3348,Validation of the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire in Korean Older Adults(*),2018-07-26,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate psychometric properties of the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) in a sample of Korean older adults. METHODS: One-hundred ninety two participants aged 65 and over completed interview-based questionnaires about chronotype, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, a small subset of subjects completed a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy measurements. RESULTS: Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) scores were significantly negatively correlated with Midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays (MSFsc) (r=-0.45, p<0.01) assessed by the MCTQ. MSFsc using the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with MSFsc assessed by both the sleep diary (r=0.74, p<0.05) and actigraphy (r=0.76, p<0.05). Additionally, MSFsc assessed by the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with insomnia (r=0.26, p<0.01), depression (r=0.25, p<0.01), and anxiety (r=0.18, p<0.05). Finally, based on MEQ scores, we derived a cut-off score for the MCTQ that distinguishes morning type and other types (intermediate/evening types) in older adults. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies supported the validity of the MCTQ in Korean older adults. Additionally, while sleep rhythms in elder adults may be more advanced, eveningness tendency may be still important and indicative of sleep and psychological disturbance.","Ryu, Hyera; Joo, Eun Yeon; Choi, Su Jung; Suh, Sooyeon",Psychiatry Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111220/,408
4606,Addressing Minority Stress and Mental Health among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in China,2020-01-16,"Vaccines based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) have failed due to extensive polymorphism in AMA1. To assess the strain-specificity of antibody responses to malaria infection and AMA1 vaccination, we designed protein and peptide microarrays representing hundreds of unique AMA1 variants. Following clinical malaria episodes, children had short-lived, sequence-independent increases in average whole-protein seroreactivity, as well as strain-specific responses to peptides representing diverse epitopes. Vaccination resulted in dramatically increased seroreactivity to all 263 AMA1 whole-protein variants. High-density peptide analysis revealed that vaccinated children had increases in seroreactivity to four distinct epitopes that exceeded responses to natural infection. A single amino acid change was critical to seroreactivity to peptides in a region of AMA1 associated with strain-specific vaccine efficacy. Antibody measurements using whole antigens may be biased towards conserved, immunodominant epitopes. Peptide microarrays may help to identify immunogenic epitopes, define correlates of vaccine protection, and measure strain-specific vaccine-induced antibodies.","Bailey, Jason A.; Berry, Andrea A.; Travassos, Mark A.; Ouattara, Amed; Boudova, Sarah; Dotsey, Emmanuel Y.; Pike, Andrew; Jacob, Christopher G.; Adams, Matthew; Tan, John C.; Bannen, Ryan M.; Patel, Jigar J.; Pablo, Jozelyn; Nakajima, Rie; Jasinskas, Algis; Dutta, Sheetij; Takala-Harrison, Shannon; Lyke, Kirsten E.; Laurens, Matthew B.; Niangaly, Amadou; Coulibaly, Drissa; Kouriba, Bourema; Doumbo, Ogobara K.; Thera, Mahamadou A.; Felgner, Philip L.; Plowe, Christopher V.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054363/,408
11295,The Role of Healthcare Robotics in Providing Support to Older Adults: a Socio-ecological Perspective,2020-03-10,"BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in normal postnatal transition. Our aims were to determine whether adding inhaled NO (iNO) decreases supplemental oxygen exposure in preterm infants requiring positive pressure ventilation (PPV) during resuscitation and to study iNO effects on heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and need for intubation during the first 20 min of life. METHODS: This was a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Infants 25 0/7–31 6/7 weeks’ gestational age requiring PPV with supplemental oxygen during resuscitation were enrolled. PPV was initiated with either oxygen (FiO(2)–0.30) + iNO at 20 ppm (iNO group) or oxygen (FiO(2)–0.30) + nitrogen (placebo group). Oxygen was titrated targeting defined SpO(2) per current guidelines. After 10 min, iNO/nitrogen was weaned stepwise per protocol and terminated at 17 min. RESULTS: Twenty-eight infants were studied (14 per group). The mean gestational age in both groups was similar. Cumulative FiO(2) and rate of exposure to high FiO(2) (>0.60) were significantly lower in the iNO group. There were no differences in HR, SpO(2), and need for intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of iNO as an adjunct during neonatal resuscitation is feasible without side effects. It diminishes exposure to high levels of supplemental oxygen.","Sekar, Krishnamurthy; Szyld, Edgardo; McCoy, Michael; Wlodaver, Anne; Dannaway, Douglas; Helmbrecht, Ashley; Riley, Julee; Manfredo, Amy; Anderson, Michael; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan; Noori, Shahab",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223624/,408
13476,Spanish Costaleros’ Physical Activity and Their Quality of Life,2020-10-02,"Rosmarinus officinalis is a potent antioxidant herb rich in polyphenols. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS), enables an exhaustive, full-spectrum analysis of the molecular constituents of natural products. The study aimed to develop a rapid UHPLC method to contribute new insights into the phytochemical composition of rosemary and to assess the performance of nine different procedures for extraction. These include fresh tissue homogenization, fresh and dry leaf decoction, and their respective fermentation, Soxhlet extraction, and sonication using water and methanol. Different extraction methods were found to recover quite different groups of polyphenols within 11 min during 20 min of analysis. Soxhlet extraction, yielded very high concentrations of rosmarinic acid (33,491.33 ± 86.29 µg/g), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (209.95 ± 8.78 µg/g), carnosic acid (2915.40 ± 33.23 µg/g), carnosol (22,000.67 ± 77.39 µg/g), and ursolic acid (5144.27 ± 28.68 µg/g). UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS enabled the detection of more than 50 polyphenols, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the various extracts. Of these, sagerinic acid ([M − H](−) m/z 719.16), salvianolic acid A ([M − H](−) m/z 493.11) and B ([M − H](−) m/z 717.15), and a pentacyclic triterpenoid corosolic acid ([M − H](−) m/z 471.34) were detected for the first time in rosemary. Soxhlet extraction was found to be the most efficient method, followed by dry leaf decoction. The UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS methodology for the analysis proved to be very efficient in the identification and characterization of targeted and untargeted bioactive molecules in the rosemary.","Sharma, Yashaswini; Velamuri, Ravikishore; Fagan, John; Schaefer, Jim",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587196/,408

Along with this challange, educational technology has been gradually introduced in medical education to facilitate learning and improve outcomes. It became an essential part of communication, storing and transferring information, audio-visual media use and production, and knowledge sharing. Technology's role has been expanding from a mere tool of study and inquiry to an approach and integrated use in education. Its use in medical education is continuously evolving. However, the impact and optimal use of various technology applications are not clearly defined. There are multiple challenges facing educators to choose the right application for the specific educational purpose. Hence, studies and evaluation reviews are needed to inform the better-defined use of educational technology. This review aims to discuss and evaluate various educational technology applications in medical education, focusing on interactive learning during lectures. Lectures and other group learning sessions are common activities used by medical schools. Promoting interactive learning in large groups is known to be challenging. The advances in technology to facilitate communication and promote interaction is a promising adjunct for lectures interactivity.","Tuma, Faiz",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7840803/,408

The study was performed to investigate the relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4) gene polymorphisms and serum lipid profiles, as well as the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with CAD and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) for the first time. Herein, 201 patients with CAD and T2DM were enrolled in the Department of Cardiology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital. DPP4 rs3788979 and rs7608798 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. The general information of all patients was collected, and the associations between DPP4 SNPs and lipid profiles were detected. At the same time, association between SNP polymorphisms and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were analyzed. There was a significant difference in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels (P = .011) for the rs3788979 polymorphism, while no difference was identified in other blood lipids or with other mutations. SNP mutation of A to G in rs3788979 was associated with a reduced percentage of severe coronary artery stenosis in female patients (P = .023) as well as those with nosmoking (P = .030), nodrinking (P = 0.007), and nocardiovascular family history (P = 0.015). G allele of rs3788979 is associated with a reduced ApoB level. Besides, we suggest that G allele in rs3788979 may have a cardioprotective effect and prove to be a useful and specific measure when predicting a patient's coronary stenosis severity if diagnosed with CAD and T2DM.","Wang, Zhongsu; Liu, Yang; Wang, Weizong; Qu, Haiyan; Han, Yi; Hou, Yinglong",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021284/,408

To avoid severe performance degradation of bioelectronics by ionic screening effects, we cover probe surfaces of field effect transistors with a single film of the supported lipid bilayer, and realize respectable potentiometric signals from receptor–ligand bindings irrespective of ionic strength of bulky solutions by placing an ion-free water layer underneath the supported lipid bilayer. High-energy X-ray reflectometry together with the circuit analysis and molecular dynamics simulation discovered biochemical findings that effective electrical signals dominantly originated from the sub-nanoscale conformational change of lipids in the course of receptor–ligand bindings. Beyond thorough analysis on the underlying mechanism at the molecular level, the proposed supported lipid bilayer-field effect transistor platform ensures the world-record level of sensitivity in molecular detection with excellent reproducibility regardless of molecular charges and environmental ionic conditions.","Lee, Donggeun; Jung, Woo Hyuk; Lee, Suho; Yu, Eui-Sang; Lee, Taikjin; Kim, Jae Hun; Song, Hyun Seok; Lee, Kwan Hyi; Lee, Seok; Han, Sang-Kook; Choi, Myung Chul; Ahn, Dong June; Ryu, Yong-Sang; Kim, Chulki",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213817/,408
19308,Technology and Sexual Offending,2021-07-19,"Dengue is a major public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Since the Zika epidemic and the increased co-circulation of other arboviruses, the serology-based diagnosis of dengue has become more problematic due to the high antigenic resemblance, especially among the flavivirus family. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity, specificity and temporal evolution of the antibody response following dengue infection is needed. In order to close this knowledge gap, we used a high-density peptide microarray of 9,072 linear peptides covering the entire proteome diversity of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. The IgM and IgG antibody responses were measured against the designed microarray in symptomatic dengue infected individuals from an arbovirus endemic area in Peru and in overseas travelers returning to Belgium, as representatives of multiple-exposed and primary infections, respectively. Serum samples were collected longitudinally across four time points over the period of six months in Peru and over two time points in travelers. We show that epitopes eliciting the strongest flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies, in both primary and secondary infections were concentrated in the capsid, E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins. The IgG antibody responses against NS1 and NS3 followed a rise-and-fall pattern, with peak titers between two to four weeks after onset of illness. The response to the E and NS5 proteins increased rapidly in the acute phase and was maintained at stable levels until at least 6 months after illness. A more scattered IgM antibody reactivity across the viral proteome was observed in the acute phase of the disease and that persisted through the 6-month window. The magnitude, breadth (i.e. number of unique epitopes targeted) and depth (i.e. number of epitope variants recognized) of the IgG response was higher in secondary infections compared to primary infections. For IgM antibodies, the magnitude of the response was higher in primary infected individuals whereas the breadth and depth of the response was lower in this group compared with the endemic subjects. Finally, through this arboviral proteome-wide epitope mapping, we were able to identify IgM and IgG dengue-specific epitopes which can be useful serological markers for dengue diagnosis and serostatus determination.","Falconi-Agapito, Francesca; Kerkhof, Karen; Merino, Xiomara; Michiels, Johan; Van Esbroeck, Marjan; Bartholomeeusen, Koen; Talledo, Michael; Ariën, Kevin K.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8289389/,408

Besides clinical evaluation of the mice and histology of the developed psoriatic lesions, cellular immune parameters were monitored. Immune cells populations/subpopulations from peripheral blood and spleen cell suspensions that follow the clinical improvement were assessed using flow cytometry. We have quantified T lymphocytes (CD3ε(+)) with T-helper (CD4(+)CD8(−)) and T-suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8a(+)CD4(−)) subsets, B lymphocytes (CD3ε(−)CD19(+)) and NK cells (CD3ε(−)NK1.1(+)).

Nevertheless, the precise microbial etiology is not identified in many cases. METHODS: Prospectively collected 63 respiratory specimens (sputum or throat swab) from patients presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, or abnormal findings of chest auscultation) after travel were tested using multiplex real-time PCR. The FTD Respiratory pathogens 33 (Fast-track diagnostics, Ltd.) can simultaneously detect 33 different respiratory pathogens directly from respiratory specimens. This test ran in the PCR-Only mode on BD MAX™ (Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, Ltd.) and LightCycler480 System (Roche). RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive cases were included in the study. Thirty-nine cases were diagnosed as non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, five cases were influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, threecases was acute sinusitis, and one case was acute pharyngitis, dengue fever. Twenty-four cases had returned from travel in Southeast Asia, nine from Africa, and 8 from Latin America, seven from South Asia, six from middle east, threefrom North America, threefrom East Asia, 2 from Oceania, and one from Europe. Of the 59 specimens analyzed, 48 (81.4%) tested positive for pathogens whereas 11 tested negative. Commonly detected pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (14 cases; 23.7%), influenza A (10 cases; 17.0%), rhinovirus (9 cases; 15.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8 cases; 13.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 13.6%), Streptococcus pneumonia, coronaviruses OC43, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4 cases; 6.8%, respectively). Multiple pathogens were detected in 30.5% of the specimens. In 14 cases (23.7%), both virus and bacteria were detected from one specimen. CONCLUSION: Not only viruses, bacterial pathogens were detected frequently than expected in the patients of RTI. Comprehensive molecular testing such as multiplex real-time PCR would change our understandings of epidemiology of RTI among travelers.

However, plasmid DNA, naked or complexed to the various chemistries, turn out to be moderately efficient in humans when injected locally and very inefficient (and very toxic in some cases) when injected systemically. A number of clinical applications have been initiated however, based on transgenes that were adapted to good local impact and/or to a wide physiological outcome (i.e., strong humoral and cellular immune responses following the introduction of DNA vaccines). Neuromuscular diseases seem more challenging for non-viral vectors. Nevertheless, the local production of therapeutic proteins that may act distantly from the injected site and/or the hydrodynamic perfusion of safe plasmids remains a viable basis for the non-viral gene therapy of muscle disorders, cachexia, as well as peripheral neuropathies.","Braun, Serge",Muscle Gene Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123420/,408

Vendors are spending a lot of time and effort on early anomaly detection in their development cycle and majority of the time is spent on manually analyzing system logs. While main research in anomaly detection uses performance metrics, anomaly detection using functional behaviour is still lacking in depth analysis. In this paper we show how a boosted ensemble of Long Short Term Memory classifiers can detect anomalies in the 5G Radio Access Network system logs. Acquiring system logs from a live 5G network is difficult due to confidentiality issues, live network disturbance, and problems to repeat scenarios. Therefore, we perform our evaluation on logs from a 5G test bed that simulate realistic traffic in a city. Our ensemble learns the functional behaviour of an application by training on logs from normal execution time. It can then detect deviations from normal behaviour and also be retrained on false positive cases found during validation. Anomaly detection in RAN shows that our ensemble called BoostLog, outperforms a single LSTM classifier and further testing on HDFS logs confirms that BoostLog also can be used in other domains. Instead of using domain experts to manually analyse system logs, BoostLog can be used by less experienced trouble shooters to automatically detect anomalies faster and more reliable.","Sundqvist, Tobias; Bhuyan, Monowar H.; Forsman, Johan; Elmroth, Erik",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256370/,408

It aims at identifying the main stressors during and post COVID-19, examining the main moderating factors which may mitigate or aggravate the impact of COVID-19 on employees’ mental health and finally to suggest recommendations from a human resource management perspective to mitigate COVID-19’s impact on employees’ mental health. Methods: This paper is a literature review. The search for articles was made in Google scholar, Web of Science and Semantic scholar. We used a combination of terms related to coronavirus OR COVID-19, workplace and mental health. Due to the paucity of studies on the COVID-19 impact on employees’ mental health, we had to draw on studies on recent epidemics. Results: The identified literature reports a negative impact of COVID-19 on individual’s mental health. Stressors include perception of safety, threat and risk of contagion, infobesity versus the unknown, quarantine and confinement, stigma and social exclusion as well as financial loss and job insecurity. Furthermore, three dimensions of moderating factors have been identified: organizational, institutional and individual factors. In addition, a list of recommendations has been presented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the employee’s mental health, during and after the outbreak, from a human resource management perspective. Conclusions: Coronavirus is new and is in a rapid progress while writing this paper. Most of current research are biomedical focusing on individuals’ physical health. In this context, mental health issues seem overlooked. This paper helps to broaden the scope of research on workplace mental health, by examining the impact of a complex new pandemic: COVID-19 on employees’ mental health, from social sciences perceptive, mobilizing psychology and human resource management.","Hamouche, Salima",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7342058/,408

Huge disruptions to human well-being which can occur as a result of the impact of particular natural resources or species are, or should be, an obvious focus of interest for the biophysical economist whose focus is on flows between the natural world and human society. The causes and consequences of such disruptions, such as emanate from pandemics and epidemics, are a clear example of this. There is a need for better understanding of these causes and consequences. As an example, twelve books on epidemics and pandemics are considered here as providing the core for what guidance they might, and should, have provided on the sources, spreaders, and responses to COVID-19. A substantial amount of guidance is given in these and other sources referenced, which if followed would have reduced spread and mortality, but in far too many countries preparedness and speed of responses were inadequate.

40271,Chronicity and primary care in times of pandemic(),2020-10-03,"Passive immunization constitutes an emerging field of interest in aquaculture, particularly with the restrictions for antibiotic use. Enteromyxum leei is a myxozoan intestinal parasite that invades the paracellular space of the intestinal epithelium, producing a slow-progressing disease, leading to anorexia, cachexia and mortalities. We have previously demonstrated that gilthead sea bream (GSB, Sparus aurata) that survive E. leei infection become resistant upon re-exposure, and this resistance is directly related to the presence of high levels of specific IgM in serum. Thus, the current work was aimed to determine if passive immunization could help to prevent enteromyxosis in GSB and to study in detail the nature of these protective antibodies. Serum from a pool of resistant (SUR) or naïve (NAI) animals was intracoelomically injected 24 h prior to the E. leei-effluent challenge and at 9 days post-challenge (dpc). Effluent challenge lasted for 23 days, and then the injected groups were allocated in separate tanks with clean water. A non-lethal parasite diagnosis was performed at 56 dpc. At the final sampling (100 dpc), blood, serum and tissues were collected for histology, molecular diagnosis and the detection of circulating antibodies. In parallel, we performed an immunoglobulin repertoire analysis of the fish generating SUR and NAI sera. The results showed that, fish injected with parasite-specific antibodies (spAbs) became infected with the parasite, but showed lower disease signs and intensity of infection than the other groups, indicating a later establishment of the parasite. Repertoire analysis revealed that E. leei induced a polyclonal expansion of diverse IgM and IgT subsets that could be in part an evasion strategy of the parasite. Nonetheless, GSB was able to produce sufficient levels of parasite-spAbs to avoid re-infection of surviving animals and confer certain degree of protection upon passive transfer of antibodies. These results highlight the crucial role of spAb responses against E. leei and set the basis for the development of effective treatment or prophylactic methods for aquaculture.","Picard-Sánchez, Amparo; Estensoro, Itziar; Perdiguero, Pedro; del Pozo, Raquel; Tafalla, Carolina; Piazzon, M.

The information about persons is aggregated into a single knowledge graph. The process was applied to reconcile three person registers of the popular semantic portal “WarSampo – Finnish World War 2 on the Semantic Web”. The registers contain detailed information about some 100 000 people and are individually maintained by domain experts.

We aim to help lay users (by focusing on experts in table manipulation, such as OD experts) in querying and exploiting LOD by taking advantage of our target users’ expertise in table manipulation and chart creation. We propose QueDI (Query Data of Interest), a question-answering and visualization tool that implements a scaffold transitional approach to 1) query LOD without being aware of SPARQL and representing results by data tables; 2) once reached our target user comfort zone, users can manipulate and 3) visually represent data by exportable and dynamic visualizations. The main novelty of our approach is the split of the querying phase in SPARQL query building and data table manipulation. In this article, we present the QueDI operating mechanism, its interface supported by a guided use-case over DBpedia, and the evaluation of its accuracy and usability level.","De Donato, Renato; Garofalo, Martina; Malandrino, Delfina; Pellegrino, Maria Angela; Petta, Andrea; Scarano, Vittorio",Semantic Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586436/,408
41473,Anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait: the importance of physical activity,2020-11-03,"Alcohol is widely used in various fields today. Alcohol overdose and its improper use can cause many health problems. Drinking liquids with high alcohol concentration, especially methanol, causes poisoning, and the use of colognes with high alcohol concentration causes various skin conditions and respiratory diseases. Therefore, for public health it is important to determine the type and concentration of alcohol in beverages and liquid products. In this paper, K* algorithm is used to detect and classify liquids containing high concentration of alcohol by measuring the scattering parameter of the liquids in the microwave frequency band. For this purpose, scatter parameter values of aqueous solutions of ethanol, methanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol at different concentrations have been used as training sets. Commercial liquids with known ethanol concentrations and liquids with other known alcohol concentrations have been tested to prove the accuracy of the proposed approach. As the results show the proposed approach can classify liquids containing alcohol and their alcohol concentrations successfully and with high accuracy.",Ebru Efeoğlu; Gurkan Tuna,Russ J Nondestruct Test,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590582/,408

The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has turned into a “normal” context, which blurs the traditional crisis termination stage. We also find that participating firms engage more with internal stakeholders than external ones. The strategies adopted by small firms include flexible human resource (HR) practices, cost reduction, enhancing customer relations, and using government support schemes.

To evaluate the operative capacity of nine serological rapid tests to detect the IgM/IgG antibodies response in serum from patients with SARS-CoV-2 in different clinical stages. METHODS. A cross-sectional study of serological rapid tests was designed to compare the performance of the evaluated immunochromatographic tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 293 samples was used, including negatives, asymptomatic, and symptomatic serum samples. RESULTS. The sensitivity of the evaluated tests was low and moderate in the groups of asymptomatic serum samples and the group of serums coming from patients with less than 11 days since the onset of the symptoms. The specificity for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies tests ranged between 86.5%-99% for IgM and 86.5%-99.5% for IgG. The sensitivity and the likelihood ratio were different according to the study groups. The usefulness of these tests is restricted to symptomatic patients and their sensitivity is greater than 85% after 11 days from the appearance of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Serological tests are not an adequate strategy for the identification of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. Serological rapid tests for the detection of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be used as a diagnostic aid, but diagnosis must be confirmed by RT-PCR. Rapid tests should be reserved for patients with symptoms lasting more than 11 days.","Mercado, Marcela; Malagón-Rojas, Jeadran; Delgado, Gabriela; Rubio, Vivian Vanesa; Muñoz Galindo, Lida; Parra Barrera, Eliana L.; Gaviria, Paula; Zabaleta, Gabriela; Alarcon, Zonia; Arévalo, Adriana; Cifuentes, Helly Casallas; Estrada, Kelly; Puerto, Gloria; Herrera Sepúlveda, María T.; Rodríguez, Helena; Galindo, Marisol; Ospina Ramírez, Martha Lucía",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734239/,408

Everyday technology such as a touchscreen tablet has great potential to support person-centred care. We aimed to support the adoption of tablets for hospitalized people with dementia to connect with families and friends. A patient-oriented research approach was employed to co-produce the toolkit. We are a transdisciplinary team, including a medical student, physicians, nurses, patients, and family partners. We facilitated staff focus groups (n=3), and conducted stakeholders’ interviews (n=4) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of users’ needs. The sample included ten patients, ten family members, 40 staff members, nurses, care workers, physicians, and unit clerks (n=40). The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the research design and qualitative analysis. A toolkit was developed based on participants’ perspectives on what needs to be in place to support successful adoption. We developed a mobile tablet with one mechanical arm and one leg on wheels. Participants reported impacts: (a) it puts a smile on the patient’s face, (b) it alleviates anxiety and worries on both sides, and (c) it reduces responsive behaviors. The conceptual framework CFIR provides helpful guidance in identifying barriers to implementation. Working with users including patient and family partners to explore possible solutions was key to our success.

So what is the solution? First is wearing good quality mask in public places and maintaining good hygiene. Other is environmental purification which one can do by medicinal havan with Geloye and Pragya pey, herbal tea along with common Havan Samagri, made by one cup decoction of Geloye along with Vasa and kalmegha which can boost up the immunity of individual. The smoke of Mango wood and Googgal can kill a deadly virus like corona; a person infected with corona and other deadly viruses can be cured by such smoke. It can be a matter of debate about Indian culture. It is about biological science. Havan Samagri specially was designed for Asthmatic patients with 3:1 ratio, and Surya Gayatri Mantra chanting was performed 24 times and Nadi Shodhan Pranayam was executed for half an hour duration daily. Subjects were asked to take kwath of Havan Samagri twice in a day. Lung Function Test (LFT) was experimented on 18 Dec 2018 up to 24 Dec 2018 to check the efficacy of Yagyopathy. Three important parameters were tested in LFT which were FVC-Forced vital capacity, FEV-Forced expirartory volume, and FEV1/FVC known as MER-measured expiratory rate. FVC is used to calculate the capacity of human lungs/volume of air which is exhaled after deep inhalation. MER is directly related to proportion of lung size to be exhaled per second. The results were measured for one year and nine months and demonstrated a significant improved performance in lung function parameters. It was noted that if experiments are done twice in a day results are more improved.","Rastogi, Rohit; Saxena, Mamta; Chaturvedi, D.

Moreover, it argues that within institutionalized higher education (HE) contexts, knowledge socialism should be reoriented toward the promotion of prosocial-entrepreneurial ‘transitional ecosystems’ of commons-based peer production (CBPP). This sociomaterialist repositioning will outline a path forward for knowledge socialism which better understands, elicits, and valorizes the inherently prosocial-entrepreneurial creative labor contributions of precariously positioned academics within contemporary HE. In order to accomplish this aim, this article first underlines several fundamental concepts (commons-based peer production, collective intelligence, creative labor) before moving on to a more pointed philosophical discussion and critique of these concepts as underlying assumptions within knowledge socialism. Lastly, this article provides an operaismo-based reflexive inquiry into the interplay between the theory of knowledge socialism as experienced in practice within the China HE context, contributing to the development of non-exploitative knowledge cultures within CBPP creative labor processes.","Green, Benjamin",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122209/,408
53284,967 COVID READY Study: Cross-Sectional Survey of Medical Students Volunteering During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) In the United Kingdom,2021-05-04,"Background: Vision changes can be the presenting symptom of pituitary macroadenomas. The first-line therapy is transsphenoidal resection except for macroprolactinomas where medical therapy with dopamine agonist (DA) is the initial treatment of choice. Surgical resection is reserved if treatment with DA did not result in decreased serum prolactin (PRL), size of adenoma and/or alleviation of symptoms. With the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been a variety of symptoms reported including ophthalmic manifestations (1). We will present how an acute decrease in vision from Covid-19 nearly led to surgical intervention of macroprolactinoma. Clinical Case: A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency room (ER) with complaints of headache in 6/2020. MRI Brain showed a 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and invasion of the cavernous sinuses. The mass engulfed the adjacent circle of Willis, the MCAs bilaterally, the PCAs and the superior aspect of the vertebrobasilar system. Initial PRL was 7441 ng/mL (5.2-26.25 ng/mL). She was discharged on Cabergoline 0.25 mg twice weekly. Visual field exam showed mild nonspecific field defects in the right eye and larger diffuse field defects in the left eye slightly more temporal. One month later, Cabergoline dose was increased to 0.5 mg twice weekly with PRL drop to 1161.7 ng/mL. In 8/2020, she started to complain of worsening vision. Ophthalmological exam showed worsening visual fields in both eyes and the optic discs showed temporal pallor. She was referred to ER where she tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted. CT Head showed stable partially calcified enhancing sellar and suprasellar mass. Repeat PRL was 635.6 ng/mL. Despite reduction in PRL, transsphenoidal resection was considered but was deferred to 9/2020 due to Covid-19. Follow up appointment with Neuro-ophthalmology in 9/2020 prior to scheduled surgery, showed visual field improvement with just mild nonspecific defects and surgery was canceled. PRL in 10/2020 decreased to 239.1 ng/mL. Patient’s visual fields continued to improve after recovery from Covid-19 and with reduction in PRL. It was determined that the patient’s reduction in visual fields was due to Covid-19 and not her macroadenoma. Conclusion: There have not been many reported cases of decreased visual fields due to Covid-19 (1). Proposed mechanisms include expression of ACE-2 receptors in the aqueous humor, which is the main receptor for Covid-19, and thromboembolic disease (1). More studies and data are needed to conclude the mechanism of decreased visual fields. This will avoid unnecessary surgical interventions for patients with macroprolactinomas. References: 1.

54008,Who's Grocery Shopping Online and Why: Cross-Sectional Analysis of a Nationally-Representative Sample Since the Pandemic,2021-06-07,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective technique for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and shows potential for the treatment of a range of other serious conditions. However, until now stimulation has generally been supramaximal and non-selective, resulting in a range of side effects. Selective VNS (sVNS) aims to mitigate this by targeting specific fiber types within the nerve to produce functionally specific effects. In recent years, several key paradigms of sVNS have been developed—spatially selective, fiber-selective, anodal block, neural titration, and kilohertz electrical stimulation block—as well as various stimulation pulse parameters and electrode array geometries. sVNS can significantly reduce the severity of side effects, and in some cases increase efficacy of the treatment. While most studies have focused on fiber-selective sVNS, spatially selective sVNS has demonstrated comparable mitigation of side-effects. It has the potential to achieve greater specificity and provide crucial information about vagal nerve physiology. Anodal block achieves strong side-effect mitigation too, but is much less specific than fiber- and spatially selective paradigms. The major hurdle to achieving better selectivity of VNS is a limited knowledge of functional anatomical organization of vagus nerve. It is also crucial to optimize electrode array geometry and pulse shape, as well as expand the applications of sVNS beyond the current focus on cardiovascular disease.","Fitchett, Adam; Mastitskaya, Svetlana; Aristovich, Kirill",Front Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180849/,408

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 126 patients (40–80 years with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) ≤80% of predicted (previously documented)) were randomized 1:1 to once daily inhaled nemiralisib (1 mg) or placebo for 84 days, added to standard of care. The primary endpoint was specific imaging airway volume (siVaw) after 28 treatment days and was analyzed using a Bayesian repeated measures model (clintrials.gov: NCT02294734). RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were randomized to treatment; 55 on active treatment and 49 on placebo completed the study. When comparing nemiralisib and placebo-treated patients, an 18% placebo-corrected increase from baseline in distal siVaw (95% credible intervals (Cr I) (−1%, 42%)) was observed on Day 28. The probability that the true treatment ratio was >0% (Pr(θ>0)) was 96%, suggestive of a real treatment effect. Improvements were observed across all lung lobes. Patients treated with nemiralisib experienced a 107.3 mL improvement in posterior median FEV(1) (change from baseline, 95% Cr I (−2.1, 215.5)) at day 84, compared with placebo. Adverse events were reported by 41 patients on placebo and 49 on nemiralisib, the most common being post-inhalation cough on nemiralisib (35%) vs placebo (3%). CONCLUSION: These data show that addition of nemiralisib to usual care delivers more effective recovery from an acute exacerbation and improves lung function parameters including siVaw and FEV(1). Although post-inhalation cough was identified, nemiralisib was otherwise well tolerated, providing a promising novel therapy for this acutely ill patient group.","Cahn, Anthony; Hamblin, J Nicole; Robertson, Jon; Begg, Malcolm; Jarvis, Emily; Wilson, Robert; Dear, Gordon; Leemereise, Claudia; Cui, Yi; Mizuma, Maki; Montembault, Mickael; Van Holsbeke, Cedric; Vos, Wim; De Backer, Wilfried; De Backer, Jan; Hessel, Edith M",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184151/,408

In particular, the migration of exercise physiology labs, which included anaerobic and aerobic exercise tests, posed a considerable hurdle in attempting to provide a practical and engaging lab environment fully online. Using a qualitative case‐study design, this presentation will highlight the experience of migrating exercise physiology labs into a virtual post‐secondary course context. In Fall 2020, approximately 200 Kinesiology students attended a virtual second‐year exercise physiology course, which included four previously in‐person, bi‐weekly labs. Labs were rapidly migrated onto an open access platform for integration into the existing institutional learning management system. Students completed bi‐weekly labs in lab groups of 20‐25 students, led by a Teaching Assistant (TA), with students working in small breakout groups of 4‐5 students to complete the virtual lab as a group using a collaborative workspace. Following the breakouts, students would rejoin their peers in the main group for a post‐lab discussion period to discuss lab report questions with the TA. After the lab, students completed a content quiz which included a responsive question: “What did you like about the lab? What do you feel could be improved about the lab?” Given the importance of considering students as partners in course development, responses from students were considered in refinement of future virtual labs throughout the term. Responses were analyzed using qualitative coding for positive/neutral/negative responses, and general themes emerged for each lab. Briefly, main themes for improvement included: increased organization and instruction for navigating the virtual lab, more contact with the TA in breakout rooms, improving engagement between members of breakout groups, and enhancements to the virtual lab components. Positive themes included: students enjoying breakout room opportunities to connect with peers, TA support especially in the post‐lab discussion period, and additional cues added to the virtual lab. Finally, student responses became increasingly positive from the first lab to fourth lab, with students noting their appreciation for being a part of the refinement process. Overall, this presentation, detailing the practical considerations of migrating labs to a virtual environment, will benefit future exercise physiology instructors in pursuing successful virtual lab delivery.","Williams, Jennifer; Howarth, Krista",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239870/,408

Herein, we discuss the key categories of risk associated with the main groups of materials commonly found in dry toilets. The study was part of the development of a German product standard for marketable and quality-assured recycling fertilizers from human excreta for use in horticulture. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that the fertilizer is epidemiologically and environmentally harmless and that the quality of the recycling fertilizer is adequate in terms of low pollution and nutrient availability. In sum, the risk of transmissible human pathogens lies within the human excreta, particularly feces; plant materials added during composting are of particular phytosanitary relevance; pharmaceutical residues in excrements and chemical additives are potential sources of pollutants; non-biodegradable contaminants can cause pollution and injury; and the horticultural risks involve mainly the ammonia emission potential and in some cases the salinity effects of urine. These risks can be reduced significantly (i) with education of users around proper operation of dry toilets and the consequences of adding inappropriate waste, (ii) with facilitation of proper use with general waste bins and clear instructions, and importantly (iii) by using modern sanitization and cleaning processes and testing for harmful substances under the guidance of local laws and regulations, ensuring safe and high-quality fertilizers. In conclusion, the benefits of using dry toilet contents to produce fertilizers for use in horticulture are unquestionable. Our analysis highlights the need to support recycling optimization and awareness for the purpose of a sustainable circular economy and to minimize the risk of harm to humans and the environment overall.","Krause, Ariane; Häfner, Franziska; Augustin, Florian; Udert, Kai M.",Circ.Econ.Sust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280996/,408

Interestingly, the citizens of the countries where most of the cases are reported are overtly religious and manifest their religiosity by attending religious activities in religious buildings. This, therefore, heightens the impact of a disaster, such as where there is a religious building collapse or a stampede. The attendant social, legal and economic effects of such disasters on religious organisations, religious faithful and society thus necessitate the study. This article critically examines the roles of religious organisations and state governments in reducing the risks of avoidable disasters in religious buildings. It evaluates the reports of two instances of church building collapses in Nigeria as case studies. This article observes that many religious organisations do not have effective risk and safety policies to reduce their exposure to religious disasters. It also observes that the state is ineffective in enforcing building standards. It argues that religious organisations and the state owe a legal duty to protect the lives and guarantee the safety of the faithful against the tragedy that may occur in worship places, and where this duty is breached, and a victim suffers harm, a right to damages will accrue. It concludes that although a religious organisation may not be able to stop all such disasters, having an effective disaster risk policy can assist in reducing the occurrence of avoidable mishaps in religious buildings.","van Coller, Helena; Akinloye, Idowu A.",Jamba,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335771/,408

Neurologic manifestations may be coincident or result of disease and its therapy. In the emergency department, orientation of the clinician with this issue is crucial for accurate decision making to limit the spread of infection during neurologic treatment. This study aimed to be familiar with MRI findings in patients with Neuro-COVID. Seventy patients presented with neurologic/neuropsychiatric manifestation either post COVID or during hospitalization underwent cerebral MRI from April 2020 to June 2021 (39 men and 31women; mean age 43.27, age range from 16 to 69 years). RESULTS: Headache (80%), is the most prevalent neurological manifestations followed by smell and taste impairment (62.9%) and stroke symptoms (45.7%). Low mood and anxiety (17.1%), prolonged fatigue (14.3%) and depression (7.1%) are the most common psychiatric symptoms. Infarctions, hematoma and demyelinating disease are the most prevalent findings. There is a week positive correlation between MRI findings and CT chest finding but without statistical significance (P-value 0.2).

However, when it comes to breaking down general implications to specific use cases, existent frameworks have been remaining vague. The following paper aims to fill this gap by examining the ethical implications of the use of information analytical systems through a management approach for filtering the content in social media and preventing information thrusts with negative consequences for human beings and public administration. The ethical dimensions of AI technologies are revealed through deduction of general challenges of digital governance to applied level management technics.","Sergei, Kamolov; Alexander, Kriebitz; Polina, Eliseeva; Nikita, Aleksandrov",AI Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498768/,408

60650,Respiratory Protection Considerations for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND The global deficit of nurses demands urgent attention in the recruitment and education of this future workforce. Graduate entry nursing (GEN) programmes are one option for people with undergraduate degrees who are seeking nursing education. Determining the key motivations for enrolling in these programmes will support the development of new initiatives in the education sector to both recruit and retain this future workforce and inform future primary research. This scoping review aims to comprehensively describe what motivates graduates to enrol in GEN programmes. METHODS Peer reviewed studies of quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method research investigating motivations to commence a graduate entry nursing programme were included, following a pre-determined protocol. Electronic databases searched included Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Emcare, ERIC, Medline and Scopus. Screening, data extraction and analysis was initially in duplicate and independent, then consensus reached. Qualitative and quantitative data was analysed and reported separately then combined thematically as a narrative synthesis in a convergent segregated approach. Reporting followed preferred reporting guidelines for scoping reviews. RESULTS Of the 491 studies retrieved in July 2020, across the five databases and reference list search, six met the inclusion criteria. Four were qualitative studies, one mixed-methods, and one quantitative, respectively from Australia, USA, and New Zealand. Four themes of motivation were identified: 1) finding meaning and purpose through altruism and caring; 2) seeking a satisfying career, 3) looking for a change in direction and, 4) reduced financial burden due to course length and provision of scholarships. CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of studies specifically seeking to investigate student motivations for enrolling in a GEN programme and only limited studies giving insights into motivators for enrolling in a GEN programme, therefore this scoping review contributes new understandings on the reason's students choose GEN programmes. These are both altruistic and practical and include personal desires to help others, the need to pursue a satisfying and meaningful career and the shorter period out of the workforce offered by an accelerated programme of study.","Macdiarmid, Rachel; Turner, Rosemary; Winnington, Rhona; McClunie-Trust, Patricia; Donaldson, Andrea; Shannon, Kay; Merrick, Eamon; Jones, Virginia; Jarden, Rebecca",BMC nursing,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00564-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743688/,408

Zinc lozenge has been shown to reduce POST. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dispersible zinc tablet on POST. Methods Eighty-eight patients undergoing surgery with endotracheal intubation were randomly allocated into two groups, to either receive dispersible zinc tablet 40 mg (zinc group) or placebo tablet (control group), 30 min preoperatively. Assessment for incidence and severity was performed for POST, on a 4-point scale (0-3) at 0, 30 min, 2, 4, and 24 h postoperatively. The primary outcome was incidence of POST at 4 h postoperatively. Secondary outcome was severity of POST at the 5 evaluation time points postoperatively. Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact, and Chi-square test were used as applicable. Results At 4 h, there was a significantly lower incidence of POST in zinc group (6.8%) than the control group (31.8%) with a P value of 0.003. Three patients in placebo group complained of severe POST compared to none in the zinc group. The severity of POST was significantly lower in Zinc group than Placebo group at 0 min (P = 0.003), 30 min (P = 0.002), 2 h (P < 0.001), and 4 h (P = 0.001).

62175,Reaction to a Pandemic: Social Distancing and Driving Among Older Adults During COVID-19.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND The presence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in individuals infected with COVID-19 may imply a worse prognosis. OBJECTIVE To describe the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by COVID-19 and to analyze the factors associated with this condition in adults and the elderly with cardiovascular disease in Brazil until the 30th Epidemiological Week of 2020. METHODS Cross-sectional study conducted with data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe - SIVEP-Gripe), referring to the SARS notification forms of hospitalized individuals in Brazil, between the 1st and 30th Epidemiological Week of 2020. Adults and the aged (≥ 18 years old) with CVD. The dependent variable was SRAG confirmation by COVID-19 and factors related to sociodemographic characteristics, signs and symptoms, and clinical factors were analyzed. Poisson regression with robust variance was applied. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS Notifications from 116,343 individuals were analyzed. Of these, 61.9% were diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19. The prevalence of the outcome was 4% lower in women (95%CI: 0.94-0.99) and 18% lower in rural areas (95%CI: 0.77-0.87). There was a higher prevalence in the 50 to 59 age group (95%CI: 1.09-1.48) and in the northeast region (95%CI: 1.72-1.91). Fever, cough, admission to the ICU, use of ventilatory support, and nosocomial cases were also significantly associated with a higher probability of SRAS by COVID-19 in these individuals. CONCLUSION There is a high prevalence of SARS by COVID-19 in adults and aged people with CVD in Brazil. Factors associated with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, signs, and symptoms were associated.","Paiva, Karina Mary de; Hillesheim, Danúbia; Rech, Cassiano Ricardo; Delevatti, Rodrigo Sudatti; Brown, Rodrigo Vasconi Sáez; Gonzáles, Ana Inês; Haas, Patricia",Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.36660/abc.20200955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161421/,408
62350,"Assessing Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of dental practitioners regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational study.",2020,"The replication of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells. The unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mediated by ER stress (ERS), is a typical outcome in coronavirus-infected cells and is closely associated with the characteristics of coronaviruses. However, the interaction between virus-induced ERS and coronavirus replication is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that infection with the betacoronavirus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) induced ERS and triggered all three branches of the UPR signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ERS suppressed PHEV replication in mouse neuro-2a (N2a) cells primarily by activating the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) axis of the UPR. Moreover, another eIF2α phosphorylation kinase, IFN-induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), was also activated and acted cooperatively with PERK to decrease PHEV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PERK/PKR-eIF2α pathways negatively regulated PHEV replication by attenuating global protein translation. Phosphorylated eIF2α also promoted the formation of stress granule (SG), which in turn repressed PHEV replication. In summary, our study presents a vital aspect of the host innate response to invading pathogens and reveals attractive host targets (e.g., PERK, PKR and eIF2α) for antiviral drugs. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus diseases are caused by different coronaviruses of importance in humans and animals, and specific treatments are extremely limited. ERS, which can activate the UPR to modulate viral replication and the host innate response, is a frequent occurrence in coronavirus-infected cells. PHEV, a neurotropic β-coronavirus, causes nerve cell damage, which accounts for the high mortality rates in suckling piglets. However, it remains incompletely understood whether the highly developed ER in nerve cells plays an antiviral role in ERS and how ERS regulates viral proliferation. In this study, we found that PHEV infection induced ERS and activated the UPR both in vitro and in vivo and that the activated PERK/PKR-eIF2α axis inhibited PHEV replication through attenuating global protein translation and promoting SG formation. A better understanding of coronavirus-induced ERS and UPR activation may reveal the pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus and facilitate the development of new treatment strategies for these diseases.","Shi, Junchao; Li, Zi; Xu, Rongyi; Zhang, Jing; Zhou, Qianyu; Gao, Rui; Lu, Huijun; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01695-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643429/,408
63078,Persistent vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic procedures.,2015,"The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis and the immunological response to inflammation. The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well-studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+ /podoplanin (PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN+ / alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+ / αSMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN+ / αSMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1+ / αSMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+ / αSMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls. Thus, our findings reveal an important role of local lymphatic drainage in periodontal inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. This article is protected by copyright.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a synthesis of the literature that describes the pedagogical principles, curriculum content and methods (teaching and assessment) used to educate health and social care practitioners on the experiences and needs of older LGBT + people. DESIGN Systematic thematic review of literature. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, Social Sciences Index, ERIC. METHOD In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, this review examined peer-reviewed papers published in English, prior to April 2018 that addressed pedagogical and curriculum issues on the inclusion of needs and experiences of older LGBT + people. RESULTS The combined searches yielded 2214 papers of which 17 papers were eligible for inclusion, 10 discussion papers and 7 evaluation studies. Analysis identified the following themes: i) Acknowledging the wider historical context of older LGBT + people's lives; ii) Recognising that older LGBT + people are not a homogenous group; iii) Incorporating a multitude of theories and models from different perspectives; iv) Alerting practitioners to the health issues and disparities facing older LGBT + people; v) Including content that supports inclusive care for older LGBT + people; vi) Addressing barriers to older LGBT + people accessing health care; vii) Interactive activities are the preferred pedagogical strategy; viii) Involving older LGBT + people in curriculum development is a core principle; and ix) Mandatory education is not always the solution.

Both membranes were stable in vivo for up to 112 days. All investigated immune cell populations (CD68+ macrophages, CD163+ macrophages, T lymphocytes, MHC class II positive cells, mast cells, and NK cells) were present. Their amount decreased significantly over time compared to day 7 after implantation. A change from an acute to a chronic inflammation and an associated shift from proinflammatory M1-like to anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages were observed. In the early phase there was a significant correlation of T cells to CD68+ (M1-like) macrophages, whereas in the chronic phase T lymphocytes were positively correlated with CD163+ (M2-like) macrophages. The material NRX showed an enhanced inflammatory reaction in comparison to Permacol possibly caused by material characteristics such as a twofold higher thickness of the membrane, roughness, and water absorption capacity. Nevertheless, a more pronounced regenerative process as, for example, indicated by nestin expression demonstrated its possible suitability for applications as wound repair material.","Lucke, Silke; Hoene, Andreas; Walschus, Uwe; Kob, Anette; Pissarek, Jens-Wolfgang; Schlosser, Michael",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/938059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648958/,408

The potential impact of bevacizumab on the efficacy and safety of partial splenic embolization (PSE) in the management of chemotherapy-induced hypersplenism (CIH) has never been investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective study with gastrointestinal cancer patients who have undergone PSE for the treatment of thrombocytopenia resulting from hypersplenism. Pre- and post-PSE platelet count (PC), the percentage of patients who resumed systemic therapy, and complication rates were compared between patients exposed and not exposed to bevacizumab. RESULTS A total of 110 patients were eligible. Colorectal cancer was the predominant neoplasm (60%), and 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab were the most commonly provided drugs (70%, 65%, and 65% of patients, respectively). After PSE, 80% of patients recovered PC ≥ 100 × 109/L (100K). Systemic therapy was resumed in 81% of patients. Seventy-one patients exposed to bevacizumab had a median PC before PSE of 77.5K and after PSE of 167.0K, with a mean difference of 108K (P < .0001). Thirty-nine patients not exposed to bevacizumab had a median PC of pre-PSE of 73.0K and post-PSE of 187.0K, with a mean difference of 117.7K (P < .0001). Both groups had similar values of percentages of patients with PC post-PSE ≥ 100K (83% vs. 74%; P = .463), resumption of systemic therapy (85% vs. 74%; P = .213), and complication rates. A linear association between splenic infarction rate and increment in PC was found (P < .0001). CONCLUSION PSE is a safe and effective procedure in the management of CIH, regardless of the provision of bevacizumab. Splenic infarction rate should be optimized to enhance patient outcomes.","Jácome, Alexandre A; Ohinata, Aki; Mahvash, Armeen; Overman, Michael J; Kee, Bryan; Fogelman, David; Morris, Van K; Johnson, Benny; Rothschild, Nicole D; Wolff, Robert A; Eng, Cathy",Clinical colorectal cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clcc.2020.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680816/,408
66426,The Importance of Patients' Perspectives in Providing Ophthalmic Care-Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recovery after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is often slower than ischemic stroke. Despite this, ICH research often quantifies recovery using the same outcome measures obtained at the same timepoints as ischemic stroke. The primary objective of this scoping review is to map the existing literature to determine when and how outcomes are being measured in prospective studies of recovery after ICH. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science from inception to November 2019, for prospective studies that included patients with ICH. Two investigators independently screened the studies and extracted data around timing and type of outcome assessment. RESULTS Among the 9761 manuscripts reviewed, 395 met inclusion criteria, of which 276 were observational studies and 129 were interventional studies that enrolled 66274 patients. Mortality was assessed in 93% of studies. Functional outcomes were assessed in 85% of studies. The most frequently used functional assessment tool was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (60%), followed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale (22%) and Barthel Index (21%). The most frequent timepoint at which mortality was assessed was 90 days (41%), followed by 180 days (18%) and 365 days (12%), with 2% beyond 1 year. The most frequent timepoint used for assessing mRS was 90 days (62%), followed by 180 days (21%) and 365 days (17%). CONCLUSION While most prospective ICH studies report mortality and functional outcomes only at 90 days, a significant proportion do so at 1 year and beyond. Our results support the feasibility of collecting long-term outcome data to optimally assess recovery in ICH.","Massicotte, Sara; Lun, Ronda; Yogendrakumar, Vignan; Dewar, Brian; Chung, Hee Sahng; Konder, Ricarda; Yim, Holly; Davis, Alexandra; Fergusson, Dean; Shamy, Michel; Dowlatshahi, Dar",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191862/,408

In some cases, this includes a requirement for pre-operative weight loss despite the lack of evidence for a correlation with successful outcomes. We sought to determine whether weight loss on a short, immediate pre-operative diet, as well as across the medical weight loss program, would correlate with 1-year outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS All patients having a LSG between March 2013 and March 2016 were reviewed. Demographics and biometrics [weight, body mass index (BMI)] were collected at initial, day of surgery and follow-up (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 4 months, and 1 year). Pre-operative weight loss was determined both cumulative (initial to day of surgery) and for the pre-operative diet (2 weeks). Weight loss and percent excess weight loss (%EWL) were calculated and correlated at all time points. RESULTS A total of 127 patients were reviewed for this study. The mean %EWL at 1-year follow-up was 47 ± 18%. Weight loss achieved on a 2-week pre-operative diet did not correlate with weight outcomes at 1-year follow-up (r = 0.134, p = 0.40); however, cumulative pre-operative weight loss had a modest correlation (r = 0.443, p < 0.01). Post-operative %EWL at 4 months had the best correlation with longer term weight loss (r = 0.730, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Pre-operative performance is not a good predictor for 1-year outcomes in LSG. Better correlation was observed in %EWL at post-surgery visits. Following the patient's trajectory post-operatively may provide a window for intervention to improve weight loss.","McNickle, Allison G; Bonomo, Steven R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5467-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281113/,408

Although different antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs are used, current evidence is insufficient as to which drug is more efficient. Our study compared favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) therapies in inpatient care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Demographic data, test results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19 pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model. RESULTS Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%), and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV, respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality age of the patients was 71±14.3 years, which was substantially greater than that of the survivors (54.2±15.5 years). Compared with patients administered with LPV/RTV, ICU admission and mortality rates were lower in patients administered with favipiravir. CK-MB, AST, CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels were higher, whereas lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who died. Age, AST, CRP, LDH, and neutrophil counts were higher in patients needing ICU, and eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Logistic regression analysis showed that favipiravir use independently decreased mortality (P=0.006). CONCLUSION The use of favipiravir was more effective than LPV/RTV in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Çinarka, Halİt; GÜnlÜoĞlu, GÜlŞah; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yurt, Sİbel; Kiyik, Murat; KoŞar, AyŞe Fİlİz; Tanriverdİ, Elİf; Arslan, Melİh Akay; Baydİlİ, KÜrŞad Nurİ; KoÇ, Aysu Sİnem; Altin, Sedat; Çetİnkaya, ErdoĞan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2012-189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726482/,408

68565,Depressive symptoms and school burnout during adolescence: evidence from two cross-lagged longitudinal studies.,2009,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of mortality in infants and young children. Despite the RSV disease burden, no vaccine is available, and treatment remains nonspecific. New drug candidates are needed to combat RSV. Toward this goal, we screened over 2,000 compounds to identify approved drugs with novel anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides, inhibitors of the membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase, were identified to have anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides diminished RSV infection in human epithelial type 2 cells and in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface. Digoxin, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved cardiac glycoside, was also able to inhibit infection of primary nasal epithelial cells with community isolates of RSV. Our results suggest that the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides may be dependent on changes in the intracellular Na+ and K+ composition. Consistent with this mechanism, we demonstrated that the ionophoric antibiotics salinomycin, valinomycin, and monensin inhibited RSV in human epithelial type 2 cells and primary nasal epithelial cells. Our data indicate that the K+/Na+-sensitive steps in the RSV life cycle occur within the initial 4 hours of viral infection but do not include virus binding/entry. Rather, our findings demonstrated a negative effect on the RSV transcription and/or replication process. Overall, this work suggests that targeting intracellular ion concentrations offers a novel antiviral strategy.","Norris, Michael J; Malhi, Manpreet; Duan, Wenming; Ouyang, Hong; Granados, Andrea; Cen, Yuchen; Tseng, Yi-Chieh; Gubbay, Jonathan; Maynes, Jason; Moraes, Theo J",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2017-0345oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30095982/,408

The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247). CONCLUSION This study revealed the pathological conjunctival alterations in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that pathological ocular surface alterations may present even at the beginning of COVID-19 without clinically significant ocular manifestation.","Bozkurt, Erdinç; Özateş, Serdar; Muhafız, Ersin; Yılmaz, Fatma; Calıskan, Okan",Eye & contact lens,https://doi.org/10.1097/icl.0000000000000752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060413/,408

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Balıkesir University, Turkey, between May 2015 and March 2020. METHODOLOGY Patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary hydatid cysts were evaluated retrospectively, for the age, gender, symptoms, cyst size and localisation, preferred surgery, duration of surgery, the extent of the intraoperative bleeding, duration of the chest drainage, hospitalisation time, and postoperative complications. The relationship between the categorical variables was examined with the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and the relationship between the non-parametric data and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS A total of 60 patients included in the study; 23 underwent videothoracoscopic surgery and 37 had thoracotomy. There were no statistically significant differences between groups as gender, age, location and size of cyst. The videothoracoscopic surgery has superiority to thoracotomy group in terms of lower duration of operation, less perioperative bleeding (p = 0.005), early chest tube removal and lower hospitalisation time (both p <0.001). But there were no statistical difference between groups in complication rates (p = 0.340). CONCLUSION Videothoracoscopic removal of pulmonary hydatid cyst is a safe and advantageous procedure comparing to thoracotomy. There is a need for prospective studies with a larger sample size.

71222,Treatment for Anxiety and Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Strategies.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND There is high morbidity in clinical patients with duodenum bulb inflammation. Mucosa-associated microbiota, which are closely related to inflammatory processes, may have a pathogenic role, but the duodenum bulb microbial signature is poorly studied. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to characterize microbial changes associated with duodenum bulb inflammation. METHODS Mucosal biopsy is commonly used to assess microbial communities associated with the intestinal mucosa. Sixteen patients (8 with duodenum bulb inflammation and 8 controls) underwent gastroscopy, and duodenal bulb biopsies were obtained. Diagnoses were based on both endoscopic and histological findings. To determine microbiota composition and diversity, 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed. OTU-level alpha diversity indices, such as the Chao1 richness estimator, abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) metric, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson index, were calculated using the OTU table in QIIME. RESULTS More OTUs were identified in the normal samples (781) than in the inflammatory samples (553). Metastats analysis identified 19 phyla and 97 genera that were significantly different between the two groups, and the beta diversity was significantly different between the two groups (unweighted UniFrac: P = 0.001; weighted UniFrac: P = 0.001). For all individuals, composition analyses showed that the most abundant phyla in the duodenal bulb samples were Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The phylogenetic diversity of the microbiota in the duodenal bulbs of healthy volunteers was higher than that in volunteers with inflammation. Dominant microbes differed between the DN samples and DI samples. The most frequently represented genera in the DN samples were Cetobacterium, Aeromonadaceae, and Clostridium (accounting for 58.4%, 8.5%, and 4.8% of the total, respectively), and the dominant genera in the DI samples were Cetobacterium, Cupriavidus, and Helicobacter (accounting for 43.6%, 13.1%, 4.5% of the total, respectively). Significant differences in the microbiota were observed between those exhibiting an inflammatory state and the controls. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm that the dominant species in duodenum bulbs differ between healthy subjects and patients with inflammation and that mucosal microbiome dysbiosis is involved in the development of duodenum bulb inflammation.","Fan, Hui-Ning; Zhu, Pei; Zhang, Jing; Zhu, Jin-Shui",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385493/,408
72029,Commentary: Time to Improve Access to Psychotherapies - A Family Medicine Perspective.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVES Cardiovascular ""risk"" is an abstract concept that is frequently misunderstood by the general public. However, correct estimation of one's own cardiovascular risk is important as risk unawareness is associated with noncompliance with interventions aimed to reduce risk burden. Knowing the prevalence and factors linked with an increased probability of risk unawareness are therefore important to develop strategies aimed to increase risk awareness. Aims. To study prevalence of risk unawareness and to understand risk markers associated with risk underestimation and overestimation. Design. A total of 1716 participants were enrolled to the study in 33 centers across Turkey. Relevant demographic and clinical data were collected by direct interview. Cardiovascular risk of the participants was calculated using SCORE risk charts. Results. Ten-year risk for a fatal cardiovascular event was calculated as low in 633 (36.8%), intermediate in 513 (29.9%) and high-very high in 570 (33.2%) participants, respectively. According to these findings, 34.6% (n = 593) of the participants estimated their risk correctly, whereas 22.7% (n = 390) of the participants overestimated and 42.7% (n = 733) of the participants underestimated their risk. Male gender was the sole factor that was associated with an increased risk of underestimation, while having hypertension, significant valve disease or atrial fibrillation was associated with increased odds for risk overestimation. Conclusions. Only one-thirds of the sample was aware of their calculated risk for cardiovascular mortality and risk underestimation was the most common mode of risk unawareness, prompting concerns on the possible impact of the latter on adherence to the strategies aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk.","Dinc Asarcikli, Lale; Kis, Mehmet; Koza, Yavuzer; Oguz, Didem; Güvenc, Tolga Sinan; Tosun, Veysel; Inci, Sinan; Zoghi, Mehdi",Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ,https://doi.org/10.1080/14017431.2020.1822541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998573/,408
72376,"""Sex in the time of COVID"": clinical guidelines for STD management in an era of social distancing.",2020-05-09,"OBJECTIVE Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is an emerging treatment modality that enables incisionless ablative neurosurgical procedures. Bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Preliminary evidence has suggested that bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy can present increased difficulties in reaching lesional temperatures as compared to unilateral thalamotomy. The authors of this article aimed to study the parameters associated with successful MRgFUS capsulotomy lesioning and to present longitudinal radiographic findings following MRgFUS capsulotomy. METHODS Using data from 22 attempted MRgFUS capsulotomy treatments, the authors investigated the relationship between various sonication parameters and the maximal temperature achieved at the intracranial target. Lesion volume and morphology were analyzed longitudinally using structural and diffusion tensor imaging. A retreatment procedure was attempted in one patient, and their postoperative imaging is presented. RESULTS Skull density ratio (SDR), skull thickness, and angle of incidence were significantly correlated with the maximal temperature achieved. MRgFUS capsulotomy lesions appeared similar to those following MRgFUS thalamotomy, with three concentric zones observed on MRI. Lesion volumes regressed substantially over time following MRgFUS. Fractional anisotropy analysis revealed a disruption in white matter integrity, followed by a gradual return to near-baseline levels concurrent with lesion regression. In the patient who underwent retreatment, successful bilateral lesioning was achieved, and there were no adverse clinical or radiographic events. CONCLUSIONS With the current iteration of MRgFUS technology, skull-related parameters such as SDR, skull thickness, and angle of incidence should be considered when selecting patients suitable for MRgFUS capsulotomy. Lesions appear to follow morphological patterns similar to what is seen following MRgFUS thalamotomy. Retreatment appears to be safe, although additional cases will be necessary to further evaluate the associated safety profile.","Davidson, Benjamin; Mithani, Karim; Huang, Yuexi; Jones, Ryan M; Goubran, Maged; Meng, Ying; Snell, John; Hynynen, Kullervo; Hamani, Clement; Lipsman, Nir",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.6.jns201302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977311/,408

However, concerns regarding safety in the setting of previous malignancy or the use of allogeneic cells have been raised. We therefore aimed to systematically review all clinical studies using adipose-derived cell therapy to identify reported adverse events with a special focus on risk of thromboembolic, immunological, and oncological safety concerns. Our systematic search resulted in 70 included studies involving more than 1,400 patients that were treated with adipose-derived cell therapy. Safety assessment method was not described in 32 of the included studies. For studies involving systemic or cardiac administration, one case of pulmonary thromboembolism and cases of both myocardial and cerebral infarctions were described. In the setting of allogeneic cell therapy studies, where the production of specific antibodies toward donor cells was examined, it was noted that 19%-34% of patients develop antibodies, but the consequence of this is unknown. With regard to oncological safety, only one case of breast cancer recurrence was identified out of 121 patients. Adipose-derived cell therapy has so far shown a favorable safety profile, but safety assessment description has, in general, been of poor quality, and only adverse events that are looked for will be found. We encourage future studies to maintain a strong focus on the safety profile of cell therapy, so its safeness can be confirmed.

Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients with stage I NSCLC are not candidates for lobectomy because of severe medical comorbidity. METHODS A panel of experts was convened through the Thoracic Oncology Network of the American College of Chest Physicians and the Workforce on Evidence-Based Surgery of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Following a literature review, the panel developed 13 suggestions for evaluation and treatment through iterative discussion and debate until unanimous agreement was achieved. RESULTS Pretreatment evaluation should focus primarily on measures of cardiopulmonary physiology, as respiratory failure represents the greatest interventional risk. Alternative treatment options to lobectomy for high-risk patients include sublobar resection with or without brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Each is associated with decreased procedural morbidity and mortality but increased risk for involved lobe and regional recurrence compared with lobectomy, but direct comparisons between modalities are lacking. CONCLUSIONS Therapeutic options for the treatment of high-risk patients are evolving quickly. Improved radiographic staging and the diagnosis of smaller and more indolent tumors push the risk-benefit decision toward parenchymal-sparing or nonoperative therapies in high-risk patients. Unbiased assessment of treatment options requires uniform reporting of treatment populations and outcomes in clinical series, which has been lacking to date.","Donington, Jessica; Ferguson, Mark; Mazzone, Peter; Handy, John; Schuchert, Matthew; Fernando, Hiran; Loo, Billy; Lanuti, Michael; de Hoyos, Alberto; Detterbeck, Frank; Pennathur, Arjun; Howington, John; Landreneau, Rodney; Silvestri, Gerard",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.12-0790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23208335/,408

A plastic object that was fixed to a urease-immobilized filter paper was used as a self-propelled object, termed a urease motor, placed on a urea aqueous solution. The driving force of the urease motor is the difference in the surface tension around the object. Oscillatory motion or no motion was triggered depending on the initial pH of the urea solution. Both the frequency and maximum speed of the oscillatory motion varied depending on the initial pH of the water phase. The mechanisms underlying the oscillatory motion and no motion were discussed in relation to the bell-shaped enzyme activity of urease in the enzyme reaction and the surface tension around the urease motor.","Nakata, Satoshi; Xu, Yu; Ji, Lin; Izumi, Shunsuke","Chemistry, an Asian journal",https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.202100336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955163/,408

Hence, ambiguous cases in the classification of HIV sequences into subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) have been treated with ad hoc methods in lack of tools based on a comprehensive coalescent model accounting for complex recombination patterns. RESULTS We developed the program ARGUS that scores classifications of sequences into subtypes and recombinant forms. It reconstructs ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that reflect the genealogy of the input sequences given a classification hypothesis. An ARG with maximal probability is approximated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. ARGUS was able to distinguish the correct classification with a low error rate from plausible alternative classifications in simulation studies with realistic parameters. We applied our algorithm to decide between two recently debated alternatives in the classification of CRF02 of HIV-1 and find that CRF02 is indeed a recombinant of Subtypes A and G.

The hypothesis was that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) may up-regulate ACE2 expression that is used as receptor for viral entry into cells. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review is to discuss the existing evidence on the interaction between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and ACEIs or ARBs and to examine the main implications for clinical practice. In addition, novel therapeutic strategies for blocking ACE2-mediated COVID-19 infection will be displayed. METHODS We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to identify data from clinical and experimental studies for the association between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and RAS inhibition. RESULTS The current clinical and experimental evidence for ACEIs or ARBs to facilitate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is insufficient to suggest discontinuing these drugs. Several observational studies arrive at the conclusion that the continued use of RAS inhibitors is unlike to be harmful in COVID-19-positive patients.

Nowadays, ancient formulations of Traditional Chinese and Kampo (Japanese) Medicines coexist with Western herbal medicines (HMs) and complement each other. HMs are used for the treatment of mild and chronic diseases, as an adjunct therapy, to improve wellbeing and delay aging, or as healthy (functional) foods. AREAS COVERED This article, a third part in a series of reviews, is focusing on history, use and regulation of the traditional and modern HMs in Japan and China. Materials available from legislative and governmental websites, PubMed and news media were used. Expert commentary: HMs are heavily regulated in both countries, often in a similar manner as conventional pharmaceutical drugs. The majority of herbal formulations are sold as over-the-counter medications supplied with leaflets describing indications and appropriate dosages for patients of different ages. Medical practitioners prescribe herbal formulations that are tailored to the needs of particular patients. Both countries had problems with adverse drug reactions and toxicity of single herbs and herbal formulations that have been investigated by authorities, and some drugs have been removed from the market.","Teng, Lida; Zu, Qiang; Li, Gangzhou; Yu, Tian; Job, Kathleen M; Yang, Xiaoyan; Di, Liuqing; Sherwin, Catherine Mt; Enioutina, Elena Y",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2016.1195263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27232545/,408

However, the rectum tends to be the dose-limiting structure when treating prostate cancer, given its close proximity. Early and late toxicities can occur when the rectum receives large doses of radiation therapy. New technologies allow for prevention of these toxicities. In this review, we examine the evidence that supports various dose constraints employed to prevent these rectal injuries from occurring. We also examine the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and how this compares to older radiation therapy techniques that allow for further sparing of the rectum during a radiation therapy course. We then review the literature on endorectal balloons and the effects of their daily use throughout a radiation therapy course. Tissue spacers are now being investigated in greater detail; these devices are injected into the rectoprostatic fascia to physically increase the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall.

Additionally, the decision on the molecular testing algorithm is hindered by their clinical heterogeneity. However, the precise identification of the type of defect is often a prerequisite for the clinical management and genetic counselling. Four major molecular alterations (epimutations, uniparental disomies, copy number variants, single nucleotide variants) have been identified, but their frequencies vary between SRS and BWS. Due to their molecular aetiology, epimutations in both disorders as well as upd(11)pat in BWS are particular prone to mosaicism which might additionally complicate the interpretation of testing results. We report on our experience of molecular analysis in a total cohort of 1448 patients referred for diagnostic testing of BWS and SRS, comprising a dataset from 737 new patients and from 711 cases from a recent study. Though the majority of positively tested patients showed the expected molecular results, we identified a considerable number of clinically unexpected molecular alterations as well as not yet reported changes and discrepant mosaic distributions. Additionally, the rate of multilocus imprinting disturbances among the patients with epimutations and uniparental diploidies could be further specified. Altogether, these cases show that comprehensive testing strategies have to be applied in diagnostic testing of SRS and BWS. The precise molecular diagnosis is required as the basis for a targeted management (e.g. ECG (electrocardiogram) and tumour surveillance in BWS, growth treatment in SRS). The molecular diagnosis furthermore provides the basis for genetic counselling. However, it has to be considered that recurrence risk calculation is determined by the phenotypic consequences of each molecular alteration and mechanism by which the alteration arose. KEY MESSAGES: The detection rates for the typical molecular defects of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or Silver-Russell syndrome (BWS, SRS) are lower in routine cohorts than in clinically well-characterised ones. A broad spectrum of (unexpected) molecular alterations in both disorders can be identified. Multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID) are less frequent in SRS than expected. The frequency of MLID and uniparental diploidy in BWS is confirmed. Mosaicism is a diagnostic challenge in BWS and SRS. The precise determination of the molecular defects affecting is the basis for a targeted clinical management and genetic counselling.","Eggermann, Thomas; Brück, Johanna; Knopp, Cordula; Fekete, György; Kratz, Christian; Tasic, Velibor; Kurth, Ingo; Elbracht, Miriam; Eggermann, Katja; Begemann, Matthias",Journal of molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-020-01966-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839827/,408

Although its illustrations are of an indisputably high quality, its unethical origins yield questions with its use. This study aimed to identify successful methods for creating equal if not higher quality anatomical visualisations through an analysis and comparison of past and present medical illustrator's techniques. Pernkopf's illustrations were not used as an anatomical reference to ensure the new visuals were ethical; instead other existing visuals and written sources were compiled and reviewed to create an original 3D model of the posterior cervical triangle using ZBrush 2020. Some visualisation techniques used by Pernkopf were used as a part of this project (i.e. rendering in partial colour) this technique is not unique to Pernkopf and was also used by Henry Carter, the illustrator of Grey's anatomy. The survey was distributed to 78 participants with a strong anatomical or medical/biological art background. The reception to the new resource was positive; participants favoured it in terms of quality and ease of understanding. However, participants noted that the images in the survey were not the same resolution which may have skewed the results in favour of the new image. When rated for detail compared to the Pernkopf Atlas, the number of structures in the resource need to be increased before it can be ranked equally to the Pernkopf Atlas for detail.

82438,Family Medicine Telehealth Clinic With Medical Students.,2020,"Bisphophonates (BPs) are a group of drugs used in treating bone diseases, which may lead to the development of the osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The negative impact of BPs on angiogenesis is among the causes of ONJ. The specific mechanisms of complications are unknown. What is taken into consideration is the trauma background, which, in combination with the implemented BP treatment, can induce bone necrosis. One of the possible consequences of necrotic change progression is the development of an oronasal fistula. Treatment generally requires a surgical intervention.The paper describes the course of treatment of an oronasal fistula in a patient with BP osteitis, currently using an upper denture. The fistula arose a year after the removal of a protruding sequestrum in the region of the hard palate. An attempt was made to treat the fistula by the mobilization of soft tissues from the palate and the bilayered closure of the fistula with the use of a pedicled connective tissue graft on the greater palatine artery, along with a Tinti-Parma-Benfenati (TPB) flap. The patient was subjected to appropriate post-procedural measures. Regular follow-ups did not reveal any abnormalities in the course of healing.The use of the abovementioned procedure proved to be an effective method of treatment of an oronasal fistula. The use of a pedicled connective tissue graft for the closure of the oronasal fistula caused by BP therapy had a significant effect on the treatment outcome.","Radziszewski, Piotr; Włodarczyk, Maciej; Yafimtsau, Ivan",Dental and medical problems,https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/114184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150357/,408
82979,Assessing risk for healthcare workers during the covid-19 pandemic.,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND The restoration of complex tissue deficits with vascularized composite allotransplantation is a paradigm shift in reconstructive surgery. Clinical adoption of vascularized composite allotransplantation is limited by the need for systemic immunosuppression, with associated morbidity and mortality. Small-animal models lack the biological fidelity and preclinical relevance to enable translation of immunologic insights to humans. Large-animal models have been described; however, limitations persist, including the inability of heterotopic models to evaluate functional nerve regeneration, and the sensitivity of primates to toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs. The authors' novel orthotopic porcine limb transplant model has broad applicability and translational relevance to both immunologic and functional outcomes after vascularized composite allotransplantation. METHODS Recipients underwent amputation at a level corresponding to the mid forearm. Replantation or transplantation of grafts was performed by plate fixation of the radio-ulna, microsurgical repair of brachial artery and median nerve, and extensor and flexor tendon repairs. Viability of replants was monitored clinically and radiologically. Transplants were monitored for clinicopathologic signs of rejection. Animals mobilized freely postoperatively. RESULTS Replantations remained viable until the endpoint of 14 days. Transplants developed Banff grade 4 acute rejection by postoperative day 7. Doppler sonography and angiography confirmed vascular patency. Serial biopsy specimens of skin and histopathology of replants at endpoint confirmed tissue viability and bone healing. CONCLUSIONS An orthotopic load-bearing porcine forelimb vascularized composite allotransplantation model was successfully established. Technical, procedural, and logistic considerations were optimized to allow model use for immunologic, bone healing, functional nerve regeneration, and other translational studies.","Fries, C Anton; Villamaria, Carole Y; Spencer, Jerry R; Rickard, Rory F; Gorantla, Vijay S; Davis, Michael R",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000002451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556621/,408
82981,Using Controlled Trials to Resolve Key Unknowns About Policy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-28,"Several cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) have been found to inhibit cell entry of filoviruses and other enveloped viruses. Structurally unrelated CADs may have antiviral activity, yet the underlying common mechanism and structure-activity relationship are incompletely understood.We aimed to understand how widespread antiviral activity is among CADs and which structural and physico-chemical properties are linked to entry inhibition.We measured inhibition of Marburg virus pseudoparticle (MARVpp) cell entry by 45 heterogeneous and mostly FDA-approved CADs and cytotoxicity in EA.hy926 cells. We analysed correlation of antiviral activity with four chemical properties: pKa, ClogP, molecular weight and distance between the basic group and hydrophobic ring structures. Additionally, we quantified drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) of a CAD subset by flow cytometry. Structurally similar compounds (derivatives) and those with similar chemical properties but unrelated structure (analogues) to strong inhibitors were obtained by two in silico similarity search approaches and tested for antiviral activity. Overall 11 out of 45 (24 %) CADs inhibited MARVpp by 40 % or more. The strongest antiviral compounds were dronedarone, triparanol and quinacrine. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed highly significant correlations between antiviral activity, hydrophobicity (ClogP>4), and DIPL. Moreover, pKa and intra-molecular distance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties correlated with antiviral activity, but to a lesser extent. We also showed that in contrast to analogues, derivatives had similar antiviral activity as the seed compound dronedarone. Overall, one quarter of CADs inhibits MARVpp entry in vitro and antiviral activity of CADs mostly relies on their hydrophobicity, yet is promoted by the individual structure.","Gunesch, Antonia P; Zapatero-Belinchon, Francisco J; Pinkert, Lukas; Steinmann, Eike; Manns, Michael P; Schneider, Gisbert; Pietschmann, Thomas; Brönstrup, Mark; von Hahn, Thomas",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00143-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513799/,408

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of preoperative dexmedetomidine nebulization on the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy-intubation, intraoperative anesthetic-analgesic requirements and recovery outcomes. Methods 120 ASA I & II adult patients, of either gender, undergoing elective surgeries requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled and randomized to receive nebulized dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg in 3-4 ml of 0.9% saline) or 0.9% saline (3-4 ml), 30 minutes before anesthesia induction. Heart rate and non-invasive systolic blood pressures were studied for 10 minutes following laryngoscopy. Results After laryngoscopy, linear mixed effect modelling showed significantly lower trend of increase in heart rate in the dexmedetomidine group versus saline (P = 0.01). However, there was no difference in the systolic blood pressure changes between the two groups (P= 0.90). Induction dose of propofol (P < 0.001), intraoperative fentanyl consumption (P = 0.007) and isoflurane requirements (P = 0.01) were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group. There was no difference in the 2-hr postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (P = 0.61) or sore-throat (P = 0.74). Conclusions Nebulized dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg attenuated the increase in heart rate but not systolic blood pressures following laryngoscopy; and reduced the intraoperative anesthetic and analgesic consumption. There was no effect on early PONV, sore-throat or increase in incidence of adverse effects. Nebulized dexmedetomidine may represent a favorable alternative to the intravenous route in short duration surgeries.","Misra, Satyajeet; Behera, Bikram Kishore; Mitra, Jayanta Kumar; Sahoo, Alok Kumar; Jena, Sritam Swarup; Srinivasan, Anand",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.20153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434291/,408

Hypoxic/metabolic changes produced by intense inflammatory response against the virus triggers cytokine storm and subsequently ARDS and multiple organ failure. Hypoxic/metabolic changes result in encephalopathy. The presence of comorbidities predisposes to hypoxic/metabolic changes responsible for encephalopathy. Altered consciousness, ranging from mild confusion, delirium, to deep coma, is hallmark clinical features. Cortical and subcortical T2/FLAIR signal changes are common neuroimaging abnormalities. In a few isolated case reports of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis, the virus has been demonstrated in CSF. The presence of anosmia and ageusia can help in differentiation from other encephalopathies. We analysed published reports on COVID-19 associated-encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is common in older patients, the majority are more than 50 years of age. The patients having encephalopathy/encephalitis are either severely or critically ill. Many patients were already on mechanical ventilation. Lung abnormalities are noted in almost all of the patients, presenting with encephalopathy.

85512,Health Conditions Associated With Severe Illness From COVID-19 Among Individuals With Serious Mental Illness.,2020-11-19,"Background and Purpose Ethnic disparities in stroke are well described, with a higher incidence of disability and increased mortality in Blacks versus Whites. We sought to compare the clinical outcomes between those ethnic groups after stroke endovascular therapy (ET). Methods We performed a retrospective review of the prospectively acquired Grady Endovascular Stroke Outcomes Registry between September 1, 2010 and September 30, 2015. Patients were dichotomized into two groups - Caucasians and African-Americans - and matched for age, pretreatment glucose level, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Baseline characteristics as well as procedural and outcome parameters were compared. Results Out of the 830 patients treated with ET, 308 pairs of patients (n = 616) underwent primary analysis. African-Americans were younger (p < 0.01), had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p < 0.01) and diabetes (p = 0.04), and had higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score values (p = 0.03) and shorter times to treatment (p = 0.01). Blacks more frequently had Medicaid coverage and less private insurance (29.6 vs. 11.4% and 41.5 vs. 60.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). The remaining baseline characteristics, including baseline NIHSS score and CT perfusion-derived ischemic core volumes, were well balanced. There were no differences in the overall distribution of 90-day modified Rankin scale scores (p = 0.28), rates of successful reperfusion (84.7 vs. 85.7%, p = 0.91), good outcomes (49.1 vs. 44%, p = 0.24), or parenchymal hematomas (6.5 vs. 6.8%, p = 1.00). Blacks had lower 90-day mortality rates (18 vs. 24.6%, p = 0.04) in univariate analysis, which persisted as a nonsignificant trend after adjustment for potential confounders (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.26-1.03, p = 0.06). Conclusions Despite unique baseline characteristics, African-Americans treated with ET for large vessel occlusion strokes have similar outcomes as Caucasians. Greater availability of ET may diminish the ethnic/racial disparities in stroke outcomes.","Bouslama, Mehdi; Rebello, Leticia C; Haussen, Diogo C; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Anderson, Aaron M; Belagaje, Samir R; Bianchi, Nicolas A; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000487607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410516/,408

PATIENTS AND METHODS The Florence robotic intracorporeal neobladder (FloRIN) was performed employing the following main surgical steps: isolation of 50 cm of ileum; bowel anastomosis; urethro-ileal anastomosis creating an asymmetrical 'U'-shape (30 cm distally and 20 cm proximally to anastomosis), ileum detubularisation; posterior wall reconfiguration as an 'L'; bladder neck reconstruction; anterior folding of the posterior plate to reach the 12 o'clock position; uretero-enteral 'orthotopic' bilateral anastomosis. The conception and development of the FloRIN followed the IDEAL guidelines recommended stages: Phase 1 (simulation) involved the neobladder robotic configuration using silicone models. Phase 2a (development) aimed to reproduce the configuration in an open fashion in one patient, and then in the first three robotic procedures. Phase 2b (exploration) consisted of the technique standardisation in 15 consecutive robotic approaches. Phase 2a and 2b included urodynamics and imaging assessment of the patients treated. RESULTS From February 2016 to September 2017 FloRIN was performed in 18 patients. Comparing the first three (Phase 2a) with the subsequent 15 patients (Phase 2b), the median (interquartile range [IQR]) reconstruction operating time was 260 (220-340) vs 160 (150-210) min, respectively. Postoperative surgical complications occurred in four of the 18 patients (22.1%), including one surgical Clavien-Dindo Grade III and three Grade I, postoperative medical Clavien-Dindo Grade II complications occurred in three (16.7%) patients. On urodynamic examination (available in nine [50%] patients) the median (IQR) reservoir cystometric capacity, compliance, and post-void residual were 240 (220-267) mL, 18 (12.5-19.8) mL/cmH2 O, and 0 (0-50) mL, respectively. Ultrasonography showed no Grade ≥2 vesico-ureteric reflux. CONCLUSION We describe the FloRIN configuration, showing its technical feasibility with acceptable time efficiency.

These events can have significant consequences for individuals in this population and further study can inform practices to reduce both maternal morbidity and mortality. Numerous surveillance systems exist but we lack a standardized approach. Given the current inconsistencies and the importance in monitoring these events, this study aimed to identify and compare commonly used surveillance methods. In June 2018, we systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL using terms related to monitoring/surveillance and maternal near miss/severe maternal morbidity. We included papers that used at least three indicators to monitor for these events and collected data on specific surveillance methods. We calculated the rate of maternal near miss/severe maternal morbidity in hospitalization data obtained from the 2016 US National Inpatient Sample using five common surveillance methods. Of 18,832 abstracts, 178 papers were included in our review. 198 indicators were used in studies included in our review; 71.2% (n = 141) of these were used in <10% of included studies and only 6.1% (n = 12) were used in >50% of studies included in our review.

Data on transcatheter stenting of SPS is limited. We sought to evaluate feasibility, safety and outcomes of stenting SPS. METHODS Retrospective review of all patients who underwent transcatheter SPS stenting from 1/2006 to 12/2013. RESULTS Of 229 surgically implanted SPS, 25 transcatheter stent interventions were performed in 22 patients. The majority had pulmonary atresia (n = 9) or HLHS (n = 10). Their median age was 4 ms (range 10 days to 4 years) and median weight 4.9 kg (range 3-14). Nine had a central and 15 had a BT shunt with a median shunt size of 3.75 mm (range 3-6). The interval from shunt placement to intervention was 1.9 ms (range 4 days-3.8 years). The indication for intervention was increasing cyanosis in10 patients and delaying final repair in 9. Two patients were on ECMO at the time of intervention. The median shunt diameter increased from 2.3 to 4.1 mm and oxygen saturation from 72 to 85% (P < 0.001). No intra-procedural complications were encountered. One patient died from aspiration (autopsy demonstrated a patent shunt), 13 progressed to repair or next stage, 6 remain palliated with shunts as they are deemed unfit for the next stage and 2 are awaiting surgery. CONCLUSIONS Stenting of systemic to pulmonary artery shunt is a safe and effective procedure and avoids surgical re-intervention. It can be performed both as a rescue procedure in patients with acute shunt occlusion and as an elective procedure to palliate patients not yet suitable for subsequent corrective or staged repair.","Vaughn, Gabrielle R; Moore, John W; Mallula, Kiran K; Lamberti, John J; El-Said, Howaida G",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25846812/,408

The objective of this work was to evaluate the incidence of aPL antibodies in patients hospitalized in conventional unit for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and confirmed venous thromboembolic events (VTE) associated with aPL antibodies. 41 patients infected with COVID-19 were tested for aPL antibodies. None had reported history of aPL syndrome. Arterial and venous duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed in all patients at Day 0 and Day 5. All patients had antithrombotic-prophylaxis upon admission using lower molecular weight heparin with Enoxaparin. Biological parameters were collected and analyzed. Nine patients (22%) developed VTE and seven (17%) were positive for aPL antibodies of which five had isolated positive lupus anticoagulant. The sixth patient was double aPL positive IgM anticardiolipin (147.8 U/ml) and anti-Beta2 Glyco protein 1 (97.3 U/ml) antibodies. The seventh was triple positive, IgM anticardiolipin 85.6 UI/ml, IgM anti-Beta2 Glyco protein 1 63.0 U/ml and positive lupus anticoagulant. Among the seven patients with aPL antibodies 2 (28.60%) had VTE. However, the incidence of VTE in patients negative for aPL antibodies was also significant as 20.6% (seven of 34). aPL antibodies were significantly associated with the transfer to ICUs of, P = 0.018. Not only the incidence of aPL antibodies was quite significant within our cohort, but also we observed 28.6% of VTE in aPL-positive patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 2008 to August 2011, we performed 175 cases of laparoscopic kidney resection. Among these, we excluded patients who received perioperative immunotherapy or target therapy and also patients with a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min. A total of 32 patients undergoing LPN and 92 patients undergoing LRN were enrolled. We retrospectively reviewed the changes in eGFR (by the modification of diet in renal disease method) at the following time points: preoperative, postoperative 1 week, and postoperative 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The mean warm ischemia time of the LPN group was 22 minutes (range, 0 to 47 minutes). Mean eGFR values (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) during postoperative week 1 and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 70.8, 71.5, 76.7, 76.0, and 75.3 in the LPN group and 52.1, 50.6, 52.8, 53.4, and 52.4 in the LRN group, respectively. One year after the operation, 6.3% (2 patients) of LPN patients and 68.5% (63 patients) of LRN patients had progressed to chronic renal insufficiency (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CONCLUSIONS Renal function recovered slightly after LPN and LRN and was maintained constantly after 3 months. However, renal function showed different patterns of decrease. Despite the concern for warm ischemia, LPN can preserve renal function better than can LRN. LPN should be considered for selected patients to prevent chronic renal insufficiency.","Kang, Su Hwan; Rhew, Hyun Yul; Kim, Taek Sang",Korean journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.4111/kju.2013.54.1.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362443/,408

The health system was rapidly overwhelmed by the pandemic. It became evident that patients suffering from timesensitive medical emergencies like stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, trauma and acute myocardial infarction required timely, effective and safe pathways to be treated. The problem was addressed by a regional decree that created a hub-and-spoke system for time-sensitive medical emergencies. METHODS We report the re-organizational changes adopted at a hub hospital (despite having already destined to COVID-19 patients most resources), and the number of emergent procedures for medical emergencies on the first 30-day of activity. These data were compared with the hospital activity in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS Organizational changes were implemented in few hours. Dedicated pathways for non-COVID-19 patients affected by a medical emergency were set up in the emergency department, in the labs and in the operating theater. Ten intensive beds were implemented from a high-dependency unit; two operating rooms were reserved 24h/day to neurosurgical or trauma emergencies. The number of emergent procedures was not different from that of the previous year, no admission refusal, no treatment delay and no viral transmission to the treated patients were recorded. No viral transmission to health care workers was observed. CONCLUSIONS Re-organization of a hospital in order to adopt a hub-and-spoke model resulted feasible and allowed to face acute coronary syndrome and other time-sensitive medical emergencies timely and safely.","Cabrini, Luca; Ageno, Walter; Balbi, Sergio; Baruzzi, Fabio; Candeloro, Elisa; Capra, Carlo; Carimati, Federico; Castiglioni, Battistina; Conti, Vinicio; De Ponti, Roberto; Franchi, Dario; Gini, Giancarlo; Giorgianni, Andrea; Sartorelli, Marianna; Landoni, Giovanni; Locatelli, Davide; Maffioli, Lorenzo; Pradella, Rita; Severgnini, Paolo; Tozzi, Matteo; Versino, Maurizio; Zocchi, Giuliano; Zoli, Alberto",Minerva cardioangiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4725.20.05384-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258565/,408

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 3942 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy cases were included in the study. All the patients were divided into 3 groups: No reinforcement (NoSLR), staple line reinforcement with fibrin glue (SLR-FG), and staple line reinforcement with omentopexy (SLR-O). Demographic data and perioperative characteristics of the groups were analyzed retrospectively. Among these, age, sex, preoperative comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, body mass index, duration of operation, reoperation, complications, and Clavien-Dindo classification scores were recorded. RESULTS Age, sex, body mass index, comorbid diseases, American Society of Anesthesiologists, and Clavien-Dindo Classification scores were similar in all the groups. The overall complication rate was 3.0%. The overall minor and major complication rates were 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively. The mortality rate was 0.1% (4 patients). The most common postoperative complications were bleeding (0.9%) and leakage (0.5%). The incidence of leakage, bleeding, and twisted gastric sleeve rates were similar when compared between SLR-FG and NoSLR. In the SLR-O patients, the incidence of leakage, hemorrhage, and twist were significantly lower and the operation time was significantly longer when compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS The SLR-O technique, especially when performed by experienced surgeons, is a promising method for the prevention of postoperative leakage, bleeding, and twist complications with an acceptable increase in the duration of operation. Considering the limited effects of the SLR-FG technique, it was predicted that it would lose its popularity over time.","Lale, Azmi; Aygen, Erhan; Kirkil, Cuneyt; Artas, Hakan; Yur, Mesut","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941357/,408

95007,Liability Protection for COVID-19 Health Care Providers.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Early reperfusion is critical for favorable outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retrievers lead to faster and more complete reperfusion than previous technologies. Our aim is to compare the cost-effectiveness of stent retrievers to the previous mechanical thrombectomy devices. METHODS Retrospective review of endovascularly treated large-vessel AIS. Data from all consecutive patients who underwent thrombectomy from January 2012 through November 2012 were collected. Baseline characteristics, the total procedural cost, the rates of successful recanalization [modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) scores of 2b or 3], and the length of stay at the hospital were compared between the stent retriever (SR) and the non-stent retriever (NSR) groups. RESULTS After excluding the patients who underwent concomitant extracranial stenting (n = 22) or received intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator only (n = 6), the entire cohort included 150 patients. The cost of the reperfusion procedure was significantly higher in the SR compared to the NSR group (USD 13,419 vs. 9,308, p <0.001). We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the rates of mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion (81 vs. 74%, p = 0.337) or the length of stay (11.1 ± 9.1 vs. 12.8 ± 9.6 days, p = 0.260) amongst the SR and the NSR patients. CONCLUSION The procedural costs of thrombectomy for AIS are increasing and account for the bulk of hospitalization reimbursement. The impact of these expenditures in the long-term sustainability of stroke centers deserves greater consideration. While it is likely that the SR technology results in higher rates of optimal reperfusion, better clinical outcomes, and shorter lengths of stay, larger studies are needed to prove its cost-effectiveness.","Kass-Hout, Tareq; Kass-Hout, Omar; Sun, Chung-Huan; Kass-Hout, Taha; Belagaje, Samir R; Anderson, Aaron M; Frankel, Michael R; Gupta, Rishi; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000371729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26019714/,408
95144,Policies to Improve Substance Use Disorder Treatment With Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.,2020-08-18,"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus is a group of viruses which causes diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these family of viruses can cause the respiratory infections from mild form to fatal forms. It is preferably called as coronavirus. Formally it known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) and this disease is called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is infectious in humans and world health organization has announced that Covid-19 as a pandemic disease. Tocilizumab is a biological agent which inhibits the cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6 inhibitor). As SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the development of cytokine storm syndrome, the drug tocilizumab seems to have positive effect in patients with covid-19. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To analyze and review the possible effects and efficacy of the tocilizumab (monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors) in SARS-CoV-2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS The search strategy on recent research and review articles is used for the SARS-CoV-2 disease and their characteristics. Furthermore we have analyzed most recent research article on monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors (tocilizumab) and their possible clinical effects in Covid-19 and their clinical trials on Covid-19 patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Covid-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is a life threatening condition which can give rise to fatal outcomes if left untreated. However there are no approved treatment for covid-19 globally. Furthermore we can conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with worsening of lung conditions characterized by interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of cytokine storm syndrome. According to available research data tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-human monoclonal antibody of IgG1τ (gamma 1, kappa) can improve patient's condition from cytokine storm syndrome by inhibiting the IL-6 (Interleukin 6) receptors. The rational use of the tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients can prevent the development of irreversible lung injury and death of the patient. Three retrospective studies of Xiaoling Xu et al., Pan luo et al. and Paola Tonaiti et al. has shown the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients. However we need more randomized research studies with significant number of patients which can confirm the promising results on tocilizumab treatment in covid-19 patients and even ongoing clinical trails such as TOSCA, COVACTA results has not been published yet which are expected to give better and more significant results on tocilizumab's effectiveness and safety.","Kulanthaivel, Shanmugaraj; Kaliberdenko, Vitalii B; Balasundaram, Keerthanaa; Shterenshis, Michael V; Scarpellini, Emidio; Abenavoli, Ludovico",Reviews on recent clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887115666200917110954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940187/,408

97627,Social Support is Key to Retention in Care during Covid-19 Pandemic among Older People with HIV and Substance Use Disorders in Ukraine.,2020-07-15,"SUMMARYThe immune system must work in an orchestrated way to achieve an optimal response upon detection of antigens. The cells comprising the immune response are traditionally divided into two major subsets, innate and adaptive, with particular characteristics for each type. Type I natural killer T (iNKT) cells are defined as innate-like T cells sharing features with both traditional adaptive and innate cells, such as the expression of an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and several NK receptors. The invariant TCR in iNKT cells interacts with CD1d, a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-like molecule. CD1d can bind and present antigens of lipid nature and induce the activation of iNKT cells, leading to the secretion of various cytokines, such as gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). These cytokines will aid in the activation of other immune cells following stimulation of iNKT cells. Several molecules with the capacity to bind to CD1d have been discovered, including α-galactosylceramide. Likewise, several molecules have been synthesized that are capable of polarizing iNKT cells into different profiles, either pro- or anti-inflammatory. This versatility allows NKT cells to either aid or impair the clearance of pathogens or to even control or increase the symptoms associated with pathogenic infections. Such diverse contributions of NKT cells to infectious diseases are supported by several publications showing either a beneficial or detrimental role of these cells during diseases. In this article, we discuss current data relative to iNKT cells and their features, with an emphasis on their driving role in diseases produced by pathogenic agents in an organ-oriented fashion.","Gálvez, Nicolás M S; Bohmwald, Karen; Pacheco, Gaspar A; Andrade, Catalina A; Carreño, Leandro J; Kalergis, Alexis M",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00232-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361143/,408

METHODS A randomized clinical trial design was utilized (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04110587). The 51 patients were allocated to a TMJ arthroscopy (n = 25) or a TMJ arthroscopy plus HA (n = 26) group. Visual analog scale joint pain scores, maximum mouth opening (MMO), and muscle pain were measured at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Disc position on magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated at baseline and 12 months. Oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) was assessed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS No group differences were observed in clinical or radiographic measurements (P≥0.05). The results do not indicate any benefit of hyaluronic acid as an adjuvant therapy to arthroscopy during follow-up months 3-12.

97893,Leveraging Technology to Improve Care of Older Adults.,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVE Large artery occlusion (LAO) in patients with major stroke predicts poor revascularization by intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and more likely results in a poor outcome. We focused on the effects of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and endovascular mechanical recanalization (EMR) as rescue therapies in major strokes refractory to IVT. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 87 patients (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >20), who did not respond to full-dose IVT due to LAO, was performed based on their endovascular therapy status. IAT was performed as an intraclot infusion of alteplase, and EMR was provided by the Solitaire device™ (Covidien, Dubin, Ireland). The recanalization and 3-month outcome rates after IAT/EMR were correlated with a group of patients who were scheduled to receive endovascular treatment but who underwent only IVT. RESULTS We achieved successful recanalization by IAT and EMR in 68.7% and 76.1% of patients, respectively. Despite no significant differences in mortality between IAT and EMR, a trend towards better outcomes after IAT and a statistically significant increase for outcome-modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-3 (45.7%) and mRS 0-2 (34.9%) after EMR was noted when compared with IVT. The degree of recanalization did not correlate with the functional results except for the good-moderate outcome after successful recanalization by EMR. CONCLUSION EMR by the Solitaire device is a safe and beneficial method for the rescue treatment of patients with major stroke whose neurological status does not improve and who fail to recanalize the LAO after a 1-h full dose of IVT. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE The article verifies efficiency of the Solitaire device in major strokes.","Vanicek, J; Bulik, M; Brichta, J; Jancalek, R",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20130545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641217/,408

Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.","Hamner, Lea; Dubbel, Polly; Capron, Ian; Ross, Andy; Jordan, Amber; Lee, Jaxon; Lynn, Joanne; Ball, Amelia; Narwal, Simranjit; Russell, Sam; Patrick, Dale; Leibrand, Howard",MMWR.

We enrolled 102 patients that were randomly divided into two groups: received three oral doses of EACA (2000 mg per dose) or three oral doses of TXA (1300 mg per dose). The medication was given according to the following schedule: 2 h before surgery and 6 and 12 h after surgery. The variables analyzed to compare the effectiveness of the hemostatic agents were total blood loss, hidden blood loss, external blood loss, transfusion rate, intraoperative blood loss, decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit values, surgical drainage output, visual analog scale, and surgical complications. There were no significant differences between any of the study variables for the group receiving oral TXA and the group receiving oral EACA (P > 0.05). Our study showed that the use of oral EACA was similar to its counterpart TXA regarding the evaluated parameters. TXA did not have superior blood conservation effects, safety profile, or differences in functional scales compared with EACA in THA. We consider the use of multiple oral doses of aminocaproic acid at the selected dose to be effective as a standard protocol to achieve less blood loss and a lower rate of transfusion and adverse events related to the medication in patients undergoing a THA.","Morales-Avalos, Rodolfo; Ramos-Morales, Tomas; García-Pedro, Jesús A; Espinoza-Galindo, Ana M; Acosta-Olivo, Carlos; Morcos-Sandino, Michelle; Silva-Ramos, Héctor N G; Peña-Martínez, Víctor M; Rodríguez-Torres, Raymundo A; Vilchez-Cavazos, Félix",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000001005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443925/,408

A crucial question is if acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the main cause of death in this pandemic, and often refractory to treatments, can be explained by respiratory center dysfunction. Objective To discuss that ARDS can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem. Materials and Methods I reviewed literature about SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to infect the respiratory center in the brainstem. Results and Conclusions An increasing amount of reports demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronavirus, which have been found in the brains of patients and experimental models, where the brainstem was severely infested. Recent studies have provided tremendous indication of the incidence of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brainstem. SARS-CoV-2 might infect the CNS through the olfactory bulb, spreading from the olfactory nerves to the rhinencephalon, and finally reaching the brainstem. Hence, the virus infection causes respiratory center dysfunctions, leading to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. I conclude that acute ARDS in Covid-19 can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion of brainstem respiratory center, suggesting the needs of more specific and aggressive treatments, with the direct participation of neurologists and neurointensivists.","Machado, Calixto; DeFina, Phillip A; Chinchilla, Mauricio; Machado, Yanín; Machado, Yazmina",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.299165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109839/,408

RESULTS The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic. Increasing length of time on the waiting list was associated with decreasing quality of life. Level of evidence: Level III retrospective case control study.","Clement, Nick D; Scott, Chloe E H; Murray, James R D; Howie, Colin R; Deehan, David J",The bone & joint journal,https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.103b.bjj-2021-0104.r1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752468/,408

To date a role for three dimensional rotational angiography of the aortic root (3DRAA) during Melody valve implantation has not been established. OBJECTIVES To describe the role of 3DRAA in the assessment of Melody valve candidacy and to demonstrate that it may improve outcomes. METHODS All patients who underwent cardiac catheterisation for Melody valve implantation and 3DRAA between August 2013 and February 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS 31 patients had 3DRAA with balloon sizing. Ten were deemed not Melody candidates (5 coronary compression, 2 aortic root distortion with cusp flattening, 2 RVOT was too large, and 1 had complex branch stenosis and a short landing zone). Of the 21 patients who were Melody candidates, 12 had conduits, 6 prosthetic valves and 3 native RVOTs. In patients with conduits, the technique of stenting the conduit prior to dilation was used after measuring the distance between the conduit and the coronary arteries on 3DRAA. In the Melody patients, we had 100% procedural success and no serious adverse events (coronary compression, tears, stent fracture or endocarditis). CONCLUSION As a tool for case selection, 3DRAA may facilitate higher procedural success and decreased risk of serious adverse events. Furthermore, 3D rotational angiography allows stenting of the conduit prior to dilation, which may prevent tears and possibly endocarditis.","Pockett, C R; Moore, J W; El-Said, H G",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-016-0931-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27933590/,408
105826,Postural Adjustments and Kinematic Index Finger Features in Frail Older Adults under Different Equilibrium Constraints.,2021-07-21,"PURPOSE The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a framework from which to measure the outcomes of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS We define the outcomes of recovery from the perspective of different stakeholders and time frames. There is no single definition of recovery. There are overlapping phases of recovery which are of particular interest to different stakeholders (surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, patients and their caregivers), and the primary outcome of interest may vary depending on the phase and the perspective. In the earliest phase (from the end of the surgery to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit [PACU]), biologic and physiologic outcomes are emphasized. In the intermediate phase (from PACU to discharge from the hospital), symptoms related to pain and gastrointestinal function as well as basic activities are important. Studies of ERAS pathways have reported clinical outcomes and symptoms, including complications, hospital stay, mobilization, and gastrointestinal function, largely during hospitalization. Nevertheless, patients define recovery as return to normal functioning, a process that occurs over weeks to months (late phase). Outcomes reflecting functional status (e.g., physical activity, activities of daily living) and overall health (e.g., quality of life) are important in this phase. To date, few studies reporting the effectiveness of ERAS pathways compared with conventional care have included functional status or quality-of-life outcomes, and there is little information about recovery after discharge from hospital. CONCLUSION Recovery after surgery is a complex construct. Different outcomes are important at different phases along the recovery trajectory. Measures for quantifying recovery in hospital and after discharge are available. A consensus-based core set of outcomes with input from multiple stakeholders would facilitate research reporting.","Feldman, Liane S; Lee, Lawrence; Fiore, Julio",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-014-0263-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391733/,408

In the present study, glutaraldehyde-modified magnetite-cornstarch nanoparticles (MCNs) were successfully synthesized, elaborately characterized by ZetaSizer and surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS), and used for the immobilization of a thermoalkalophilic esterase from Geobacillus sp. The optimal immobilization conditions were obtained at 65°C, 2:3 molar ratios of Fe2+ :Fe3+ and 1 g cornstarch resulted in approximately 90 nm magnetic particles in size. Also, immobilization yield and immobilization efficiency of the esterase were found as 74% and 82%, respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed that MCNs were uniform, spherical in shape, and well dispersed and esterase immobilized MCNs displayed similar morphology as free MCNs. The maximum activity of free and immobilized esterase was obtained at 65°C and pH 9. Immobilization onto glutaraldehyde-modified MCNs significantly enhanced the esterase thermostability. Additionally, the immobilized esterase kept its residual activity of 75% after three sequential cycles, suggesting that it has favorable operational stability.

106837,Promoting Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Obesity and Chronic Disease Management.,2020-06-09,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been the most significant health crisis in recent global history. Early studies from Wuhan highlighted COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and a significant association with mortality was soon recognised. As research continues across the world, more evidence is emerging of the cross-talk between the innate immune system, coagulation activation and inflammation. Immunothrombosis has been demonstrated to play a key role in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, with extracellular histones and neutrophil extracellular traps detected in the plasma and cardiopulmonary tissues of critically ill patients. Targeting the components of immunothrombosis is becoming an important factor in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. Recent studies report outcomes of intermediate and therapeutic anticoagulation in hospitalised patients with varying severities of COVID-19 disease, including optimal dosing and associated bleeding risks. Immunomodulatory therapies, including corticosteroids and IL-6 receptor antagonists, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. As the pandemic continues, more studies are required to understand the driving factors and upstream mechanisms for coagulopathy and immunothrombosis in COVID-19, and thus potentially develop more targeted therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in the acute phase and in those who develop longer term symptom burden.","Shaw, Rebecca J; Bradbury, Charlotte; Abrams, Simon T; Wang, Guozheng; Toh, Cheng-Hock",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114204/,408
107171,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social determinants among the Portuguese population: study protocol.,2021-09-13,"Objective: To assess the role of brief neuropsychological assessments in prediction and identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and progression to AD dementia. Method: Adults (N = 255; range = 40-81 years) with self-reported cognitive decline underwent baseline and 2-year follow-up clinical assessment, including a brief neuropsychological screening and lumbar puncture. Five different mild cognitive impairment (MCI) algorithms were applied on baseline cognitive test results: one conventional, three amnestic (lenient, stringent, multidomain), and one comprehensive criterion. We compared predictive and diagnostic accuracy of these MCI criteria by performing logistic regression analyses and calculating diagnostic accuracy measures for 2-year outcomes of (1) clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and (2) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the Alzheimer's continuum. Results: The lenient amnestic MCI criterion showed the largest effect size for predicting progression to AD dementia (OR = 13.762, 99% CI = 1.969-96.194, p = .001) and AD biomarkers (OR = 4.855, 99% CI = 1.974-11.924, p < .001) after 2 years. This criterion was sensitive for progression to dementia (sensitivity = 92.0%, specificity = 54.8%, positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 2.03, LR- = 0.15) and showed the highest overall diagnostic accuracy for AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 59.1%, LR+ = 1.78, negative likelihood ratio [LR-] = 0.46). The multidomain amnestic MCI criterion produced the highest specificity for dementia (sensitivity = 76.0%, specificity = 73.0%, LR+ = 2.82, LR- = 0.33) and AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 46.8% specificity = 70.9% LR+ = 1.61, LR- = 0.75). Conclusions: Defining MCI using a brief neuropsychological battery provided limited accuracy for progression to AD dementia and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ. The lenient amnestic MCI criterion identified the highest number of individuals who progressed to clinical AD or showed biomarker pathology, but this approach included a substantial number of false positives.

RALRP is currently performed in patients without previous surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This paper presents a successfully performed RALRP after previous open transvesical adenomectomy (TVA). CASE REPORT A 68-year-old patient underwent nerve-sparing RALRP for prostate cancer revealed by transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, 7 years after TVA. RESULTS Postoperatively, a regular diet was allowed on day 1. The Foley catheter was removed on day 7. At 3 months' follow-up, the patient complained of moderate stress incontinence but erectile function was responsive to Tadalafil(®). Serum prostate-specific antigen was undetectable. Quality of life was satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS A history of previous prostatic surgery does not appear to compromise the outcome of RALRP. Nerve sparing is still indicated. Long-term follow-up is necessary to define RALRP as a gold standard also in patients with previous TVA.","Bove, Alfredo Maria; Altobelli, Emanuela; Sergi, Federico; Buscarini, Maurizio",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-013-0392-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27637245/,408

Data sources We conducted searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it comprises and has been customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 29, 2020 (one day before submission). Study selection and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect, in patients with COVID-19, of vitamin C versus placebo or no treatment. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will resubmit it to the journal whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 95 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 20 ongoing studies, including 13 randomized trials evaluating vitamin C in COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers soon.

Safe surgery and infection prevention and control depend on effective sterile processing (SP) of surgical instruments; however, little is known about SP in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where surgical site infection is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Aim To appraise and synthesise available evidence on SP in LMICs. Methods An integrative review of research literature was conducted on SP in LMICs published between 2010 and 2020. Studies were appraised and synthesised to identify challenges and opportunities in practice and research. Results Eighteen papers met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. Challenges to advancing SP include limited available evidence, resource constraints and policy-practice gaps. Opportunities for advancing SP include tailored education and mentoring initiatives, emerging partnerships and networks that advance implementation guidelines and promote best practices, identifying innovative approaches to resource constraints, and designing and executing quality assurance and surveillance programmes. Discussion Research investigating safe surgery, including SP, in LMICs is increasing. Further research and evidence are needed to confirm the generalisability of study findings and effectiveness of strategies to improve SP practice in LMICs. This review will help researchers and stakeholders identify opportunities to contribute. The burdens of unsafe surgery transcend geopolitical borders, and the global surgery and research communities are called upon to negotiate historical and present-day inequities to achieve safe surgery for all.","Cuncannon, Alexander; Dosani, Aliyah; Fast, Olive",Journal of infection prevention,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757177420947468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841559/,408

The initial driver of this was Professor C Peter Clarke at the Austin Hospital at the beginning of the new millennium. His legacy was carried on by his apprentice, but at St Vincent's Hospital. After a period of slow development, it became the procedure of choice from 2005, and began to filter sporadically to other hospitals from 2010. METHODS This paper details the historical development, techniques and results of 343 VATS pulmonary resections (including lobectomies, sub-lobar anatomical resections, sleeve resections, bi-lobectomies and pneumonectomies). RESULTS In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 2.0% and 5-year survival for all stages of NSCLC was 70%. Over 36% of patients were stage II-III using the new 7(th) revision TNM staging system. The conversion to thoracotomy rate was 4.7%. The estimated learning curve for this experience VATS lobectomy appears to be in the range of 15-20 cases. In this series, the same lymph node dissection or sampling was attempted and usually achieved as would have occurred at thoracotomy.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trials. SETTING Variable. PARTICIPANTS 60 years and older with depression. INTERVENTION Ketamine. MEASUREMENTS Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. RESULTS Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The first study showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms with use of repeated subcutaneous ketamine administration among older adults with depression. The second study failed to achieve significance on its primary outcome measure but did show a decrease in MADRS scores with intranasal ketamine along with a higher response and remission rates in esketamine group compared with the placebo group. The adverse effects from ketamine generally lasted only a few hours and abated spontaneously. No cognitive adverse effects were noted in either trial from the use of ketamine. CONCLUSIONS The current evidence for use of ketamine among older adults with depression indicates some benefits with one positive and one negative trial. Although one of the trials did not achieve significance on the primary outcome measure, it still showed benefit of ketamine in reducing depressive symptoms. Ketamine was well tolerated in both studies with adverse effects being mild and transient.","Gupta, Aarti; Dhar, Romika; Patadia, Palak; Funaro, Melissa; Bhattacharya, Gargi; Farheen, Syeda A; Tampi, Rajesh R",International psychogeriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610220000903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600480/,408

In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created several new challenges-particularly for frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assessed the sleep quality (SQ) among HCWs. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted using an English-language online survey. The participants were invited via a web link sent using social network platforms. It included sociodemographic- and profession-related characteristics. COVID-19-associated risks were assessed (e.g., being on the front line, doing swabs, satisfaction about protective equipment, and management protocols). Assessment of SQ was done using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and various medical errors were recorded. RESULTS A total of 217 HCWs completed the survey with mean (±standard deviation) age of 35.8 (±7.3) years; 56.2% were male, 18.43% had comorbidities, and 61.75% experienced sleep difficulties before the COVID-19 crisis. This work reports a 78.8% prevalence of poor SQ, with the mean (standard deviation) global PSQI score of 9.36 (±4.4). HCWs with poor sleep experienced more positive comorbid profile (23.64% versus 6.52%, p=0.01). Working on the front lines of COVID-19 was associated with poor sleep (69.59% versus 47.83%, p=0.006). Among the participants, 77.42% performed medical errors, particularly not checking for drug allergies (17.97%), dispensing medication with incomplete instructions (20.74%), providing incorrect doses or overdosing (14.75%), incorrectly explaining the use of medication (9.22%), and prescribing a drug to the wrong patient (10.14%). CONCLUSION This nationwide survey reported high prevalence of poor SQ among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being an HCW on the front lines of COVID-19 and doing swabs with a positive comorbidity was associated with poor sleep.","Abbas, Ahmad; Al-Otaibi, Torki; Gheith, Osama Ashry; Nagib, Ayman Maher; Farid, Mahmoud M; Walaa, Mohammad",Turkish thoracic journal,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkthoracj.2021.20245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871338/,408

In in vitro RSV plaque assays, ALN-RSV01 showed a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.7 nM. Sequence analysis of primary isolates of RSV showed that the siRNA target site was absolutely conserved in 89/95 isolates, and ALN-RSV01 demonstrated activity against all isolates, including those with single-mismatch mutations. In vivo, intranasal dosing of ALN-RSV01 in a BALB/c mouse model resulted in potent antiviral efficacy, with 2.5- to 3.0-log-unit reductions in RSV lung concentrations being achieved when ALN-RSV01 was administered prophylactically or therapeutically in both single-dose and multidose regimens. The specificity of ALN-RSV01 was demonstrated in vivo by using mismatch controls; and the absence of an immune stimulatory mechanism was demonstrated by showing that nonspecific siRNAs that induce alpha interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha lack antiviral efficacy, while a chemically modified form of ALN-RSV01 lacking measurable immunostimulatory capacity retained full activity in vivo. Furthermore, an RNA interference mechanism of action was demonstrated by the capture of the site-specific cleavage product of the RSV mRNA via rapid amplification of cDNA ends both in vitro and in vivo. These studies lay a solid foundation for the further investigation of ALN-RSV01 as a novel therapeutic antiviral agent for clinical use by humans.","Alvarez, Rene; Elbashir, Sayda; Borland, Todd; Toudjarska, Ivanka; Hadwiger, Philipp; John, Mathias; Roehl, Ingo; Morskaya, Svetlana Shulga; Martinello, Rick; Kahn, Jeffrey; Van Ranst, Mark; Tripp, Ralph A; DeVincenzo, John P; Pandey, Rajendra; Maier, Martin; Nechev, Lubomir; Manoharan, Muthiah; Kotelianski, Victor; Meyers, Rachel",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00014-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506055/,408

Students (n = 2,026; mean [standard deviation] age = 10.71 years [1.07]; 1,011 [49.9 percent] girls) in Sichuan, China completed a cross-sectional online survey, and this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (IRB ref: HSEARS20190718001). The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities. Parents/caregivers are recommended to monitor their children's use of Internet while encouraging children to engage in positive activities to ease the concern of negative psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; Pakpour, Amir H; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877905/,408
117393,[Mental health assessment of medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia: results of an online survey].,2021,"Bamboo culms are extensively used for structural and decorative purposes. Under certain atmospheric conditions culms can split longitudinally with detrimental effects on their appearance and structural integrity. Here we describe the first ever systematic study of this phenomenon. We tested culms of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys Pubescens), which had been commercially dried to a moisture content of 12.5%. Using a purpose-built environmental chamber, we measured the rate of splitting for ten different test conditions, varying temperature and humidity and testing samples with and without nodes. A 50% probability of splitting after one week was found to be associated with a reduction in moisture content to 8%. We found that splitting was mainly determined by a change in relative humidity, as opposed to absolute humidity. We hypothesised that splitting occurs owing to an incompatibility in shrinkage in the tangential direction during drying, creating tensile residual stress near the outer surface of the culm. Using data from the published literature we developed a simple theoretical model capable of predicting splitting. Higher residual stress was predicted near nodes, which was consistent with our finding that splitting rarely occurs in samples having no nodes. These findings will be useful in the prevention of splitting, through control of the environment or other protective measures.","Hone, Timothy; Cahill, Luke; Robinson, Anthony; Korde, Chaaruchandra; Taylor, David",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.103990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818771/,408
117510,Midwives' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.,2021-03-15,"COVID19 is a devastating global pandemic with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and now the United States. While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss. To that end, less is known about the how the virus may impact different organ systems. The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2. We advocate for higher surveillance and analysis of neuro-complications in infected cases.","Kabbani, Nadine; Olds, James L",Molecular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1124/molpharm.120.000014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238438/,408
117987,"The Spread of COVID-19 in the Italian Population: Anxiety, Depression, and Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms.",2020-06-26,"Each year over 16 million older Americans undergo general anesthesia for surgery, and up to 40% develop postoperative delirium and/or cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Delirium and POCD are each associated with decreased quality of life, early retirement, increased 1-year mortality, and long-term cognitive decline. Multiple investigators have thus suggested that anesthesia and surgery place severe stress on the aging brain, and that patients with less ability to withstand this stress will be at increased risk for developing postoperative delirium and POCD. Delirium and POCD risk are increased in patients with lower preoperative cognitive function, yet preoperative cognitive function is not routinely assessed, and no intraoperative physiological predictors have been found that correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Since general anesthesia causes alpha-band (8-12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) power to decrease occipitally and increase frontally (known as ""anteriorization""), and anesthetic-induced frontal alpha power is reduced in older adults, we hypothesized that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power might correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Here, we provide evidence that such a correlation exists, suggesting that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could be used as a physiological marker to identify older adults with lower preoperative cognitive function. Lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could thus be used to target these at-risk patients for possible therapeutic interventions to help prevent postoperative delirium and POCD, or for increased postoperative monitoring and follow-up. More generally, these results suggest that understanding interindividual differences in how the brain responds to anesthetic drugs can be used as a probe of neurocognitive function (and dysfunction), and might be a useful measure of neurocognitive function in older adults.","Giattino, Charles M; Gardner, Jacob E; Sbahi, Faris M; Roberts, Kenneth C; Cooter, Mary; Moretti, Eugene; Browndyke, Jeffrey N; Mathew, Joseph P; Woldorff, Marty G; Berger, Miles",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533746/,408

As a consequence of this, healthcare providers will be challenged to provide advanced physiological support to preserve human life. Given the mobility and modularity of modern medical systems, the ability to provide critical care outside of the confines of traditional hospitals under such circumstances has become not only a reality and periodic necessity, but an expectation. Austerity amplifies the complexity of providing high-level critical care, because resources are frequently limited, providers are asked to fill unexpected roles determined by necessity, security may be threatened, and the population at risk and their afflictions can be highly diverse. DISCUSSION Our current deployed military medical experience and a review of published literature pertaining to civilian medical disaster response efforts support these stated challenges. The fundamentals of successful critical care practice in unusual settings include proper planning with an emphasis on attention to detail, the careful management of all resources, using the proper equipment, leveraging aeromedical evacuation assets, and employing the right people with the right skills.

118365,Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder: In need of a dose of kindness?,2020-06-15,"OBJECTIVES Transnasal pulmonary aerosol delivery using high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices has become a popular route of aerosol administration in toddlers. Clinically, albuterol is administered using an infusion pump or unit doses. However, little evidence is available to compare the two administration strategies. METHODS A toddler manikin (15 kg) with appropriate anatomic airway was connected with collecting filter to a simulator of distressed breathing. HFNC device with mesh nebulizer placed at the inlet of a humidifier at 37°C, with the gas flow set at 25 and 3.75 L/min. Five milligrams of albuterol was delivered in all experiments. With infusion pump administration, albuterol concentrations of 5 and 1 mg/mL were delivered at 4 and 20 mL/hr for 15 minutes. With unit dose administration, 1 mL (5 mg/mL) and 2 mL (2.5 mg/mL) of albuterol were nebulized. Additional tests with mouth open and nebulizers via mask were using 5 mg/1 mL for mesh nebulizer and 5 mg/3 mL for jet nebulizer (n = 3). The drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS The inhaled dose was higher with unit dose than infusion pump administration with gas flows of 25 L/min (2.66 ± 0.38 vs 1.16 ± 0.28%; P = .004) and 3.75 L/min (10.51 ± 1.29 vs 8.58 ± 0.68%; P = .025). During unit dose administration, compared with closed-mouth breathing, open-mouth breathing generated a higher inhaled dose at 3.75 L/min and lower inhaled dose at 25 L/min. Compared to the nebulizers via mask with both open and closed-mouth breathing, nebulization via HFNC at 3.75 L/min generated greater inhaled dose, while HFNC at 25 L/min generated lower inhaled dose. CONCLUSIONS During transnasal aerosol delivery, the inhaled dose was higher with medication administrated using unit dose than using an infusion pump.","Li, Jie; Wei, Wu; Fink, James B",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31782914/,408

120520,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the quality of sleep by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: A systematic review.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Periprocedural thrombus fragmentation is a relevant risk in endovascular stroke treatment. Because factors influencing its occurrence are largely unknown, this study addresses a potential relationship between thrombus histology and clot stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-five patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with thrombectomy were included in this retrospective study. The number and location of emboli after retrieving the primary thrombus, the number of maneuvers, and TICI scores were evaluated. H&E and neutrophil elastase staining of retrieved clots was performed, and semiquantitative measurements of thrombus components were correlated with procedural parameters. RESULTS An inverse correlation between maneuvers required for thrombus retrieval and the number of distal and intermediate emboli was observed (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Younger patients were at higher risk for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation (Spearman r, -0.23; P = .032). Bridging thrombolysis tended to be associated with fewer maneuvers (2 vs 3, P = .054) but more emboli (1 vs 0, P = .067). While no consistent correlation between procedural parameters and red/white blood cells and fibrin-/platelet fractions could be found, higher amounts of neutrophil elastase-positive cells within the thrombus were independently associated with the occurrence of multiple emboli (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1-19.7; P = .041) and lower rates of complete recanalization (adjusted OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = .050). CONCLUSIONS Younger age, easy-to-retrieve thrombi, and bridging thrombolysis may be risk factors for periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. Findings from standard histologic stains did not provide insight into thrombectomy-relevant thrombus stability. However, higher neutrophil levels in the thrombus tissue were related to an increased risk of periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. This observation aligns with the proposed thrombolytic capacity of neutrophil elastase and points to its potential clinical relevance in the context of stroke thrombectomy.","Kaesmacher, J; Boeckh-Behrens, T; Simon, S; Maegerlein, C; Kleine, J F; Zimmer, C; Schirmer, L; Poppert, H; Huber, T",AJNR.

120682,Smart technology for physical activity and health assessment during COVID-19 lockdown.,2020-10-22,"Background Proper inhaler technique is highly relevant to the effective management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The tiotropium bromide spray (TBS) (Spiriva® Respimat®) is a soft mist inhaler (SMI) preferred by patients to pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) because of its convenience in use. However, the technique of using TBS inhaler in the real world is unclear. Objective To evaluate techniques in using TBS inhaler and investigate the association between the patient characteristics and the correct use of TBS inhaler. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 74 COPD patients who used TBS inhaler device for more than 3 months. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. The technique of using TBS inhaler was evaluated step by step. Incorrect use was defined as the patient's inability to complete the key steps in the inhalation manoeuvre. The percentage of incorrect use was compared between the groups. Risk factors related to incorrect use were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 74 participants, only 2 (2.7%) patients completed all the steps correctly, and 48 (64.9%) patients misused the key steps in the inhalation manoeuvre. Incorrect preparation of the TBS inhaler for the first use was the most frequently misused step, accounting for 77.0%. Factors associated with misuse of TBS inhaler included the educational background (p=0.010), living state (p=0.031) and COPD assessment test (CAT) score (p=0.005) of the patients. Additionally, logistic regression analysis showed that the COPD duration was significantly associated with the incorrect use (p=0.019). Compared with patients with a higher educational background, patients with an elementary school background [OR 11652.99, CI: 22.72-5975697.72], junior high school background [OR 7187.78, CI: 16.41-3146787] and high school background [OR 1563, CI: 4.27-572329.67] were more likely to misuse TBS inhaler. Patients living with their spouses alone were also more likely to commit errors in using TBS inhaler as compared with those living with their children [OR 12.29, CI of 1.14-1.96]. Clinical factors like the COPD symptoms were relative to the technical use of the device. Better technique was accompanied by a lower CAT score [OR 1.49, CI of 1.14-1.96]. Conclusion The incorrect use of TBS inhaler was common in COPD patients. Healthcare providers should not only teach the patients about the drug preparation but help them use the inhaler correctly. Special attention should be paid to patients with a short COPD duration and a low educational background and those who live without the company of their children. Proper use of TBS inhaler can significantly improve the symptom control of COPD patients.","Zhang, Wei; Xu, Lili; Gao, Shen; Ding, Nan; Shu, Ping; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Yuping",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s253338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32606655/,408
120745,Social Isolation and Self-Reported Cognitive Decline Among Older Adults in Japan: A Longitudinal Study in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND Incidence rates of pediatric cancers in the United States are typically reported in 5-year age groups, obscuring variation by single year of age. Additionally, racial and ethnic variation in incidence is typically presented in broad categories rather than by narrow age ranges. METHODS The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data (2000-2017) were examined to calculate frequencies and age-adjusted incidence rates among individuals aged birth to 39 years. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated as the measure of association for rate comparisons by race and Hispanic origin overall and by single year of age. RESULTS Several histologic types showed substantial variation in race/ethnicity-specific and overall rates by single year of age. Overall, Black children and young adults experienced substantially decreased incidence of acute lymphoid leukemia (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.49-0.55) compared to Whites, and this decreased incidence was strongest at ages 1 through 7 years and 16 through 20 years. Hispanic individuals experienced decreased overall incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (IRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.48-0.52) and astrocytoma (IRR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.52-0.56) and increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.42-1.51) compared to non-Hispanic Whites, and the increased risk was strongest at ages 10 through 23 years. Substantial decreased risk across many tumor types was also observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives. CONCLUSIONS Examination of incidence rates for pediatric cancers by narrow age groups may provide insights regarding etiological differences in subgroups. Additionally, variation in age-specific incidence rates by race and ethnicity may enable hypothesis generation on drivers of disparities observed.","Marcotte, Erin L; Domingues, Allison M; Sample, Jeannette M; Richardson, Michaela R; Spector, Logan G",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151418/,408

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family Circoviridae. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem-loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6%) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis indicated that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 novel species that belong to the family Circoviridae.","Ge, Xingyi; Li, Jialu; Peng, Cheng; Wu, Lijun; Yang, Xinglou; Wu, Yongquan; Zhang, Yunzhi; Shi, Zhengli",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.034108-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21795473/,408

METHODS Overall, 193 patients with adenomyosis included in this study were categorized into three groups: adenomyomectomy (n = 57, group 1), adenomyomectomy + GnRH-a (n = 83, group 2) and adenomyomectomy + GnRH-a + LNG-IUS (n = 53, group 3). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores and uterine volumes were determined to evaluate the severity of adenomyosis. Dysmenorrhea improvement and uterine volume were the main outcomes. RESULTS The VAS scores of all patients reduced from 7.3 (6.0, 8.5) to 0 (0, 0.6) at the 6 months after surgery, which were significantly higher in group 1 compared to other groups (P < 0.05). In groups 1, 2 and 3, there were 14, 7 and 4 patients, respectively, who suffered dysmenorrhea recurrence. The mean recurrent-free-survival (RFS) was 51.6 ± 2.4, 58.0 ± 1.2 and 58.3 ± 1.0 months, respectively, which was significantly shorter in group 1 (P < 0.05). The dysmenorrhea recurrences were 26.3%, 6.1%, 5.9% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, at the 36 months, which was significantly higher in group 1 (P < 0.01).

In archived formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded lung samples from 68 cases with the clinical and histologic diagnosis of pneumonia the histological pattern of pneumonia was re-evaluated and the samples were further investigated for the following infectious agents: canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica, Pasteurella (P.) multocida, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. In 47.1% of the samples at least one of the featured respiratory pathogens was detected. In 31.3% of these positive samples more than one pathogen could be found. The correct detection of CDV had been achieved in ten out of eleven positive cases (90.9%) upon initial investigation, but the presence of bacterial pathogens, like B. bronchiseptica (10 cases) and P. multocida (17 cases) had been missed in all but one case. While CDV and CRCoV infections were exclusively found in dogs younger than one year, the vast majority of infections with P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica were both common either in dogs younger than 4 months or older than one year. Thus, this retrospective approach yielded valuable data on the presence, absence and prevalence of certain respiratory pathogens in dogs with pneumonia.","Wöhrer, Daniela; Spergser, Joachim; Bagrinovschi, Gabriela; Möstl, Karin; Weissenböck, Herbert",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/004.2016.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919147/,408

RECENT FINDINGS Some BA, as a single medication or as combined therapy to food or venom immunotherapy, are effectively able to reduce most of the severe anaphylactic reactions. SUMMARY Anaphylaxis is a recognized clinical emergency, which requires prompt identification and treatment. Several biologic therapies and new devices are emerging as a potential preventive treatment for anaphylaxis. However, adrenaline (epinephrine) is still the first-line treatment for any type of anaphylaxis. Biological drugs, such as omalizumab, whereas not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved for anaphylaxis, have been used as therapeutic adjuvants in the preventive treatment of anaphylaxis, but cost-effectiveness should be considered individually.","Tanno, Luciana Kase; Demoly, Pascal",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0000000000000737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625038/,408

The stochastic theory of chromatography has been postulated as a suitable basis to achieve this goal. Here, we implement Dondi and Cavazzini's Monte Carlo framework that utilizes experimentally accessible single molecule kinetics and use it to correlate heterogenous adsorption statistics at the stationary phase to shifts in asymmetry. The contributions cannot be captured or modeled through ensemble chemometrics. Simulations reveal that peak asymmetry scales non-linearly with longer analyte-stationary phase interactions and migrates towards symmetry across the column length, even without column overloading.","Bishop, Logan D C; Misiura, Anastasiia; Moringo, Nicholas A; Landes, Christy F",Journal of chromatography.

The reactivity of n-TiO2 increases with light exposure, and the photocatalytic effects have been shown on cultures of bacteria and microalgae in the laboratory. The purpose of this study was to assess the response of natural bacterial and microalgal communities associated with marine aggregates to n-TiO2 under conditions similar to those found in the photic zone of nearshore waters. Nano and bulk TiO2 particles were incorporated into marine aggregates over 4 days under two light conditions: 6:18 and 0:24 (hours light:dark).

To reduce its transmission, a number of strategies have been proposed. In this study, mathematical models with nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions were formulated and analyzed. The first model was formulated without the inclusion of community awareness. The analysis focused on investigating the mathematical behavior of the model, which can explain how medical masks, medical treatment, and rapid testing can be used to suppress the spread of COVID-19. In the second model, community awareness was taken into account, and all the interventions considered were represented as time-dependent parameters. Using the center-manifold theorem, we showed that both models exhibit forward bifurcation. The infection parameters were obtained by fitting the model to COVID-19 incidence data from three provinces in Indonesia, namely, Jakarta, West Java, and East Java. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential parameters on the number of new infections and the basic reproduction number. We found that the use of medical masks has the greatest effect in determining the number of new infections. The optimal control problem from the second model was characterized using the well-known Pontryagin's maximum principle and solved numerically. The results of a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that community awareness plays a crucial role in determining the success of COVID-19 eradication programs.","Aldila, Dipo; Ndii, Meksianis Z; Samiadji, Brenda M",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378859/,408

This infection runs in three major stages: a mild cold-like illness, a moderate respiratory syndrome and a severe acute interstitial pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a more benign evolution in children. As a matter of fact, low susceptibility and minor aggressivity have been highlighted in most cases. There are currently no effective antiviral drugs treatment for the affected children. No sufficient results have been reached by the use of interferon (IFN), lopinavir/ritonavir, orbidol, and oseltamivir in the treatment of the coronaviruses infection.

This temperature was measured by fabricating gold nanodisks down to 20 nm in diameter and 10 nm in thickness on mica and sapphire surfaces. The melting and vaporization of these nanodisks were used to determine this temperature according to the known gold nanocluster melting temperature variations as a function of their volume.

In vitro studies reported that ARS has anticancer effects; however, its detrimental action on cancer cells may also play a role in its toxicity toward normal cells and its potential toxicity has not been sufficiently researched. In this study, we investigated the possible cytotoxic effects using normal BRL-3A and AML12 liver cells. The results showed that ARS dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and arrested the G0/G1 phase cell cycle in both BRL-3A and AML12 liver cells. Western blotting demonstrated that ARS induced a significant downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), CDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in various levels and then caused apoptosis when the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased. Conversely, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine can significantly inhibit cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by ARS. Thus, the data confirmed that ARS exposure impairs normal liver cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and this detrimental action may be associated with intracellular ROS accumulation. Collectively, the possible side effects of ARS on healthy normal cells cannot be neglected when developing therapies.","Yin, S; Yang, H; Zhao, X; Wei, S; Tao, Y; Liu, M; Bo, R; Li, J",Human & experimental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0960327120937331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633561/,408
131851,How New York City Health + Hospitals System-Wide Special Pathogens Program Responded to COVID-19.,2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND Micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides a noninvasive way to evaluate the effects of genetic and/or pharmacological modulation on sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)-mediated radionuclide accumulation in mouse thyroid and salivary glands. However, parameters affecting image acquisition and analysis of mouse thyroids and salivary glands have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of region-of-interest (ROI) selection, collimation, scan time, and imaging orbit on image acquisition and quantification of thyroidal and salivary radionuclide accumulation in mice. METHODS The effects of data window minima and maxima on thyroidal and salivary ROI selection using a visual boundary method were examined in SPECT images acquired from mice injected with (123)I NaI. The effects of collimation, scan time, and imaging orbit on counting linearity and signal intensity were investigated using phantoms filled with various activities of (123)I NaI or Tc-99m pertechnetate. Spatial resolution of target organs in whole-animal images was compared between circular orbit with parallel-hole collimation and spiral orbit with five-pinhole collimation. Lastly, the inter-experimental variability of the same mouse scanned multiple times was compared with the intra-experimental variability among different mice scanned at the same time. RESULTS Thyroid ROI was separated from salivary glands by empirically increasing the data window maxima. Counting linearity within the range of 0.5-14.2 μCi was validated by phantom imaging using single- or multiple-pinhole collimators with circular or spiral imaging orbit. Scanning time could be shortened to 15 minutes per mouse without compromising counting linearity despite proportionally decreased signal intensity. Whole-animal imaging using a spiral orbit with five-pinhole collimators achieved a high spatial resolution and counting linearity. Finally, the extent of inter-experimental variability of NIS-mediated radionuclide accumulation in the thyroid and salivary glands by SPECT imaging in the same mouse was less than the magnitude of variability among the littermates. CONCLUSIONS The impacts of multiple variables and experimental designs on micro-SPECT imaging and quantification of radionuclide accumulation in mouse thyroid and salivary glands can be minimized. This platform will serve as an invaluable tool to screen for pharmacologic reagents that differentially modulate thyroidal and salivary radioiodine accumulation in preclinical mouse models.","Brandt, Michael P; Kloos, Richard T; Shen, Daniel H; Zhang, Xiaoli; Liu, Yu-Yu; Jhiang, Sissy M",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2011.0348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22540327/,408

Japanese citizens lost a means of transportation to return back to Japan. The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) helped the operation of charter flights for evacuation of Japanese residents from Hubei Province, and this article outlines our experiences. A total of five charter flights were dispatched, and the majority of returnees (793/829 [95.7%]) were handled at NCGM. A large number of personnel from various departments participated in this operation; 107 physicians, 115 nurses, 110 clerical staff, and 45 laboratory technicians in total. Several medical translators were also involved. In this operation, we conducted airborne precautions in addition to contact precautions. Eye shields were also used. The doctors collecting the pharyngeal swab used a coverall to minimize the risk of body surface contamination from secretions and droplets. Enhanced hand hygiene using alcohol hand sanitizer was performed. Forty-eight persons were ultimately hospitalized after the triage at NCGM operation, which was more than the number of persons triaged at the airport (n = 34). Of those hospitalized after NCGM triage, 8.3% (4/48 patients) ultimately tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, significantly higher than the positive rate among subjects not triaged (4/48 [8.3%] vs. 9/745 [1.2%]: p = 0.0057).

Additionally, B. bronchiseptica is capable of establishing long-term or chronic infections in swine. Bacterial biofilms are increasingly recognized as important contributors to chronic bacterial infections. Recently the polysaccharide locus bpsABCD has been demonstrated to serve a critical role in the development of mature biofilms formed by the sequenced laboratory strain of B. bronchiseptica We hypothesized that swine isolates would also have the ability to form mature biofilms and the bpsABCD locus would serve a key role in this process. A mutant containing an in-frame deletion of the bpsABCD structural genes was constructed in a wild-type swine isolate and found to be negative for poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)-like material by immunoblot assay. Further, the bpsABCD locus was found to be required for the development and maintenance of the three-dimensional structures under continuous-flow conditions. To investigate the contribution of the bpsABCD locus to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, the KM22Δbps mutant was compared to the wild-type swine isolate for the ability to colonize and cause disease in pigs. The bpsABCD locus was found to not be required for persistence in the upper respiratory tract of swine. Additionally, the bpsABCD locus did not affect the development of anti-Bordetella humoral immunity, did not contribute to disease severity, and did not mediate protection from complement-mediated killing. However, the bpsABCD locus was found to enhance survival in the lower respiratory tract of swine.","Nicholson, Tracy L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Sukumar, Neelima; Paharik, Alexandra E; Lister, Jessica L; Horswill, Alexander R; Kehrli, Marcus E; Loving, Crystal L; Shore, Sarah M; Deora, Rajendar",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00261-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559403/,408

Bamlanivimab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2, may confer rapid protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Objective To determine the effect of bamlanivimab on the incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, phase 3 trial that enrolled residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. A total of 1175 participants enrolled in the study from August 2 to November 20, 2020. Database lock was triggered on January 13, 2021, when all participants reached study day 57. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab, 4200 mg (n = 588), or placebo (n = 587). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incidence of COVID-19, defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and mild or worse disease severity within 21 days of detection, within 8 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate or worse COVID-19 severity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results The prevention population comprised a total of 966 participants (666 staff and 300 residents) who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology (mean age, 53.0 [range, 18-104] years; 722 [74.7%] women). Bamlanivimab significantly reduced the incidence of COVID-19 in the prevention population compared with placebo (8.5% vs 15.2%; odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.28-0.68]; P < .001; absolute risk difference, -6.6 [95% CI, -10.7 to -2.6] percentage points). Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57; all occurred in the placebo group. Among 1175 participants who received study product (safety population), the rate of participants with adverse events was 20.1% in the bamlanivimab group and 18.9% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (reported by 12 participants [2%] who received bamlanivimab and 14 [2.4%] who received placebo) and hypertension (reported by 7 participants [1.2%] who received bamlanivimab and 10 [1.7%] who received placebo). Conclusions and Relevance Among residents and staff in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, treatment during August-November 2020 with bamlanivimab monotherapy reduced the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to assess preventive efficacy with current patterns of viral strains with combination monoclonal antibody therapy.

Telemedicine increases options for health care access, but a ""digital divide"" of disparate access may prevent certain populations from realizing the benefits of telemedicine. OBJECTIVES The study aimed to understand telemedicine utilization patterns after a widespread deployment to identify potential disparities exacerbated by expanded telemedicine usage. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of adults who scheduled outpatient visits between June 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 at a single-integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties and a large geographic region in the Upper Midwest, during a period of time after the initial surge of COVID-19 when most standard clinical services had resumed. At the beginning of this study period, approximately 72% of provider visits were telemedicine visits. The primary study outcome was whether a patient had one or more video-based visits, compared with audio-only (telephone) visits or in-person visits only. The secondary outcome was whether a patient had any telemedicine visits (video-based or audio-only), compared with in-person visits only. RESULTS A total of 197,076 individuals were eligible (average age = 46 years, 56% females). Increasing age, rural status, Asian or Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and self-pay/uninsured status were significantly negatively associated with having a video visit. Digital literacy, measured by patient portal activation status, was significantly positively associated with having a video visit, as were Medicaid or Medicare as payer and American Indian/Alaskan Native race. CONCLUSION Our findings reinforce previous evidence that older age, rural status, lower socioeconomic status, Asian race, Black/African American race, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are associated with lower rates of video-based telemedicine use. Health systems and policies should seek to mitigate such barriers to telemedicine when possible, with efforts such as digital literacy outreach and equitable distribution of telemedicine infrastructure.","Hsiao, Vivian; Chandereng, Thevaa; Lankton, Robin L; Huebner, Jeffrey A; Baltus, Jeffrey J; Flood, Grace E; Dean, Shannon M; Tevaarwerk, Amye J; Schneider, David F",Applied clinical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1730026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107542/,408

We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of RFA for HCC located in the caudate lobe compared with HCC located elsewhere in the liver. METHODS Overall, 555 consecutive patients treated by RFA for a single HCC tumor of less than 3 cm diameter, were enrolled in this study, including 20 patients with HCC located in the caudate lobe. Among these 20 patients, HCC was located in the Spiegel lobe in eight patients, in the paracaval portion in another 10 and in the caudate process in two. We evaluated differences in the local recurrence rate and the incidence of complications associated with RFA between the caudate and the non-caudate groups. RESULTS The 4-year cumulative local recurrence rate after RFA in the caudate group and the non-caudate group was 22.3% and 4.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis of factors affecting local recurrence demonstrated that tumor size and tumor location (caudate or non-caudate) were independent significant factors. No postoperative complications were observed in the caudate group, whereas 15 patients (2.8%) in the non-caudate group experienced complications related to RFA. CONCLUSION We were able to safely treat HCC located in the caudate lobe by RFA. However, there was a high incidence of local recurrence, presumably because of the heat sink effect of the inferior vena cava and the restricted puncture approach. We should pursue a revised method to reduce local recurrence.","Nishigaki, Youichi; Tomita, Eiichi; Hayashi, Hideki; Suzuki, Yusuke; Iritani, Soichi; Kato, Tomohiro; Yamada, Tetsuya",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1872-034x.2012.01095.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072582/,408

METHODS Fifty-eight consecutive patients (M/F = 28/30; median age, 53 years) harbouring 68 aneurysms (ruptured/unruptured = 12/56) underwent treatment with Solitaire™ AB stent(s) implantation between April 2010 and August 2011 in our institution. The data were retrospectively reviewed and analysed. RESULTS The technical success rate of Solitaire™ AB stenting was 100%. The rates of the overall and the treatment-related adverse events were 9% (6/68) and 6% (4/68), respectively, and the recurrent rate was 1% (1/68). All of the adverse events (n = 6) occurred in tiny (n = 1, ≤3 mm) or small (n = 5, >3 to ≤10 mm) aneurysms. The majority (75%, 3/4) of thromboembolic events (thrombus, n = 2; infarction, n = 2) occurred in ruptured lesions, and 2 intraprocedural aneurysm ruptures occurred in the course of coiling when the stent(s) was/were applied within 6 months. Subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAH, p<0.05) and immediate occlusion grades (p<0.05) were predictors for overall adverse events by univariate analysis. Compared with the immediate post-treatment angiographic results, the follow-up angiographic imaging (mean, 13 months; range, 6-25 months) revealed that stent(s) implantation enhanced the rate of class I occlusion from 34% (23/68) to 93% (63/68). SAH was the only predictor for unfavourable outcomes (the modified Rankin Scale score [mRS], 2-6) during the mean 19-month (range, 12-27 months) of clinical follow-ups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although the complete obliteration of tiny and small aneurysms without complications remains a challenge, stent(s) implantation could lead to further occlusion of incompletely coiled aneurysms. SAH and the occlusion grade were the primary predictors for adverse events. SAH was the only predictor for unfavourable outcomes by univariate analysis.","Zhao, Kai-Jun; Zhang, Yong-Wei; Xu, Yi; Hong, Bo; Huang, Qing-Hai; Zhao, Wen-Yuan; Yang, Peng-Fei; Liu, Jian-Min",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23468947/,408
136463,COVID-19 and the Health Workforce.,2020-10-31,"INTRODUCTION Recently it has been suggested that patients with both depression and a family history of dementia are seven times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as are controls. METHOD Fifty patients aged 21 - 60 years suffering from DSM-IV Major Depression entered the study; three of them (6%) had a positive family history of dementia. Diagnosis was by SCAN v 2.0. The family history method was used to record family history. All depressed patients were investigated with the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST), brain SPECT, electro-oculogram (EOG), flash-electroretinogram (f-ERG) and Pattern-Reversal Visual Evoked Potentials (PR-VEPs). Student's t-test was used to analyse the results. All patients with positive family history had atypical features. RESULTS Two of them suffered from borderline personality disorder, in comparison to eight in the remainder of the sample and five in the rest of the atypicals. The age of onset of depression was lower. DST, SPECT, EOG and PR-VEPs findings were similar between groups. The only significant finding concerned the latency of the bs wave of the scotopic ERG (P < 0.01), but even in this, patients with positive history did not differ from the rest of the atypical patients. CONCLUSION The present study provided limited data connecting atypical features of depression, personality traits, psychological stressors, hypercortisolaemia and family history of dementia.

Our purpose was to evaluate the anxiety and depression in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients during the pandemic and to analyse the influencing factors. We conducted an online questionnaire survey among 307 SCA patients from China and selected 319 healthy people matched by sex and age as the control group. The questionnaire included general information, the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and the self-rating depression scale (SDS). The relevant factors included COVID-19 risk factors, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), educational background, disease course, score on the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). The proportion of SCA patients with anxiety was 34.9%, and the proportion with depression was 56.7%. The SAS and SDS scores of the SCA patients were significantly higher than those of the control group (SAS: 45.8 ± 10.1 vs. 40.6 ± 8.9, P < 0.01; SDS: 55.1 ± 12.2 vs. 43.6 ± 11.9, P < 0.01). In SCA3, the risk of exposure to COVID-19, educational level, disease course and the severity of ataxia may be factors affecting patients' mental health. More attention should be paid to the mental health of SCA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gong, Yiqing; Chen, Zhao; Liu, Mingjie; Wan, Linlin; Wang, Chunrong; Peng, Huirong; Shi, Yuting; Peng, Yun; Xia, Kun; Qiu, Rong; Tang, Beisha; Jiang, Hong",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2021.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992201/,408

The mechanism by which pseudoknots trigger -1 PRF, however, remains controversial, with several competing models. Recent work showed that high -1 PRF efficiency was linked to high pseudoknot conformational plasticity via the formation of alternate conformers. We tested whether pseudoknots bound with an anti-frameshifting ligand exhibited a similar correlation between conformational plasticity and -1 PRF efficiency by measuring the effects of a ligand that was found to inhibit -1 PRF in the SARS coronavirus on the conformational dynamics of the SARS pseudoknot. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy to unfold pseudoknots mechanically, we found that the ligand binding effectively abolished the formation of alternate conformers. This result extends the connection between -1 PRF and conformational dynamics and, moreover, suggests that targeting the conformational dynamics of pseudoknots may be an effective strategy for anti-viral drug design.","Ritchie, Dustin B; Soong, Jingchyuan; Sikkema, William K A; Woodside, Michael T",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/ja410344b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446874/,408

In contrast, 3D-DSA provides volumetric information from a single injection but neglects temporal information. Four-dimensional-DSA (4D-DSA) combines temporal information of 2D-DSA with volumetric information of 3D-DSA to provide time-resolved tomographic 3D reconstructions, potentially reducing procedure time and radiation. This work evaluates the diagnostic quality of virtual single-frame 4D-DSA relative to 2D-DSA images by assessing clinicians' ability to evaluate cerebrovascular pathology. METHODS Single-frame images of four projections from 4D-DSA and their corresponding 2D-DSA images (n = 15) were rated by two neurointerventional radiologists. Images were graded based on diagnostic quality (0 = non-diagnostic, 1 = poor, 2 = acceptable, 3 = good). Dose area product (DAP) for each case was recorded for all 2D-DSA, 4D-DSA acquisitions, and the overall procedure. RESULTS The mean diagnostic quality of all four 4D-DSA projections from both raters was 1.75 while the mean of 2D-DSA projections was 2.8. Student's t-test revealed significant difference in diagnostic quality between 4D-DSA and 2D-DSA at all four projections (p < 0.001). On average 4D-DSA acquisitions accounted for 30% dose compared to the overall average aggregated dose per procedure. CONCLUSIONS The difference in image quality between virtual single-frame 4D-DSA and their respective 2D-DSA images is statistically significant. Furthermore, 4D-DSA acquisitions require less radiation dose than conventional procedures with 2D-DSA acquisitions.","Yu, Jay F; Pung, Leland; Minami, Hataka; Mueller, Kerstin; Khangura, Rajkamal; Darflinger, Robert; Hetts, Steven W; Cooke, Daniel L","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920961604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985291/,408

As coagulopathy is an important contributor to the secondary destruction of nervous tissue, we hypothesized that PROG and ALLO administration may also have a beneficial effect on coagulation protein expression after TBI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given bilateral contusions of the medial frontal cortex followed by treatments with PROG (16 mg/kg), ALLO (8 mg/kg), or vehicle (22.5% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin). Controls received no injury or injections. Progesterone generally maintained procoagulant (thrombin, fibrinogen, and coagulation factor XIII), whereas ALLO increased anticoagulant protein expression (tissue-type plasminogen activator, tPA). In addition, PROG significantly increased the ratio of tPA bound to neuroserpin, a serine protease inhibitor that can reduce the activity of tPA. Our findings suggest that in a model of TBI, where blood loss may exacerbate injury, it may be preferable to treat patients with PROG, whereas it might be more appropriate to use ALLO as a treatment for thrombotic stroke, where a reduction in coagulation would be more beneficial.","VanLandingham, Jacob W; Cekic, Milos; Cutler, Sarah M; Hoffman, Stuart W; Washington, Ebony R; Johnson, Sarah J; Miller, Darren; Stein, Donald G",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2008.73; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18628783/,408
140964,Eating disorders and type 1 diabetes.,2021-06-21,"INTRODUCTION Patients with COVID-19 ARDS require significant amounts of sedation and analgesic medications which can lead to longer hospital/ICU length of stay, delirium, and has been associated with increased mortality. Tracheostomy has been shown to decrease the amount of sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic medications given to patients. The goal of this study was to assess whether tracheostomy decreased sedation and analgesic medication usage, improved markers of activity level and cognitive function, and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective registry of patients with COVID-19 ARDS who underwent tracheostomy creation at the University of Pennsylvania Health System or the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 3/2020 to 12/2020. Patients were grouped into the early (≤14 days, n = 31) or late (15 + days, n = 97) tracheostomy groups and outcome data collected. RESULTS 128 patients had tracheostomies performed at a mean of 19.4 days, with 66% performed percutaneously at bedside. Mean hourly dose of fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol were all significantly reduced 48-h after tracheostomy: fentanyl (48-h pre-tracheostomy: 94.0 mcg/h, 48-h post-tracheostomy: 64.9 mcg/h, P = .000), midazolam (1.9 mg/h pre vs. 1.2 mg/h post, P = .0012), and propofol (23.3 mcg/kg/h pre vs. 8.4 mcg/kg/h post, P = .0121). There was a significant improvement in mobility score and Glasgow Coma Scale in the 48-h pre- and post-tracheostomy. Comparing the early and late groups, the mean fentanyl dose in the 48-h pre-tracheostomy was significantly higher in the late group than the early group (116.1 mcg/h vs. 35.6 mcg/h, P = .03). ICU length of stay was also shorter in the early group (37.0 vs. 46.2 days, P = .012). INTERPRETATION This data supports a reduction in sedative and analgesic medications administered and improvement in cognitive and physical activity in the 48-h period post-tracheostomy in COVID-19 ARDS. Further, early tracheostomy may lead to significant reductions in intravenous opiate medication administration, and ICU LOS.","Kapp, Christopher M; Latifi, Ardian; Feller-Kopman, David; Atkins, Joshua H; Ben Or, Esther; Dibardino, David; Haas, Andrew R; Thiboutot, Jeffrey; Hutchinson, Christoph T",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211045896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636705/,408

Ground NO2 mapping with high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for fine-scale air pollution and environmental health research. We thus developed a spatiotemporal regression kriging model to map daily high-resolution (3-km) ground NO2 concentrations in China using the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite retrievals and geographical covariates. This model combined geographically and temporally weighted regression with spatiotemporal kriging and achieved robust prediction performance with sample-based and site-based cross-validation R2 values of 0.84 and 0.79. The annual mean and standard deviation of ground NO2 concentrations from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019 were predicted to be 15.05 ± 7.82 μg/m3, with that in 0.6% of China's area (10% of the population) exceeding the annual air quality standard (40 μg/m3). The ground NO2 concentrations during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period (January and February in 2020) was 14% lower than that during the same period in 2019 and the mean population exposure to ground NO2 was reduced by 25%. This study was the first to use TROPOMI retrievals to map fine-scale daily ground NO2 concentrations across all of China. This was also an early application to use the satellite-estimated ground NO2 data to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the air pollution and population exposures. These newly satellite-derived ground NO2 data with high spatiotemporal resolution have value in advancing environmental and health research in China.","Wu, Sensen; Huang, Bo; Wang, Jionghua; He, Lijie; Wang, Zhongyi; Yan, Zhen; Lao, Xiangqian; Zhang, Feng; Liu, Renyi; Du, Zhenhong",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477063/,408

Those with a lifelong passion for evidence-based policy (EBP) have lauded Australia's and other nations' policy responses to COVID-19 as a breakthrough moment for the cause. This article reflects on the complexity of the public policy process, the perspectives of its various actors, and draws on Alford's work on the Blue, Red and Purple zones to propose a more nuanced approach to advocacy for EBP in health. We contend that the pathway for translation of research evidence into routine clinical practice is relatively linear, in contrast to the more complex course for translation of evidence to public policy - much to the frustration of health researchers and EBP advocates. Cairney's description of the characteristics of successful policy entrepreneurs offers useful guidance to advance EBP and we conclude with proposing some practical mechanisms to support it. Finally, we recommend that researchers and policy makers spend more time in the Purple zone to enable a deeper understanding of, and mutual respect for, the unique contributions made by research, policy and political actors to sound public policy.","Cormack, Mark; Boxall, Anne-Marie; Hullick, Carolyn; Booth, Mark; Gruen, Russell L",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,https://doi.org/10.1071/ah21016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517976/,408

They were divided into two groups based on age: the middle age group (MA) included 1148 total participants, 515 men and 633 women from 40-59 years old; the older age group (OA) included 1737 total participants, 683 men and 1054 women from 60-79 years old. MetS was diagnosed according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program and the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP-ATP III). Logistic regression was conducted to calculate the odds ratio for MetS prevalence. Results The prevalence of MetS in people with AL increased 1.432-fold in the MA men group, 1.511-fold in the OA men group, 1.546-fold in the MA women group, and 1.565-fold in the OA women group. There were several causes of AL; people with physical activity for diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased MetS prevalence in both sexes and all age groups: MA men group (OR=3.216, 95% CI=1.852-7.354, P=0.034), MA women group (OR=2.159, 95% CI=1.854-5.346, P=0.032), OA men group (OR=3.200, 95% CI=1.235-7.841, P=0.009), and OA women group (OR=3.444, 95% CI=1.310-6.627, P=0.008).

Due to the extremely small pulsational excursions (<0.1 mm in diameter), exact segmentation of the aneurysms is of critical importance. In vitro examinations have shown improvement of the accuracy of vessel delineation by iterative reconstruction methods. We hypothesized that this improvement shows a measurable effect on aneurysm pulsations in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients with cerebral aneurysms underwent 4D-CTA. Images were reconstructed with filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction. The following parameters were compared between both groups: image noise, absolute aneurysm volumes, pulsatility, and sharpness of aneurysm edges. RESULTS In iterative reconstruction images, noise was significantly reduced (mean, 9.8 ± 4.0 Hounsfield units versus 8.0 ± 2.5 Hounsfield units; P = .04), but the sharpness of aneurysm edges just missed statistical significance (mean, 3.50 ± 0.49 mm versus 3.42 ± 0.49 mm; P = .06). Absolute volumes (mean, 456.1 ± 775.2 mm(3) versus 461.7 ± 789.9 mm(3); P = .31) and pulsatility (mean, 1.099 ± 0.088 mm(3) versus 1.095 ± 0.082 mm(3); P = .62) did not show a significant difference between iterative reconstruction and filtered back-projection images. CONCLUSIONS CT images reconstructed with iterative reconstruction methods show a tendency toward shorter vessel edges but do not affect absolute aneurysm volumes or pulsatility measurements in vivo.","Illies, T; Säring, D; Kinoshita, M; Fujinaka, T; Bester, M; Fiehler, J; Tomiyama, N; Watanabe, Y",AJNR.

Clinical variables including age, gender, type of surgery, indications, and complications were obtained and analyzed. Principal outcome measures were length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and rate of readmission. RESULTS Four hundred eighteen patients underwent thyroid surgery during the study period. Two hundred eight were accomplished on an outpatient basis, 128 patients were observed under a 23-hour status, and 82 were admitted for a mean of 2.9 days (the latter two cohorts were grouped together and designated as inpatients). There were four complications in the outpatient group (1.9%) and 28 (13.3%) in the inpatient group (P < .001). Four individuals in the outpatient group (1.9%) required readmission compared with 5.7% (12/210) of those in the inpatient group, most commonly for transient hypocalcemia. CONCLUSIONS The initial favorable experience with outpatient thyroid surgery has been validated in this expanded patient population of more than 200 patients. In rare instances, readmission may be required secondary to transient hypocalcemia. Modern surgical techniques, avoidance of drains, and prophylactic calcium supplementation have combined to make outpatient thyroidectomy safe in carefully selected patients.","Seybt, Melanie W; Terris, David J",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.20866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20422690/,408
144610,A Bird's Eye View From Below: Activity in the Temporo-Parietal Junction Predicts From-Above Necker Cube Percepts.,2020-10-15,"Importance A lower dose of intravenous alteplase appears to be a safer treatment option than the standard dose, reducing the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. There is uncertainty, however, over how this effect translates into an overall clinical benefit for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Objective To assess whether older, Asian, or severely affected patients with AIS who are considered at high risk of thrombolysis may benefit more from low-dose rather than standard-dose alteplase treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants This study is a prespecified secondary analysis of the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED), an international, randomized, open-label, blinded, end-point clinical trial of low-dose vs standard-dose intravenous alteplase for patients with AIS. From March 1, 2012, to August 31, 2015, a total of 3310 patients who had a clinical diagnosis of AIS as confirmed by brain imaging and who fulfilled the local criteria for thrombolysis treatment were included in the alteplase-dose arms. Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-dose (0.6 mg/kg; 15% as bolus and 85% as infusion over 1 hour) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg; 10% as bolus and 90% as infusion over 1 hour) alteplase. Of the 3310 randomized patients, 13 patients were excluded for missing consent, mistaken randomization, and duplicate randomization numbers. This secondary analysis was conducted between May 1, 2016, and April 28, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was a poor outcome defined by the combination of death and any disability as scored by the modified Rankin Scale (scores range from 2 to 6, with the highest score indicating death) at 90 days. Results Of the 3297 patients included in the analysis, 1248 (37.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 67 (13) years. No significant differences in the treatment effects were observed between low- and standard-dose alteplase for poor outcomes (death or disability) by age, ethnicity, or severity (all P > .37 for interaction). Similarly, the treatment effects of low- vs standard-dose alteplase on function outcome (ordinal shift of the modified Rankin Scale) in Asians (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.22) was consistent with non-Asians (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76-1.14) (P = .32 for interaction). There were generally consistent reductions in rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage with low-dose alteplase, although this reduction was not statistically significant by age, ethnicity, or severity. Conclusions and Relevance This analysis found that the effects of low-dose alteplase were not clearly superior to the effects of standard-dose alteplase on death or disability in key demographic subgroups of patients with AIS. Further investigation is required to identify patients with AIS who may benefit from low-dose alteplase.

This success has been attributed to a defect of sorts: high mutation rates (low fidelity) resulting in mutant swarms that allow rapid selection for fitness in new environments. Studies of viruses with small RNA genomes have identified fidelity determinants in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and have shown that RNA viruses likely replicate within a limited fidelity range to maintain fitness. In this review we compare the fidelity of small RNA viruses with that of the largest RNA viruses, the coronaviruses. Coronaviruses encode the first known viral RNA proofreading exoribonuclease, a function that likely allowed expansion of the coronavirus genome and that dramatically increases replication fidelity and the range of tolerated variation. We propose models for regulation of coronavirus fidelity and discuss the implications of altered fidelity for RNA virus replication, pathogenesis, and evolution.","Smith, Everett Clinton; Sexton, Nicole R; Denison, Mark R",Annual review of virology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-031413-085507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958717/,408

DESIGN Nationwide case-control study. SETTING Denmark. PARTICIPANTS All Danish children born from 1997 to 2014 and followed for asthma onset and persistent wheezing from age 1 year to 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Onset of asthma and persistent wheezing. RESULTS A higher incidence of asthma was found in children of parents with asthma (adjusted hazard ratio 2.29 (95% confidence interval 2.22 to 2.35) and mothers who smoked during pregnancy (1.20, 1.18 to 1.22), whereas a lower incidence was found in children of parents with high educational attainment (0.72, 0.69 to 0.75) and high incomes (0.85, 0.81 to 0.89). Exposure to particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) and ≤10 µm (PM10) and nitrate was associated with an increased risk of asthma and persistent wheezing, with hazard ratios per 5 µg/m3 increase in pollutant concentrations 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07) for PM2.5, 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06) for PM10, and 1.04 (1.03 to 1.04) for nitrogen dioxide. Only the positive association of PM2.5 with asthma and persistent wheezing remained robust across the different models and in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that children exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 are more likely to develop asthma and persistent wheezing than children who are not exposed. Other risk factors associated with these outcomes were parental asthma, parental education, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.","Holst, Gitte J; Pedersen, Carsten B; Thygesen, Malene; Brandt, Jørgen; Geels, Camilla; Bønløkke, Jakob H; Sigsgaard, Torben",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816747/,408

Few evidence-based interventions effectively diagnose new HIV infections among adolescents while successfully providing linkage to care. Methods We conducted a systematic review of recent interventions to increase HIV testing among adolescents and young adults using data retrieved from PubMed and Google Scholar, and using abstracts presented at the International AIDS Society conferences and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections published between January 1, 2015, and April 28, 2018. Results We identified 36 interventions (N=14 in high- income countries and N=22 in low- and middle-income countries) that were published in the literature (N=28) or presented at conferences (N=8). Interventions were categorized as behavioral/educational, alternate venue/self-testing, youth-friendly services, technology/mobile health, incentives, or peer-based/community-based interventions. The studies consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective observational studies, and quasi-experimental/pre-post evaluations with variable sample sizes. Study designs, populations, and settings varied. All categories showed some degree of acceptability, yet not all interventions were effective in increasing HIV testing. Effectiveness was seen in more than one RCT involving technology/mobile health (2/3 RCTs) and alternative venue/self-testing (3/3 RCTs) interventions, and only in one RCT each for behavioral interventions, community interventions, and incentives. There were no effective RCTs for adolescent-friendly services. Data were limited on the number of new infections identified and on the methods to increase linkage to care after diagnosis. Conclusion Future studies should include combinations of proven methods for engaging adolescents in HIV testing, while ensuring effective methods of linkage to care.","Zanoni, Brian C; Elliott, Ryan J; Neilan, Anne M; Haberer, Jessica E","Adolescent health, medicine and therapeutics",https://doi.org/10.2147/ahmt.s153204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584383/,408

SETTING Ophthalmology department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Oporto, Portugal. DESIGN Cross-sectional, non-randomized, retrospective study. METHOD ology: Data of all patients waiting for cataract surgery were analysed at the beginning of May 2020, after two months without performing elective surgery. The waiting time since surgical inscription was considered an independent and overriding factor. Also, higher priority was given to patients with white or brunescent cataracts and patients with low visual acuity: corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) ≤20/200 in binocular patients or CDVA ≤20/63 in monocular patients. Criteria of medium priority included patients that remained with anisometropia and patients with glaucoma or low to moderate risk of chronic angle closure. Data of scheduled surgeries in the following months were then analyzed. RESULTS A total of 717 patients were waiting for phacoemulsification in our center. 191 patients (26.64%) had more than 4.5 months on the waiting list; the medium waiting time was 3.51±1.57 months. According to both priority criteria and waiting time, 48.6% (n=348) were categorized as priority cases. A total of 158 patients (22.0%) met the highest priority; 61 patients (8.5%) met the medium priority criteria. In 129 patients (18.0%), priority was considered based solely on higher waiting time. This algorithm allowed us to operate all priority cases within the first three months. CONCLUSION The presented protocol showed to be effective, providing a timely surgical opportunity for priority cases.","Vieira, Rita; Baptista, Pedro; Castro, Catarina; Leite, João; Menéres, Maria João; Menéres, Pedro",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229967/,408

Current clinical guidelines rely mainly on histopathological markers with relatively weak prognostic value. This motivates further search for prognostic markers. METHODS This explorative study aimed to identify potential candidate gene mutations to facilitate differentiation between subgroups of patients with CRC stage II. Panel-based massive parallel sequencing was used to genetically characterize tumor tissues from 85 patients radically operated for CRC stage II, of which 12 developed recurrent cancer during follow-up. Genetic data was compared between patients with or without cancer recurrence, between tumors located in colon and in rectum, and for association with tumor differentiation grade. RESULTS Genetic variation in ATM, C11ORF65 was associated with recurrence-free survival. Previous reports regarding the association between BRAF mutation and a higher age at diagnosis, and tumor location in colon were confirmed. APC, BRAF, or KRAS mutation was associated with tumor differentiation grade. Multiple correspondence analyses revealed no obvious clustering of patients with the studied clinical characteristics, indicating that the genetic signatures observed here were unique for each individual. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, we have demonstrated the utility of panel-based massive parallel sequencing to explore the pathogenesis of CRC stage II. We have identified promising candidate gene mutations associated with cancer recurrence, tumor location, and differentiation grade in patients with CRC stage II, which merit further investigation.","Dimberg, Jan; Andersson, Roland E; Haglund, Sofie",Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408300/,408
148425,Impact event and orofacial pain amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: a cross-sectional epidemiological study.,2021,"BACKGROUND Self-efficacy is developed through a person's interaction with his/her physical and social environment. Self-efficacy in caring is an essential attribute of care workers to develop a positive attitude towards their clients, improve work performance, and enhance job satisfaction. Care workers' self-efficacy may vary according to the context in which the care is being provided. Aged care is a multidimensional and challenging setting, and characteristics of aged care services are different from those of acute care services. The objective of this review is to give an overview of the self-efficacy of residential aged care workers in caring for older people and factors influencing their self-efficacy. METHODS The protocol for this review is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual for Scoping Review. A systematic search of the literature on electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AgeLine, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global will be carried out using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. This review will include studies that examined the self-efficacy of direct care workers in caring for older people living in residential aged care facilities. All primary studies irrespective of the study design will be included. Studies conducted to develop measures or studies with informal care workers or students as study participants will not be considered. Two reviewers will independently conduct title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data charting. A third reviewer will resolve discrepancies, while the final decision for conflicting studies will be made by consensus within the review team. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to analyze the quantitative findings, and the result will be presented in narrative form accompanied by tables and charts. Content analysis will be carried to analyze the qualitative findings and will be presented in narrative form supported by illustrative quotations. DISCUSSION This study will be an important source of knowledge to policymakers and aged care providers to understand the self-efficacy of aged care workers to support and enhance their self-efficacy and thereby improve their caring behaviors towards their clients.

Morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high, particularly in hospitalized patients. Better risk prediction during hospitalization could improve management and ultimately reduce mortality rates. AIM To evaluate CRP measured at admission and the third day of hospitalization as a predictor for adverse events in CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP at an academic hospital. Major adverse outcomes were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital length of stay, hospital complications and 30-day mortality. Predictive associations between CRP (as absolute levels and relative decline at third day) and adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS Eight hundred and twenty-three patients were assessed, 19% were admitted to ICU and 10.6% required mechanical ventilation. The average hospital stay was 8.8 ± 8.2 days, 42% had nosocomial complications and 8.1% died within 30 days. Ninety eight percent of patients had elevated serum CRP on admission to the hospital (18.1 ± 14.1 mg/dL). C-reactive protein measured at admission was associated with the risk of bacterial pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, septic shock and use of mechanical ventilation. Lack of CRP decline within three days of hospitalization was associated with high risk of complications, septic shock, mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS CRP responses at third day of hospital admission was a valuable predictor of adverse events in hospitalized CAP adult patients.","Saldías-Peñafiel, Fernando; Salinas-Rossel, Gerardo; Farcas-Oksenberg, Katia; Reyes-Sánchez, Antonia; Díaz-Patiño, Orlando",Revista medica de Chile,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0034-98872019000800983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31859962/,408

A jejunal interposition, as described by Alvin Merendino in 1955, aims to substitute the lower oesophageal sphincter, thereby treating physiological disorders such as reflux oesophagitis. METHODS We aimed to combine these procedures in the treatment of an otherwise healthy patient, who presented with high-grade dysplasia on surveillance endoscopy, with particular reference to technical feasibility and to Quality of Life as assessed by the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). RESULTS We performed a laparoscopic vagus preserving Merendino procedure with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The patient made an entirely uncomplicated recovery and was discharged on day 7. His pathological specimen reported intramucosal carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia within Barrett's oesophagus. 0/4 lymph nodes were involved. His GIQLI scores preoperatively, at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, were 111, 98 and 105, respectively. His weight at the corresponding times was 69.8, 63.2 and 62.7 kg. CONCLUSION A laparoscopic vagal preserving Merendino procedure is technically feasible. It also offers a physiologically advantageous procedure for the patient.","Pring, Chris; Dexter, Simon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0736-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997753/,408
150482,The psychiatric impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION To understand the impact of e-cigarette devices, flavours, nicotine levels and prices on adult e-cigarette users' choices among closed-system and open-system e-cigarettes, cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs). METHODS Online discrete choice experiments were conducted among adult (≥18 years) e-cigarette users (n=2642) in August 2020. Conditional logit regressions were used to assess the relative impact of product attributes and the interactions between product attributes and user characteristics, with stratified analyses to examine differences by smoking status and primarily used e-cigarette device and flavour. RESULTS On average, participants preferred non-tobacco and non-menthol flavours most, preferred open-system over closed-system e-cigarettes and preferred regular nicotine level over low nicotine level. However, the preference varied by demographics, smoking status and the primarily used e-cigarette device and flavour. The differences in preference among products/devices were larger than the difference among flavours or nicotine levels. Participants who primarily used closed-system e-cigarettes exhibited similar preferences for closed-system and open-system e-cigarettes, but those who primarily used open-system e-cigarettes preferred much more open-system over closed-system e-cigarettes. HTP was the least preferred product, much lower than cigarettes in general, but participants living in states where IQOS is being sold had similar preferences to cigarettes and HTPs. CONCLUSIONS People are unlikely to switch to another product/device because of the restriction of flavour or nicotine level. If non-tobacco and non-menthol flavours were banned from open-system e-cigarettes, users may switch to menthol flavour e-cigarettes. Intervention strategies should be tailored to specific groups.","Yang, Yong; Lindblom, Eric N; Salloum, Ramzi G; Ward, Kenneth D",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2021-056599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301836/,408

METHODS A total of 19 MM patients with BIPN were enrolled and Nux Vomica Capsule (NVC, 0.4 g, thrice daily) were orally administrated for 30 days. Comparative analysis on parameters between pre- and post-therapy, including peripheral neuropathy (PN) grade, neurotoxicity score, Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome score, total neuropathy score (TNS), coagulation function, and serum nerve growth factor (NGF) levels were conducted. The adverse events were monitored. RESULTS In BIPN of MM patients who received NVC, PN grade was lowered, neurotoxicity score was obviously decreased (P⩽0.01), and both CM syndrome score and TNS were remarkably decreased (P<0.01). After the therapy, activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged (P<0.01) and fibrinogen was declined (P<0.05), showing improvement in the hypercoagulable state of patients. No significant difference of NGF recovery degrees was detected between pre- and post-therapy (P>0.05). No evident adverse reactions were observed during the course of treatment.

152649,Bilateral oedipism: a case of extreme self-harm in an African society averse to self-mutilation.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic surgery (LS) has proved superior compared to conventional surgery (CS) regarding morbidity, length of hospital stay, rate of wound infection and time until recovery. An improved preservation of the postoperative immune function is assumed to contribute to these benefits though the role of the local peritoneal immune response is still poorly understood. Our study investigates the peritoneal immune response subsequent to abdominal surgery and compares it between laparoscopic and conventional surgery to find an immunological explanation for the clinically proven benefits of LS. METHODS Wistar rats (N = 140) underwent laparoscopic cecum resection (LCR; N = 28), conventional cecum resection (CCR; N = 28), laparoscopic sham operation (LSO; N = 28), conventional sham operation (CSO; N = 28), or no surgical treatment (CTRL; N = 28). Postoperatively, peritoneal lavages were performed, leukocytes isolated and analyzed regarding immune function and phagocytosis activity. RESULTS Immune function was inhibited postoperatively in animals undergoing LCR or CCR compared to CTRL reflected by a lower TNF-α (CTRL 3956.65 pg/ml, LCR 2018.48 pg/ml (p = 0.023), CCR 2793.78 pg/ml (n.s.)) and IL-6 secretion (CTRL 625.84 pg/ml, LCR 142.84 pg/ml (p = 0.009), CCR 169.53 pg/ml (p = 0.01)). Phagocytosis was not affected in rats undergoing any kind of surgery compared to CTRL. Neither cytokine secretion nor phagocytosis activity differed significantly between laparoscopic and conventional surgery. CONCLUSIONS According to our findings the benefits associated with LS compared to CS cannot be explained by differences in the postoperative peritoneal innate immune response. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causes for a more favorable postoperative outcome in patients after LS compared to CS.","Lingohr, Philipp; Dohmen, Jonas; Matthaei, Hanno; Schwandt, Timo; Stein, Kathy; Hong, Gun-Soo; Steitz, Julia; Longerich, Thomas; Bölke, Edwin; Wehner, Sven; Kalff, Jörg C",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-016-1521-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761714/,408

The burden of RSV varies between countries. In China, the actual burden remains unclear. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to quantify the positive rate of ALRTI-related RSV infections among Chinese children in recent years. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and Chinese BioMedical (CBM) databases were searched to identify relevant cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was performed using R software. Results A total of 18 studies involving 66,799 ALRTI cases were finally included in the meta-analysis. Among those ALRTIs cases, the overall positive rate of RSV infection was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.9-19.6%). The rate was significantly higher in children <3 years (19.5%, 95% CI 13.3-27.6%) compared to those ≥3 years (5.6%, 95% CI: 2.3-13.2%; P<0.01). Moreover, stratified analysis revealed that RSV infection was most frequent in children <6 months (31.1%, 95% CI: 21.0-43.5%). The positive detection rate of RSV infection was significantly associated with season (P<0.01), with winter having the highest detection rate (29.0%, 95% CI: 21.3-38.2%), followed by autumn (20.9%, 95% CI: 10.5-37.3%), and summer having the lowest rate (6.4%, 95% CI: 2.3-16.9%). The rate of RSV infection was highest and lowest in November (49.4%, 95% CI: 29.0-70.0%) and June (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.6-2.8%), respectively. When stratified according to geographical region, RSV infections peaked in winter (South: 24.8%, 95% CI: 12.9-42.3%; North: 36.3%, 95% CI: 30.8-42.1%), followed by autumn (South: 13.9%, 95% CI: 6.5-27.4%; North: 32.7%, 95% CI: 20.2-48.3%). Conclusions In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that among Chinese children with ALRTI, 16.0% had RSV infection. RSV infection frequently occurred in children under the age of 3 years, especially in those under 6 months. The rate of RSV infections was highest in winter, followed by autumn.","Xie, Zhengde; Qin, Qiang; Shen, Kunling; Fang, Cheng; Li, Yang; Deng, Tong",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953547/,408
152863,COVID-19 and perinatal intimate partner violence: a cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum individuals in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND There is a critical need for the psychometric evaluation of outcome measures to be used in clinical trials targeting cognition in Down syndrome (DS). This study examines a specific cognitive skill that is of particular importance in DS, working memory, and the psychometric properties of a set of standardised measurements to assess working memory in individuals with DS. METHODS Ninety children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years old with DS were assessed on a selection of verbal and visuospatial working memory subtests of standardised clinical assessments at two time points to examine feasibility, distributional qualities, test-retest reliability and convergent validity against a priori criteria. Caregivers also completed an adaptive behaviour questionnaire to address working memory subtests' associations with broader developmental functioning. RESULTS The Stanford Binet-5 Verbal Working Memory, Differential Ability Scales-2 Recognition of Pictures, Stanford Binet-5 Nonverbal Working Memory and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-5 Picture Span measures met the most psychometric criteria overall across the full age and IQ range of the study. Although Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Sequential Order and Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Digits Backward met the fewest a priori criteria, follow-up analyses suggested greater feasibility in specific age and IQ ranges. CONCLUSIONS Several working memory measures appear to be psychometrically sound and appropriate for use in clinical trials for children with DS, especially when focusing on raw scores. However, floor effects on standard scores and feasibility of some measures were problematic. Guidelines for use of the working memory subtests with this population are provided.","Schworer, E K; Esbensen, A J; Fidler, D J; Beebe, D W; Carle, A; Wiley, S",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763953/,408

However, assessment of whether public have willingness to purchase or not, especially in unaffected areas, is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical Ebola vaccine in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 August to 30 December 2015 in five cities in Aceh province of Indonesia. Patients' family members who visited outpatient departments were approached and interviewed about their sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of Ebola, attitude towards vaccination practice and their WTP for a hypothetical Ebola vaccine. A multivariable linear regression model assessed the relationship between these explanatory variables and WTP. Results: During the study, 500 participants were approached and interviewed. There were 424 (84.8%) respondents who completed the interview and 74% (311/424) expressed their acceptance for an Ebola vaccine. There were 288 participants who were willing to pay for an Ebola vaccine (92.6% out of 311). The mean of WTP was US$2.08 (95% CI: 1.75-2.42). The final multivariable model indicated that young age, high educational attainment, working as a private employee, entrepreneur or civil servant (compared to farmers), being unmarried, and residing in a suburb (compared to a city) were associated with higher WTP. Conclusions: Although the proportion of the participants who would accept the Ebola vaccine was relatively high, the amount they were willing to pay for Ebola vaccine was very low. This finding would indicate the need of subsidies for Ebola vaccine in the country.","Mudatsir, Mudatsir; Anwar, Samsul; Fajar, Jonny K; Yufika, Amanda; Ferdian, Muhammad N; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Imanda, Aga S; Azhars, Roully; Ilham, Darul; Timur, Arya U; Sahputri, Juwita; Yordani, Ricky; Pramana, Setia; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Wagner, Abram L; Jamil, Kurnia F; Harapan, Harapan",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20144.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399182/,408

To date, however, whether obesity is associated with adult cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To assess whether obesity is a risk factor for CVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A case-control study was performed in consecutive adult patients with CVT admitted from July 1, 2006 (Amsterdam), and October 1, 2009 (Berne), through December 31, 2014, to the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, or Inselspital University Hospital in Berne, Switzerland. The control group was composed of individuals from the control population of the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis study, which was a large Dutch case-control study performed from March 1, 1999, to September 31, 2004, and in which risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were assessed. Data analysis was performed from January 2 to July 12, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Obesity was determined by body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 30 or greater was considered to indicate obesity, and a BMI of 25 to 29.99 was considered to indicate overweight. A multiple imputation procedure was used for missing data. We adjusted for sex, age, history of cancer, ethnicity, smoking status, and oral contraceptive use. Individuals with normal weight (BMI <25) were the reference category. RESULTS The study included 186 cases and 6134 controls. Cases were younger (median age, 40 vs 48 years), more often female (133 [71.5%] vs 3220 [52.5%]), more often used oral contraceptives (97 [72.9%] vs 758 [23.5%] of women), and more frequently had a history of cancer (17 [9.1%] vs 235 [3.8%]) compared with controls. Obesity (BMI ≥30) was associated with an increased risk of CVT (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.63; 95% CI, 1.53-4.54). Stratification by sex revealed a strong association between CVT and obesity in women (adjusted OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.00-6.14) but not in men (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.25-5.30). Further stratification revealed that, in women who used oral contraceptives, overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of CVT in a dose-dependent manner (BMI 25.0-29.9: adjusted OR, 11.87; 95% CI, 5.94-23.74; BMI ≥30: adjusted OR, 29.26; 95% CI, 13.47-63.60). No association was found in women who did not use oral contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Obesity is a strong risk factor for CVT in women who use oral contraceptives.","Zuurbier, Susanna M; Arnold, Marcel; Middeldorp, Saskia; Broeg-Morvay, Anne; Silvis, Suzanne M; Heldner, Mirjam R; Meisterernst, Julia; Nemeth, Banne; Meulendijks, Eva R; Stam, Jan; Cannegieter, Suzanne C; Coutinho, Jonathan M",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.0001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26974867/,408

The Society then abruptly refused to accept any more of his papers on catechin, or any other subject. It provided him with no reasons for the embargo until 1925. It then transpired that Nierenstein was boycotted because it was deemed that he had not responded adequately to criticisms of his work made by his rival in catechin research, the German natural products chemist, Karl Freudenberg. It was not until 1929 that, as a result of a petition by a group of his former Bristol pupils and friends, that Nierenstein was again permitted to publish in the Society's journal. The paper explores the Chemical Society's treatment of Nierenstein in detail, sheds new light on his career and his reaction to the Society's unprecedented boycott, examines some of the structural chemistry involved in the disputes, and discusses whether Nierenstein's research deserves the label of 'bad science'.","Brock, William H; Lewis, David E",Annals of science,https://doi.org/10.1080/00033790.2021.1917657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888042/,408
156856,A Scoping Review of Environmental Factors That Impact Driving with Arthritis: Considerations for Occupational Therapy.,2020-01-28,"INTRODUCTION In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of a system that would prevent the infection of healthcare providers is in urgent demand. We sought to investigate the feasibility and validity of a telemedicine-based system in which healthcare providers remotely check the vital signs measured by patients with COVID-19. METHODS Patients hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 measured and uploaded their vital signs to secure cloud storage. Additionally, the respiratory rates were monitored using a mat-type sensor placed under the bed. We assessed the time until the values became available on the Cloud and the agreements between the patient-measured vital signs and simultaneous healthcare provider measurements. RESULTS Between 26 May-23 September 2020, 3835 vital signs were measured and uploaded to the cloud storage by the patients (n=16, median 72 years old, 31% women). All patients successfully learned how to use these devices with a 10-minute lecture. The median time until the measurements were available on the cloud system was only 0.35 min, and 95.2% of the vital signs were available within 5 min of the measurement. The agreement between the patients' and healthcare providers' measurements was excellent for all parameters. Interclass coefficient correlations were as follows: systolic (0.92, p<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (0.86, p<0.001), heart rate (0.89, p<0.001), peripheral oxygen saturation (0.92, p<0.001), body temperature (0.83, p<0.001), and respiratory rates (0.90, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine-based self-assessment of vital signs in patients with COVID-19 was feasible and reliable. The system will be a useful alternative to traditional vital sign measurements by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kagiyama, Nobuyuki; Hiki, Makoto; Matsue, Yuya; Dohi, Tomotaka; Matsuzawa, Wataru; Daida, Hiroyuki; Minamino, Tohru; Kasai, Takatoshi",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211011825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966523/,408

As the cause of the disease is a novel coronavirus whose gene information is unknown, drugs and vaccines are yet to be found. For the present situation, disease spread analysis and prediction with the help of mathematical and data driven model will be of great help to initiate prevention and control action, namely lockdown and qurantine. There are various mathematical and machine-learning models proposed for analyzing the spread and prediction. Each model has its own limitations and advantages for a particluar scenario. This article reviews the state-of-the art mathematical models for COVID-19, including compartment models, statistical models and machine learning models to provide more insight, so that an appropriate model can be well adopted for the disease spread analysis. Furthermore, accurate diagnose of COVID-19 is another essential process to identify the infected person and control further spreading. As the spreading is fast, there is a need for quick auotomated diagnosis mechanism to handle large population. Deep-learning and machine-learning based diagnostic mechanism will be more appropriate for this purpose. In this aspect, a comprehensive review on the deep learning models for the diagnosis of the disease is also provided in this article.","John, Christopher Clement; Ponnusamy, Vijayakumar; Krishnan Chandrasekaran, Sriharipriya; R, Nandakumar",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2021.3069213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769936/,408

Although the open surgical approach, either through direct suturing or through mesh repairs, mostly achieves a satisfactory outcome, postoperative wound pain usually impedes patient's early ambulation. Accordingly, laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has emerged as a minimally invasive technique in modern surgical practice. We described a different approach of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old woman with a history of appendectomy presenting with a bulging mass over the right lower quadrant of the abdomen beneath the operation scar was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography revealed defects in the abdominal muscle layers without evidence of bowel incarceration. The patient was diagnosed with postappendectomy incisional hernia for which laparoscopic hernia repair was performed through a combined intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal approach. The patient's postoperative course was excellent.

To validate the method the human cysteine protease cathepsin B was screened against a library of 64,000 individual compounds and also against the same library mixed 10 compounds per well. The orthogonal pooling method used resulted in each compound being present in two wells, mixed with a different set of nine other compounds in each location. Thus hits were identified based on activity in both locations, avoiding the need for retesting of each component of active mixtures. Hits were tested in dose-response both in the dithiothreitol (DTT)-containing buffer used in the primary HTS and in buffer containing cysteine in place of DTT to rule out artifacts due to oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Comparison of the confirmed actives from single-compound and mixture screening showed that mixture screening identified all of the actives from single-compound HTS. Based on these results the orthogonal pooling strategy has been used successfully to rapidly screen several cysteine and serine proteases.","Motlekar, Nuzhat; Diamond, Scott L; Napper, Andrew D",Assay and drug development technologies,https://doi.org/10.1089/adt.2007.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593377/,408

Pandemic-related prenatal anxiety could lead to depression, a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and abnormal neonatal development. This study aimed to investigate the impact of anxiety on the mental health of pregnant women exposed to catastrophic events as compared to those without such exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies. This study compared the prevalence of anxiety among pregnant women during a catastrophic event. RESULTS Fifteen full texts were assessed for inclusion, with 3 included, 10 excluded for not meeting criteria, and 2 excluded for other reasons. The included studies were published before the current COVID-19 pandemic but included the SARS 2003 outbreak. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, 10 further studies were conducted, but they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two studies using STAI revealed that women exposed to a catastrophic event had a higher mean STAI score of 1.82 points (95% CI: 0.47-3.18 points). CONCLUSION Women with complications during pregnancy should be assessed for anxiety independently from catastrophic events. During financial crises, environmental or other disasters, special attention should be given to women with low risk, normal pregnancies.","Feduniw, Stepan; Modzelewski, Jan; Kajdy, Anna; Sys, Dorota; Kwiatkowski, Sebastian; Makomaska-Szaroszyk, Elżbieta; Rabijewski, Michał",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482x.2021.1985453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633913/,408

Its biosynthesis is severely reduced in mouse models of Huntington's disease. One possible mechanism is a diminished nuclear translocation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and, consequently, reduced activation of SREBP-controlled genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we evaluated the efficacy of a gene therapy based on the unilateral intra-striatal injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/5 (AAV2/5) targeting astrocytes specifically and carrying the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment of human SREBP2. Robust hSREBP2 expression in striatal glial cells in R6/2 Huntington's disease mice activated the transcription of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes, restored synaptic transmission, reversed Drd2 transcript levels decline, cleared mutant Huntingtin aggregates and attenuated behavioral deficits. We conclude that glial SREBP2 participates in Huntington's disease brain pathogenesis in vivo and that AAV-based delivery of SREBP2 to astrocytes counteracts key features of the disease.","Birolini, Giulia; Verlengia, Gianluca; Talpo, Francesca; Maniezzi, Claudia; Zentilin, Lorena; Giacca, Mauro; Conforti, Paola; Cordiglieri, Chiara; Caccia, Claudio; Leoni, Valerio; Taroni, Franco; Biella, Gerardo; Simonato, Michele; Cattaneo, Elena; Valenza, Marta",Brain : a journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974044/,408

160924,Betrayal of Trust? The Impact of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic on Older Persons.,2020-04-30,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7and 8 were considered to recognize single-strand RNA (ssRNA) from viruses. Although these receptors also respond to synthetic small chemical ligands, such as CL075 and R848, it remains to be determined whether these receptors sense natural small molecules or not. In the structure of human TLR8 (huTLR8) with ssRNA, there are two ligand-binding sites: one binds a uridine and the other binds an oligoribonucleotide (ORN). This finding demonstrates that huTLR8 recognizes degradation products of ssRNA, suggesting the presence of natural small ligands. We here show that TLR7 works as the sensor for guanosine (G)/2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) in the presence of ORN where ORN strengthens TLR7 interaction with G/dG. In addition, modified nucleosides such as 7-methylguanosine, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) activated TLR7 with ORNs. Importantly, 8-OHdG-a well-known oxidative DNA damage marker with unknown function-induced strong cytokine production comparable to G and dG both in mouse and human immune cells. Although 8-OHdG bound TLR7/ORN with lower affinity than dG did in isothermal titration calorimetry, administered 8-OHdG was metabolically more stable than dG in the serum, indicating that 8-OHdG acts on TLR7 as an endogenous ligand in vivo To address a role of G analogs in the disease state, we also examined macrophages from Unc93b1 (D34A/D34A) mice, which suffer from TLR7-dependent systemic inflammation, and found that Unc93b1 (D34A/D34A) macrophages showed significantly enhanced response to G alone or 8-OHdG with ORN. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that G, dG, 8-OHG and 8-OHdG are novel endogenous ligands for TLR7.","Shibata, Takuma; Ohto, Umeharu; Nomura, Shosaku; Kibata, Kayoko; Motoi, Yuji; Zhang, Yan; Murakami, Yusuke; Fukui, Ryutaro; Ishimoto, Tatsushi; Sano, Shigetoshi; Ito, Tomoki; Shimizu, Toshiyuki; Miyake, Kensuke",International immunology,https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxv062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26489884/,408
161467,Estimating the economic consequences of substance use and substance use disorders.,2021-04-26,"OBJECTIVE Superficial venous reflux disease has been treated with endovenous ablation techniques for more than 15 years. Thrombi discovered in the postoperative period are referred to as endovenous heat-induced thrombi (EHIT). In spite of the few studies of the ultrasound differentiation between EHIT and deep vein thrombi (DVT), there remains a paucity of literature regarding the evaluation of ultrasound examination and pathologic differentiation. METHODS Six Yorkshire cross swine underwent femoral vein thrombosis by suture ligation or endovenous radiofrequency ablation. At 1 week after the procedure, each femoral vein was imaged by color Duplex ultrasound and sent for histologic interpretation for differentiation between EHIT and DVT. Five blinded vascular surgery faculty, two vascular surgery fellows, and three vascular surgery residents reviewed the ultrasound images. RESULTS Thrombi associated with radiofrequency ablation demonstrated a greater degree of hypercellular response, fibroblastic reaction, and edema (3.42 vs 2.92; 3.75 vs 2.42; 2.83 vs 1.33). Specimens harvested from the iatrogenic-induced DVT swine demonstrated a more prolific response to trichrome staining (3.42 vs 2.67). Evidence of revascularization was found in all of the EHIT specimens but in 33% of DVT specimens. On the basis of histologic findings, the pathologist predicted correct modality 92% of the time. Subgroup analysis comparing paired specimens from each swine failed to demonstrate any marked pathologic differences. Recorded ultrasound images from EHIT and DVT samples were reviewed by fellows, residents, and vascular surgery staff to determine whether clot was stationary or free-floating (n = 111; 93%), evidence of retracted or adherent vein (n = 105; 88%), and absence of color flow (n = 102; 85%). The degree of occlusion (partial vs total) and degree of distention of a visualized vein were least likely to be agreed on by reviewers (n = 95; 79% each, respectively). In subgroup (DVT vs EHIT) analyses, the percentage agreement was greatest among vascular surgery fellows (89% and 92%) compared with residents (82% and 79%) and faculty (78% and 77%). CONCLUSIONS It is possible to differentiate the thrombus origin on pathologic examination but not clinically on ultrasound. Wide variability exists for ultrasound diagnosis of EHIT and de novo DVT. Care must be taken in evaluating post-treatment duplex scans to not assign diagnosis of EHIT when DVT may well be present and extending into the deep venous system. The modulation of collagen production in the treatment of DVT may be helpful in preventing vascular dysfunction and reducing the post-thrombotic changes. Further studies on injury after radiofrequency ablation and laser ablation are needed.","Santin, Brian J; Lohr, Joanne M; Panke, Thomas W; Neville, Patrick M; Felinski, Melissa M; Kuhn, Brian A; Recht, Matthew H; Muck, Patrick E",Journal of vascular surgery.

In this context, the economic entities were forced to look for adjustment and rescue solutions of their activities. One possible solution for the recovery and reorganization of economic entities’ activities is demerger. This paper evaluates the impact of demerger upon the sustainable development of economic entities in terms of economic efficiency and financial performances. To achieve this goal, a statistical analysis of profitability ratios before and after the demerger, as well as a structural analysis of 268 demerger projects for the April 2012–April 2021 period, were performed. The results attest there are no significant differences between the ex-ante and ex-post financial performances. However, demerger seems to have a positive effect upon analyzed companies helping them to overcome economic hardships, rethink their business strategies, and continue their activity in the medium and long-term time horizon.","Baba, Camelia Mirela Duguleană Constantin Marius Sorin Dincă Duguleană Liliana Dincă Gheorghița",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158316,408

Although better educated than their parents, young men and women are chronically unemployed or in vulnerable work positions. While the majority of young people live in rural areas, these issues have sometimes resulted in large scale migration from rural to urban areas. In forested areas, those who remain are often highly dependent on forests for goods and services for their livelihood. Community forestry has been shown to be an effective strategy for sustainable forest management and livelihoods. Unfortunately, youth have often been marginalized in benefiting from or participating in decision-making about community forests. This is frequently attributed to local, cultural, and traditional norms that give priority to older generations in decision-making. Given their stake in sustainable forest management in a post-pandemic world, as well as their large numbers, it is important to utilize new approaches to bring young men and women together with older generations to address challenges and foster opportunities. This will then capitalize on the knowledge, energy, enthusiasm, innovative ideas, leadership ability, technological literacy, and resilience that youth can contribute to community forest management and rural communities. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brown, H.

While they exclude already marginalised groups and are detrimental to the entire job market, many voices maintain that these positions are crucial, support science and conservation in economically disadvantaged areas, and allow early-career scientists their first step into the field. To better understand the real scale and nature of these positions, we reviewed relevant job offers within marine biology and conservation, advertised globally in English, from three random months in 2019–2020, both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unpaid and pay-to-work positions were more common than paid jobs, and offered mostly in economically privileged areas, such as North America and Europe. Most of these postings required some or strong experience and education background. Most non-governmental and private organisations offering uncompensated work did not produce any peer-reviewed research output in the last 3 years.

Recent data suggest that symptoms and general malaise may continue long after the infection has ended in recovered patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection has profound consequences in the host cells. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger a DNA damage response (DDR) in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). We observed a transcriptional upregulation of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) in infected cells. In addition, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of CHK1, a downstream effector of the ATR DNA damage response, as well as H2AX. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection lowered the expression of TRF2 shelterin-protein complex, and reduced telomere lengths in infected Vero E6 cells. Thus, our observations suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have pathological consequences to host cells beyond evoking an immunopathogenic immune response.","Victor, Joshua; Deutsch, Jamie; Whitaker, Annalis; Lamkin, Erica N.; March, Anthony; Zhou, Pei; Botten, Jason W.; Chatterjee, Nimrat",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459535,408

Methods, Results & Conclusion: A Xeno-Free (XF), fed-batch, microcarrier-based bioreactor process for hMSC manufacturing had been developed and optimized [1], and scaled to a 50L process, with demonstrated comparability between the hMSC critical quality attributes (CQAs) from the bioreactor process and from 2D control cells of similar population doubling (PDL) [2]. Based on this previous process development, GenCure and RoosterBio are leading the first stage of biomanufacturing through upstream (2D seed train & bioreactor expansion) and downstream process (continuous counterflow centrigufation, formulation & fill, and cryopreservation). Bioreactor runs at the 50 L scale were performed using the most commonly used hMSC sources in regenerative medicine: bone marrow (BM-MSCs), umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and adipose (AD-MSCs). Critical process parameters (CPPs) are defined and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the harvested cell product are characterized. An initial production run produced over 33billion BM-MSCs that passed the ISCT minimal criteria for MSCs. The subsequent expansion of UC- and AD-MSCs will be presented. Sentien's proprietary platform was used to ask questions on how the MSCs reacted to different stimuli with results showing that BM-MSCs were able to sense and respond with different secretomes to inflammatory stimuli. Our data also showed that BMMSCs induced changes in CD4, CD8 and CD19 cells and significantly reduced TNF-a levels in activated PBMCs, demonstrating their immunomodulatory capabilities. The same assays will be performed using the resulting MSCs from umbilical cord and adipose tissue expanded in the 50L bioreactor. Sentien, which has treated 16 subjects with acute kidney injury (AKI, open IND) and is currently running a trial in severe COVID-19 patients with AKI, will contribute biomarker data from the clinical-scale bioreactor and patient samples. Testing the in vitro developed potency hypothesis against the clinical samples will form the basis of a true potency assay. Through this work, the consortium will develop a generalized quality framework for large scale MSC manufacturing and potency assay development for broad use in regenerative medicine.","Lembong, J.; O'Rourke, B.; Sears, T.; Nguyen, S.; Barnett, C.; Salmi, M.; Kombe, M.; Getz, J.; Garg, P.; Whitelonis, A.; Rowley, J.

But apart from them, in-situ prevention approaches like inclusion of nutrient rich healthy foods and herbs in daily diet helps to protect the body from inside by strengthening immune system. Thus, to strengthen immune system from inside we need to take immunity boosters, apart from normal healthy diet. These immunity boosters are prepared from leaves, roots, stems, flowers, barks and some other parts of medicinal and spice crops.

More specifically, in South Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a crippling effect on jobs. Companies and businesses are struggling to operate and retain workers as revenue streams are drying up. Owners of companies and businesses have been forced to make difficult decisions. An example is the retrenchment of workers by some organizations because of the financial fall-out due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also, before the pandemic, South Africa had unemployment challenges, economic downgrading, and high levels of inequality (within the employment sector). These challenges bring to mind what the employment method and strategy will look like during the (post)-COVID-19. In view of these challenges, one question that comes to mind is: given the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the job losses affected people of all races, should the policies of affirmative action and preferential hiring still be considered in South Africa? Thus, this paper is a philosophical reflection on COVID-19, job losses, affirmative action, and preferential hiring in South Africa. In reflecting on the above, this paper aims to show that affirmative action and preferential hiring should not be considered in South Africa during the (post)-COVID-19.

We utilized our preexisting electronic medical record, video calling, and online payment for online consultation. Methodology: Consultations between April 15, 2020, and July 31, 2020, were compared with a similar period in 2019 to see the change in the pattern of consultation. Results: Between April 15, 2020, and July 31, 2020, there were a total of 1597 appointments compared to 2945 in the previous year a 45% fall in 2020. In the current model, all patients had to compulsorily have an online consultation. Online consultation was first done for 1130 patients, of whom 396 had a physical consultation in the clinic. There were no online consultations in the previous year. The real-world problems with online consultations and how they were overcome are discussed. Analyzing the data month wise, there was a progressive increase in the appointments this year indicating better acceptance for online consultation increasing from 350 appointments in May to 628 in July 2020, which translated into 40% and 70% of 2019 appointments indicating better acceptance over time. Cancellations were 5.2% for online consultation and 2.2% for physical consultation in the clinic. The reasons for cancellations were also analyzed and the most common causes were inability to reach the patient on mobile and blood pressure not recordable nearby. 0.7% had to make an emergency visit before they could complete an online consultation. Conclusions: Simple method of online consultation can be implemented in any clinic. No special app is required. The number of patients undergoing consultation is increasing with every passing month.

The accuracy of molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been assessed numerous times, usually in reference to a gold standard diagnosis. One major disadvantage of that approach is the possibility of error due to inaccuracy of the gold standard, which is especially problematic for evaluating testing in a real-world surveillance context. We used an alternative approach known as Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM), which circumvents the need to designate a gold standard by simultaneously estimating the accuracy of multiple tests. We applied this technique to a collection of 1,716 tests of three types applied to 853 individuals on a university campus during a one-week period in October 2020. We found that reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of saliva samples performed at a campus facility had higher sensitivity (median: 0.923; 95% credible interval: 0.732-0.996) than RT-PCR testing of nasal samples performed at a commercial facility (median: 0.859; 95% CrI: 0.547-0.994). The reverse was true for specificity, although the specificity of saliva testing was still very high (median: 0.993; 95% CrI: 0.983-0.999). An antigen test was less sensitive and specific than both of the RT-PCR tests. These results suggest that RT-PCR testing of saliva samples at a campus facility can be an effective basis for surveillance screening to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a university setting.","Perkins, A.; Stephens, M.; Alvarez Barrios, W.; Cavany, S.

In Drosophila, the BMP family member Dpp is produced in a limited set of imaginal disc cells and functions as a classic morphogen to regulate pattern and growth by diffusing throughout imaginal discs. However, the role of TGFβ/Activin-like ligands in disc growth control remains ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses canonical dSmad2 mediated signaling to regulate wing size. We propose that Myo is a myokine that helps mediate an allometric relationship between muscles and their associated appendages.","Upadhyay, Ambuj; Peterson, Aidan J.; Kim, Myung-Jun; O’Connor, Michael B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/793851,408

With the expansion of virtual supermarket shopping (VS-shopping) consumption, there is an increasing need to investigate the variety of consumers' motivations for engaging in such behavior. This study sought to address this gap by using the means-end chain theory method to explore the motivational complexity of VS-shopping. Based on data collected (n = 67) through the soft-laddering approach, six types of motivation are identified, include Quality of life, sense of accomplishment, Family well-being, Financial security, Self-direction, and Health consciousness. The results are expected to complement both theoretical contributions (additional understanding related to the virtual supermarket) and practical contributions (providing valid knowledge for retailers to create a more favorable service and marketing strategies for VS-shopping consumption).","Nguyen, T.

However, undergraduate medical education is not keeping up with this pace and medical schools risk producing graduates who are unqualified to work in a digital NHS.The Medical Education Innovation and Research Centre (MEdIC) led two projects exploring views of primary care educators and medical students. MEdIC is a translational centre bringing cutting-edge evidence from health, education, community and policy into medical education innovations and research.Primary care educators attended a digital health workshop where activities included discussing challenges and risks around digital technology. Key challenges identified included digital consultation skills, access, workload, patient safety and ethics.Third year medical students were invited to enrol on ‘Digital Health Futures’, a specialty choice module. After the module, students were invited to participate in focus groups to reflect on digital health education. Key themes included lack of preparedness for practice, a call for digital to be fully integrated within the curriculum, and concerns around attitude of the medical school to technology and digital innovation.LeadershipImplementing curricular improvement requires strong leadership;and close collaborations and consultation with students and educators is vital. This must be an ongoing and iterative process due to the nature of technological development.

177823,Delivering low-carbon electricity systems in sub-Saharan Africa: insights from Nigeria (Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/d1ee00746g),2021,"Introduction Approximately 15,000 individuals in the Midwest live with sickle cell disease (SCD), a lifelong, painful disorder with complications and comorbidities. Providers self-report limited knowledge and confidence in treating patients with SCD, leading to limited access to providers knowledgeable about evidence-based management and treatment guidelines and therefore poor health outcomes for patients. Sickle Treatment and Outcomes Research in the Midwest (STORM) is a regional sickle cell network, established to improve outcomes for individuals with SCD living in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. One goal of STORM is to increase provider knowledge about evidence-based management of SCD. STORM TeleECHO, a replication of the Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) telementoring model, was launched in March 2016 as an innovative, lifespan approach to provider education in the Midwest. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 public health pandemic, the STORM coordinating team quickly pivoted to host additional COVID-19 and SCD focused ECHO sessions. Methods STORM TeleECHO virtual clinics include didactic presentations with a curriculum based on the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Evidence-Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease guidelines, as well as a de-identified case discussion presented by providers seeking feedback on the management of challenging clinical scenarios. Other additional medical and psychosocial issues have also been presented. Participants join the monthly hour-long sessions using Zoom© or telephone. COVID-19 and SCD sessions followed the same format and topics focused on emerging medical and psychosocial pandemic issues, such as: serology, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children, the COVID and SCD surveillance registry, blood safety and transfusion practices, telemedicine, back to school issues, mental health, and Sickle Cell Disease Association of America patient and provider advisories. These sessions also provided an open forum for this hematology/primary care provider community of practice to share rapidly changing clinical practices and patient resources. Results Since March 2016, 58 sessions have been held with over 175 unique attendees. Evaluation data shows 100% of providers will continue participating and would recommend STORM TeleECHO to a colleague. Over 80% reported learning best practice guidelines for SCD;developing clinical expertise;and applying knowledge into practice. Data analysis has shown a statistically significant increase in provider confidence to identify eligible candidates and prescribing hydroxyurea. STORM has awarded over 750 CME credits (since 2016), over 300 MOC Part II from the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Internal Medicine (since 2017) and 70 CNE credits (since 2019). Since March 2020, the 11 special COVID-19 sessions have averaged 42 attendees per session- nearly a 150% increase compared to the standing ECHO sessions in previous years (Table 1). Over 115 unique providers have attended at least one COVID-19 session, with 61 participants being new to STORM TeleECHO. Participants have cumulatively attended an average of 4 COVID-19 sessions and represented 17 states and Canada. On average, 93% of respondents rated the COVID-19 STORM TeleECHO sessions as “very good” or “excellent”. Discussion STORM TeleECHO has been instrumental in increasing knowledge and comfort of providers caring for patients with SCD. Data shows that STORM TeleECHO has the potential to improve outcomes and decrease health disparities in this underserved and medically vulnerable population. Moreover, STORM COVID-19 and SCD TeleECHO session participants have been highly satisfied with this educational forum for addressing emerging issues during the public health emergency. Our program quickly and successfully leveraged the existing STORM TeleECHO framework to expand educational forums for this community of practice. The continued increase in participants sustained throug out the COVID-19 ECHO's has demonstrated the need and interest for this educational forum to share practice changes, new clinical protocols, patient education and other resources. While the regular STORM TeleECHO sessions will continue, there are also plans to continue the additional COVID-ECHO sessions for the foreseeable future.

The absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 increase the population's vulnerability. Since there are efficient vaccines but it is not available to all worldwide, Especially the inhabitants of the third world, in addition the appearance of mutated copies (Indian version, Nigerian version..), properly wearing masks in public areas is one of the major protection methods for people. Although it is important to wear the facemask correctly, there are not much research studies about facemask detection based on image processing. In this work, we propose Yolov4FaceMask, which is a model with high accuracy and can detect Masked/IncorrectMask/UnMasked faces. The main challenging point of this task is the absence of practical datasets. For this, we introduce our new practical dataset, which contains 14409 images. Experiments show that the Yolov4FaceMask achieves 88.82% mAP on our proposed dataset. This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) based framework for automating face-masked/incorrect mask/unmasked people's detection using images and surveillance video and the library OpenCV for image processing. Our proposed model uses the object detection model named YOLOv4 to segregate human's faces from the background. The Yolo4FaceMask results are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models of face mask detection, e.g. Face-mask InceptionV3 and SSDMNV2 and RetinaFaceMask in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). © 2021 IEEE.","Mokeddem, M.

For this the experimentation with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms is performed. A convolution network (CNN) is one of the widely used deep learning algorithms used for medical imaging systems. In this chapter different variants of CNN are used. Data augmentation and dropout techniques are used to avoid overfitting. Among these different variants, CNN with ten convolutional layers and 15 epochs has given the best performance of 88.23% training 85.94% validation accuracy. This is followed by the use of Alexnet for feature extraction from CXR images and the extracted features are given as the input to different machine learning classifiers including Gaussian Naïve Bays, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost, Ada Boost for classification of input images among the classes of Covid-19, No Finding, Pneumonia. Among these machine learning classifiers, SVM has given the best performance of 86% testing accuracy. Thus, the deep learning algorithms have proven to give satisfactory performance. This performance can still be improved with the help of more images and by fine tuning the pre trained models.

A microbial sensor utilizing fluorescence emitted by microorganisms was used to measure bioaerosol concentrations in the living room and children’s bedroom as well as on the balcony. Indoor PM2.5 was also monitored simultaneously at certain time points using a PM2.5 sensor. The behavior of the residents was also recorded during some monitoring periods. The average number concentration of microbes as fungi in the living room was 15,100, 58,800, and 10,600 counts m-3 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively, increasing in summer when the outside temperature was high. Microbial number concentrations were closely related to human behavior, increasing rapidly during periods of physical activity, but decreasing again within 20-30 min of the activity ending. There was no clear correlation between indoor microbial number concentrations and PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting that indoor microorganisms are concentrated in coarse particles, such as dust, which are quickly removed via gravitational settling. The concentration of indoor airborne microorganisms decreased significantly after ventilation, and although an occasional increase was observed immediately after ventilation, concentrations decreased again rapidly within 10-20 min.

181705,Digital health services among patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review,2021,"Background Evidence suggests that adverse outcomes in COVID-19 may be driven by a cytokine-induced vascular inflammatory response, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Aim We aimed to develop a non-invasive method for quantifying cytokine-driven vascular inflammation in patients with acute COVID-19 infection that could allow risk stratification. Methods We developed a platform for rapid development of novel imaging biomarkers of vascular inflammation, by applying quantitative radiotranscriptomics to images from standard Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). We used this platform to train a radiotranscriptomic signature (C19-RS) from the perivascular space around the aorta and the internal mammary artery, visualized in routine chest CTAs, to best describe cytokine-driven vascular inflammation, defined using transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing data from human arterial biopsies. This signature was tested externally in 435 clinically indicated CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) from patients with or without COVID-19 from 3 different geographical regions. Results COVID-19 patients were characterised by significantly higher C19-RS values (adjusted odds ratio of 2.97 [95%CI: 1.43-6.27], p=0.004), while patients infected with the new B.1.1.7 variant (“UK variant”) were also found to have higher C19-RS values compared to those with the original variant, evidence suggestive of higher degrees of vascular inflammation. C19-RS had prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, with hazard ratios of 3.31 ([95%CI: 1.49-7.33], p=0.003) and 2.58 ([95%CI: 1.10-6.05], p=0.028) in two external testing cohorts respectively, after correction for clinical factors and biochemical biomarkers of inflammation (WBC, CRP) and myocardial injury (troponin). Importantly, the corrected HR for in-hospital mortality was 8.24[95%CI: 2.16- 31.36], P=0.002 for those who received no treatment with dexamethasone, but only 2.27[95%CI: 0.69-7.55], p=0.18 in those who received dexamethasone after the test, suggesting that anti-inflammatory treatment may be modifying the natural history of COVID-19 infection by improving outcomes specifically in those patients with high vascular inflammation. Conclusions Our study introduces a new radiotranscriptomic signature, C19-RS, extracted from routine CTPAs, trained to detect cytokine-driven arterial inflammation, and demonstrates that vascular inflammation determined in this way has prognostic value in patients with COVID-19. The “UK variant” leads to higher vascular inflammation measured in this way, and the risk associated with COVID-19 arteritis is modifiable by dexamethasone.","Kotanidis, C.

182306,A study of factors affecting the alcohol consumption in turkey,2021,"Background Under strong sexual selection, certain species evolve distinct intrasexual, alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). In many cases, ARTs can be viewed as environmentally-cued threshold traits, such that ARTs coexist if their relative fitness alternates over the environmental cue gradient. Surprisingly, the chemical ecology of ARTs has been underexplored in this context. To our knowledge, no prior study has directly quantified pheromone production for ARTs in a male-polymorphic species. Here, we used the bulb mite—in which males are either armed fighters that kill conspecifics, or unarmed scramblers—as a model system to gain insight into the role of pheromones in the evolutionary maintenance of ARTs. Given that scramblers forgo investment into weaponry, we tested whether scramblers produce higher pheromone quantities than fighters, which would improve the fitness of the scrambler phenotype, e.g. through female mimicry to avoid aggression from competitors. To this end, we sampled mites from a rich and a poor nutritional environment and quantified their production of the female sex pheromone α-acaridial through gas chromatography analysis. Results We found a positive relationship between pheromone production and body size, but males exhibited a steeper slope in pheromone production with increasing size than females. Females exhibited a higher average pheromone production than males. We found no significant difference in slope of pheromone production over body size between fighters and scramblers. However, scramblers reached larger body sizes and higher pheromone production than fighters, providing some evidence for a potential female mimic strategy adopted by large scramblers. Pheromone production was significantly higher in mites from the rich nutritional environment than the poor environment. Conclusion Further elucidation of pheromone functionality in bulb mites, and additional inter-and intrasexual comparisons of pheromone profiles are needed to determine if the observed intersexual and intrasexual differences in pheromone production are adaptive, if they are a by-product of allometric scaling, or diet-mediated pheromone production under weak selection. We argue chemical ecology offers a novel perspective for research on ARTs and other complex life-history traits.","Zeeman, Adam N.; Smallegange, Isabel M.; Steel, Emily Burdfield; Groot, Astrid T.; Stewart, Kathryn A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.450527,408

To examine the evolution of symptoms and the extent of under-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Design: Prospective cohort study of randomly selected schools and classes. Setting: Schools remained open for physical attendance in Switzerland from May 2020 to the end of 2020/2021 school year. Lower school level (age range 7-10 years) and middle school level (8-13 years) children in primary schools, and upper school level (12-17 years) children in secondary schools were invited for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing in the Ciao Corona study in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Three testing rounds were completed in June-July 2020 (T1; after the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections), October-November 2020 (T2; during the peak of the second wave), and March-April 2021 (T3; after the second wave and with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern becoming dominant). Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic information and symptoms. Participants: 2487 children (median age 12 years, age range 7-17 years) recruited from 275 classes in 55 schools participated in the testing in March-April 2021; total of 2974 children participated in at least one of the 3 testing rounds. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 serology results; clustering of seropositive children within classes; reported symptoms. Results: The proportion of children who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive increased from 1.5% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.6% to 2.6%) in June-July 2020, to 6.6% (95% CrI 4.0% to 8.9%) in October-November, and to 16.4% (95% CrI 12.1% to 19.5%) in March-April 2021. By March-April 2021, children in upper school level (12.4%; 95% CrI 7.3% to 16.7%) were less likely to be seropositive than those in middle (19.5%; 95% CrI 14.2% to 24.4%) or lower school levels (16.0%; 95% CrI 11.0% to 20.4%). Children in the upper school level had a 5.1% (95% CI -9.4% to -0.7%) lower than expected seroprevalence by March-April 2021 than those in middle school level, based on difference-in-differences analysis. The ratio of PCR-diagnosed to all seropositive children changed from 1 to 21.7 (by June-July 2020) to 1 to 3.5 (by March-April 2021). Symptoms were reported by 37% of newly seropositive and 16% seronegative children. Potential clusters of 3 or more newly seropositive children were detected in 24 of 119 (20%) classes with a high participation rate, from which a median of 17 clusters could be expected due to random distribution of seropositive children within the classes. Clustering was lowest in middle and upper school levels. Retention rate in the cohort was high (84% of T1 participants attended T3). Among participants, supporting society and research were reported more commonly for participation than personal reasons. Fear of blood sampling was the most frequently reported reason for non-participation, reported for 64% of children. Conclusions: By March-April 2021, 16.4% of children and adolescents were seropositive in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. The majority of clusters of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive children in school classes could be explained by community rather than intra-class transmission of infections.

It is no surprise then that academic flying is among the leading causes of universities’ greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Despite growing awareness surrounding GHG emissions from flying and calls for reducing aeromobility, academics have continued to travel. The COVID-19 pandemic, in equitably stopping all flying, offers a unique opportunity to study emerging low-GHG modes of academic internationalization. In this article, we look at academic internationalization, inspired by digital ethnography, to explore how the academic landscape has adapted to meet internationalization goals within the context of a sudden grounding of travel.

This been recently declared as Global Pandemic by WHO. There is a global emergency to identify potential drugs to treat the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. There is a urgency to identifying potential antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. An effective and quick approach is to test existing antiviral drugs against. Whole genome analysis and alignment carried out using BLASTn, SMART BLAST and WebDSV 2.0 had shown more than 238 ORF’s coding for proteins mostly origin from Bat SARS coronavirus and root genomic origin from Archaea. Molecular docking results against protein targets Furin, papain like proteases, RdRp and Spike glycoprotein had shown paritaprevir, ritonavir, entecavir and chloroquine derivatives are the best drugs to inhibit multi targets of coronavirus infection including natural compounds corosolic acid, baicalin and glycyrrhizic acid with minimal inhibitory concentrations. Thus we propose use of paritaprevir, entecavir, ritonavir and chloroquine derivatives as best drug combination along with niacinamide, folic acid and zinc supplements to treat novel coronavirus infection. We also propose use of plant protease inhibitors (PI’s) and Anti-IL8, IL-6, IL-2 as future drug models against coronavirus.","Manikyam, Hemanth Kumar; Joshi, Sunil K",J Pharm Drug Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7331973/,408

Lewis rats develop a persistent infection of the central nervous system which is pathohistologically represented by perivascular encephalitic lesions predominantly in the grey matter. In previous studies it has been shown that a cell-mediated immune response causes Borna disease (BD). In order to define further the immune cell responsible for this immunopathological disease, a BDV-specific T cell line, NM1, was established and cultured in vitro. Phenotypically this T cell line was characterized by cytofluorometry as CD4-positive (CD4+). Proliferation assays with syngeneic and allogeneic antigen-presenting cells, and blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies, revealed major histocompatibility complex class II antigens to be restriction elements. After passive transfer of this virus-specific CD4+ T cell into immunosuppressed BDV-infected recipients, full-blown disease could be induced. Immunohistological examination of the cells involved in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in BDV-infected rats and in recipients of the NM1 T cell line revealed a dominance of macrophages and CD4+ T cells. The presence of these cells in encephalitic lesions strongly suggests a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction as the pathogenetic mechanism of BD.","Richt, J; Stitz, L; Deschl, U; Frese, K; Rott, R",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1979346/,408

187526,Doctors who are using e-mail with their patients: a qualitative exploration.,2003,"OBJECTIVE The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious infection caused by a newly discovered strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV). During the outbreak of SARS in the first half of 2003, children appeared to be less susceptible to the SARS coronavirus and pediatric patients presented with a less aggressive clinical course than adult patients did, demonstrating the traits which were rarely observed in other viral contagious disease. The present study aimed to preliminarily examine the presence of serum specific antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus virus (SARS-CoV) in pediatric SARS patients and explore the possibility of subclinical infection in children/adults through close association with SARS cases. METHODS (1) Clinicians and nurses visited families and collected general and epidemiological information about the subjects using a standard questionnaire and took serum specimens. (2) Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV were assayed with two methods, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for detecting IgG antibodies and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mixed antibodies. Serum specimens tested included those from 21 clinically confirmed pediatric SARS cases (aged from 8 months to 14 years, 11 male and 10 female) and their 23 parents who had close contact with the children, 36 adult patients in convalescence stage of SARS, 24 children (aged 1.5 to 14 years) and other 34 adults who had close contact with infected adults. RESULTS (1) The positive rates of specific IgG and mixed antibodies against SARS-CoV were 38% (8/21) and 33% (7/21) in pediatric cases; whereas the rates were 75% (27/36) and 69% (25/36) in adult patients. (2) The proportion of the patients who had close contact to SARS patients was 7/8 among the antibody-positive group vs. 1/13 for the antibody-negative group (P < 0.05). (3) The IgG antibody emerged in one of 24 children, whose mother, a nurse, had suffered from SARS (4%). (4) Among 23 parents of children with SARS, one was positive for IgG and the mixed antibodies, whose grandson and husband suffered from SARS; The IgG antibody and the mixed antibodies were also positive in another adult who had close contact with adult SARS cases (3%). CONCLUSIONS (1) SARS-CoV infection was confirmed by serological methods in 38.1% of clinically diagnosed pediatric SARS cases, which leads to the assumption that correct diagnosis of pediatric SARS requires more accurate and efficient ways, for example, screening for antigen or gene of SARS-CoV. (2) The proportion of the patients who had close contact to SARS patients among antibody-positive cases was higher than that in antibody-negative cases. (3) It is possible that subclinical SARS CoV infection exists in children and adults, although the rate of occurrence is low. The data of the present study did not confirm that SARS had subclinical infection among adults who had close contact to pediatric SARS cases.","Cao, Li; Wang, Tian-you; Chen, Hui-zhong; Qian, Yuan; Chen, Bo-wen; Fang, Ping; Sun, Yan-xiang; Zhu, Ru-nan; Deng, Jie; Zhao, Lin-qing; Mi, Jie; Zhang, Ting",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15631713/,408

All four possible combinations of activities reflecting E2 functions were found, i.e., N+F+, N-F-, N+F-, and N-F+. In addition, competitive binding studies with these monoclonal antibodies revealed two nonoverlapping antigenic regions. The first region, designated A, was recognized by antibodies which included each of the four functional types. Region B was identified by a single monoclonal antibody with N-F- activities. The existence of antibodies which only neutralize virus or only block viral-induced fusion implies that the structures on E2 which serve as targets for neutralization and which induce fusion are not identical. The critical determinants for neutralization and fusion must be closely related topographically on E2 since both N+F- and N-F+ antibodies recognize the same antigenic region.","Gilmore, W; Fleming, J O; Stohlman, S A; Weiner, L P",Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Developing safe and effective SARS-CoV vaccines is essential for us to prevent the possible reemergence of its epidemic. Previous experiences indicate that inactivated vaccine is conventional and more hopeful to be successfully developed. Immunogenicity evaluation of an experimental inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rabbits was conducted and reported in this paper. METHODS The large-scale cultured SARS-CoV F69 strain was inactivated with 0.4% formaldehyde and purified, then used as the immunogen combined with Freund's adjuvant. Eight adult New Zealand rabbits were immunized four times with this experimental inactivated vaccine. Twelve sets of rabbit serum were sampled from the third day to the seventy-fourth day after the first vaccination. The titers of specific anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody were determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the neutralizing antibody titers were detected with micro-cytopathic effect neutralization test. RESULTS Rapid and potent humoral immune responses were induced by the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in all the eight test rabbits. Titers of both specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody peaked at about six weeks after first vaccination, with the maximum value of 1:81 920 and 1:20 480, respectively. After that, serum antibody levels remained at a plateau or had a slight decrease, though two boosters were given in the succedent 4 to 5 weeks. Cross neutralization response existed between SARS-CoV F69 strain and Z2-Y3 strain. CONCLUSIONS The inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine made from F69 strain owns strong immunogenicity, and the cross neutralization response between the two different SARS-CoV strains gives a hint of the similar neutralizing epitopes, which provide stable bases for the development of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines.","Zhang, Chuan-Hai; Guo, Zhong-Min; Zheng, Huan-Ying; Lu, Jia-Hai; Wang, Yi-Fei; Yan, Xin-Ge; Zhao, Yong; DU, Xiong-Wei; Zhang, Xin; Fang, Ling; Ling, Wen-Hua; Qi, Shu-Yuan; Yu, Xin-Bing; Zhong, Nan-Shan",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15569476/,408

Previous studies demonstrated that the two terminal residues are important, and the charged residue (R227) in the penultimate position in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 M protein was suggested to participate in intermolecular interactions with negative charges in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. To determine the significance of the positive charge at position 227, we substituted the arginine with lysine (K), aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), or alanine (A) and studied these by reverse genetics in the context of a MHV full-length infectious clone. Viruses with wild-type phenotype were readily recovered with the K or A substitutions. In contrast, negative-charge substitutions were not tolerated as well. In all recovered R227D viruses the negative charge was replaced with heterologous residues resulting from apparent template switching during negative-strand synthesis of subgenomic RNA 7. An additional second-site compensatory V202I substitution was present in some viruses. Recovered R227E viruses had second-site changes within the M protein carboxy tail that were partially compensatory. Significantly, most of the second site changes in the R227E mutant viruses were previously shown to compensate for the removal of negative charges in the N protein. Our results strongly indicate that a positive charge is not absolutely required. It is clear that other regions within the tail must also be involved in helping mediate interactions between the M protein and the nucleocapsid.","Verma, Sandhya; Lopez, Lisa A; Bednar, Valerie; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329345/,408

Within a few days of infection, a strong and transient NK cell activation, characterized by enhanced IFN-gamma message expression and cytolysis, was observed. LDV triggered a large increase in serum IFN-gamma levels. Because NK cells and IFN-gamma may participate in the defence against virus infection, we analysed their possible role in the control of LDV titres with a new agglutination assay.

200897,Considerations for STI Clinics During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The positive-stranded RNA genome of the coronaviruses is translated from ORF1 to yield polyproteins that are proteolytically processed into intermediate and mature nonstructural proteins (nsps). Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) polyproteins incorporate 16 protein domains (nsps), with nsp1 and nsp2 being the most variable among the coronaviruses and having no experimentally confirmed or predicted functions in replication. To determine if nsp2 is essential for viral replication, MHV and SARS-CoV genome RNA was generated with deletions of the nsp2 coding sequence (MHVDeltansp2 and SARSDeltansp2, respectively). Infectious MHVDeltansp2 and SARSDeltansp2 viruses recovered from electroporated cells had 0.5 to 1 log10 reductions in peak titers in single-cycle growth assays, as well as a reduction in viral RNA synthesis that was not specific for any positive-stranded RNA species. The Deltansp2 mutant viruses lacked expression of both nsp2 and an nsp2-nsp3 precursor, but cleaved the engineered chimeric nsp1-nsp3 cleavage site as efficiently as the native nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site. Replication complexes in MHVDeltansp2-infected cells lacked nsp2 but were morphologically indistinguishable from those of wild-type MHV by immunofluorescence. nsp2 expressed in cells by stable retroviral transduction was specifically recruited to viral replication complexes upon infection with MHVDeltansp2. These results demonstrate that while nsp2 of MHV and SARS-CoV is dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, deletion of the nsp2 coding sequence attenuates viral growth and RNA synthesis. These findings also provide a system for the study of determinants of nsp targeting and function.","Graham, Rachel L; Sims, Amy C; Brockway, Sarah M; Baric, Ralph S; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227261/,408

A positive result using Tru-cut biopsy (TCB) and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has high diagnostic specificity, but information about the capacity of these techniques to correctly identify cats with FIP lesions is not available. OBJECTIVES The diagnostic sensitivity of TCB and FNAB for detecting liver and kidney histologic lesions caused by FIP was evaluated. METHODS TCB and FNAB specimens collected mainly at necropsy from 25 cats with FIP were analyzed. Diagnostic sensitivity was calculated on the basis of the number of false-negative and true-positive specimens, compared with the number of organs bearing histologic lesions of FIP. RESULTS Diagnostic sensitivity was higher for hepatic TCB (64%) and FNAB (82%) than for renal (39% and 42%, respectively) procedures. A high percentage of renal cytologic and TCB specimens were inadequate. Combined analysis of TCB and FNAB specimens collected from the same organ increased the diagnostic sensitivity for liver (86%) and kidney (48%). The sensitivity of immunohistochemical/cytochemical analysis was low (11-38% depending on the technique), probably due to variable distribution of feline coronavirus in the lesions. CONCLUSION Biopsy of liver and kidney can correctly identify FIP lesions. However, false-negative results or inadequate samples occur with moderate frequency, especially for immunochemical analysis.

203657,Survey of CAMHS clinicians about their experience of remote consultation: brief report,2021,"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","Szeto, Christopher; Chatzileontiadou, Demetra S M; Nguyen, Andrea T; Sloane, Hannah; Lobos, Christian A; Jayasinghe, Dhilshan; Halim, Hanim; Smith, Corey; Riboldi-Tunnicliffe, Alan; Grant, Emma J; Gras, Stephanie",iScience,,408

204841,Impact of COVID-19 on paramedicine students: A mixed methods study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations. There are two types of bruxism, awake bruxism and sleep bruxism. Awake bruxism is generally treated by dentists and maxilla-facial surgeons through several treatment modalities such as, counselling about triggers, relaxation, occlusal splints and botulinum toxin type A injections. METHODS: We will present the case of a 21-year-old woman presenting mood swings with a high level of anxiety and concentration difficulties since childhood. She also complained of awake bruxism. Intelligence was evaluated using The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated through a neuropsychology test. RESULTS: Intelligence evaluation showed normal intellectual function. Neuropsychology test showed a profile corresponding to ADHD. Bupropion XR 300 mg was initiated for ADHD. Pregabalin was prescribed for general anxiety syndrome. The patient reported a complete disappearance of awake bruxism at a daily dose of 375 mg, with no occlusal appliances. Following the improvement of the anxiety symptoms, the attempt to reduce the dose twice leading to the recurrence of bruxism. CONCLUSIONS: A 21 years old female treated with 375 mg daily doses of pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder experienced a significant reduction of daytime bruxism. More studies are needed to determine whether pregabalin has a long term effect against awake bruxism.","Tecco, Juan Martin; Tecco, Simona",Psychiatr Danub,,408
205798,"COVID-19, Psychological Well-being and Physical Activity Levels in Older Adults During the Nationwide Lockdown in Spain",2020,"BACKGROUND/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two teaching hospitals over a 3-month period (March 2010-June 2020) comparing severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) and subjected to awake prone position (PP) with those receiving standard care (SC). Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRâ¯=â¯0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pâ¯=â¯0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRâ¯=â¯0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pâ¯=â¯0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRâ¯=â¯0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pâ¯=â¯0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC. Although our results are intriguing, further randomized controlled trials are needed to answer all the open questions remaining pending about the real efficacy of PP in this setting.","Tonelli, Roberto; Pisani, Lara; Tabbì, Luca; Comellini, Vittoria; Prediletto, Irene; Fantini, Riccardo; Marchioni, Alessandro; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Bruzzi, Giulia; Manicardi, Linda; Busani, Stefano; Mussini, Cristina; Castaniere, Ivana; Bassi, Ilaria; Carpano, Marco; Tagariello, Federico; Corsi, Gabriele; d039,; Amico, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo; Nava, Stefano; Clini, Enrico","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,408

208264,COVID-19 pandemic: The testing times for healthcare workers,2021,"Objectives: Self-injurious behavior (SIB) refers to any repeated self-directed, non-suicidal, behavior that may cause or has the potential to cause physical harm to the person's body. Behavioral interventions provide the standard evidence-based treatments for SIB by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). Translating the proven effectiveness of behavioral interventions to treatment of self-injury in community settings by clinicians and caregivers has not been totally successful. The aim of the present study was to advance translational research by providing real-time telehealth consultation to a treatment team at a community-based mental health agency that provided inpatient and outpatient services to individuals with ASD and ID. Method: The participants of this single-case experimental study were three adolescents with ASD who had been referred for services because of their increasingly unmanageable SIB both at home and at school. The telehealth consultant provided real-time assistance to the treatment team within a translational model of care in the development and implementation of a behavior support plan and an informal mindfulness-based Soles of the Feet (SoF) program. Results: Both visual and statistical analyses demonstrated reductions in the frequency of SIB for all three adolescents, with overall clinically significant reductions only with the SoF intervention. Conclusion: The results of this translational study suggest that telehealth consultation might be a viable technological alternative in situations which preclude face-to-face consultation. Telehealth consultation could be one method of supporting people with behavioral difficulties during pandemics, such as COVID-19.","Singh, Nirbhay N; Lancioni, Giulio E; Medvedev, Oleg N; Hwang, Yoon-Suk; Myers, Rachel E",Adv Neurodev Disord,,408

To accomplish this, a compartmental model with eight batches (sub-population groups) has been proposed and the simulation of the set of differential equations has been conducted to show the effects of the various involved parameters. Also, to achieve more accurate results and closer to reality, the coefficients of a system of differential equations containing transmission rates, death rates, recovery rates and etc. have been proposed by some new step-functions viewpoint. Results: First of all, the efficiency of the proposed model has been shown for Iran and Italy, which completely denoted the flexibility of our model for predicting the epidemic progress and its moment behavior. The model has shown that the reopening plans and governmental measures directly affect the number of active cases of the disease. Also, it has specified that even releasing a small portion of the population (about 2-3 percent) can lead to a severe increase in active patients and consequently multiple waves in the disease progress. The effects of the healthcare capacities of the country have been obtained (quantitatively), which clearly specify the importance of this context. Control strategies including strict implementation of mitigation (reducing the transmission rates) and re-quarantine of some portion of population have been investigated and their efficiency has been shown.","Soltani, Kamran; Department, Ghader Rezazadeh Mechanical Engineering; Urmia,; Iran,; University, South Ural State; Chelyabinsk,; Federation, Russian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11716v1.pdf,408

A total of 3,672,238 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 254,045 deaths were reported globally up to May 7, 2020. However, approved antiviral agents for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 remain unavailable. Drug repurposing of approved antivirals against other viruses such as HIV or Ebola virus is one of the most practical strategies to develop effective antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. A combination of repurposed drugs can improve the efficacy of treatment, and structure-based drug design can be employed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2. This review discusses therapeutic strategies using promising antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, structural characterization of potentially therapeutic viral or host cellular targets associated with COVID-19 have been discussed to refine structure-based drug design strategies.","Jeong, Gi Uk; Song, Hanra; Yoon, Gun Young; Kim, Doyoun; Kwon, Young-Chan",Front Microbiol,,408

211084,Insights on COVID-19 From Community Health Worker State Leaders,2020,"BACKGROUND: Covid-status certification - certificates for those who test negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, test positive for antibodies, or who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 - has been proposed to enable safer access to a range of activities. Realising these benefits will depend in part upon the behavioural and social impacts of certification. The aim of this rapid review was to describe public attitudes towards certification, and its possible impact on uptake of testing and vaccination, protective behaviours, and crime. METHOD: A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, pre-print databases, and the grey literature, from 2000 to December 2020. Studies were included if they measured attitudes towards or behavioural consequences of health certificates based on one of three indices of Covid-19 status: test-negative result for current infectiousness, test-positive for antibodies conferring natural immunity, or vaccination(s) conferring immunity. RESULTS: Thirty-three papers met the inclusion criteria, only three of which were rated as low risk of bias. Public attitudes were generally favourable towards the use of immunity certificates for international travel, but unfavourable towards their use for access to work and other activities. A significant minority was strongly opposed to the use of certificates of immunity for any purpose. The limited evidence suggested that intention to get vaccinated varied with the activity enabled by certification or vaccination (e.g., international travel). Where vaccination is seen as compulsory this could lead to unwillingness to accept a subsequent vaccination. There was some evidence that restricting access to settings and activities to those with antibody test certificates may lead to deliberate exposure to infection in a minority. Behaviours that reduce transmission may decrease upon health certificates based on any of the three indices of Covid-19 status, including physical distancing and handwashing. CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence suggests that health certification in relation to COVID-19 - outside of the context of international travel - has the potential for harm as well as benefit. Realising the benefits while minimising the harms will require real-time evaluations allowing modifications to maximise the potential contribution of certification to enable safer access to a range of activities.","Drury, John; Mao, Guanlan; John, Ann; Kamal, Atiya; Rubin, G James; Stott, Clifford; Vandrevala, Tushna; Marteau, Theresa M",BMC Public Health,,408

For biomaterials in bone reconstruction, the promotion of osteogenic differentiation and reduction of inflammation are desirable. Fibrillar coatings are interesting because of fibrils' high surface area-volume ratio, aiding adsorption and adhesion. Fibrils also serve as a matrix for the immobilization of biomolecules with biological activity, such as the phenolic compound phloroglucinol (PG), the subunit of marine polyphenols. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of PG coatings on fibroblast- and osteoblast-like cells to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants. Collagen fibril coatings, containing PG at low and high concentrations, were produced on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds generated by additive manufacturing (AM). These coatings, especially PG-enriched coatings, reduced hydrophobicity and modulated the behavior of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cell lines. Both osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells spread and adhered well on PG-enriched coatings. Coatings significantly reduced the inflammatory response. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was promoted by collagen coatings with a high PG concentration. Thus, the enrichment of collagen fibril coatings with PG is a promising strategy to improve Ti6Al4V implants for bone contact in orthopedics and dentistry and is worthy of further investigation.","Mieszkowska, Anna; Beaumont, Harrison; Martocq, Laurine; Koptyug, Andrey; Surmeneva, Maria A; Surmenev, Roman A; Naderi, Javad; Douglas, Timothy E L; Gurzawska-Comis, Katarzyna A",,,408

213617,Substance consumption styles during the COVID-19 lockdown for socially integrated people who use drugs,2021,"Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the thrombotic events reported in COVID-19 patients, but underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Circulating levels of the coagulation cascade activator PAI-1 are substantially higher in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory dysfunction than in patients with bacterial-sepsis and ARDS. Indeed, the elevation of PAI-1 is recognized as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we report that recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S1 stimulated robust production of PAI-1 by HPMEC. We examined the role of protein degradation in this SARS-CoV-2-S1 induction of PAI-1 and found that the proteasomal degradation inhibitor bortezomib inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S1 mediated changes in PAI-1. Our data further show that bortezomib upregulated KLF2, a shear-stress-regulated transcription factor that suppresses PAI-1 expression. Aging and metabolic disorders are known to increase the mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients. We therefore examined the role of ZMPSTE24, a metalloprotease with a demonstrated role in host defense against RNA viruses that is decreased in the elderly and in metabolic syndrome, in the induction of PAI-1 in HPMEC by SARS-CoV-2-S1. Indeed, overexpression of ZMPSTE24 blunted enhancement of PAI-1 production in spike protein-exposed HPMEC. Additionally, we found that membrane expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 was reduced by ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage and shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, leading to accumulation of ACE2 decoy fragments that may bind SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in COVID-19 patients.

213827,How COVID-19 Is Changing U.S. Health Care Delivery,2020,"Various studies indicate that vaccination, especially with pneumococcal vaccines, protects against symptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death. This paper explores the possibility that pneumococcal vaccines in particular, but perhaps other vaccines as well, contain antigens that might be cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Comparison of the glycosylation structures of SARS-CoV-2 with the polysaccharide structures of pneumococcal vaccines yielded no obvious similarities. However, while pneumococcal vaccines are primarily composed of capsular polysaccharides, some are conjugated to cross-reacting material CRM197, a modified diphtheria toxin, and all contain about three percent protein contaminants, including the pneumococcal surface proteins PsaA, PspA and probably PspC. All of these proteins have very high degrees of similarity, using very stringent criteria, with several SARS-CoV-2 proteins including the spike protein, membrane protein and replicase 1a. CRM197 is also present in Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningitis vaccines. Equivalent similarities were found at lower rates, or were completely absent, among the proteins in diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and poliovirus vaccines. Notably, PspA and PspC are highly antigenic and new pneumococcal vaccines based on them are currently in human clinical trials so that their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 disease is easily testable.","Root-Bernstein, Robert",,,408

The impact of fraud is complex and has varying degrees depending on political and financial institutional structures of a country. In this paper, we investigate the combined effect of economic and non-economic variables on fraud using a sample of 41 developed, in transition, and developing European countries. The data cover the period July 2014–December 2020. Panel data techniques of pooled estimation and the dynamic panel data/generalized method of moments (DPD/GMM) is used, keeping in view the endogeneity perspective. Nevertheless, two-way impacts of fixed effect model estimation—cross-sectional and time-based (panel) effects (alternatively)—are used for analyzing the relationship among the given variables, based on Hausman specification test results. Empirical results of panel data extended REM and FEM approaches with country-specific cross-sectional effects showing that political stability, economic freedom, poverty, and GDP significantly affect fraud proliferation. Political stability is appraised to be the most scoring determinant of fraud incidence in a country.","Bashir, Ahmad Ciupac-Ulici Maria Daniela-Georgeta Beju",Risks,,408

The two cell lines were treated with miR-27a-3p mimics or inhibitors or corresponding negative control (NC), respectively. The changes were investigated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, Western blot (WB), colony formation assay, and flow cytometry assay. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay was analyzed to verify the downstream target gene of miR-27a-3p. Further investigation in the correlation between miR-27a-3p and BTG2 was launched by WB, flow cytometry assay, and CCK-8 assay. The expression of Akt and p-Akt was detected by WB. Key Findings: Significantly higher miR-27a-3p expression was confirmed in MCF-7/ADR as compared with sensitive cell line MCF-7 (P<0.05). The down-regulation of miR-27a-3p in MCF-7/ADR enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to adriamycin treatment, decreased multidrug resistance gene 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/P-gp) expression, enhanced the apoptosis-related proteins expression, increased adriamycin-induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation as compared to NC groups (P<0.05). The up-regulation of miR-27a-3p in MCF-7 showed the opposite results. BTG2 is identified as a direct target of miR-27a-3p and its down-regulation reversed ADR-resistance. BTG2 treatment exhibited inhibitory effect on PI3K/Akt pathway in MCF-7/ADR cells. Significance: miR-27a-3p might be associated with resistance of breast cancer cells to adriamycin treatments, modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting BTG2 and promoting the PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells. miR-27a-3p/BTG2 axis might be a potential therapeutic target for clinical BC resistance.","Zhu, Bei; Chen, Weixian; Fu, Yue; Cui, Xiaohan; Jin, Lei; Chao, Jiadeng; Yun, Xiao; Gao, Peng; Shan, Shiting; Li, Jun; Yin, Xu; Zhu, Chunfu; Qin, Xihu",Onco Targets Ther,,408

Social determinants of health, structural racism, and implicit bias play major roles in preventing health equity. We begin with the larger picture and then focus on examples of systemic and health inequities and their solutions that have special relevance to allergy-immunology. We propose a 4-prong approach to address inequities that requires (1) racial and ethnic inclusivity in research with respect to both participants and investigators, (2) diversity in all aspects of training and practice, (3) improvement in communication between clinicians and patients, and (4) awareness of the social determinants of health. By communication we mean sensitivity to the role of language, cultural background, and health beliefs in physician-patient interactions and provision of training and equipment so that the use of telecommunication can be a resource for all patients. The social determinants of health are the social factors that affect health and the success of health care, such as adequacy of housing and access to nutritious foods. Using this 4-prong approach we can overcome health disparities.","Ogbogu, Princess U; Capers, Quinn; Apter, Andrea J",J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract,,408

However, how and to what extent people respond to chabots' self-disclosure remain less known. In this work, we designed a social chatbot with three self-disclosure levels that conducted small talks and provided relevant recommendations to people. 372 MTurk participants were randomized to one of the four groups with different self-disclosure levels to converse with the chatbot on two topics, movies, and COVID-19. We found that people's self-disclosure level was strongly reciprocal to a chatbot's self-disclosure level. Chatbots' self-disclosure also positively impacted engagement and users' perception of the bot and led to a more effective recommendation such that participants enjoyed and agreed more with the recommendations.","Liang, Kai-Hui; Shi, Weiyan; Oh, Yoojung; Zhang, Jingwen; Yu, Zhou",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01666v1.pdf,408

Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 3011 Hong Kong Chinese aged &#8805; 15 years (mean = 44, 55% females) between February 25 and April 29 2020. Respondents reported social capital (perceived interpersonal trust, social harmony, and sense of belonging), income change since the outbreak (loss vs. gain/no change), depressive symptoms, preventive behaviors, and demographics. Controlling for sociodemographics, lack of perceived interpersonal trust was associated with probable depression and avoiding contact with people with respiratory symptoms. Lack of perceived sense of belonging was associated with probable depression and decreased odds of adopting preventive behaviors. Lack of perceived social harmony was associated with probable depression and increased odds of used face masks among respondents with income loss only. Our results suggest that social capital is related to lower risk of depression and to higher chance of used face masks particularly among those experiencing income loss related to COVID-19. Prevention of mental health problems and promotion of effective preventive behaviors could be implemented by focusing on support for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Li, Tsz Wai; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun; Goodwin, Robin; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Liang, Li; Liu, Huinan; Hou, Wai Kai",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,408

218078,Grief and the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults,2020,"PURPOSE: Experts have recommended exercise for improved sleep, but often with the caveat that one should avoid nighttime exercise. The aim of this study was to challenge this recommendation in a sample who might be most prone to sleep impairment after nighttime exercise. The secondary aims were to assess whether or not post-treatment sleep was correlated with anxiolytic effects or downregulation of body temperature. METHODS: Twelve sedentary adults with insomnia completed two treatments (separated by 2-5 days) in counterbalanced order: (1) 30 min of moderate treadmill exercise (60-70% maximum heart rate) + 15 min of moderate resistance exercise and (2) a control treatment (reading). Each treatment was completed 2 h before bedtime and followed by a 10-min shower, a light snack, 8 h of polysomnographic recording, and a sleep questionnaire. State anxiety was assessed before and 30 min after each treatment and 10 min before bedtime. Body temperature was assessed from pre-exercise to wake time. RESULTS: No significant treatment differences in sleep were found, and Hedges g paired comparisons indicated small effect sizes; however, two participants had severely disturbed objective sleep following exercise. Significant correlations were found between change in state anxiety from pre-exercise to bedtime and TST (r = 0.69, p = 0.03). Stage 1 (r = 0.67, p = 0.03), WASO (r = 0.69, p = 0.03), and sleep efficiency (r = 0.66, p = 0.02). No significant correlations were found of sleep with temperature decline. CONCLUSIONS: Profound sleep disturbance after exercise in some participants, and no marked sleep improvement in the others, provides some support for caution regarding late-night exercise for sedentary individuals with insomnia.","Youngstedt, Shawn D; Ito, Wakako; Passos, Giselle Soares; Santana, Marcos Gonçalves; Youngstedt, Julia M",Sleep breath,,408

Concerns have been raised about whether home confinement may have worsened the burden of myopia owing to substantially decreased time spent outdoors and increased screen time at home. Objective: To investigate the refractive changes and prevalence of myopia in school-aged children during the COVID-19 home confinement. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cross-sectional study using school-based photoscreenings in 123â¯535 children aged 6 to 13 years from 10 elementary schools in Feicheng, China, was conducted. The study was performed during 6 consecutive years (2015-2020). Data were analyzed in July 2020. Exposures: Noncycloplegic photorefraction was examined using a photoscreener device. Main Outcomes and Measures: The spherical equivalent refraction was recorded for each child and the prevalence of myopia for each age group during each year was calculated. The mean spherical equivalent refraction and prevalence of myopia were compared between 2020 (after home confinement) and the previous 5 years for each age group. Results: Of the 123â¯535 children included in the study, 64â¯335 (52.1%) were boys. A total of 194â¯904 test results (389â¯808 eyes) were included in the analysis. A substantial myopic shift (approximately -0.3 diopters [D]) was found in the 2020 school-based photoscreenings compared with previous years (2015-2019) for younger children aged 6 (-0.32 D), 7 (-0.28 D), and 8 (-0.29 D) years. The prevalence of myopia in the 2020 photoscreenings was higher than the highest prevalence of myopia within 2015-2019 for children aged 6 (21.5% vs 5.7%), 7 (26.2% vs 16.2%), and 8 (37.2% vs 27.7%) years. The differences in spherical equivalent refraction and the prevalence of myopia between 2020 and previous years were minimal in children aged 9 to 13 years. Conclusions and Relevance: Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be associated with a significant myopic shift for children aged 6 to 8 years according to 2020 school-based photoscreenings. However, numerous limitations warrant caution in the interpretation of these associations, including use of noncycloplegic refractions and lack of orthokeratology history or ocular biometry data. Younger children's refractive status may be more sensitive to environmental changes than older ages, given the younger children are in a critical period for the development of myopia.","Wang, Jiaxing; Li, Ying; Musch, David C; Wei, Nan; Qi, Xiaoli; Ding, Gang; Li, Xue; Li, Jing; Song, Linlin; Zhang, Ying; Ning, Yuxian; Zeng, Xiaoyu; Hua, Ning; Li, Shuo; Qian, Xuehan",JAMA ophthalmol.

218524,COVID-19 in Germany and China: mitigation versus elimination strategy,2021,"BACKGROUND: A novel disease poses special challenges for informatics solutions. Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","Neuraz, Antoine; Lerner, Ivan; Digan, William; Paris, Nicolas; Tsopra, Rosy; Rogier, Alice; Baudoin, David; Cohen, Kevin Bretonnel; Burgun, Anita; Garcelon, Nicolas; Rance, Bastien",J Med Internet Res,,408

However, diagnosis of mental health disorders is a challenging problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral patterns. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of mental health problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a plethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep neural networks (DNNs) points towards a possible solution. However, disease diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, remains a challenging problem. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data, MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the synthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different data partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from 74 individuals. We conduct data instance level and patient level evaluations. MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%, respectively, for classifications between healthy instances and schizoaffective disorder instances, major depressive disorder instances, and bipolar disorder instances. At the patient level, MHDeep DNNs achieve an accuracy of 100%, 100%, and 90.0% for the three mental health disorders, respectively.","Hassantabar, Shayan; Zhang, Joe; Yin, Hongxu; Jha, Niraj K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10435v1.pdf,408

METHOD: Case study. Data were obtained via a questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants, including 25 singers, 1 conductor and 1 accompanist attended a choir practice on March 12, 2020. The practice was indoor and took place in a non ventilated space of 45 m2. No choir member reported having been symptomatic for COVID-19 between March 2 and March 12.The mean age of the participants was 66.9 (range 35-86) years. The secondary attack rate was 70%: 19/27 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 from 1 to 12 days after the rehearsal with a median of 5.1 days. Thirty-six percent of the cases needed a hospitalization (7/19), and 21% (4/19) were admitted to an ICU. The index cases were asymptomatic and possibly multiple. CONCLUSION: In the absence of valid barrier measures to prevent COVID-19 transmission, indoor choir practice should be suspended during the SARSCoV-2 surging phases.

223271,Covid-19 and Health Care's Digital Revolution,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have depicted the rate, patterns, and predictions of cases of this pandemic disease. To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts a grave scenario of decreasing survival rates in various regions of India and shows variability in these rates by age and sex. In essence, we can safely conclude that the critical appraisal of the survival rate and thorough analysis of patient data in this study equipped us to identify risk groups and perform comparative studies of various segments in India.

224577,Challenging behavior of nursing home residents during COVID-19 measures in the Netherlands,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronavirus during pregnancy. In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking. RESULTS: From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

The intent of this design is to create statistical information about confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in an academic institution in Brooklyn, New York from March to May 2020.Results: A total of 1413 patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 1413 patients, 520 Expired, 40.5% were males, and 33% were females, p = 0.004. Male patients had high mortality at a rate that is statistically significant. For race of those ‘Expired’, 38.3% white, 34.2% Black, 28.2% Asian, and Unknown 43.6%, showing statistical significance at p = 0.050. The most common co-morbidities for those not-Expired versus Expired: DM, 44.6% expired versus 55.6% not-expired, HTN, 77.1% versus 22.9%, and CAD, 47.9% versus 52.1%. Comparing the data of COVID-19 patients without surgery and with those who had surgery, it was observed that 53% of those who did not have surgery went ‘Home’ versus 38.6%, of those with surgery who could not. Further examining those without surgery versus those with surgery: 3.4% versus 13.3% discharge to ‘Rehab’, for ‘Other discharge’ destinations 5.9% versus 14.5%, and for ‘Expired’ 37.1% versus 31.3%. Overall, the presence of surgery had a significant impact on COVID-19 patients discharge destinations at p = &lt; 0.001.Conclusions: The implications of change in the setting of our current clinical practice therefore require forbearance, training, preparedness, and education to efficiently maintain our essential surgical services.","Sharon Desales, Baoas Rucinski James Zenilman Michael",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,,408

225616,Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers and the General Population During the COVID-19 in Italy,2020,"Plants frequently suffer from environmental stresses in nature and have evolved sophisticated and efficient mechanisms to cope with the stresses. To balance between growth and stress response, plants are equipped with efficient means to switch off the activated stress responses when stresses diminish. We previously revealed such an off-switch mechanism conferred by Arabidopsis PARAQUAT TOLERANCE 3 (AtPQT3) encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, knockout of which significantly enhances resistance to abiotic stresses. To explore whether the rice homolog OsPQT3 is functionally conserved, we generated three knockout mutants with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The OsPQT3 knockout mutants (ospqt3) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1. More importantly, the ospqt3 mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions. We further showed that OsPQT3 expression rapidly decreased in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3 does. Taken together, these results show that OsPQT3 is functionally well conserved in rice as an off-switch in stress response as AtPQT3 in Arabidopsis. Therefore, PQT3 locus provides a promising candidate for crop improvement with enhanced stress resistance by gene editing technology. This article is protected by copyright.

226345,Implications of telehealth and digital care solutions during COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative literature review,2020,"Provision of supplementary food for garden birds is practiced on a large scale in multiple countries. While this resource has benefits for wild bird populations, concern has been expressed regarding the potential for contamination of foodstuffs by mycotoxins, and the implications this might have for wildlife health. We investigated whether aflatoxin (AF) and ochratoxin A (OA) residues are present in foodstuffs sold for wild bird consumption at point of sale in Great Britain using high pressure liquid chromatography analyses. The hypothesis that production of these mycotoxins occurs in British climatic conditions, or under storage conditions after the point of sale, was tested under experimental conditions but was not proved by our study. While the majority of peanut samples were negative for AF residues, 10% (10/98) of samples at point of sale and 11% (13/119) of those across the storage and climate exposure treatment replicates contained AFB1 that exceeded the maximum permitted limit of 20 µg/kg. No significant difference was found in the detection of either mycotoxin between branded and non-branded products. The clinical significance, if any, of exposure of wild birds to mycotoxins requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the precautionary principle should be adopted and best practice steps to reduce the likelihood of wild bird exposure to mycotoxins are recommended.","Lawson, B; Robinson, R A; Parmar, M; Killick, R; Cunningham, A A; MacDonald, S J",Sci Total Environ,,408

228485,Strategies for Management of Peritoneal Dialysis Patients in Singapore during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Poor postural stability is associated with chronic ankle instability. Previous research showed an effect of foot type on postural stability. However, the specific effect of supinated feet remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: Our study aimed to assess the effect of foot type on postural stability, while taking potential confounding effects of body mass and body height into account. METHODS: Forty-three healthy participants between 18 and 40 years old performed barefooted single leg stance tests with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) on solid ground, and on a balance board (BB). Foot type was determined from pressure recordings during gait, using the arch index. Ground reaction forces were measured using a force plate. Outcome measures were Center of Pressure Velocity (COPV) divided by body height, and the Horizontal Ground Reaction Force (HGRF) divided by body mass. Generalized Estimating Equations models assessed the differences between supinated, normal and pronated feet during EO, EC and on a BB. RESULTS: During EO an interaction between supinated feet and body mass showed an increase of COPV with 0.03 × 10-2 1/s per kilogram of mass relative to normal feet (p = .03). During EC this interaction was more pronounced with 0.22 × 10-2 1/s increase per kilogram mass (p < .01). The HGRF did not differ between foot types in any of the conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: Supinated feet have a larger increase in COPV compared to normal feet with increasing mass when standing on solid ground during EO and EC. This indicates that people with supinated feet and a higher mass are less stable during single leg stance.

This study analysed 95 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, including 62 moderate COVID-19 patients, 21 severe COVID-19 patients and 12 critical COVID-19 patients (6 patients died, all critical). The results showed that the mean serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels were over four times higher in severe patients than in moderate patients and were over eight times higher in critical patients than in moderate patients. For discharged patients, both high-normal PCT levels and abnormal PCT levels decreased during recovery. However, in death cases, serum levels of PCT increased as the disease worsened. We demonstrate that PCT may be an indicator of disease severity in COVID-19 and may contribute to determining the severity of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, serial PCT measurements may be useful in predicting the prognosis.","Hu, Rui; Han, Chaofei; Pei, Shiyao; Yin, Mingzhu; Chen, Xiang",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,408
229036,How COVID-19 has impacted integrated care practice: lessons from the frontlines,2021,"Background: With the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), appropriate training for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel on personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential. We aimed: 1) to examine the change in proportions of EMS personnel reporting awareness of and training in PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) to determine factors associated with reporting these outcomes. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from October 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 from currently working, nationally certified EMS personnel (n = 15,339), assessing N95 respirator fit testing; training in air purified respirators (APR) or powered APR (PAPR) use; and training on PPE use for chemical, biological, and nuclear (CBN) threats. We used an interrupted time series analysis to determine changes in proportions of EMS personnel reporting training per week, using the date of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) initial EMS guidance (February 6, 2020) as the interruption. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to understand factors associated with each outcome. Results: We found high awareness of N95 respirators (99%) and APR/PAPR (91%), but only 61% reported N95 fit testing and 64% reported training on PPE for CBN threats in the prior 12 months. There was a significant, positive slope change after CDC guidance for N95 respirator fit testing, and significant post-interruption mean increases for fit testing (0.9%, 95% CI 0.6-1.1%), APR/PAPR training (0.3%, 95% CI 0.2-0.5%), and PPE for CBN threats training (0.6%, 95% CI 0.3-0.9%). Factors consistently associated with lower odds of awareness/training included part-time employment, providing 9-1-1 response service, working at a non-fire-based EMS agency, and working in a rural setting. Conclusions: CDC guidance on COVID-19 for EMS may have increased N95 fit testing and training, but there remain substantial gaps in training on PPE use among EMS personnel. As the pandemic continues in our communities, EMS agencies should be supported in efforts to adequately prepare their staff.","Cash, Rebecca E; Rivard, Madison K; Camargo, Carlos A; Powell, Jonathan R; Panchal, Ashish R",Prehosp Emerg Care,,408

The present study was conducted to assess the general public's awareness of COVID-19 and its association with mental health, dietary habits, and physical activity. A web-based survey was conducted to gather information about demographics, knowledge about COVID-19, dietary habits, mental health, and anthropometry among the general public of Pakistan. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression were used for data analysis. The majority of the participants were suffering from anxiety (71.0%) and depression (52.0%) during the COVID-19 pandemic; 32.4% of participants had poor COVID-19-related knowledge. COVID-19 lockdown reduced the physical activity of 66.9% of participants and increased weight of 38.8% of the survey participants. Demographic variables, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, family type, and geographical location, were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Depression was inversely associated with COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.05). Healthy changes in dietary habits including decreased consumption of fast foods, soft and cola drinks, fruit drinks, cooked meat (outside the home), sugar, and fats, and were associated with increased knowledge of COVID-19. Vitamin C and immunity-boosting supplement consumption were significantly associated with increased knowledge regarding COVID-19 (< 0.05). Inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and the presence of anxiety and depression were found among most of the study participants. There is a need to conduct educational seminars to limit the health consequences resulting from COVID-19 lockdown.","Ali, Ahmad; Sohaib, Muhammad; Iqbal, Sanaullah; Hayat, Khezar; Khan, Azmat Ullah; Rasool, Muhammad Fawad",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,408

230861,Changes in Elder Abuse Risk Factors Reported by Caregivers of Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Today, over 80% of global trade is seaborne. In a world of global supply chains and complex industrial development processes, seaports and port operators play an integral role of utmost importance and act as an incentive to the development of the marine economy and particularly, the national economy in general. Most importantly, the supply chain and demand shocks of Covid-19 on container ports and the container shipping industry have intensified competition among terminal operators. Thus, it is imperative that managers evaluate competitiveness by measuring their past and current performance efficiency indexes. In so doing, we present a hybrid data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that combines the DEA Malmquist method and the epsilon-based measure (EBM) for the first time to address the issue of performance evaluation of seaport terminal operators. The applicability of the proposed hybrid approach is illustrated with a case study of the top 14 seaport companies in Vietnam. First, the Malmquist model is used to assess the total productivity growth rates of the companies, and its decomposition into technical efficiency change (catch-up) and technological investment (frontier-shift). Second, the EBM model is used to calculate the efficiency and inefficiency score of each company. Besides indicating the best-performing companies from certain aspects during the research period (2015–2020), the results reflect that the gap of applying the EBM method in the field of the maritime industry was successfully addressed, and together with the Malmquist model, the integrated framework can be an effective and equitable evaluation model for any area. Furthermore, the managerial implication provides a useful guideline for practitioners in the maritime sector in improving their operational efficacy and helps customers in selecting the best seaport companies in the outsourcing strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

We aim to determine whether racial/ethnic differences exist in wait times for children presenting to PEDs and examine between-site and within-site differences. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study for PED encounters in 2016 using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry, an aggregated deidentified electronic health registry comprising 7 PEDs. Patient encounters were included among all patients 18 years or younger at the time of the ED visit. We evaluated differences in emergency department wait time (time from arrival to first medical evaluation) considering patient race/ethnicity as the exposure. RESULTS: Of 448,563 visits, median wait time was 35 minutes (interquartile range, 17-71 minutes). Compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and other race children waited 27%, 33%, and 12% longer, respectively. These differences were attenuated after adjusting for triage acuity level, mode of arrival, sex, age, insurance, time of day, and month [adjusted median wait time ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.11 (1.10-1.12) for NHB, 1.12 (1.11-1.13) for Hispanic, and 1.05 (1.03-1.06) for other race children compared with NHW children]. Differences in wait time for NHB and other race children were no longer significant after adjusting for clinical site. Fully adjusted median wait times among Hispanic children were longer compared with NHW children [1.04 (1.03-1.05)]. CONCLUSIONS: In unadjusted analyses, non-White children experienced longer PED wait times than NHW children. After adjusting for illness severity, patient demographics, and overcrowding measures, wait times for NHB and other race children were largely determined by site of care. Hispanic children experienced longer within-site and between-site wait times compared with NHW children. Additional research is needed to understand structures and processes of care contributing to wait time differences between sites that disproportionately impact non-White patients.","Johnson, Tiffani J; Goyal, Monika K; Lorch, Scott A; Chamberlain, James M; Bajaj, Lalit; Alessandrini, Evaline A; Simmons, Timothy; Casper, T Charles; Olsen, Cody S; Grundmeier, Robert W; Alpern, Elizabeth R",Pediatr. emerg. care,,408

234079,COVID-19 in Africa: care and protection for frontline healthcare workers,2020,"Background/Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected all aspects of inpatient hospital medicine with patients admitted from level 1 (general medical wards) to level 3 (intensive care). Often, there are subtle physiological differences in these cohorts of patients. In particular, in intensive care, patients tend to be younger and have increased disease severity. Data, to date, has combined outcomes from medical and intensive care cohorts, or looked exclusively at intensive care. We looked solely at the level 1 (medical) cohort to identify their clinical characteristics and predictors of outcome. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to a central London teaching hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from 23rd March to 7th April 2020 identified from the hospital electronic database. Any patients who required level 2 or 3 care were excluded. Results: A total of 229 patients were included for analysis. Increased age and frailty scores were associated with increased 30-day mortality. Reduced renal function and elevated troponin blood levels are also associated with poor outcome. Baseline observations showed that increased oxygen requirement was predictive for mortality. A trend of increased mortality with lower diastolic blood pressure was noted. Lymphopenia was not shown to be related to mortality. Conclusion: Urea and creatinine are the best predictors of mortality in the level 1 cohort. Unlike previous intensive care data, lymphopenia is not predictive of mortality. We suggest that these factors be considered when prognosticating and for resource allocation for the treatment and escalation of care for patients with COVID-19 infection.","Moledina, Saadiq M; Maini, Alexander A; Gargan, Alice; Harland, William; Jenney, Heloise; Phillips, Georgina; Thomas, Kate; Chauhan, Devkishan; Fertleman, Michael",Int J Gen Med,,408

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11th. 2020. Patients affected by COVID-19 may present with subtle, specific symptoms, but the sudden onset of life-threatening acute respiratory failure is not uncommon. The peculiarities of the disease combined with the single patient's comorbidities, e.g. advanced age and cardiovascular diseases, plus hypoxia and hypotension secondary to ARDS, and multiorgan failure. may lead to unexpected difficulties in the case of tracheal intubation. The occurrence of the 'Cannot-Intubate-Cannot-Oxygenate' (CICO) scenario in COVID-19 patients represents a hazard not only for the patients but also for the assisting healthcare workers due to the high risk of aerosol-generating infected particles during conventional rescue airway procedures. While international consensus guidelines on the management of CICO scenario in COVID-19 patients are still lacking. there is evidence that both scalpel cricothyrotomy (CT) and open surgical tracheotomy (OST) represent valid alternatives for the establishment of a front-of-neck emergency airway. Primary CT requires a staged conversion to formal tracheotomy;conversely;OST represents a definitive mastery of the airway in COVID-19 patients in case of prolonged mechanical ventilation dependency, avoiding a second procedure and further exposure to aerosols. Furthermore, in patients with facial trauma and/or head and neck tumors, OST allows obtaining safe airway control. In the context of the current pandemic, emergency OST procedure in SARS-CoV-2 positives (or with unknown status) requires adequate arrangements and the use of proper personal protective equipment to limit risks for clinicians.","Muriana, P.; Ciriaco, P.; Carretta, A.; Negri, G.",Signa Vitae,,408
235918,Virtual Group Exercises and Psychological Status among Community-Dwelling Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Feasibility Study,2021,"Among at-risk groups for psychological distress in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pregnant women might be especially vulnerable. Identifying subgroups of pregnant women at high risk of poor adaptation might optimize clinical screening and intervention, which could, in turn, contribute to mitigating the potentially devastating effects of prenatal stress on mothers and fetus. Level of personality functioning may be a good indicator of who may be more vulnerable to distress in challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, as adults with high levels of personality dysfunction may experience significant difficulties in mentalizing threatening situations. The aims of the present study are (a) to determine the impact of level of personality pathology on affective, behavioral, and thought problems in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) to test a model where mentalization of trauma mediates the impact of personality pathology on symptomatology. Data from 1,207 French-Canadian pregnant women recruited through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Latent profile analysis, using the Criterion A elements of the alternative model for personality disorders (Identity, Self-Direction, Empathy, Intimacy) as latent indicators, yielded four profiles: Healthy, Mild Self-Impairment, Intimacy Impairment, and Personality Disorder. Profiles showed significant associations with diverse indicators of symptomatology. Mediation models showed both direct and indirect (through mentalization of trauma) significant associations between level of personality functioning and affective/behavioral/thought problems. Results have clinical implications on prophylactic measures for at-risk pregnant women, especially in challenging contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

237904,Risk Perception and Hesitancy Toward COVID-19 Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers and Staff at a Medical College in Nepal,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is an association between acuity level of care (ALC), case fatality and length of stay in patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. DESIGN: A hospital-based observational follow-up study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Service of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan, from 26 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, aged &#8805;18 years. METHODS: ALC was categorised into low, intermediate and high level and patients were triaged using the standard emergency severity illness score. All patients were followed until the end of hospital admission for the outcome of case fatality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 822 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period and 699 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.5 years and 67% were males; 50.4% were triaged to low, 42.5% to intermediate and 7.2% to high acuity care. The overall case-fatality rate was 11.6%, with the highest (52%) in high acuity level followed by 16.2% in intermediate and 2% in low acuity care. Acuity level was associated with case fatality, with an HR (95% CI) of 5.0 (2.0 to 12.1) for high versus low acuity care and an HR of 2.7 (1.2, 6.4) for intermediate versus low acuity care, after adjusting for age, sex and common comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic lung disease. Similarly, acuity level was also associated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: High and intermediate acuity level is associated with higher case fatality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. In resource-limited settings where the provision of high acuity care is limited, the intermediate care acuity could serve as a useful strategy to treat relatively less critical patients with COVID-19.","Almas, Aysha; Mushtaq, Zain; Moller, Jette",BMJ Open,,408

Previously, the accuracy of the quantitative LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 antigen test was demonstrated using samples collected retrospectively. In this study, the LUMIPULSE antigen test was clinically validated using prospective samples. METHODS: In total, 1033 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 1033 individuals, and an additional 275 follow-up samples were collected from 43 patients who subsequently tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 1308 samples were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and the antigen test. The antibody response was investigated for patients with discordant results to clarify if seroconversion had occurred. RESULTS: RT-qPCR identified 990 samples as negative and 43 as positive, while the antigen test identified 992 samples as negative, 37 as positive and four as inconclusive. The overall concordance rate was 99.7% (1026/1029). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 92.5% (37/40), 100% (989/989), 100% (37/37) and 99.7% (989/992), respectively, after exclusion of the four inconclusive results. The kappa coefficient was 0.960 (95% confidence interval 0.892-0.960), suggesting excellent agreement between the two tests. Seropositivity in five of seven patients with discordant results suggested that the discrepancy was caused by samples collected during the late phase of infection. Using follow-up samples, correlation was observed between the antigen level and the viral load or cycle threshold value. The concordance rate between these test results tended to be high among samples collected 0-9 days after symptom onset, but this decreased gradually in samples collected thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrated that the LUMIPULSE antigen test is a highly accurate diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Maejima, Makoto; Shibusawa, Masahiro; Amemiya, Kenji; Nagakubo, Yuki; Hosaka, Kazuhiro; Sueki, Hitomi; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Miyashita, Yoshihiro; Omata, Masao",Int J Infect Dis,,408

We show that under various assumptions and for various natural objectives this optimization problem is NP-hard, and in some cases even hard to approximate. Furthermore, we also show that given a fixed central bank bailout objective, banks in the network can make new debt contracts to increase their own market value in the event of a bailout (at the expense of the central bank).","Egressy, Beni; Wattenhofer, Roger",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12315v1.pdf,408

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of bilateral orchidopexy on serum inhibin-B and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). METHODS: A cohort study including 208 bilateral cryptorchid boys (median age: 1.7 year) was evaluated with serum inhibin-B and FSH in relation to histological parameters. Based on the fertility potential, the boys were divided into three subgroups. At follow-up (median age: 2.7 years) the boys were evaluated with FSH and in case of inhibin-B using multiple of the median (MoM). RESULTS: Inhibin-B MoM improved significantly at follow-up. In 32 boys with high FSH at orchidopexy 63% normalized FSH and 59% increased MoM inhibin-B, but 31% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. In 105 boys with transient hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 52% increased inhibin-B MoM but 31% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. In 71 boys with normal FSH, inhibin-B, and G/T, 54% increased inhibin-B MoM and 15% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. The effect of the surgery was best in patients younger than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Orchidopexy, especially before 1 year of age, improves the fertility potential in bilateral cryptorchidism. At follow-up, 26% (54/208) had a risk of infertility based on inhibin-B.","Hildorf, Simone; Cortes, Dina; Clasen-Linde, Erik; Fossum, Magdalena; Thorup, Jorgen",Pediatr. surg. int,,408

A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.","Corrêa Giron, Carolina; Laaksonen, Aatto; Barroso da Silva, Fernando L",Virus Res,,408

242399,Severe mental illness: reassessing COVID-19 vaccine priorities,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan is not as disastrous as it is in other Western countries, possibly because of certain lifestyle factors. One such factor might be the seaweed-rich diet commonly consumed in Japan. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface and downregulates ACE2, likely elevating the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2. The overreaction of the immune system, combined with the cytokine storm and ACE dominance, is purported to cause the condition of COVID-19 patients to deteriorate rapidly. Dietary seaweeds contain numerous components, including ACE inhibitory peptides, soluble dietary fibers (eg, fucoidan, porphyran), omega-3 fatty acids, fucoxanthin, fucosterol, vitamins D3 and B12, and phlorotannins. These components exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects directly as well as indirectly through prebiotic effects. It is possible that ACE inhibitory components could minimize the ACE dominance caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, dietary seaweeds might confer protection against COVID-19 through multiple mechanisms. Overconsumption of seaweeds should be avoided, however, as seaweeds contain high levels of iodine.","Tamama, Kenichi",Nutr. rev,,408

We report the case of a 5-year-old previously healthy male who presented to our hospital’s emergency department (ED) with facial swelling secondary to infected maxillary left molars. Extractions were performed in the ED with moderate sedation. He was later found to be COVID-19 positive before admission for intravenous antibiotics. The use of universal precautions during the pandemic in treating patients with possible COVID-19 symptoms and in aerosol-generating procedures is recommended. Evaluating and providing treatment to our patients with urgent dental care should not be delayed to prevent further complications and decrease the burden placed on the ED, which may be limited in its ability to provide definitive care.","Fleagle, Jenelle Lorch Margarita",Oral,,408
242838,Telehealth Capability Among Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities in Counties With High Versus Low COVID-19 Social Distancing,2020,"Background: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine use for outpatient pediatric specialty care was low. Stay-at-home orders (SHO) prompted rapid upscaling of telemedicine capabilities and upskilling of providers. This study compares telemedicine usage before and after the SHO and analyzes how a Children's Center addressed challenges associated with a rapid rise in telemedicine. Methods: Data on outpatient visits across 14 specialty divisions were abstracted from the institutional electronic medical record. The 12-week study period (March 9, 2020-May 29, 2020) spanned three epochs: pre-SHO; post-SHO; reopening to in-person visits. Changes in in-person visits, video visits, and completed, cancelled, and no-show appointments were compared between three epochs. Results: A total of 4,914 outpatient pediatric specialty visits were completed, including 67% (3,296/4,914) in-person and 33% (1,618/4,914) through video. During the first two epochs encompassing the SHO, video visits increased by 4,750%. During the third epoch when the SHO was lifted, video visits decreased by 66%, with 19.4% of visits conducted through video in week 12. Overall, for outpatient video appointments, 82.8% (1,618/1,954) were completed, 9.1% (178/1,954) were cancelled, and 8.1% (158/1,954) were no-shows. The percentage of completed and no-show appointments did not differ between epochs. However, the cancellation rate decreased significantly from Epochs 1 to 3 (p = 0.008). Conclusion: A SHO was associated with a large increase in pediatric specialty video visits. Post-SHO, the percentage of pediatric specialty visits conducted through video decreased but remained higher than before the SHO. Frequent, content-rich communications, self-directed tutorials, and individualized coaching may facilitate successful increases in telemedicine use.","Howie, Flora; Kreofsky, Beth L; Ravi, Anupama; Lokken, Troy; Hoff, Mekenzie D; Fang, Jennifer L",Telemed. j. e. health,,408
242859,Well-being and education of urology residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of an American National Survey,2020,"Korean CDC experts first reported the likelihood of reactivation in COVIOD-19 patients. They hypothesized that like childhood chicken pox infections which lie dormant for tens of years only to cause shingles in seniors, SARS-CoV-2 can reactivate. However, as testing for the virus had been flawed at that time, U.S. infectious disease experts were skeptical about the reports of second COVID-19 infections. New reports have addressed the urgent need to conduct large-scale studies to better understand the potential recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some case studies show possible reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in a family cluster. Given this consideration, major space stressors such as microgravity and space radiation and their interactions which are not fully known, so far can increase the risk of reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in future space missions, an event that can easily impact the success of any space mission. Since about 80% of infected people are either asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, in a near future, it would be likely that astronauts who start their mission even after complex medical examinations, experience reactivation of the virus during their mission. Moreover, we have previously addressed the potential higher fatality of COVID-19 infections in space due to 1) uselessness of social distancing due to microgravity 2) immune system dysregulation 3) possibly higher mutation rates of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a RNA virus 4) higher risk of reactivation of the virus 5) existence of strong selective pressure and 6) decreased maximum oxygen uptake.","Mortazavi, S.

METHODS: This mixed-methods study included 10 patients with RA and four rheumatologists. A rheumatologist presented about joint inflammation and disease monitoring in RA. Patients then self-examined and reported 28-tender joint count (28-TJC) and 28-swollen joint count (28-SJC). Next, two paired rheumatologists examined patients and reported 28-TJC and 28-SJC. After watching a joint examination video for training physicians, patients discussed their training needs for self-examination, with discussion analyzed using thematic analysis. Self-examination techniques were determined by consensus. Finally, patients self-examined and reported 28-TJC and 28-SJC. Reliability between the first and second patient-reported 28-TJCs and 28-SJCs and rheumatologist pair-reported 28-TJC and 28-SJC was determined with the intraclass coefficient. RESULTS: The reliability for patient self-reported joint counts was higher for the 28-TJC than for the 28-SJC. Reliability improved following rheumatologist examination and training. Patients identified a preference for practical information rather than detailed information on joint anatomy and pathophysiology. Clear definitions of ""swollen"" and ""tender"" were important; patients found the concept of ""tenderness"" difficult. Techniques for self-examination and reporting of joint counts were agreed on and demonstrated in an instructional video. CONCLUSION: Training increased reliability of patient-reported joint counts. Patients with RA identified important aspects of training for self-examination and reporting of joint counts. An 8-minute instructional video was codeveloped; the next step is the evaluation of the video's impact on patient-reported joint counts.","Grainger, Rebecca; Townsley, Hermaleigh R; Stebbings, Simon; Harrison, Andrew A; Taylor, William J; Stamp, Lisa K",,,408
245353,The AAGP Scholars Program: Predictors of Pursuing Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship Training,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused havoc worldwide, with patients presenting a spectrum of complications that have pushed health care experts to explore new technological solutions and treatment plans. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies have played a substantial role in solving complex problems, and several organizations have been swift to adopt and customize these technologies in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the role of AI as a comprehensive and decisive technology to fight the COVID-19 crisis in the fields of epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease progression. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available online between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and AI. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in 419 articles published and made available online during the aforementioned period. Of these, 130 publications were selected for further analyses. These publications were classified into 3 themes based on AI applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology, Early Detection and Diagnosis, and Disease Progression. Of the 130 studies, 71 (54.6%) focused on predicting the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were classified under the Computational Epidemiology theme. Next, 40 of 130 (30.8%) studies that applied AI techniques to detect COVID-19 by using patients' radiological images or laboratory test results were classified under the Early Detection and Diagnosis theme. Finally, 19 of the 130 studies (14.6%) that focused on predicting disease progression, outcomes (ie, recovery and mortality), length of hospital stay, and number of days spent in the intensive care unit for patients with COVID-19 were classified under the Disease Progression theme. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we assembled studies in the current COVID-19 literature that utilized AI-based methods to provide insights into different COVID-19 themes. Our findings highlight important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research.","Syeda, Hafsa Bareen; Syed, Mahanazuddin; Sexton, Kevin Wayne; Syed, Shorabuddin; Begum, Salma; Syed, Farhanuddin; Prior, Fred; Yu, Feliciano",JMIR Med Inform,,408
245852,COVID-19 vaccination among people who inject drugs: Leaving no one behind,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In light of the opioid epidemic, there is a need to identify factors that predict aberrant opioid behaviors including misuse and abuse. Impulsivity has been extensively studied in addiction literature, but not in the context of opioid misuse. Hence, this study aimed to identify which of the impulsivity facets (negative urgency, positive urgency, sensation seeking, lack of perseverance, and lack of premeditation) would predict current aberrant opioid-related behaviors in patients with chronic pain. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey from patients with chronic pain who visited a tertiary pain clinic. Patients were predominately female (74%), middle aged (M = 55 years), and White/Caucasian (84%). Upon consent, they completed a series of surveys including UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, the Current Opioid misuse Measure, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PROMIS-anxiety, depression, and physical function, and a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted to test study hypotheses. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, only lack of premeditation predicted higher odds of aberrant opioid-related behaviors in the past 30 days, after controlling for known covariates, and explained 26% of variance. Interestingly, lack of premeditation together with pain catastrophizing as a covariate explained 56% of the variance in aberrant opioid-related behaviors. DISCUSSION: The current study is the first to identify a potential role of lack of premeditation as an impulsivity facet predicting aberrant opioid-related behaviors among patients with chronic pain.","Hettie, Gabrielle; Nwaneshiudu, Chinwe; Ziadni, Maisa S; Darnall, Beth D; Mackey, Sean C; You, Dokyoung S",Subst Use Misuse,,408
245853,COVID-19 vaccination among people who inject drugs: Leaving no one behind,2021,"BACKGROUND: UltraViolet-C (UV-C) lamps may be used to supplement current hospital cleaning and disinfection of surfaces contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Our aim is to provide some practical indications for the correct use of UV-C lamps. METHODS: We studied three UV-C lamps, measuring their spatial irradiance and emission over time. We quantify the error that is committed by calculating the irradiation time based exclusively on the technical data of the lamps or by making direct irradiance measurements. Finally, we tested specific dosimeters for UV-C. RESULTS: Our results show that the spatial emission of UV-C lamps is strongly dependent on the power of the lamps and on the design of their reflectors. Only by optimizing the positioning and calculating the exposure time correctly, is it possible to dispense the dose necessary to obtain SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. In the absence of suitable equipment for measuring irradiance, the calculated irradiation time can be underestimated. We therefore consider it precautionary to increase the calculated times by at least 20%. CONCLUSION: To use UV-C lamps effectively, it is necessary to follow a few simple precepts when choosing, positioning and verifying the lamps. In the absence of instruments dedicated to direct verification of irradiance, photochromic UV-C dosimeters may represent a useful tool for easily verifying that a proper UV-C dose has been delivered.","Lualdi, Manuela; Cavalleri, Adalberto; Bianco, Andrea; Biasin, Mara; Cavatorta, Claudia; Clerici, Mario; Galli, Paola; Pareschi, Giovanni; Pignoli, Emanuele",BMC Infect Dis,,408

Furthermore, to verify whether the quality requirement of aPDT-treated plasma is acceptable, the differences of the levels of clotting factors, total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titrations in plasma of patient before and after aPDT treatment were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cur@PLGA-NPs was synthesized using Electrospinning process and characterized by different analysis including Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy assays. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the plasma samples of patients suspected of having COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Then, the treated plasma samples with Cur@PLGA-NPs plus blue laser were exposed to Vero cells. Eventually, cell cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of treated Vero cells were evaluated. Levels of clotting factors including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies measurements were performed using the coagulometer, method of Bradford, and titration procedure, respectively. RESULTS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 84.3 % of samples. Different concentrations of Cur@PLGA-NPs (3, 5, 7, and 10 % wt.), the irradiation times of blue laser (1, 3, and 5 min), and aPDT with the maximum dosed of blue laser light (522.8 J/cm2) plus 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs had no cytotoxicity. Although there were significant cell degradation and apoptotic effects in treated Vero cells with treated plasma using 10 % wt. Cur@PLGA-NPs, and a blue laser at an energy density of 522.8 J/cm2, no visible changes in cells and apoptosis were observed following aPDT. Total plasma protein content, PT, APTT, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titers showed no significant changes (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) in treated plasma as compared to untreated plasma. CONCLUSION: aPDT exhibited in vitro anti-COVID-19 activities in the treated plasma containing SARS-COV-2 without Vero cell apoptosis and any adverse effects on plasma quality in aPDT-exposed plasma.","Pourhajibagher, Maryam; Azimi, Maryam; Haddadi-Asl, Vahid; Ahmadi, Hanie; Gholamzad, Mehrdad; Ghorbanpour, Sara; Bahador, Abbas",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,408

RESULTS: A median of a 32-day period of viral RNA shedding was observed, ranging from 4 days to 111 days. On multivariate analysis, elderly age was independently associated with prolonged viral shedding (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, P = 0.003). An incremental increase in the duration of viral RNA shedding was observed with increasing age (P < 0.05). The median (quartile) duration of viral RNA shedding was 23 (22) days (&#8804; 40 years), 30 (18) days (41-50 years), 33 (21) days (51-60 years), 34 (17) days (61-70 years) and 34 (17) days (> 70 years). CONCLUSIONS: Viral RNA shedding can persist for as long as 111 days in the upper respiratory tract. Increasing age is associated with viral RNA persistence.

253727,Leveraging investments in Ebola preparedness for COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a care crisis of unknown duration which has seemingly not yet reached its peak in many countries. A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care - in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families. Visiting restrictions aimed to protect the general public must be weighted against the patient's and family's suffering.","Anneser, Johanna",Palliat Support Care,,408

255363,Covid-Bound: A Pandemic Idyl,2021,"In patients with cardiovascular disease, the use of antibody or serological testing is frequently encountered as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to evolve. Antibody testing detects one form of the acquired immunological response to a pathogenic antigen. Once the immune system recognizes a viral antigen or a protein as foreign, a humoral immune response is initiated, which is generally detected by laboratory testing in 5 to 10 days after the initial exposure. While this information is critical from a public health perspective to implement surveillance systems and measures to limit infectivity and transmission rate, the misinterpretation of serologic testing in clinical practice has generated much confusion in the medical community because some attempted to apply these strategies to individual patient's treatment schemes. In this mini-review, we examine the different serologic-based testing strategies, how to interpret their results, and their public health impact at the population level, which are critical to contain the transmission of the virus in the community within a busy cardiovascular practice. Further, this review will also be particularly helpful as vaccination and immune therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 become available to the society as a whole.","Damluji, Abdulla A; Christenson, Robert H; deFilippi, Christopher",J Am Heart Assoc,,408

260452,Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol-induced blackout tweets,2020,"Introduction: acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are responsible for significant proportions of illnesses and deaths annually. Most of ARIs are of viral etiology, with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) playing a key role. This study was conducted prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to provide evidence about the sero-epidemiology of HCoVs in rural areas of Ghana. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted as part of a large epidemiological study investigating the occurrence of respiratory viruses in 3 rural areas of Ghana; Buoyem, Kwamang and Forikrom. Serum samples were collected and tested for the presence of IgG-antibodies to three HCoVs; HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 using immunofluorescence assay. Results: of 201 subjects enrolled into the study, 97 (48.3%) were positive for all three viruses. The most prevalent virus was HCoV-229E (23%; 95% CI: 17.2 - 29.3), followed by HCoV-OC43 (17%; 95% CI: 12.4 - 23.4), then HCoV-NL63 (8%, 95% CI: 4.6 - 12.6). Subjects in Kwamang had the highest sero-prevalence for HCoV-NL63 (68.8%). human coronaviruses-229E (41.3%) and HCoV-OC43 (45.7%) were much higher in Forikrom compared to the other study areas. There was however no statistical difference between place of origin and HCoVs positivity. Although blood group O+ and B+ were most common among the recruited subjects, there was no significant association (p = 0.163) between blood group and HCoV infection. Conclusion: this study reports a 48.3% sero-prevalence of HCoVs (OC43, NL63 and 229E) among rural communities in Ghana. The findings provide useful baseline data that could inform further sero-epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Africa.","Owusu, Michael; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; El-Duah, Philip; Acheampong, Godfred; Mutocheluh, Mohammed; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw",Pan Afr Med J,,408

We evaluated the incidence of QTc prolongation among moderately and severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ and of the existence of concomitant alternative causes. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ (between Mar 1 and Apr 14, 2020) in a tertiary medical center were included. Clinical characteristics and relevant risk factors were collected from the electronic medical records. Individual patient QTc intervals were determined before and after treatment with HCQ. The primary outcome measure sought was a composite endpoint comprised of either an increase &#8805; 60 milliseconds (ms) in the QTc interval compared with pretreatment QTc, and/or a maximal QTc interval >500 ms. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-75) and 57 (63%) were male. Thirty-nine patients (43%) were severely or critically ill. Hypertension and obesity were common (n=23 each, 26%). QTc prolongation evolved in fourteen patients (16%). Age > 65 years, congestive heart failure, severity of disease, C-reactive protein level, hypokalemia and furosemide treatment, were all associated with QTc prolongation. Adjusted analysis showed that QTc prolongation was five times more likely with hypokalemia [OR 5, (95% CI, 1.3-20)], and three times more likely with furosemide treatment [ OR 3 (95% CI, 1.01-13.7)]. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with HCQ, QTc prolongation was associated with the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypokalemia and furosemide treatment.","Fteiha, Bashar; Karameh, Hani; Kurd, Ramzi; Ziff-Werman, Batsheva; Feldman, Itamar; Bnaya, Alon; Einav, Sharon; Orlev, Amir; Ben-Chetrit, Eli",Int J Clin Pract,,408

262934,Putting physical activity in the 'must-do' list of the global agenda,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause serious illness in some people resulting in admission to intensive care units (ICU) and frequently, ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure. Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","Smith, Valerie; Devane, Declan; Nichol, Alistair; Roche, David",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,408

Digital technologies may offer an innovative way to support the mental health needs of women and their families throughout the perinatal period, as well as assist midwives in the recognition of perinatal mental health concerns. However, little is known about the acceptability and perceived benefits and barriers to using such technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the current state of perinatal mental health care provision in the United Kingdom, as well as users' (women and partners) and midwives' interest in using a digital mental health assessment throughout the perinatal period. METHODS: Women, partners, and midwives were recruited to participate in the study, which entailed completing an online survey. Quantitative data were explored using descriptive statistics. Open-ended response data were first investigated using thematic analysis. Resultant themes were then mapped onto the components of the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Behavior model and summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 829 women, 103 partners, and 90 midwives participated in the study. The provision of adequate perinatal mental health care support was limited, with experiences varying significantly across respondents. There was a strong interest in using a digital mental health assessment to screen, diagnose, and triage perinatal mental health concerns, particularly among women and midwives. The majority of respondents (n=781, 76.42%) expressed that they would feel comfortable or very comfortable using or recommending a digital mental health assessment. The majority of women and partners showed a preference for in-person consultations (n=417, 44.74%), followed by a blended care approach (ie, both in-person and online consultations) (n=362, 38.84%), with fewer participants preferring online-only consultations (n=120, 12.88%). Identified benefits and barriers mainly related to physical opportunity (eg, accessibility), psychological capability (eg, cognitive skills), and automatic motivation (eg, emotions). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof-of-concept support for the development and implementation of a digital mental health assessment to inform clinical decision making in the assessment of perinatal mental health concerns in the United Kingdom.","Martin-Key, Nayra Anna; Spadaro, Benedetta; Schei, Thea Sofie; Bahn, Sabine",J Med Internet Res,,408
269317,Prevalence of anxiety and associated factors for Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"After the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commenced across the world. Understanding the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for interrupting viral infectivity and preventing aberrant immune responses before a vaccine can be developed. In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease. Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1-7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries. However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics. Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals. In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19. Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy.","Seif, Farhad; Aazami, Hossein; Khoshmirsafa, Majid; Kamali, Monireh; Mohsenzadegan, Monireh; Pornour, Majid; Mansouri, Davood",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,408

Well-being and stress symptoms (i.e., cognitive, emotional and physical) were scored for the periods pre, during and after the first COVID-19 wave using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and a 10-point Likert scale. Stressors were assessed and explored by rating experiences with specific situations (i.e., frequency and intensity of distress) and in free-text narratives. Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Narratives were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: In total, 192 questionnaires were returned (39% response). Compared to pre-COVID-19, the mean WHO-5 index score (range: 0-100) decreased significantly with 14.1 points (p < 0.001) during the peak of the first wave and 3.7 points (< 0.001) after the first wave. Mean self-perceived stress symptom levels almost doubled during the peak of the first wave (&#8804;0.005). Half of the respondents reported experiencing more moral distress in the ED since the COVID-19 outbreak. High levels of distress were primarily found in situations where the staff was unable to provide or facilitate necessary emotional support to a patient or family. Analysis of 51 free-texts revealed witnessing suffering, high work pressure, fear of contamination, inability to provide comfort and support, rapidly changing protocols regarding COVID-19 care and personal protection, and shortage of protection equipment as important stressors. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 wave took its toll on ED staff. Actions to limit drop-out and illness among staff resulting from psychological distress are vital to secure acute care for (non-)COVID-19 patients during future infection waves.","Hesselink, Gijs; Straten, Lise; Gallée, Lars; Brants, Anne; Holkenborg, Joris; Barten, Dennis G; Schoon, Yvonne",BMC Health Serv Res,,408

273192,Does disability modify the relationship between labour force status and psychological distress among young people?,2020,"Garnet solid state electrolytes have been considered as potential candidates to enable next generation all solid state batteries (ASSBs). To facilitate the practical application of ASSBs, a high room temperature ionic conductivity and a low interfacial resistance between solid state electrolyte and electrodes are essential. In this work, we report a study of cerium doped Li5La3Nb2O12 through X-ray pair distribution function analysis, impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical testing. The successful cerium incorporation was confirmed by both X-ray diffraction refinement and X-ray pair distribution function analysis, showing the formation of an extensive solid solution. The local bond distances for Ce and Nb on the octahedral site were determined using X-ray pair distribution function analysis, illustrating the longer bond distances around Ce. This Ce doping strategy was shown to give a significant enhancement in conductivity (1.4 × 10-4 S cm-1 for Li5.75La3Nb1.25Ce0.75O12, which represents one of the highest conductivities for a garnet with less than 6 Li) as well as a dramatically decreased interfacial resistance (488 &#937; cm2 for Li5.75La3Nb1.25Ce0.75O12).

We describe implementation at the first US site, the UPMC health system, and offer recommendations for implementation at other sites. METHODS: To implement REMAP-COVID, we focused on six major areas: engaging leadership, trial embedment, remote consent and enrollment, regulatory compliance, modification of traditional trial management procedures, and alignment with other COVID-19 studies. RESULTS: We recommend aligning institutional and trial goals and sharing a vision of REMAP-COVID implementation as groundwork for learning health system development. Embedment of trial procedures into routine care processes, existing institutional structures, and the electronic health record promotes efficiency and integration of clinical care and clinical research. Remote consent and enrollment can be facilitated by engaging bedside providers and leveraging institutional videoconferencing tools. Coordination with the central institutional review board will expedite the approval process. Protocol adherence, adverse event monitoring, and data collection and export can be facilitated by building electronic health record processes, though implementation can start using traditional clinical trial tools. Lastly, establishment of a centralized institutional process optimizes coordination of COVID-19 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the REMAP-COVID trial within a large US healthcare system is feasible and facilitated by multidisciplinary collaboration. This investment establishes important groundwork for future learning health system endeavors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02735707 . Registered on 13 April 2016.","Anonymous,",Trials,,408

However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4°C) and freezing (-20°C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at -20°C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant.IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4°C and -20°C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity. Therefore, precautions should be taken during and after handling food preserved under cold conditions.","Huang, Sheng-Yu; Kung, Yu-An; Huang, Peng-Nien; Chang, Sheng-Yun; Gong, Yu-Nong; Han, Yi-Ju; Chiang, Huan-Jung; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Lee, Kuo-Ming; Chang, Chia-Yu; Chang, Chia-Ching; Huang, Chung-Guei; Shih, Shin-Ru",MSphere,,408

276008,Covid-19 and the Need for Health Care Reform,2020,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the activation and regulation of proper immune response during respiratory viral infections. Aberrant IL-6 expression, however, may promote virus survival and/or exacerbation of clinical symptoms, such as the inflammatory cytokine storms observed in severe COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. IL-6 is now regarded as a prominent target for clinical intervention but less is known about how IL-6 itself is regulated in various disorders. Using precision nuclear run-on next generation sequencing (PRO-Seq) to measure the transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases (RNA Pol II) in human primary small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs), we have discovered an upstream enhancer-like region in the IL-6 gene locus. This is a region that resides within an open chromatin domain. It has DNase I hypersensitivity and enriches in activating H3K27Ac mark, but lack of active transcription mark H3K36me3. Interestingly, it displays increased ratio of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3, a phenomenon usually associated with active enhancers. We were therefore surprised to observe that rhinovirus (RV) infection disrupts active RNA Pol II binding in this region, despite the fact that RNA Pol II is increased in the body of the IL-6 gene. These findings suggest that the upstream sequence may be functioning as a suppressor of IL-6 expression. To test this possibility, we targeted the KRAB transcriptional silencer to the upstream sequence using CRISPRi (KRAB/dCas9 directed by sgRNA). hSAECs expressing control sgRNA or the sequence-specific sgRNA were infected with RV and IL-6 mRNA measured by Q-RT-PCR. Intriguingly, the sequence-specific sgRNA enhanced RV- induced IL-6 expression. These results suggest that the upstream element is not an enhancer but a functionally active suppressor of IL-6 expression and that the mechanism of IL-6 expression involves a previously unknown de-repression step. It will advance us to understand how dynamic interactions between cis-regulatory elements regulate the threshold, magnitude and duration of IL-6 gene transcription in response to distinct factors.","Yang, Jun Brasier Allan Zhang Yueqing",The FASEB Journal,,408
276231,Beyond Burnout: Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic Challenges to Self-care,2021,"Healthy eating plays a critical role in preventing diet-related chronic diseases. To promote healthy eating, nutrition labels have been mandated to certain foods in many countries. To test how different designs of nutrition labels affect consumer behavior, eye tracking technique has been increasingly used to overcome the limitations of subjective report which are susceptible to different biases and a poor indicator of nutrition label use in reality. In this review, we reviewed 45 eye-tracking studies on nutrition label processing. Besides a summary of eye tracking methodology, we found three emerged topics from these studies: attention capture, nutrition label comprehension and food choice. Overall, updated designs of nutrition labels improve attention capture and nutrition label comprehension, but it does not necessarily lead to healthier food choices. The discrepancy between attention capture and food choice also indicate potential limitation in promoting healthy food choice via the indirect attention route (exposure - attention - nutrition label processing - food choice). Instead, actual food choice may be a consequence of a direct heuristic route and modulated by person-, product- and context-related factors. These findings can not only guide future studies, but also have implications on making nutrition label policy and improving human health in eastern developing countries.","Ma, Guojie; Zhuang, Xiangling",Appetite,,408

Currently, there is no drug approved for its treatment and different therapeutic options are being essayed to address pathophysiological processes underlying the clinical manifestations experienced by patients. New and old drugs, whether as a single treatment or in combination, in immunologically compromised patients may favour the development of adverse drug reactions (ADR), including drug hypersensitivity, which must be identified and managed accordingly. Given the lack of community immunity and the high rate of virus contagion, it is expected that new cases will emerge in the upcoming months. Thus, the probability of more adverse reactions or even new clinical manifestations may increase in the near future.

Disruption of the microbiota can also contribute to disease, and the microbiota has been implicated in numerous intestinal and extra-intestinal pathologies including colorectal cancer. Interactions between host and microbiota can occur either directly or indirectly, via microbial-derived metabolites. In this chapter, we focus on two major products of microbial metabolism, short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, and their role in colorectal cancer. Short-chain fatty acids are the products of microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates and confer protection against cancer risk, while bile acids are compounds which are endogenous to the host, but undergo microbial modification in the large intestine leading to alterations in their bioactivity. Lastly, we discuss the ability of microbial modulation to mediate cancer risk and the potential to harness this ability as a prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in colorectal cancer.","Keane, J M; Joyce, S A; Gahan, C G M; Hyland, N P; Houston, A",Results Probl Cell Differ,,408

278546,Assessing risk for healthcare workers during the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be â¼4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be â¼3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be â¼2.6 based on confirmed cases and â¼2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around â¼0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Russo, Lucia; Tsakris, Athanasios; Siettos, Constantinos",PLoS One,,408

METHODS: All members of the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED) were invited to participate to a questionnaire-based survey during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. RESULTS: 314/1306 (24%) SIED members accounting for 201/502 (40%) endoscopic centers completed the survey. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) were available in most centers, but filtering face-piece masks (FFP2 or FFP3) and negative pressure room were not in 10.9 and 75.1%. Training courses on PPE use were provided in 57.2% of centers only; there was at least one positive HCW in 17.4% of centers globally, 107/3308 (3.2%) HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar rates of physicians (2.9%), nurses (3.5%) and other health operators (3.5%). Involvement in a COVID-19 care team (OR: 4.96) and the lack of training courses for PPE, (OR: 2.65) were associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of COVID-19 among endoscopy HCWs was not negligible and was associated with work in a COVID-19 care team and lack of education on proper PPE use. These data deserve attention during the subsequent waves.","Mariani, Alberto; Capurso, Gabriele; Marasco, Giovanni; Bertani, Helga; Crinò, Stefano Francesco; Magarotto, Andrea; Tringali, Andrea; Pasquale, Luigi; Arcidiacono, Paolo Giorgio; Zagari, Rocco Maurizio",Dig Liver Dis,,408

This paper draws on our research into practice during the pandemic to show some of the ways social workers changed their practice and to provide theories and concepts that can help to account for how such change occurs. Drawing on anthropological uses of the concepts of ‘contingency’ and ‘improvisation’ and Hartmut Rosa’s sociological work on ‘adaptive transformation’ and ‘resonance’ we show how social workers creatively ‘re-made’ key aspects of their practice, by recognising inequalities and providing material help, through digital casework, movement and walking encounters, and by going into homes and taking risks by getting close to children and parents. It is vital that such improvisation and remaking are learned from and sustained post-pandemic as this can renew practice and enable social workers to better enhance the lives of service users.

In the first stage, an infection - COVID-19 or CAP, is detected using a pre-trained DenseNet architecture. Then, in the second stage, a fine-grained three-way classification is done using EfficientNet architecture. The proposed COVID+CAP-CNN framework achieved a slice-level classification accuracy of over 94% at identifying COVID-19 and CAP. Further, the proposed framework has the potential to be an initial screening tool for differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and CAP, achieving a validation accuracy of over 89.3% at the finer three-way COVID-19, CAP, and healthy classification. Within the IEEE ICASSP 2021 Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC) on COVID-19 Diagnosis, our proposed two-stage classification framework achieved an overall accuracy of 90% and sensitivity of .857, .9, and .942 at distinguishing COVID-19, CAP, and normal individuals respectively, to rank first in the evaluation.

Many of these processes are disrupted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is marked among others by diffuse endothelial injury, intense activation of the coagulation system and increased capillary permeability. Most commonly occurring in the setting of sepsis, ARDS is a devastating illness, associated with increased morbidity and mortality and no effective pharmacological treatment. Endothelial cell damage has an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and several biomarkers of endothelial damage have been tested in determining prognosis. By further understanding the endothelial pathobiology, development of endothelial-specific therapeutics might arise. In this review, we will discuss the underlying pathology of endothelial dysfunction leading to ARDS and emerging therapies. Furthermore, we will present a brief overview demonstrating that endotheliopathy is an important feature of hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).","Vassiliou, Alice G; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Orfanos, Stylianos E",Int. j. mol. sci.

289810,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on STIs in Greece,2021,"BACKGROUND: Besides handling the physical impacts of COVID-19 there is more than ever a need to understand what can help when mental health is challenged. Within this context our practical wisdom - our ability to understand and recognise when 'the other', for example the patient, is feeling lonely or anxious is particularly important. AIM: This article aims to contribute to the understanding of how the competence of health professionals may be advanced by helping them develop the self-understanding essential to being wise practitioners. METHOD: The article is based on a discussion informed by reflections (written in Danish and translated into English) by Masters students (and registered nurses) participating in a university programme ""Patient and user focused nursing"". FINDINGS: The first part of the article considers a student nurse's reflection on understanding herself and one of her patients. The second part considers reflections on the contemporary world of change from a student nurse trying to engage with a world she experiences as falling apart. The third part addresses the impact of resonant places and encounters on developing self/other understandings; encounters that may also be produced through songs and lyrics. The final part draws conclusions on how it is possible to reach understandings of oneself and others as student health practitioners in time of a pandemic. CONCLUSION: In the process of developing understanding and recognition, competence built on self-understanding is central for helping form health professionals into 'wise practitioners'. It is concluded that the existential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, paradoxically, may direct many people's awareness to a more sensitive, resonant, attitude towards the other. For some, this may produce a more humanized world and perception of others. Within this perspective the arts may help us develop self-understanding and recognition of 'the other'.","Damsgaard, Janne Brammer; Phoenix, Ann",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,408

COVID-19 managed to spread worldwide and so far more than 9.1 million cases and more than 4.7 lakh death has been reported globally. Children, pregnant women, elderly population, immunocompromised patients, and patients with conditions like asthma, diabetes, etc. are highly vulnerable to COVID infection. Currently, there is no treatment available for COVID-19 infection. Traditional medicinal plants have provided bioactive molecules in the past that are efficiently used during conditions like cancer, malaria, microbial infections, immune-compromised states, etc. AYUSH India has recommended the use of Curcuma longa, Allium sativum, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Withania somnifera for immune-boosting during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we investigated the potential of 63-major bioactive molecules of these plants against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) through docking studies and compared the results with known inhibitor 11a. Our results proposed cuscohygrine, Î³-Glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, anahygrine, and S-allylcystein as the potent inhibitors against Mpro identified using molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics. Interestingly, these molecules are from A. sativum, and W. somnifera, which are known for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory potential. None of the proposed molecules have earlier been reported as antiviral molecules. Our results predict very strong potential of these four-molecules against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, especially Î³-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, as all four form hydrogen bonding with Glu166 that is a crucial residue for the formation of the biologically active dimeric form of Mpro. Therefore, we strongly recommend further research on these biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2.","Parashar, Arun; Shukla, Arpit; Sharma, Ankush; Behl, Tapan; Goswami, Dweipayan; Mehta, Vineet",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,408

However, the development of information terminals has made it easier to obtain personal mobility information. In this study, we propose methods for evaluating the mobility of people in a city using global positioning system data. There are two main methods for evaluating movement. One is to create a temporal network from real data and check the change in travel time according to time zones or seasons. Temporal networks are difficult to evaluate because of their time complexity, and in this study, we proposed an evaluation method using the probability density function of travel time. The other method is to define a time-dependent traveling salesman problem and find an efficient traveling route by finding the shortest path. By creating a time-dependent traveling salesman problem in an existing city and solving it, a traveler can choose an efficient route by considering traffic conditions at different times of the day. We used 2 months of data from Kyoto City to conduct a traffic evaluation as a case study.","Mukai, Tatsuro; Ikeda, Yuichi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00328v1.pdf,408

293321,Clinical ethnography in severe mental illness: a clinical method to tackle social determinants and structural racism in personalised care,2021,"Mechanical interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) guide many fundamental cell behaviors. Native connective tissue consists of highly organized, 3D networks of ECM fibers with complex, nonlinear mechanical properties. The most abundant stromal matrix component is fibrillar type I collagen, which often possesses a wavy, crimped morphology that confers strain- and load-dependent nonlinear mechanical behavior. Here, we established a new and simple method for engineering electrospun fibrous matrices composed of dextran vinyl sulfone (DexVS) with controllable crimped structure. A hydrophilic peptide was functionalized to DexVS matrices to trigger swelling of individual hydrogel fibers, resulting in crimped microstructure due to the fixed anchorage of fibers. Mechanical characterization of these matrices under tension confirmed orthogonal control over nonlinear stress-strain responses and matrix stiffness. We next examined ECM mechanosensing of individual endothelial cells (ECs), finding that fiber crimp promoted physical matrix remodeling alongside decreases in cell spreading, focal adhesion area, and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP). These changes corresponded to an increase in migration speed along with evidence for long-range interactions between neighboring cells in crimped matrices. Interestingly, when ECs were seeded at high density in crimped matrices, capillary-like networks rapidly assembled containing tube-like cellular structures wrapped around bundles of synthetic matrix fibers due to increased physical reorganization of matrix fibers. Our work provides an additional level of mechanical and architectural tunability to synthetic fibrous matrices and implicates a critical role for mechanical nonlinearity in EC mechanosensing and network formation.","Davidson, Christopher; Jayco, Danica; Wang, William; Shikanov, Ariella; Baker, Brendon",J. biomech. eng,,408

To characterize the potential pro-arrhythmic risk of this novel sarcomere activator, we evaluated OM in a series of International Conference on Harmonization S7B core and follow-up assays, including an in silico action potential (AP) model. OM was tested in: (i) hERG, Nav1.5 peak, and Cav1.2 channel assays; (ii) in silico computation in a human ventricular AP (hVAP) population model; (iii) AP recordings in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers (PF); and (iv) electrocardiography analysis in isolated rabbit hearts (IRHs). OM had low potency in the hERG (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50 ] = 125.5 µM) and Nav1.5 and Cav1.2 assays (IC50 > 300 µM). These potency values were used as inputs to investigate the occurrence of repolarization abnormalities (biomarkers of pro-arrhythmia) in an hVAP model over a wide range of OM concentrations. The outcome of hVAP analysis indicated low pro-arrhythmia risk at OM concentration up to 30 µM (100-fold the effective free therapeutic plasma concentration). In the isolated canine PF assay, OM shortened AP duration (APD)60 and APD90 significantly from 3 to 30 µM. In perfused IRH, ventricular repolarization (corrected QT and corrected JT intervals) was decreased significantly at greater than or equal to 1 µM OM. In summary, the comprehensive proarrhythmic assessment in human and non-rodent cardiac models provided data indicative that OM did not delay ventricular repolarization at therapeutic relevant concentrations, consistent with clinical findings.","Qu, Yusheng; Gao, BaoXi; Arimura, Ziva; Fang, Mei; Vargas, Hugo M",Clinical and translational science (Online),,408

METHODS: Concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir were assayed by an accredited LC-MS/MS method. The population pharmacokinetics of lopinavir was described using non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version 7.4). After determination of the base model that better described the data set, the influence of covariates (age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C reactive protein (CRP), and trough ritonavir concentrations) was tested on the model. RESULTS: From 13 hospitalized patients (4 females, 9 males, age = 64 ± 16 years), 70 lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations were available for analysis. The data were best described by a one-compartment model with a first-order input (KA). Among the covariates tested on the PK parameters, only the ritonavir trough concentrations had a significant effect on CL/F and improved the fit. Model-based simulations with the final parameter estimates under a regimen lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg b.i.d. showed a high variability with median concentration between 20 and 30 mg/L (Cmin/Cmax) and the 90% prediction intervals within the range 1-100 mg/L. CONCLUSION: According to the estimated 50% effective concentration of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells (16.7 mg/L), our model showed that at steady state, a dose of 400 mg b.i.d. led to 40% of patients below the minimum effective concentration while a dose of 1200 mg b.i.d. will reduce this proportion to 22%.","Alvarez, Jean Claude; Moine, Pierre; Davido, Benjamin; Etting, Isabelle; Annane, Djillali; Larabi, Islam Amine; Simon, Nicolas",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,408

Given the overwhelming demand on facility capacity, the impact on all health care sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of health care capacities. In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis. This study offers a novel approach to informed guidance for health care management when a priori no scientific evidence is available.","Ritschl, Paul V; Nevermann, Nora; Wiering, Leke; Wu, Helen H; Moroder, Philipp; Brandl, Andreas; Hillebrandt, Karl; Tacke, Frank; Friedersdorff, Frank; Schlomm, Thorsten; Schöning, Wenzel; Öllinger, Robert; Schmelzle, Moritz; Pratschke, Johann",Am J Transplant,,408

METHODS: CT volumes from 2,398 United States radiology practices participating in the ACR Dose Index Registry from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, were analyzed. Data were compared to projected CT volumes using 2019 normative data and analyzed with respect to time since government orders, population-normalized positive COVID-19 tests, and attributed deaths. Data were stratified by state population density, unemployment status, and race. RESULTS: There were 16,198,830 CT examinations (2,398 practices). Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs per day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 fewer CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378 of 1,142,247; quartile 1] versus 21% [1,894,152 of 9,140,689; quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331 of 2,071,251; quartile 1] versus 23% [1,753,521 of 7,496,443; quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856 of 71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 substantially reduced US CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment. Partial volume recovery occurred despite rising positive COVID-19 tests.","Davenport, Matthew S; Fruscello, Tom; Chatfield, Mythreyi; Weinstein, Stefanie; Sensakovic, William F; Larson, David B",J.

The treatment is performed through completion total gastrectomy (CTG) with radical lymphadenectomy. Some reports consider this procedure may be associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate surgical results and survival after CTG in patients with RGC. METHODS: 54 patients who underwent CTG between 2009 and 2019 were included in the study. As a comparison group 215 patients with primary gastric cancer (PGC) who underwent total gastrectomy (TG) in the same period were selected. RESULTS: among the initial characteristics, age (68.0 vs. 60.5; p<0.001), hemoglobin values (10.9 vs. 12.3; p<0.001) and body mass index (22.5 vs. 24.6; p=0.005) were different between the RGC and PGC groups, respectively. The most frequent postoperative complications were related to pulmonary complications, infection and fistula in both groups. There was a higher incidence of esophagojejunal fistula in the CTG group (14.8% vs 6.5%, p=0.055). Perioperative mortality was higher in RGC patients (9.3% vs. 5.1%), but without significance (p=0.329). Hospital length of stay, postoperative complications graded by the Clavien-Dindo classification, mortality at 30 and 90 days were not different between groups. There was no significant difference in disease-free and overall survival between RGC and PGC groups. CONCLUSION: despite previous reports, surgical results and survival were similar between groups. Higher risk of esophagojejunal fistula must be considered.","Ramos, Marcus Fernando Kodama Pertille; Pereira, Maria Claudia Machado; Oliveira, Yara Souza; Pereira, Marina Alessandra; Barchi, Leandro Cardoso; Dias, Andre Roncon; Zilberstein, Bruno; Ribeiro Junior, Ulysses; Cecconello, Ivan",Rev Col Bras Cir,,408

In the original article, images did not correspond to their correct figure captions. This has been corrected in the current version of the article. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-49526-001). For centuries Africans were captured and brought to America in bondage and forced to forge a new culture. The development of a Black culture gave rise to humor as a coping mechanism against the oppressive state they found themselves in. For centuries, humor became a way to protest their conditions by creating various humorous styles that infused social political commentary on oppression as a sign of defiance, while also providing hope for the hopeless. This commentary seeks to introduce leisure scholars to how Black Twitter (Sharma, 2013) users' expressions of humor during the COVID-19 pandemic serve as a form of resistance to injustices and inequalities, while simultaneously adopting coping strategies to reclaim power and control in order to speak their truth all while cultivating individual and collective identity in/through leisure.

There have been tremendous advances in in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial diagnostic of COVID-19 is based on the test of Sputum, Blood and SWAB of throat and nose. The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours but shortened to minimum of 45 hr. Another method of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min and has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA). A range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulin produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection i.e, immunoglobulin (IgM) and immunoglobulin (IgG). In this review, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss various diagnostic method of COVID-19, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for eradiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lipsa, Samal Gurudutta Pattnaik Laxmidhar Biswal Samal H.

The main route of human-to-human transmission is through contact with infectious secretions from the respiratory tract. Clinical manifestations vary from mild non-specific symptoms to life-threatening conditions. Since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, it has affected many medical, legal, social and economic aspects of everyday life in countries around the world. In this article, the authors present a summary of recommendations for taking care of otorhinolaryngology patients in outpatient settings and the legal basis referring to a risk of infection in doctor's office. In the selection of articles, the authors used English- and Polish-language online medical databases, typing the following keywords: SARS­­CoV-2, COVID-19, otolaryngology, endoscopy, personal protective equipment, and legal responsibility of the physician. The mucosa of the upper respiratory tract is a potential site of virus replication. The specificity of an ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination and a direct patient-doctor contact favor the transmission of the infection. The authors discussed the elements of self-protection of medical personnel and the legal aspects a risk of the patient contracting the infection in the otolaryngology office. In the case of a direct contact with the patient, the following medical personal protective equipment is required: a cap, a mask with an FFP-2 filter, goggles, an apron and gloves. If, during the visit, exposure to secretions or aerosol from the respiratory tract is expected, the personnel should additionally wear a visor and a waterproof apron. The patient's visit in the clinic should be preceded by telemedicine consultation. Patients should be screened prior to having a direct contact with a physician, using a short patient questionnaire. The questionnaire may consist of simple questions about the characteristic symptoms of the SARS­­CoV-2 infection and exposure to a sick person in the past 14 days. The question of staying in the areas of a high infection risk appears of little importance in view of the whole of Poland being perceived as constituting such an area. Due to the spread of the SARS­CoV- 2 virus, new procedures for providing medical services have been introduced. In the case of claims on the part of the patient, the only protection the medical personnel or facility can provide is confirmation of scrupulous compliance with medical procedures .

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of induced sputum as an additional indicator for the current clinical discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients to prevent virus recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one COVID-19 patients who met the national clinical discharge criteria were discharged from the hospital and tested daily for the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in their pharyngeal swabs and every other day for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in their induced sputum. Once the patient's induced sputum was negative after two consecutive tests, testing was discontinued. RESULTS: Among 21 discharged patients from COVID-19, the first pharyngeal swab and induced sputum tests for viral nucleic acid were positive in 3 (14.3%) and 8 (38.1%) patients respectively. Induced sputum was significantly more positive than pharyngeal swab (p < 0.05). In our cohort, all pharyngeal swabs became negative at day 7, and all induced sputa turned negative at day 11 after discharge. Interestingly, patients with negative pharyngeal swabs experienced viral relapse, whereas patients with negative induced sputum did not revert to positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of positive viral nucleic acid in induced sputum was high. Patients with negative induced sputum nucleic acid tests did not have a relapse of SARS-COV-2, indicating that viral nucleic acid testing of induced sputum should be used as an additional criterion for patients with national clinical discharge criteria COVID-19.","Zheng, S-L; Sun, W-L; Sun, L-N; Zeng, X-H; Wang, Q-X",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,408

The present study was aimed to better understand psychological status among medical staff and medical students during the early epidemic and to explore the influence factors of psychological distress. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from February 2-14, 2020. We collected general information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents were assessed using the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors influencing psychological distress. Results: Five hundred and twenty-eight respondents returned valid questionnaires. Medical staff and Medical students scored averages of 6.77 +/- 5.04, 15.48 +/- 8.66 on the K6, 37.22 +/- 11.39, 22.62 +/- 11.25 on the SSRS and 18.52 +/- 7.54, 28.49 +/- 11.17 on the PSS, respectively. Most medical staff (279, 91.77%) and 148 medical students (66.07%) showed a positive coping style. Social support, perceived stress, hours spent watching epidemic-related information per day and frequency of epidemic-related dreams were identified as factors influencing psychological distress among medical staff and medical students. Coping style emerged as a determinant of psychological distress among medical staff. Conclusions: In the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, medical staff and medical students were at moderate to high risk of psychological distress. Our results suggest that psychological interventions designed to strengthen social support, reduce perceived stress and adopt a positive coping style may be effective at improving the mental health of medical staff and medical students.","Li, Z.; Yi, X.; Zhong, M.

SUMMARY: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.","Ciotti, Marco; Benedetti, Francesca; Zella, Davide; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Chemotherapy,,408

318083,Editorial: COVID-19 Spiraling of Frailty in Older Italian Patients,2020,"Since it was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of cases of Covid-19 patients who died has continued to increase. One of the countries with the highest death rate in the world is Indonesia. On Saturday, April 4, 2020, Indonesia reached the highest death rate for Covid-19 patients, around 9.11%. This number must be suppressed so that there are no more victims. For this reason, it is necessary to know actually the factors that can reduce the risk of death and predict the chance of curing Covid-19 patients. In data mining, there are several methods that can be used to predict a patient's recovery rate by considering several variables. The variables used in this study were age and gender. Naive Bayes Method, logistic regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are the methods to be chosen in this study to analyze their most accurate performance. The result shows that KNN has the highest accuracy, which is 0.750 compared to logistic regression which has a value of 0.703 as well as Naive Bayes which has the same value. Meanwhile, the level of precision of the three models shows that KNN also has the highest value, namely 0.750 than logistic regression and Naive Bayes which have the same value, namely 0.700. The recall value of the three also shows that the kNN remains the highest with 0.750 compared to the two comparison models which have the same value, namely 0.708. © 2021 IEEE.","Romadhon, M.

318084,Editorial: COVID-19 Spiraling of Frailty in Older Italian Patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize maternal immune response after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and quantify the efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 infection at any point in pregnancy and collected paired maternal and cord blood samples at the time of delivery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays were performed to measure maternal plasma and cord blood concentrations and neutralizing potency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Differences in concentrations according to symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infection and time from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result to delivery were analyzed using nonparametric tests of significance. The ratio of cord to maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers was analyzed to assess transplacental transfer efficiency. RESULTS: Thirty-two paired samples were analyzed. Detectable anti-receptor-binding domain IgG was detected in 100% (n=32) of maternal and 91% (n=29) of cord blood samples. Functional neutralizing antibody was present in 94% (n=30) of the maternal and 25% (n=8) of cord blood samples. Symptomatic infection was associated with a significant difference in median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers compared with asymptomatic infection (log 3.2 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.7 [2.9-1.4], P=.03). Median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers were not significantly higher in patients who delivered more than 14 days after a positive PCR test result compared with those who delivered within 14 days (log 3.3 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.67 [2.8-1.6], P=.05). Median (range) cord/maternal antibody ratio was 0.81 (0.67-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate robust maternal neutralizing and anti-receptor-binding domain IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet a lower-than-expected efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer and a significant reduction in neutralization between maternal blood and cord blood. Maternal infection does confer some degree of neonatal antibody protection, but the robustness and durability of protection require further study.","Joseph, Naima T; Dude, Carolynn M; Verkerke, Hans P; Irby, Les039; Shon, S; Dunlop, Anne L; Patel, Ravi M; Easley, Kirk A; Smith, Alicia K; Stowell, Sean R; Jamieson, Denise J; Velu, Vijayakumar; Badell, Martina L",Obstet Gynecol,,408

A 23-year-old patient presented with high temperature and reduced fetal movements at 25 + 5/40 weeks of gestation. RT-PCR proved maternal COVID-19 infection. Ultrasound examination confirmed intrauterine death. Placenta histology showed necrosis of the villous trophoblast, associated with Chronic Histiocytic Intervillositis (CHI) and Massive Perivillous Fibrin Deposition (MPFD) with up to 90% - of the intervillous spaces being involved. Immunohistochemistry showed CD68 positive histiocytes in the intervillous spaces and the villous trophoblast was positive for the COVID-19 spike protein. RNA scope signal was indicative of the presence of the viral genome and active viral replication in the villous trophoblastic cells, respectively. MPFD is a gradually developing end-stage disease with various etiology, including autoimmune and alloimmune maternal response to antigens expressed at the feto-maternal interface and frequently accompanies chronic alloimmune villitis or histiocytic intervillositis. Covid-19 infection is associated with similar pattern of histological changes of the placenta leading to placental insufficiency and fetal death. This case report supports maternal- fetal vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to placental insufficiency and fetal demise. MPFD and CHI appear to be the typical placental histology for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection associated fetal demise.","Marton, T; Hargitai, B; Hunter, K; Pugh, M; Murray, P",Pediatr Dev Pathol,,408

We build upon previous Social Identity research into community resilience by testing the role of pre-existing local community (or 'neighbourhood') identity as a predictor of these outcomes, via the mediator of perceived social support. Community residents in the UK completed a longitudinal online survey four months before lockdown (T1; N = 253), one month before lockdown (T2; N = 217), and two months into lockdown (T3; N = 149). The cross-lagged panel analysis shows that T1 community identification predicts T3 giving and receiving of pandemic-related support, and that these effects occur via the perception of community support at the second time point (while the alternative pathway from T1 support via T2 identification is non-significant). Moreover, we show that T1 community identification also directly predicts lockdown adherence at T3.

We build upon previous Social Identity research into community resilience by testing the role of pre-existing local community (or 'neighbourhood') identity as a predictor of these outcomes, via the mediator of perceived social support. Community residents in the UK completed a longitudinal online survey four months before lockdown (T1; N = 253), one month before lockdown (T2; N = 217), and two months into lockdown (T3; N = 149). The cross-lagged panel analysis shows that T1 community identification predicts T3 giving and receiving of pandemic-related support, and that these effects occur via the perception of community support at the second time point (while the alternative pathway from T1 support via T2 identification is non-significant). Moreover, we show that T1 community identification also directly predicts lockdown adherence at T3. Our findings point to the pivotal role played by community identity in effective behavioural responses to the pandemic, and the need to support and foster community development to facilitate local community resilience as the crisis continues to unfold.","Stevenson, Clifford; Wakefield, Juliet R H; Felsner, Isabelle; Drury, John; Costa, Sebastiano",Br. j. soc. psychol,,408

Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of children and adolescents and to compare the results with previous national data and other studies to determine variations. METHOD: A total of 459 children and adolescents in residential care, foster families, kinship families, or family strengthening programs under SOS Children's Villages Spain were evaluated using the SDQ to measure internalizing and externalizing problems and using KIDSCREEN-10 index to measure heath related quality of life. An independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA and the chi-square test were used. RESULTS: The children and adolescents in this study had worse psychological wellbeing than those in the 2017 Spanish reference, that is, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Quality of life remained the same. No differences between care modalities were found. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to monitor the mental health status of children and adolescents to prevent possible problems. Additionally, it is necessary to use well-known assessment instruments because it is essential to have a reference to other situations and populations.","Vallejo-Slocker, Laura; Fresneda, Javier; Vallejo, Miguel A",Psicothema,,408

The Austrian government has implemented a lockdown to contain further spread of this disease on March 16th. We investigated the effects of lockdown on acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in Austria. Patients and methods We contacted 98 Austrian hospitals performing emergency endoscopies. The hospitals were asked to report upper GI endoscopies performed because of recent hematemesis, melena, or both and exhibiting endoscopically visible signs of bleeding. Investigated time points included three weeks before and after lockdown. Results 61% of Austrian hospitals and importantly all major state hospitals responded. 575 upper GI bleedings occurred in the three weeks before and 341 after lockdown (40.7% reduction). When comparing the first and last calendar week of investigation we observed an almost 55% decline in nonvariceal bleeding events (calendar week 9 versus 14: 196 versus 89) whereas rates of variceal hemorrhage did not change (calendar week 9 versus 14: 17 versus 15). Conclusions National lockdown resulted in a dramatic decrease in upper gastrointestinal bleeding events.","Schmiderer, Andreas; Schwaighofer, Hubert; Niederreiter, Lukas; Profanter, Christoph; Steinle, Hartmut; Ziachehabi, Alexander; Tilg, Herbert",Endoscopy,,408

In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing. The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic.","Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey",Clin Imaging,,408

Increasing levels of stress may lead to anxiety, depression, burnout syndrome, and in severe cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to examine the presence of stress among resident trainee doctors working in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia in the context of the corona pandemic. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Security Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We included the resident trainee doctors from different specialties of our hospital including medical, surgical, anesthesia, emergency room (ER), and critical care units. We used convenience sampling to select study respondents. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used for assessing the stress levels among trainees. Trainees were requested to fill the questionnaire either online survey monkey or in paper form. All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 26. We calculated mean, standard deviation, frequency count, and percentages for the perceived stress. Results: A total of 60 trainees were included in this study. Mean PSS-10 score was 20 +/- 5.51, with a range between 6 and 34.

322503,Covid-19 pneumonia with delayed viral clearance in a patient with active drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS: Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","Raoofi, Azam; Takian, Amirhossein; Akbari Sari, Ali; Olyaeemanesh, Alireza; Haghighi, Hajar; Aarabi, Mohsen",Arch Iran Med,,408

Eventually, many user accounts are deleted by their owners or suspended due to violating the rules of social media platforms. In this study, we analyze what happened in Twitter before and after the event triggers. We create a novel dataset that includes approximately 500k users sharing 20m tweets, half of whom actively participated in the 2020 BLM discussion, but some of them were deleted or suspended later. We have the following research questions: What differences exist (i) between the users who did participate and not participate in the BLM discussion, and (ii) between old and new users who participated in the discussion? And, (iii) why are users deleted and suspended? To find answers, we conduct several experiments supported by statistical tests; including lexical analysis, spamming, negative language, hate speech, and misinformation spread.","Toraman, Cagri; cSahinucc, Furkan; Yilmaz, Eyup Halit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00070v1.pdf,408

Methods: We gathered data from all 18 staff members with COVID-19 in ALDs in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, China. The baseline, job before diagnosis, presumed infection environment, use of protective equipment, and psychological status before and after diagnosis were collected and analyzed. A total of 18 uninfected staff members working alongside them in the same environment and 18 random matched infected doctors and nurses formed two control groups; the psychological impact of these three groups was then compared. Results: Of the 18 members of staff, 88.89% were infected due to the working environment (hospital), and nine had face-to-face conversations with doctors and nurses in their daily work. Many staff members did not take any protective measures in their routine work. Before they were diagnosed, 12 staff members were aware of the seriousness of the epidemic, and most of the staff maintained a neutral attitude to the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 77.78% of the staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes after diagnosis, which were mainly caused by family health and disease related issues. Most of them managed their emotions by self-control and video calls with their families. There was no significant difference in psychological impact among the three groups, but uninfected staff members were fully aware of the seriousness of the epidemic. Conclusions: Effective protective measures should be taken for staff members in ALDs. Psychological interventions are very important to help infected staff members in ALDs cope with psychological distress.","Luo, Li-Sha; Jin, Ying-Hui; Cai, Lin; Pan, Zhen-Yu; Zeng, Xian-Tao; Wang, Xing-Huan",Front.

Methods: In November 2018, one adult patient (female, 36 years old) with missing right mandibular first molar was treated in the Department of Implantology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Fujian Medical University. The three-dimensional virtual models of mandible and implant surgery tools were established, and the virtual reality software (Unity 3D 5.5.1) was imported. Combined with the virtual reality head mounted display, a virtual reality training system simulating the dental implant treatment process was independently developed. Ten refresher doctors and 20 graduate students in Department of Implantology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Fujian Medical University from September 2018 to December 2019 were recruited as the experimental objects (no clinical experience was found). According to the level and seniority of doctors, they were randomly divided into virtual training group and conventional training control group, which made the two groups comparable, with 15 in each group. Subjective scores (including anatomical structure, surgical field of vision, cavity preparation, implant placement and process mastery) were given after the corresponding training in the two groups, and the virtual reality training system was used to test. The mesial and distal direction, buccolingual direction, depth and angle deviation of implants before and after the training were analyzed, and the differences between the two groups were compared. Results: The subjective scores of five dimensions in the virtual training group were significantly higher than those in the conventional training control group (P<0.05). In the virtual training group, the mesial and distal, buccolingual, depth and angle deviation of implants were (0.73±0.33), (0.78±0.41), (0.61±0.32) mm and 6.66°±3.87°.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of the whole world. Our study aimed to describe illness progression and risk profiles for mortality in non-survivors. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and focused on 18 non-survivors among them. Briefly, we compared the dynamic profile of biochemical and immune parameters and drew an epidemiological and clinical picture of disease progression from disease onset to death in non-survivors. The survival status of the cohort was indicated by a Kaplan–Meier curve. Results. Of the non-survivors, the median age was 73.5 years, and the proportion of males was 72.2%. Five and 13 patients were hospital-acquired and community-acquired infection of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The interval between disease onset and diagnosis was 8.5 days (IQR, [4–11]). With the deterioration of disease, most patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical parameters, including lymphopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, as well as elevated D-dimer and procalcitonin. Regarding the immune dysregulation, patients exhibited significantly decreased T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, including CD3 +T, CD3 +CD4 +Th, and CD3 +CD8 +Tc cells. By the end of the disease, most patients suffered from severe complications, including ARDS (17/18; 94.4%), acute cardiac injury (10/18; 55.6%), acute kidney injury (7/18; 38.9%), shock (6/18; 33.3%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/18; 5.6%), as well as perforation of intestine (1/18; 5.6%). All patients died within 45 days after the initial hospital admission with a median survivor time of 13.5 days (IQR, 8–17). Conclusions. Our data show that patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical and immune parameters with the deterioration of the disease, indicating the necessity of early intervention.","Shao, Liang; Li, Xinyi; Zhou, Yi; Yu, Yalan; Liu, Yanan; Liu, Minghui; Zhang, Ruixian; Zhang, Haojian; Wang, Xinghuan; Zhou, Fuling",Front.

328446,Social Support is Key to Retention in Care during Covid-19 Pandemic among Older People with HIV and Substance Use Disorders in Ukraine,2020,"In the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth plays a significant role in the e-healthcare. E-health security risks have also risen significantly with the rise in the use of telehealth. This paper addresses one of e-health's key concerns, namely security. Secret sharing is a cryptographic method to ensure reliable and secure access to information. To eliminate the constraint that in the existing secret sharing schemes, this paper presents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) guided patients' privileged based secure sharing. This is a new secret sharing technique that generates the shares using a simple mask based operation. This work considers addressing the challenges presents in the original secret sharing scheme. This proposed technique enhances the security of the existing scheme. This research introduces a concept of privileged share in which among k number of shares one share should come from a specific recipient (patient) to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the original information. In the absence of this privileged share, the original information cannot be reconstructed. This technique also offers TPM based exchange of secret shares to prevent Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM). Here, two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key for transmitting the secret shares. The proposed method has been found to produce attractive results that show that the scheme achieves a great degree of protection, reliability, and efficiency and also comparable to the existing secret sharing scheme.","Sarkar, Arindam; Sarkar, Moumita",Multimed Tools Appl,,408

The required percentage of immune individuals has been estimated to be 50-66% of the population which, given the current infection rates, will take long to be achieved. Furthermore, data from SARS-CoV suggest that the duration of immunity may not be sufficiently significant, while the immunity response against SARS-CoV-2 may not be efficiently effective in all patients, as relapses have already been reported. In addition, the development of mutant strains, which has already been documented, can cause the reemergence of the epidemic. In conclusion, the development of an effective vaccine is an urgent necessity, as long-term natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may not be sufficient for the control of the current and future outbreaks.","Papachristodoulou, Eleni; Kakoullis, Loukas; Parperis, Konstantinos; Panos, George",Pathog.

331891,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has radically changed our lives causing hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide and influencing our lifestyle and habits. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a disease of felids caused by the feline coronaviruses (FCoV). FIP has been considered irremediably deadly until the last few years. Being one of the numerous coronaviruses that are well known in veterinary medicine, information on FCoV could be of interest and might give suggestions on pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that are still unclear. The authors of this paper describe the most important aspects of FIP and COVID-19 and the similarities and differences between these important diseases. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV are taxonomically distant viruses, and recombination events with other coronaviruses have been reported for FCoV and have been suggested for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV differ in terms of some pathogenic, clinical and pathological features. However, some of the pathogenic and immunopathogenic events that are well known in cats FIP seem to be present also in people with COVID-19. Moreover, preventive measures currently recommended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading have been shown to allow eradication of FIP in feline households. Finally, one of the most promising therapeutic compounds against FIP, GS-441524, is the active form of Remdesivir, which is being used as one therapeutic option for COVID-19.","Paltrinieri, Saverio; Giordano, Alessia; Stranieri, Angelica; Lauzi, Stefania",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Addressing Undeserved Suffering in Health Care,2020,"ABSTRACT: Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal recombinant antibody against IL-6 receptor, is currently used in managing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that occurred in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) selected cases. The primary objective of our study was to establish the effectiveness of TCZ in patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia.We retrospectively analyzed 25 consecutive patients, admitted in the Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Romania from April 1, 2020 until May 25, 2020, all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia. All patients were treated off-label with TCZ, beside their standard care. Adjuvant iron chelator was associated in 11 patients.Six female and 19 male patients admitted in our hospital all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia as defined by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were enrolled in this study. Seventeen of the 25 enrolled patients (68%) were seriously ill requiring noninvasive ventilation or oxygen mask, and 8 cases (32%) were critically ill requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients received TCZ, and also received hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50âmg for 10âdays. Adjuvant iron chelator (deferasirox - marketed as Exjade) was associated in 11 patients who had ferritin serum levels above 1000âng/mL. No side effects were encountered during infusions or after TCZ. We observed a rapid increase in arterial oxygen saturation for 20 of the 25 cases (80%) with a favorable evolution toward healing. Survivors were younger than 60âyears old (80%), had less comorbidities (10% no comorbidities, 70% with 1 or 2 comorbidities), lower serum ferritin levels (30% under 1000âng/mL), and 50% had no serum glucose elevation. Our patients with CRS had no response to corticosteroid therapy. Five out of the 25 patients had an unfavorable evolution to death. The off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe or critically ill form of SARS-CoV-2 infection had good results in our study.Off-label use of TCZ in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia is effective in managing the ""cytokine storm."" Better outcomes were noted in younger patients. Associated adjuvant iron chelators may contribute to a good outcome and needs to be confirmed in larger studies.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Chicea, Liana",Medicine (Baltimore),,408

Rather than uncritically adopt the standards of the currently predominant paradigm, homeopathy should not forget its roots, peculiarities, and self-conception. Contrary to conventional medicine, it is based on a teleological image of humanity, a holistic and sustainable approach towards curing sickness, and an up-to-date concept of medical theory in terms of healing arts. However, under today's frameworked conditions of industrialisation, commercialisation and commodification, the strengths of homeopathy tend to be disregarded or even attacked, and a special kind of reductionist and materialist rationality, compatible with expanding markets and profits, is preferably facilitated. To reveal and demonstrate these developments and relationships on a scientific level, there is a need for multidisciplinary research on the part of the humanities, such as history and theory of medicine, history and theory of science, history of economics, sociology of scientific knowledge, and philosophy.","Schmidt, Josef M",Homeopathy,,408

In the majority of patients the most active virus replication seems to be found in the upper respiratory tract, severe cases however suffer from SARS-like disease associated with virus replication in lung tissues. Due to the current lack of suitable anti-viral drugs the induction of protective immunity such as neutralizing antibodies in the lung is the key aim of the only alternative approach-the development and application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, past experience from experimental animals, livestock, and humans showed that induction of immunity in the lung is limited following application of vaccines at peripheral sides such as skin or muscles. Based on several considerations we therefore propose here to consider the application of a Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine to mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract as a favorable approach to combat COVID-19.","Förster, Reinhold; Fleige, Henrike; Sutter, Gerd",Front Immunol,,408

Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.","Fu, Yajing; Cheng, Yuanxiong; Wu, Yuntao",Virol Sin,,408
335683,Mental health advice for frontline healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a new contagious disease that has spread rapidly across the world. It is associated with high mortality in those who develop respiratory complications and require admission to intensive care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive therapy option for selected severely ill patients who deteriorate despite the best supportive care. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, extra demand led to staff reorganization; hence, cardiac surgery consultants joined the ECMO retrieval team. This article describes how we increased service provisions to adapt to the changes in activity and staffing. METHODS: The data were collected from 16 March 2020 to 8 May 2020. The patients were referred through a dedicated Web-based referral portal to cope with increasing demand. The retrieval team attended the referring hospital, reviewed the patients and made the final decision to proceed with ECMO. RESULTS: We reported 41 ECMO retrieval runs during this study period. Apart from staffing changes, other retrieval protocols were maintained. The preferred cannulation method for veno-venous ECMO was drainage via the femoral vein and return to the right internal jugular vein. There were no complications reported during cannulation or transport. CONCLUSIONS: Staff reorganization in a crisis is of paramount importance. For those with precise transferrable skills, experience can be gained quickly with appropriate supervision. Therefore, the team members were selected based on skill mix rather than on roles that are more traditional. We have demonstrated that an ECMO retrieval service can be reorganized swiftly and successfully to cope with the sudden increase in demand by spending cardiac surgeons services to supplement the anaesthetic-intensivist roles.","Rafiq, Muhammad U; Valchanov, Kamen; Vuylsteke, Alain; Taghavi, Fouad J; Iyer, Swetha B; Sudarshan, Catherine D; Fowles, Jo-Anne; Anderson, Simon; Govender, Pooveshni; Holmes, Miranda; White, Alexander; Mishra, Abhi; Mwaura, Lucy; Jenkins, David P",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,408

DESIGN: Both online survey and face-to-face interviews were employed in this cross-sectional study. The Household Food Security Scale and Household Dietary Diversity Score were used to access HFS and HDD, respectively. The HDD scores were derived from a 24-h recall of food intake from 12 groups. SETTING: Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 1876 households were recruited. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of HFS and HDD were 31·86 (sd 2·52) and 6·22 (sd 5·49), respectively. Being a rural resident, having no formal education, occupation of household head other than government job and low monthly income were potential determinants of lower HFS and HDD. Approximately 45 % and 61 % of Bangladeshi households did not get the same quantity and same type of food, respectively, as they got before the pandemic. Over 10 % of respondents reported that they lost their job or had to close their businesses, and income reduction was reported by over 70 % of household income earners during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn was negatively associated with HFS and HDD. CONCLUSION: Household socio-economic variables and COVID-19 effects on occupation and income are potential predictors of lower HFS and HDD scores. HFS and HDD deserve more attention during this pandemic particularly with reference to low-earning households and the households whose earning persons' occupation has been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kundu, Satyajit; Banna, Md Hasan Al; Sayeed, Abu; Sultana, Mst Sadia; Brazendale, Keith; Harris, Jody; Mandal, Moumita; Jahan, Ishrat; Abid, Mohammad Tazrian; Khan, Md Shafiqul Islam",Public Health Nutr,,408

Home-based OPAT allows for safe completion of prolonged courses of therapy while decreasing costs to the healthcare system, minimizing the risk of hospital-related infectious exposures for patients, and permitting patients to recover in a familiar environment. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, during which nursing facilities have been at the center of many outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, completion of antimicrobial therapy in the home is an even more appealing option. Persons who inject drugs (PWID) frequently present with infectious complications of their injection drug use which require long courses of parenteral therapy. However, these individuals are frequently excluded from home-based OPAT on the basis of their addiction history. This commentary describes perceived challenges to establishing home-based OPAT for PWID, discusses ways in which this is discriminatory and unsupported by available data, highlights ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated inequities in care, and proposes a multidisciplinary approach championed by Addiction specialists to increasing implementation of OPAT for appropriate patients with substance use disorders.","Jawa, Raagini; Rozansky, Hallie; Clemens, Dylan; Fagan, Maura; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,408

339012,Social Isolation and Loneliness Among San Francisco Bay Area Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place Orders,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently poses a global public health threat. Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model predicts susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered /deaths) cases and has been widely used but its applicability is limited often to an early phase of epidemic in the case of a large collective population. Full numerical simulation of entire period from beginning till end-point would be helpful in understanding COVID-19 trends with in-patient and infectious at large separately and also in preparing beds and develop quarantine strategies. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop an isolation considered epidemiological model to simulate a whole trend of the first epidemic in Tokyo and allow to count in-patient and those of infectious at large separately. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equation i.e. effective reproductive number and the final size equation. METHODS: Time-series SARS-COV-2 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo and antibody test conducted by Japan Government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on discrete delay differential equation (ATLM) was introduced. The model can predict trends of in-patient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, in-patient, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting the present ATLM gave 20% less infectious cases in field than that of standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that time lag T from infected till detected and isolated is 14 days. Based on this, adequate vaccine ratio to avoid outbreak was evaluated 57% of population. The date of release of a statement of emergency was 23rd May was assessed. Taking into consideration of infectious cases in field, 30th May should have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with shorter time lag of T=7 and larger transmission rate &#945;=1.43&#945;0 suggest that infectious at large should reduce to by half and in-patient be much the same of those of the 1st wave of SARS-COV-2 epidemic while public health intervention is applied to enhance social contact by 43% . CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-COV-2 data for Tokyo. Simulation agreed with data from beginning to endemic. Shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreak without rigorous public health intervention and control.","Utamura, Motoaki; Koizumi, Makoto; Kirikami, Seiichi",,,408

339829,"Qigong for the Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Infection in Older Adults",2020,"KEY MESSAGE: The first biochemical characterization of a chloroplastic disaggregase is reported (Arabidopsis thaliana ClpB3). ClpB3 oligomerizes into active hexamers that resolubilize aggregated substrates using ATP and without the aid of partners. Disaggregases from the Hsp100/Clp family are a type of molecular chaperones involved in disassembling protein aggregates. Plant cells are uniquely endowed with ClpB proteins in the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplastic ClpB proteins have been implicated in key processes like the unfolded protein response; however, they have not been studied in detail. In this study, we explored the biochemical properties of a chloroplastic ClpB disaggregase, in particular, ClpB3 from A. thaliana. ClpB3 was produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified to near homogeneity. ClpB3 forms a hexameric complex in the presence of MgATP and displays intrinsic ATPase activity. We demonstrate that ClpB3 has ATPase activity in a wide range of pH and temperature values and is particularly resistant to heat. ClpB3 specifically targets unstructured polypeptides and mediates the reactivation of heat-denatured model substrates without the aid of the Hsp70 system. Overall, this work represents the first in-depth biochemical description of a ClpB protein from plants and strongly supports its role as the putative disaggregase chaperone in chloroplasts.","Parcerisa, Ivana L; Rosano, Germán L; Ceccarelli, Eduardo A",Plant mol. biol,,408

342053,COVID-19 and mucormycosis syndemic: double health threat to a collapsing healthcare system in India,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the healthcare system in the United States. The redistribution of resources and suspension of elective procedures and other services has placed a financial stress across all service lines. The financial impact on the practice of vascular surgery has not yet been quantified. This study hypothesized that vascular surgery divisions have experienced losses affecting the hospital and professional side that will not be recoupable without significant productivity increases. Administrative claims data for clinical services performed by the vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center from March-April 2019 and March-April 2020 were analyzed. These claims were separated into two categories: Hospital claims (Inpatient and Outpatient) and Professional claims (professional reimbursement for all services provided). Medicare reimbursement methodologies were utilized to assign financial value: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) for inpatient services, Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) for outpatient services, and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for professional reimbursement and work relative value units (wRVU). Reimbursements and productivity (wRVU) were compared between the two time periods. A financial model was created to determine the increase in future productivity over baseline required to mitigate losses incurred during the pandemic. A total of 11,317 vascular surgery claims were reviewed. Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521, -47% (inpatient: $3,505,775 to $2,128,133, -39%; outpatient $1,476,339 to $521,388, -65%) while professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967, -54% when compared to the same time period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10478 wRVU to 5386 wRVU, -51%. Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase Inpatient and Outpatient revenue, above pre-pandemic levels, by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9 months, 19 months, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11 months, 20 months, or 36 months for a similar increase in productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and lasting impact on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial impact on a vascular surgery division has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% when compared to pre-pandemic period the previous year. Because complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short-term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","Fang, Zachary B; Simons, Jessica P; Judelson, Dejah R; Arous, Edward J; Jones, Douglas W; Steppacher, Robert C; Schanzer, Andres; Aiello, Francesco A",J. vasc. surg,,408
342539,COVID-19 Mortality Rates Among Nursing Home Residents Declined From March To November 2020,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic altered the workplace for medical education. As restrictions ease, the opportunities provided by virtual rotations remain. Radiation Oncology rotations based around virtual participation with patients (consults, follow-ups, and brachytherapy), contouring and reviewing external beam plans, didactics, and unstructured office hours have been well-received at multiple institutions. Virtual rotations decrease barriers to access including lack of a Radiation Oncology Department at home institute and high cost of travel and housing. Furthermore, rotations can be adapted to pre-clinical students and those with prior Radiation Oncology rotation experience. However, the virtual format creates and exacerbates several challenges including technical difficulties with electronic medical record or treatment planning software, lack of spontaneous interactions common to in-person rotations, and unexpected delays in clinic. We recommend early scheduled time with IT services to troubleshoot any potential issues, scheduled office hours with faculty and videoconferencing with non-physician team members to mitigate omission of in-person introductions, and providing complete contact information for all staff scheduled to meet with students to facilitate communication when unexpected clinic issues arise.

DESIGN: An observational study that identified patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 between March 12, 2020, and March 31, 2020. Data reported are those available through May 6, 2020. SETTING: A multicenter study including three Indianapolis area academic hospitals. PATIENTS: Two-hundred forty consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were admitted to one of three hospitals. One-hundred nine critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received routine subcutaneous chemical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome of this study was to determine the frequency of venous thromboembolism and the degree of inflammatory and coagulation marker elevation associated with venous thromboembolism development. Descriptive statistics outlined the frequency of venous thromboembolism at any time during severe coronavirus disease 2019. Clinical course and laboratory metrics were compared between patients that developed venous thromboembolism and patients that did not develop venous thromboembolism. Hypercoagulable thromboelastography was defined as two or more hypercoagulable parameters. MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred nine patients developed severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring ICU care. The mean (± SD) age was 61 ± 16 years and 57% were male. Seventy-five patients (69%) were discharged home, 7 patients (6%) remain in the hospital, and 27 patients (25%) died. Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in 31 patients (28%) 8 ± 7 days after hospital admission, including two patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism at presentation to the hospital. Elevated admission D-dimer and peak D-dimer were associated with venous thromboembolism development (p < 0.05). D-dimer greater than 2,600 ng/mL predicted venous thromboembolism with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.760 (95% CI, 0.661-0.858; p < 0.0001), sensitivity of 89.7%, and specificity of 59.5%. Twelve patients (11%) had thromboelastography performed and 58% of these patients had a hypercoagulable study. The calculated coagulation index was hypercoagulable in 50% of patients with thromboelastography. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that coronavirus disease 2019 results in a hypercoagulable state. Routine chemical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis may be inadequate in preventing venous thromboembolism in severe coronavirus disease 2019.","Maatman, Thomas K; Jalali, Farid; Feizpour, Cyrus; Douglas, Anthony; McGuire, Sean P; Kinnaman, Gabriel; Hartwell, Jennifer L; Maatman, Benjamin T; Kreutz, Rolf P; Kapoor, Rajat; Rahman, Omar; Zyromski, Nicholas J; Meagher, Ashley D",Crit Care Med,,408
342735,Understanding Psychological Distress and Protective Factors Amongst Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The past four decades of tourism research have demonstrated that the field would be impoverished without recognising the human aspect of scientific inquiry The contributions made through critical approaches, Indigenous perspectives, qualitative methods and morally instilled concepts such as 'sustainability' or 'community development' have accentuated that tourism scholars are not detached and value-free producers of knowledge Rather, our gender, ethnicity, personal and political views enter research agendas and actively shape knowledge Alarmed by a host of social, economic, environmental, political and ethical concerns, and motivated to end injustice, inequality, oppression and discrimination, we also circumnavigate hope However, researchers' relationships with hope can be problematic, as evidenced by the recent tensions within critical tourism scholarship In order to examine the extent to which hope ought to be part of tourism research, it is important to engage with the notion of hope seriously and methodically By drawing on different varieties of hope, it is argued that these can underpin research projects to different degrees, including critical hope, hope-as-utopia, transformative hope, radical hope and pragmatic hope It is emphasised that hope is connected to critical research in elementary ways and plays a vital role in envisioning a more just, inclusive, sustainable and equitable world The acknowledgment of hope as part of critical research is particularly valuable amid the COVID-19 pandemic - an event with devastating consequences for communities worldwide Through a hopeful lens, our momentary loss of tourism may bring with it a renewed appreciation and care, which has been eroded by rampant commodification and comatose consumerism The hope driving post COVID-19 visions of tourism is argued to lie in more thoughtful and responsible engagement with tourism, and in our ability to positively transform it","Pernecky, Tomas",Tourism Geographies,,408
344683,Defining effective strategies to prevent post-traumatic stress in healthcare emergency workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With an increase in high-demand sporting activity, the rate of pediatric and adolescent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is increasing. Yet, the failure rates after reconstruction are much higher than the adult population. The purpose of this paper is to understand failure rates, reasons for graft failure, and strategies for successful revision surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: A complete understanding of the failure etiology is essential for the clinician treating this population prior to revision. This begins with an assessment of post-operative patient compliance and sporting activity. Surgical technique must then be scrutinized for non-anatomic tunnel placement and poor graft size/type. Concurrent bony deformity must also be addressed including lower extremity valgus alignment and tibial slope abnormalities. Meniscus and chondral injury must be aggressively treated. Furthermore, imaging must be examined to look for missed posterolateral corner injury. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (in the setting of ligamentous laxity or rotational instability) may be also indicated as well. The surgeon can then choose a graft type and surgical technique that optimizes outcome and respects skeletal growth. Prior to surgical intervention, the clinician must also counsel patients in regard to the guarded prognosis and outcomes in this setting. Prolonged rehabilitation protocols/return-to-play timing as well as sporting activity modification in the post-operative period after revision are critical. There is limited literature on revision ACL reconstruction in the skeletally immature athlete. An understanding of all the risk factors for failure is essential in order to achieve treatment success.","Garcia, Steven; Pandya, Nirav K",,,408

Methods: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA. Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38-63) presented with fatigue, cough, and fever leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and one improved markedly. The other two had minimal response to steroids and no further improvement after IVIG. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious/immune-mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment.","McCuddy, Micheala; Kelkar, Praful; Zhao, Yu; Wicklund, David",Neurol India,,408

Since then, a number of therapeutic molecules have been explored to have potential efficacy against the SARS-Cov-2 per se or its sequelae. There are no Food and Drug Administration specific therapies approved so far; however, numerous drugs based on varying levels of evidence, in vitro studies and compassionate drug trials are being established as therapeutic agents, especially drugs approved for previous emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov). Numerous active clinical trials for COVID-19 with more than 150 drugs and products are under study. Needless to say, many dermatological drugs are being employed to mitigate this pandemic threat. We aim to review drugs with potential against SARS-Cov-2 widely used in dermatology practice. Additionally, rampant and overzealous use of these drugs as well as introduction of new molecules might lead to emergence of adverse effects associated with these agents. Dermatologists must be on lookout for any cutaneous adverse effects of these drugs.

Recent studies have highlighted the additional critical role of TCF1 in peripheral T cell responses to acute and chronic infections as well as cancer. Here, we review the regulatory functions of TCF1 in the differentiation of T follicular helper cells, memory T cells and recently described stem-like exhausted T cells, where TCF1 promotes less differentiated stem-like cell states by controlling common gene-regulatory networks. These studies also provide insights into the mechanisms of defective T cell responses in older individuals. We discuss alterations in TCF1 expression and related regulatory networks with age and their consequences for T cell responses to infections and vaccination. The increasing understanding of the pathways regulating TCF1 expression and function in aged T cells holds the promise of enabling the design of therapeutic interventions aiming at improving T cell responses in older individuals.","Kim, Chulwoo; Jin, Jun; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",Int. j. mol. sci.

349766,What motivates students to enter nursing? Findings from a cross-sectional study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer may cause significant disruptions in normal adolescent development particularly in social domains. Both treatment and survivorship pose challenges to fostering social connections. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review of the experience of social isolation and connectedness in adolescents with cancer and adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted following PRISMA Guidelines. Eligible articles included original peer-reviewed research published in English between January 2000 and April 2020 that reported on social domains of patients and survivors of cancer between the ages of 10-21. Initial database search identified 4606 articles with 43 studies meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Results were synthesized into four domains: (1) the prevalence of connectedness/isolation; (2) risk factors associated with social isolation; (3) protective factors against social isolation; (4) the impact of social isolation on psychological health. Overall, adolescent patients and survivors of cancer have satisfactory social connectedness. However, certain subgroups including those with central nervous system tumors are at higher risk of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In general, adolescent cancer patients and survivors report levels of social connectedness consistent with healthy adolescent population norms. The risk and protective factors identified in this review may help serve as important indicators for psychosocial screening and interventions. These findings are particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era as all adolescents face challenges to social connections and psychosocial development.","Pahl, Daniel A; Wieder, Matthew S; Steinberg, Dara M",J Adolesc,,408

About seventy-nine million infections and more than 1.7 million death have been reported to date, along with destruction of the global economy. With the uncertainty evolved by alarming level of genome mutations, coupled with likelihood of generating only a short lived immune response by the vaccine injections, the identification of antiviral drugs for direct therapy is the need of the hour. Strategies to inhibit virus infection and replication focus on targets such as the spike protein and non-structural proteins including the highly conserved RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, nucleotidyl-transferases, main protease and papain-like proteases. There is also an indirect option to target the host cell recognition systems such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease, serine 2, host cell expressed CD147, and the host furin. A drug search strategy consensus in tandem with analysis of currently available information is extremely important for the rapid identification of anti-viral. An unprecedented display of cooperation among the scientific community regarding SARS-CoV-2 research has resulted in the accumulation of an enormous amount of literature that requires curation. Drug repurposing and drug combinations have drawn tremendous attention for rapid therapeutic application, while high throughput screening and virtual searches support de novo drug identification. Here, we examine how certain approved drugs targeting different viruses can play a role in combating this new virus and analyze how they demonstrate efficacy under clinical assessment. Suggestions on repurposing and de novo strategies are proposed to facilitate the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Ruixuan; Stephen, Preyesh; Tao, Yi; Zhang, Wenfa; Lin, Sheng-Xiang",Biomed Pharmacother,,408

A need for simple, inexpensive techniques to prevent PPH and provide treatment exists, particularly in cases where uterotonics cannot be accessed. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labor. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of uterine massage after delivery of the placenta in reducing postpartum blood loss. Thus, a randomized controlled trial was conducted in Turkey between March 2018 and September 2018. A total of 176 pregnant women (88 in the control and 88 in the uterine massage groups) were randomly allocated to the two groups: one group receiving sustained uterine massage, while the other comprising the control group. The uterine massage group was administered transabdominal uterine massage, starting immediately after delivery of the placenta and continuing every 15 min for a duration of 2 h until the uterus hardened. The blood loss within 2 h of delivery was recorded. Level of significance was taken as p < 0.05, and the chi-square, t, and Mann-Whitney U tests as well as Spearman's correlation and linear regression were employed in the analysis of the data. The average amount blood loss within 2 h of the delivery was significantly higher in the control group than in the massage group (X = 170.49 ± 61.46 and X = 186.20 ± 47.59, p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was present between the uterine massage and control groups in terms of hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, and RCB pre-delivery and pre-discharge (first 24 h) values and in the use of additional uterotonics and the amount of blood loss (p < 0.05). The results of the analysis show that postpartum uterine massage has a reducing effect on the amount of PPH.","Erkaya, Reyhan; Karabulutlu, Özlem; Çalik, Kiymet Yesilçiçek",Health Care Women Int,,408

Conclusions: Whether or not and in which manner the pharmacomodulation of the renin-angiotensin system may had affect the clinical course of the reported six COVID-19 patients affected by stroke has to be still clarified. An urgent need of randomized clinical trials aimed to assess the safety profile and neuroprotective properties of ACE-Is and ARBs in COVID-19 patients diagnosed with stroke does exists.","Luzzi, Sabino; Giotta Lucifero, Alice; Marasco, Stefano; Del Maestro, Mattia; Bellantoni, Giuseppe; Gragnaniello, Cristian",Interdiscip.

352736,Physical activity during COVID-19 lockdown in older adults,2020,"Background: A recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), which began in Wuhan, China, with a high level of human-to-human transmission has been reported. There are limited data available on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hematological malignancies with more than 60 days of follow-up. This study describes the clinical characteristics, including multiple recurrences of COVID-19, in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during 69 days of follow-up. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old female was admitted to hospital isolation after being infected with COVID-19 as part of a family cluster on January 30, 2020. Apart from SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, laboratory results revealed lymphocytosis of uncertain etiology and abnormal distribution of T lymphocytes. On blood smears, small blue lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm were observed, and the presence of high levels of circulating clonal B cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and CLL. Among her family members, she had the highest viral loads and the fastest progression on lung injury and developed severe pneumonia. Serological results showed she had both 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; however, only IgG antibodies were detected in her husband's plasma. Results: A combination regimen of antiviral therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the early stage seemed to be effective for treating CLL and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Because of the low humoral immune response, the CLL patient could not effectively clear the SARS-Cov-2 infection and suffered from recurrence twice during the 69-day follow-up. Conclusion: In CLL, a neoplastic antigen-specific B-cell clone proliferates, and the progeny cells accumulate and outgrow other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. Considering the low humoral immune response and ineffective clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in CLL patients, the follow-up and home quarantine period should be extended. We need further studies to clarify suspending or continuing CLL therapy during COVID infection. For those patients who are prone to progression to severe disease, administering humoral immunity therapies can help to prevent disease progression and quickly meet the cure criteria.","Ye, Xingnong; Xiao, Xiaofang; Li, Bin; Zhu, Weigang; Li, Youjiang; Wu, Jianguo; Huang, Xin; Jin, Jingxia; Chen, Dan; Jin, Jie; Huang, Jian",Front.

353059,Nurses' pandemic lives: A mixed-methods study of experiences during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac injury is common in COVID-19 patients and is associated with increased mortality. However, it remains unclear if reduced cardiac function is associated with cardiac injury, and additionally if mortality risk is increased among those with reduced cardiac function in COVID-19 patients. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to assess cardiac function among COVID-19 patients with and without biomarkers of cardiac injury and to determine the mortality risk associated with reduced cardiac function. METHODS/RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 143 consecutive COVID-19 patients who had an echocardiogram during hospitalization between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020. The mean age was 67 ± 16 years. Cardiac troponin-I was available in 131 patients and an increased value (>0.03 ng/dL) was found in 59 patients (45%). Reduced cardiac function, which included reduced left or right ventricular systolic function, was found in 40 patients (28%). Reduced cardiac function was found in 18% of patients without troponin-I elevation, 42% with mild troponin increase (0.04-5.00 ng/dL) and 67% with significant troponin increase (>5 ng/dL). Reduced cardiac function was also present in more than half of the patients on mechanical ventilation or those deceased. The in-hospital mortality of this cohort was 28% (N = 40). Using logistic regression analysis, we found that reduced cardiac function was associated with increased mortality with adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.65 (1.18 to 5.96). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced cardiac function is highly prevalent among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with biomarkers of myocardial injury and is independently associated with mortality.","Chen, Lu Q; Burdowski, Joseph; Marfatia, Ravi; Weber, Jonathan; Gliganic, Kathleen; Diaz, Nancy; Ramjattan, Neiman; Zheng, Haoyi; Mihalatos, Dennis; Wang, Lin; Barasch, Eddy; Leung, Amanda; Gopal, Aasha; Craft, Jason; Ren, Xiaoli; Stergiopoulos, Kathleen; Jeremias, Allen; Petrossian, George; Robinson, Newell; Levine, Joseph; Shlofmitz, Richard A; Gulotta, Ronald J; Muehlbauer, Stefan M; Lucore, Charles L; Cao, J Jane",Clin Cardiol,,408

The study was focused on changes in two types of motivation: autonomous motivation- finding importance in the task of staying at home, and controlled motivation- staying at home because of felt pressure or choicelessness, as autonomous motivation predicts effective behavior change better than controlled motivation, especially long-term. Predictions grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) tested whether three motivating aspects of messages to stay at home from governmental and public health agencies, physicians, the news, and family and friends predicted changes in these motivations across time. Perceiving messages to stay at home as controlling predicted increases in controlled motivation and decreases in autonomous motivation over two months. Conversely, perceiving messages to stay at home as autonomy supportive predicted increases in autonomous motivation over two months. Results for mandated orders to stay at home were intriguing: they related to increases in both controlled and autonomous motivations over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that increases in autonomous motivation over time predicted actual time spent at home reported at Wave 2, whereas increases in controlled motivation did not relate. Discussion focuses on contributions to theory and public health messaging about behavioral change.","Legate, Nicole; Weinstein, Netta",Health Commun,,408

Some Preliminary Lessons Learned from the European VIGOUR Project,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most treatments in mental health care are provided through video calling. AIM: To poll what they think of remote care among 605 care providers of Arkin. METHOD: We surveyed 605 professionals on their experiences. RESULTS: Enthusiasm for remote care was found predominantly among psychologists who worked in curative care. They reported practical benefits for the patient and for the process of care provision. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who provided care to patients with complex and/or chronic problems. They feared a deterioration in quality of care and a decline in their job satisfaction. Nurses were also critical, especially those who provided FACT and outreaching care. Their patients often lacked the resources or skills required to access digital care. CONCLUSION: This assessment of remote care was likely adversely affected by the corona measures. Employees were suddenly forced to alter their usual work habits and had not been optimally trained in the new method were more critical. Moreover, they were forced to work from home and lacked informal professional contact with colleagues. Nevertheless, professionals have a nuanced and predominantly positive opinion of video calling: it is not suitable for everyone or appropriate under all circumstances, but remote care is seen as a useful addition to the existing arsenal of treatment modalities.","de Beurs, E.; Blankers, M.; Goudriaan, A.

This trend occurs alongside a growing recognition that social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) influence health and medical care use. Consequently, health providers and insurers are starting to incorporate new SBDH data sources into a wide range of health care prediction models, although existing models that use SBDH variables have not been shown to improve health care predictions more than models that use exclusively clinical variables. In this viewpoint, we review the rationale behind the push to integrate SBDH data into health care predictive models and explore the technical, strategic, and ethical challenges faced as this process unfolds across the United States. We also offer several recommendations to overcome these challenges to reach the promise of SBDH predictive analytics to improve health and reduce health care disparities.","Tan, Marissa; Hatef, Elham; Taghipour, Delaram; Vyas, Kinjel; Kharrazi, Hadi; Gottlieb, Laura; Weiner, Jonathan",JMIR Med Inform,,408

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations.METHODSWe retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15, 2020, and May 7, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available.RESULTSWe identified 77 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were recipients of cellular therapy (Allo, 35; Auto, 37; CAR T, 5; median time from cellular therapy, 782 days; IQR, 354-1611 days). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of nonrebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25 of 77) included number of comorbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host disease was not identified among Allo recipients. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients.CONCLUSIONIn this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the antiviral response and immune reconstitution.FUNDINGNIH grant P01 CA23766 and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant P30 CA008748.","Shah, Gunjan L; DeWolf, Susan; Lee, Yeon Joo; Tamari, Roni; Dahi, Parastoo B; Lavery, Jessica A; Ruiz, Josel; Devlin, Sean M; Cho, Christina; Peled, Jonathan U; Politikos, Ioannis; Scordo, Michael; Babady, N Esther; Jain, Tania; Vardhana, Santosha; Daniyan, Anthony; Sauter, Craig S; Barker, Juliet N; Giralt, Sergio A; Goss, Cheryl; Maslak, Peter; Hohl, Tobias M; Kamboj, Mini; Ramanathan, Lakshmi; van den Brink, Marcel Rm; Papadopoulos, Esperanza; Papanicolaou, Genovefa; Perales, Miguel-Angel",J Clin Invest,,408
359856,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice of the older people about covid-19 pandemic in isfahan, iran",2020,"Despite the outstanding success of the cancer drug imatinib, one obstacle in prolonged treatment is the emergence of resistance mutations within the kinase domain of its target, Abl. We noticed that many patient-resistance mutations occur in the dynamic hot spots recently identified to be responsible for imatinib's high selectivity toward Abl. In this study, we provide an experimental analysis of the mechanism underlying drug resistance for three major resistance mutations (G250E, Y253F, and F317L). Our data settle controversies, revealing unexpected resistance mechanisms. The mutations alter the energy landscape of Abl in complex ways: increased kinase activity, altered affinity, and cooperativity for the substrates, and, surprisingly, only a modestly decreased imatinib affinity. Only under cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations, these changes cumulate in an order of magnitude increase in imatinib's half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). These results highlight the importance of characterizing energy landscapes of targets and its changes by drug binding and by resistance mutations developed by patients.","Hoemberger, Marc; Pitsawong, Warintra; Kern, Dorothee",Proc.

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is estimated to have an cumulative global case-fatality rate as high as 7.2%[1]. As the SARS-CoV-2 spread across the globe it catalyzed new urgency in building systems to allow rapid sharing and dissemination of data between international healthcare infrastructures and governments in a worldwide effort focused on case tracking/tracing, identifying effective therapeutic protocols, securing healthcare resources, and in drug and vaccine research. In addition to the worldwide efforts to share clinical and routine population health data, there are many large-scale efforts to collect and disseminate medical imaging data, owing to the critical role that imaging has played in diagnosis and management around the world. Given reported false negative rates of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of up to 61%[2, 3], imaging can be used as an important adjunct or alternative. Furthermore, there has been a shortage of test-kits worldwide and laboratories in many testing sites have struggled to process the available tests within a reasonable time frame. Given these issues surrounding COVID-19, many groups began to explore the benefits of 'big data' processing and algorithms to assist with the diagnosis and therapeutic development of COVID-19.","Desai, Sudhen B; Pareek, Anuj; Lungren, Matthew P",Intell Based Med,,408

AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid nucleocapsid protein antigen detection (RAD) assays (Biosynex, Biotical, Orient Gene, Panbio and SD Biosensor), and describe the performance and impact of implementation of the SD Biosensor assay in an emergency department. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the five RAD assays were analysed on 100 respiratory samples: 60 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, 24 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative samples and 16 samples positive for other respiratory pathogens. The manufacturer's protocol was adapted to validate the antigen tests on transport media used for rRT-PCR in the authors' routine practice. The SD Biosensor RAD assay was implemented as a screening method for rapid diagnosis and targeted admission. FINDINGS: Sensitivity of the five RAD assays ranged from 88.9% to 100% for samples with cycle threshold values <26, and specificity ranged from 46.2% to 100%. During the implementation period, 4195 RAD tests were performed. Due to the rapid RAD result, 157 patients were transferred directly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cohort ward instead of the regular ward (N=47) or the temporary COVID-19 ward (N=110). CONCLUSION: The SD Biosensor, Biotical and Panbio SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests showed acceptable overall performance, and identified the majority of contagious patients. In the context of high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, RAD tests can be used as a rapid screening tool to guide infection prevention measures and aid targeted admission.","Van Honacker, E; Van Vaerenbergh, K; Boel, A; De Beenhouwer, H; Leroux-Roels, I; Cattoir, L",J Hosp Infect,,408
362348,The impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the diagnosis and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,2020,"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which became particularly invasive in Italy in March 2020. We show that the high apparent lethality or case fatality ratio (CFR) observed in Italy, as compared with other countries, is likely biased by a strong underestimation of the number of infection cases. To give a more realistic estimate of the lethality of COVID-19, we use the actual (March 2020) estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of the pandemic based on the minimum observed CFR and analyze data obtained from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, a good representation of a “laboratory” case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses, we derive more realistic estimates of the real extent of the infection as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then isolate the dominant factors causing the abnormal severity of the disease in Italy. Finally, we use the death count—the only data estimated to be reliable enough—to predict the total number of people infected and the interval of time when the infection in Italy could end.","De Natale, Giuseppe; Ricciardi, Valerio; De Luca, Gabriele; De Natale, Dario; Di Meglio, Giovanni; Ferragamo, Antonio; Marchitelli, Vito; Piccolo, Andrea; Scala, Antonio; Somma, Renato; Spina, Emanuele; Troise, Claudia",J.

362786,Burnout Status of Italian Healthcare Workers during the First COVID-19 Pandemic Peak Period,2021,"More than 198 million cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported that result in no fewer than 4.2 million deaths globally. The rapid spread of the disease coupled with the lack of specific registered drugs for its treatment pose a great challenge that necessitate the development of therapeutic agents from a variety of sources. In this study, we employed an in-silico method to screen natural compounds with a view to identify inhibitors of the human transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2). The activity of this enzyme is essential for viral access into the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Inhibiting the activity of this enzyme is therefore highly crucial for preventing viral fusion with ACE-2 thus shielding SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. 3D model of TMPRSS2 was constructed using I-TASSER, refined by GalaxyRefine, validated by Ramachandran plot server and overall model quality was checked by ProSA. 95 natural compounds from microalgae were virtually screened against the modeled protein that led to the identification 17 best leads capable of binding to TMPRSS2 with a good binding score comparable, greater or a bit lower than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat). Physicochemical properties, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity analysis revealed top 4 compounds including the reference drug with good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. These compounds bind to the same pocket of the protein with a binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol, -7.6 kcal/mol, -7.4 kcal/mol and -7.4 kcal/mol each for camostat, apigenin, catechin and epicatechin respectively.

363348,Disability and COVID-19,2020,"Fake news dissemination on COVID-19 has increased in recent months, and the factors that lead to the sharing of this misinformation is less well studied. Therefore, this paper describes the result of a Nigerian sample (n = 385) regarding the proliferation of fake news on COVID-19. The fake news phenomenon was studied using the Uses and Gratification framework, which was extended by an “altruism” motivation. The data were analysed with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to determine the effects of six variables on the outcome of fake news sharing. Our results showed that altruism was the most significant factor that predicted fake news sharing of COVID-19. We also found that social media users’ motivations for information sharing, socialisation, information seeking and pass time predicted the sharing of false information about COVID-19. In contrast, no significant association was found for entertainment motivation. We concluded with some theoretical and practical implications.","Apuke, Oberiri Destiny; Omar, Bahiyah",Telematics Inf,,408

364291,Mitigation of COVID-19 Risk Among Older Adults in Nursing Homes: A Public Survey,2021,"This article explores how the digital strategy for schools policy 2015–2020, Ireland’s national digital technology in education policy and its enactment in schools prepared them for school closures as part of the Covid-19 response. The educational, economic and social context in which the digital strategy for schools was published in 2015 was vastly different from the current living with Covid-19 context. When schools eventually recalibrate, lockdown induced school closures will have provided a collective perspective and richer evidence base for the triumvirate of student, teacher and parent to contribute to the technology in the education debate. This paper utilises Ball, Maguire, and Braun’s concept of context as a heuristic tool to illuminate the enactment of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015–2020. The approach taken is discursive drawing on the digital strategy for schools policy document and the corpus of national and international reports and literature that have been published during Covid-19. Findings are fused with a detailed theoretical discussion about what we understand by digital learning for a post-pandemic society, how the current digital strategy speaks to this new reality and where attention should be directed in future reviews and strategy documents.

364841,What influences practitioners' readiness to deliver psychological interventions by telephone? A qualitative study of behaviour change using the Theoretical Domains Framework,2020,"Technostress during the COVID-19 pandemic has become more prevalent as a result of the global preventive measures applied to limit the spread of infection. These measures included remote working from home in both public and private organizations. The objective of this study is to study technostress and challenges of remote virtual work environment among university staff members at Menoufia University, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was conducted over Menoufia University academic staff members in Egypt. The participants were chosen from both practical and theoretical colleges in Menoufia University using a multistage random sample. Tarfadar technostress questionnaire was used. Cortisol blood level was measured for all participants. This study included 142 participants. The mean age of the group was 36.32±6.41 years. 52.1 percent worked in practical colleges, and 60.6% were lecturers or higher. Their mean cortisol level was 15.61±7.07mcg/dl. Participants who were females, reside in rural areas, held a lecturer or higher position, had poor work-environment WiFi, and lacked technical training had significantly higher levels of technostress subscales. Most of the technostress subscales were significantly correlated with age and blood cortisol levels. The predictors of work overload in multivariate regression were female gender and a work environment with poor WiFi. Female gender, theoretical colleges, being lecturer or higher, and poor WiFi were the predictors for invasion. Among university staff members, technostress was found to be evident. High levels of technostress were significantly influenced by age, higher professions, female gender, and a bad workplace environment.","Gabr, Hala Marawan; Soliman, Shaimaa Sherif; Allam, Heba Khodary; Raouf, Shaimaa Yaihya Abdel",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Basics of Respiratory Failure,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 remains pandemic with countries scrambling to mass vaccinate populations, prioritising health-care workers, the elderly and the vulnerable. Malta is a small Mediterranean country with a population of circa half a million with free healthcare at point-of-care. This paper reviews the adaptations made to cope with mass vaccination. METHODS: Permission was obtained to tour hospital facilities. Photographs were taken with and edited on a mobile phone, a previously utilised methodology. RESULTS: Vaccination commenced on 27/12/20 with priorities as above. Malta Medical School lecture halls were initially used, followed by outpatients at the country's regional hospital, as well as other lecture halls, and National Health Service clinics. Virtually all medically vulnerable individuals have had their first doses as well as most individuals &#8805;60 years of age, with the 55-60 year age group currently targeted. Malta is well ahead of the European Union average. DISCUSSION: Exacting logistics and cooperation by all local authorities (such as the University of Malta) has resulted in a highly successful vaccine rollout. The eventual licencing of vaccination for children and the availability of booster dose/s will further facilitate the eventual attainment of herd immunity. This must be a global effort lest escape variants render these efforts futile.","Grech, Victor; Souness, Jorgen; Agius, Steve",J Vis Commun Med,,408

These emerging health inequalities mirror those already evident in UK society. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand how COVID-19 and the associated imposed restrictions affected the lives of people from the Muslim community living in the North West of England. METHOD: Twenty-five in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n = 22) explored individual experiences of COVID-19 and imposed restrictions. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: The virus and associated imposed restrictions had negative impacts on the psychological wellbeing of participants, their families and the wider community. Worry and low mood were particular features of participant's pandemic stories. Main concerns were those of contracting and transmitting the virus to others and employment-related difficulties. Low mood was particularly linked to the impact of restrictions on fundamental interactions embedded within cultural and religious practices. These practices are central to feelings of belonging and connectedness within the Muslim community. Religious beliefs were important in helping to mitigate psychological distress for some participants. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress was associated with COVID-19 virus and impact of COVID-19 restrictions on livelihoods and fundamental human interactions. Better provision of culturally appropriate information, improving local channels of communication and practical support are important during times of pandemic when usual support systems may be disrupted.","Hassan, Shaima M; Ring, Adele; Tahir, Naheed; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,,408
374548,The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on the Mental Health of the Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the CT imaging features/signs of patients with different clinical types of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) via the application of artificial intelligence (AI), thus improving the understanding of COVID-19. PANTIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and chest CT imaging features of 58 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to the Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Provisional 6th Edition), COVID-19 patients were divided into mild type (7), common type (34), severe type (7) and critical type (10 patients). The CT imaging features of the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 types were analyzed, and the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung was calculated with the use of AI software. SPSS 21.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients: fever was found in 47 patients (81.0%), cough in 31 (53.4%) and weakness in 10 (17.2%). Laboratory examinations: normal or decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts were observed in 52 patients (89.7%), decreased lymphocyte counts (LCs) in 14 (24.1%) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 18 (31.0%). CT imaging features: there were 48 patients (94.1%) with lesions distributed in both lungs and 46 patients (90.2%) had lesions most visible in the lower lungs; the primary manifestations in patients with common type COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (23/34, 67.6%) or mixed type (17/34, 50.0%), with lesions mainly distributed in the periphery of the lungs (28/34, 82.4%); the primary manifestations of patients with severe/critical type COVID-19 were consolidations (13/17, 76.5%) or mixed type (14/17, 82.4%), with lesions distributed in both the peripheral and central areas of lungs (14/17,82.4%); other common signs, including pleural parallel signs, halo signs, vascular thickening signs, crazy-paving signs and air bronchogram signs, were visible in patients with different clinical types, and pleural effusion was found in 5 patients with severe/critical COVID-19. AI software was used to calculate the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung. There were significant differences in the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions for the superior lobe of the left lung, the inferior lobe of the left lung, the superior lobe of the right lung, the inferior lobe of the right lung and the whole lung among patients with different clinical types (p<0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions for the whole lung for the diagnosis of severe/critical type COVID-19 was 0.740, with sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 58.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and CT imaging features of COVID-19 patients were characteristic to a certain degree; thus, the clinical course and severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated with a combination of an analysis of clinical features and CT imaging features and assistant diagnosis by AI software.","Ren, H-W; Wu, Y; Dong, J-H; An, W-M; Yan, T; Liu, Y; Liu, C-C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,408

The spatial variation in the environmental, health, socioeconomic, and demographic risk factors of COVID-19 death rate is not well understood. Global models and local linear models were used to estimate the impact of risk factors of the COVID-19, but these do not account for the nonlinear relationships between the risk factors and the COVID-19 death rate at various geographical locations. We proposed a local nonlinear nonparametric regression model named geographically weighted random forest (GW-RF) to estimate the nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 death rate and 47 risk factors derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Information, Centers for Disease Control and the US census. The COVID-19 data were employed to a global regression model random forest (RF) and a local model GW-RF. The adjusted R2 of the RF is 0.69. The adjusted R2 of the proposed GW-RF is 0.78. The result of GW-RF showed that the risk factors (i.e. going to work by walking, airborne benzene concentration, householder with a mortgage, unemployment, airborne PM2.5 concentration and per cent of the black or African American) have a high correlation with the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 death rate, and these key factors driven from the GW-RF were mapped, which could provide useful implications for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Luo, Yaowen; Yan, Jianguo; McClure, Stephen",,,408
375128,Telephone-Based Emotional Support for Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The health emergency caused by the spread of SARS-COV-2 virus has required the adoption of passive measures against contagion, such as social distancing. The use of filtering masks, of the different types available on the market, such as surgical and facial filtering masks (FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3), is also recommended. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper, within the Italian and European regulatory reference framework, is to suggest a rational application of existing methodologies that enable to know and assess the features and/or make a face mask intended to be used by the community. In addition to this, the study aims to provide a correct regulatory framework and useful information for a correct use and disposal of face masks. Another purpose is the assessment of the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. METHODS: The analysis of filtering masks is based on the review of scientific literature, the state of art of technology and the filtering means/materials available. Reference is made to filtering mechanisms and devices, the testing methods, the technical, manufacturing and performance features, and to the Italian and European regulatory reference framework. Reference is also made to the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. RESULTS: Surgical masks or, alternatively, filtering masks with a filtration efficiency between 90% and 95% for 3-µm particles, are the most practicable choice with minor contraindications. The reusable type of mask is conceptually superior compared to single-use masks, but cleaning procedures to be followed are quite complex and not always described in a clear way. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of rigorous and repeatable tests on mask filtration capacity, breathability, wearability, duration of use, regeneration, as well as safe disposal methods, are the main way to provide users with correct selection and use criteria. The results must be disclosed and disseminated quickly.","Santarsiero, A; Ciambelli, P; Donsì, G; Quadrini, F; Briancesco, R; D039,; Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Ann Ig,,408
375479,Substance Use Disorders and COVID-19: Multi-Faceted Problems Which Require Multi-Pronged Solutions,2020,"1.ImportanceNationally stated goals for distributing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines included to reduce COVID-19 mortality, morbidity, and inequity using prioritization groups. However, the impact of these prioritization strategies is not well understood, particularly their effect on health inequity in COVID-19 burden for historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations. ObjectiveTo assess the impact of vaccination prioritization and operational strategies on disparities in COVID-19 burden among historically marginalized populations, and on mortality and morbidity by race and ethnicity. DesignWe use an agent-based simulation model of North Carolina to project SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated deaths (mortality), hospitalizations (morbidity), and cases over 18 months (7/1/2020-12/31/2021) with vaccine distribution beginning 12/13/2020 to frontline medical and people 75+, assuming initial uptake similar to influenza vaccine. We study two-stage subsequent prioritization including essential workers (""essential""), adults 65+ (""age""), adults with high-risk health conditions, HMPs, or people in low income tracts, with eligibility for the general population in the third stage. For age-essential and essential-age strategies, we also simulated maximal uptake (100% for HMP or 100% for everyone), and we allowed for distribution to susceptible-only people. ResultsPrioritizing Age then Essential had the largest impact on mortality (2.5% reduction from no prioritization); Essential then Age had the lowest morbidity and reduced infections (4.2% further than Age-Essential) without significantly impacting mortality. Under each prioritization scenario, the age-adjusted mortality burden for HMPs is higher (e.g., 33.3-34.1% higher for the Black population, 13.3%-17.0% for the Hispanic population) compared to the White population, and the gap grew under some prioritizations. In the Age-Essential strategy, the burden on HMPs decreases only when uptake is increased to 100% in HMPs. However, the Black population still had the highest mortality rate even with the Susceptible-Only distribution. Conclusions and RelevanceSimulation results show that prioritization strategies have differential impact on mortality, morbidity, and disparities overall and by race and ethnicity. If prioritization schemes were not paired with increased uptake in HMPs, disparities did not improve and could worsen. Although equity was one of the tenets of vaccine distribution, the vaccination strategies publicly outlined are insufficient to remove and may exacerbate disparities between racial and ethnic groups, thus targeted strategies are needed for the future.","Rosenstrom, Erik; Mele, Jessica A.; Ivy, Julie; Mayorga, Maria; Patel, Mehul; Lich, Kristen Hassmiller; Johnson, Karl D; Delamater, Paul; Keskinocak, Pinar; Boyce, Ross; Smith, Raymond; Swann, Julie L",,,408

375933,Systemic Racism and Health Disparities: A Statement from Editors of Family Medicine Journals,2021,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 has captured the world. We hypothesized that this pandemic reduced referral of other non-COVID-19 patients to the hospitals or clinics, including gynecological and perinatological referrals. Women can be at risk in limited use of health services. METHODS: In this retrospective study, referrals from gynecologic oncology, perinatology, and gynecology clinics in a large teaching hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) were compared from February 20 to May 20, 2020, with the same period in 2019. Finally, referral trends in 2020 were compared with the COVID-19 admission pattern. RESULTS: Total admissions to all three clinics declined 63% in 2020 compared to 2019. There was a significant relationship between the number of visits to three clinics during these2 years (p < 0.001). The reduction in referrals to the gynecology clinic was more than gynecologic oncology and perinatology. The COVID-19 referral pattern was conversely linked to gynecology-related admissions. CONCLUSION: As the pandemic situation makes patients hesitant to go to the hospitals or not, health policymakers should consider other non-COVID issues, including maternal and fetal concerns. Providing safe places for other patients to visit is a goal that can be achieved through developing guidelines for nosocomial hygiene and training informed healthcare staff. Moreover, non-urgent visits should be avoided or postponed. This issue calls for new strategies, including telemedicine in situations similar to the current pandemic to both identify and manage such conditions.","Khazaeipour, Zahra; Razavi, Erfan; Pahlevan-Fallahy, Mohammad-Taha",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,408

This indication is seen from the community enthusiastic in the question and when the feedback about the disease COVID-19, the community's ability to answer questions also has begun well. As for the constraints in conducting counselling are also found as there are still people who do not concentrate in following the counselling caused because of their attention is distracted by children who are also brought at the time of counselling. Counselling time it felt too short, so the delivery of the extension material is not optimal. COVID-19 preventive execution generally runs as planned. While making preventive measures, there are still many people who do not behave well in the prevention of the spread of Coronaviruses, such as not keeping the distance at the time of communication, the presence of gatherings of people who are more than 5 people without wearing masks. At the time of giving counselling to the shop owner/crotch in the fish auction place about the importance of providing water and soap for hand wash ready action. In general, the shop/shop will apply the action, but there are also found shops/stalls that do not heed this preventative effort. &nbsp;","Aprihatin, Yessy","Sumatra Journal Of Disaster, Geography And Geography Education",,408

During the COVID-19 lockdown and pandemic, with students across the world forced into home-based learning via remote teaching, a VR classroom shows potential as a tool for adding depth to their learning. The possibility of immersing students in a virtual environment could provide an answer to motivation and engagement issues for today's students as well as a solution to some of the current constraints faced by teachers. In particular, VR has the potential to increase the time students are able to spend in (virtual) environments that are suitable for teaching and learning practical skills. With the cost of VR equipment reducing rapidly and the increasing quality of virtual experiences, it appears VR is on the tipping-point of becoming a regular part of school programmes.This article outlines the development and testing of a VR Classroom for the delivery of a food-based lesson with middle school students in a New Zealand school. Kitchens are a costly commodity for schools and the obvious health and safety issues make teaching practical cooking skills challenging. With a focus on student engagement and motivation, data is collected from observation of students using the virtual classroom and a post-test survey. Results show that students were highly motivated and perceived the VR classroom as fun to use.","Gorman, Daniel; Hoermann, Simon; Lindeman, Robert W; Shahri, Bahareh",Int J Technol Des Educ,,408

Early epidemiological estimates show that COVID-19 is highly transmissible, infecting populations across the globe in a short amount of time. WHO has recommended widespread clinical testing in order to contain COVID-19. However, mass testing in emergency department (ED) settings may result in crowded EDs and increase transmission risk for healthcare staff and other ED patients. Drive-through COVID-19 testing sites are an effective solution to quickly collect samples from suspected cases with minimal risk to healthcare personnel and other patients. Nevertheless, there are many logistical and operational challenges, such as shortages of testing kits, limited numbers of healthcare staff and long delays for collecting samples. Solving these problems requires an understanding of disease dynamics and epidemiology, as well as the logistics of mass distribution. In this position paper, we provide a conceptual framework for addressing these challenges, as well as some insights from prior literature and experience on developing decision support tools for public health departments.","Araz, Ozgur M.; Ramirez-Nafarrate, Adrian; Jehn, Megan; Wilson, Fernando A.",Health Syst.,,408

387122,Adapting Interventions for Occupational Therapy Practice: Application of the FRAME Coding Structure,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to the overlapping clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, parallels are often drawn between the two diseases. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are at a higher risk for severe manifestations of both illnesses. Considering the high transmission rate of COVID-19 and with the seasonal influenza approaching in late 2020, the dual epidemics of COVID-19 and influenza pose serious cardiovascular implications. This review highlights the similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19 and the potential risks associated with coincident pandemics. MAIN BODY: COVID-19 has a higher mortality compared to influenza with case fatality rate almost 15 times more than that of influenza. Additionally, a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes has been noted in patients with CVD, with ~ 15 to 70% of COVID-19 related deaths having an underlying CVD. The critical care need have ranged from 5 to 79% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, a proportion substantially higher than with influenza. Similarly, the frequency of vascular thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is markedly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with influenza in which vascular complications are rarely seen. Unexpectedly, while peak influenza season is associated with increased cardiovascular hospitalizations, a decrease of ~ 50% in cardiovascular hospitalizations has been observed since the first diagnosed case of COVID-19, owing in part to deferred care. CONCLUSION: In the coming months, increasing efforts towards evaluating new interventions will be vital to curb COVID-19, especially as peak influenza season approaches. Currently, not enough data exist regarding co-infection of COVID-19 with influenza or how it would progress clinically, though it may cause a significant burden on an already struggling health care system. Until an effective COVID-19 vaccination is available, high coverage of influenza vaccination should be of utmost priority.","Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Shahid, Izza; Anker, Stefan D; Solomon, Scott D; Vardeny, Orly; Michos, Erin D; Fonarow, Gregg C; Butler, Javed",BMC Med,,408

388977,COVID-19-related self-harm and suicidality among individuals with mental disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and its social responses threaten the health of people living with HIV. We conducted a rapid-response interview to assess COVID-19 protective behaviors of people living with HIV and the impact of their responses on HIV-related health care. METHOD: Men and women living with HIV (N = 162) aged 20-37 years participating in a longitudinal study of HIV treatment and care completed routine study measures and an assessment of COVID-19-related experiences. RESULTS: At baseline, most participants demonstrated HIV viremia, markers indicative of renal disorders, and biologically confirmed substance use. At follow-up, in the first month of responding to COVID-19, engaging in more social distancing behaviors was related to difficulty accessing food and medications and increased cancelation of health care appointments, both by self and providers. We observed antiretroviral therapy adherence had improved during the initial month of COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may pose added risk for COVID-19 severity were prevalent among people living with HIV, and those with greater risk factors did not practice more COVID-19 protective behaviors. Social distancing and other practices intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 interfered with HIV care, and impeded access to food and medications, although an immediate adverse impact on medication adherence was not evident. These results suggest social responses to COVID-19 adversely impacted the health care of people living with HIV, supporting continued monitoring to determine the long-term effects of co-occurring HIV and COVID-19 pandemics.","Kalichman, Seth C; Eaton, Lisa A; Berman, Marcie; Kalichman, Moira O; Katner, Harold; Sam, Soya S; Caliendo, Angela M",,,408
388989,Managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Immunity after dengue virus (DENV) infection has been suggested to cross-protect from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mortality. METHODS: We tested whether serologically proven prior DENV infection diagnosed in September-October 2019, before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinically apparent COVID-19 over the next 13 months in a population-based cohort in Amazonian Brazil. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of infection and disease, adjusting for potential individual and household-level confounders. Virus genomes from 14 local SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained using whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Anti-DENV IgG was found in 37.0% of 1,285 cohort participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.3% to 39.7%) in 2019, with 10.4 (95% CI, 6.7 to 15.5) seroconversion events per 100 person-years during the follow-up. In 2020, 35.2% of the participants (95% CI, 32.6% to 37.8%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 57.1% of the 448 SARS-CoV-2 seropositives (95% CI, 52.4% to 61.8%) reported clinical manifestations at the time of infection. Participants aged >60 y were twice more likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 than under-five children. Locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates were assigned to the B.1.1.33 lineage. Contrary to the cross-protection hypothesis, prior DENV infection was associated with twice the risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with P values between 0.025 and 0.039 after adjustment for identified confounders. CONCLUSION: Higher risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 among individuals with prior dengue has important public health implications for communities sequentially exposed to DENV and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","Nicolete, Vanessa C; Rodrigues, Priscila T; Johansen, Igor C; Corder, Rodrigo M; Tonini, Juliana; Cardoso, Marly A; de Jesus, Jaqueline G; Claro, Ingra M; Faria, Nuno R; Sabino, Ester C; Castro, Marcia C; Ferreira, Marcelo U",Clin. infect. dis,,408

Conceptual and methodological considerations to delineating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use and disorder,2021,"We examined the phenomenon of fewer new confirmed cases on Monday in Japan, which we refer to as the Monday effect. In Japan, prefectures aggregate and announce the number of daily confirmed cases. We analyzed the impact of this effect in each prefecture. The effect is mainly found in prefectures with populations of 2 million or more. This effect is also constantly observed in the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. However, the magnitude of the observed effect is uncorrelated with both the number of positives per 1,000 people and the population size. Our results suggest that the reporting delay occurs in prefectures above a specific size, but the magnitude of the delay differs among prefectures. We consider two possible explanations for this effect: 1) delays caused by the administrative system. 2) fewer tests are conducted on the previous day. Our results indicate that delays are caused by the administrative system in some prefectures, and that some prefectures with larger populations are less likely to conduct screenings on holidays.

However, no proven effective therapies currently exist, and different clinical phenotypes complicate the situation. In clinical practice, many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, including vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, even in the absence of cough and dyspnea. Understanding the mechanism of GI disturbances is warranted for exploring better clinical care for COVID-19 patients. With evidence collected from clinical studies on COVID-19 and basic research on a rare genetic disease (i.e., Hartnup disorder), we put forward a novel hypothesis to elaborate an effective nutritional therapy. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binding to intestinal angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, negatively regulates the absorption of neutral amino acids, and this could explain not only the GI, but also systemic disturbances in COVID-19. Amino acid supplements could be recommended.Level of evidence No level of evidence: Hypothesis article.","Nisoli, Enzo; Cinti, Saverio; Valerio, Alessandra",Eat. weight disord,,408

397851,The impact of COVID-19 on opioid treatment program (OTP) services: Where do we go from here?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. We propose a deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 from CXRs, as well as a tool for retrieving similar patients according to the model's results on their CXRs. For training and evaluating our model, we collected CXRs from inpatients hospitalized in four different hospitals. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1384 frontal CXRs, of COVID-19 confirmed patients imaged between March and August 2020, and 1024 matching CXRs of non-COVID patients imaged before the pandemic, were collected and used to build a deep learning classifier for detecting patients positive for COVID-19. The classifier consists of an ensemble of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNS), specifically, ReNet34, ReNet50¸ ReNet152, and vgg16, and is enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation. We further implemented a nearest-neighbors algorithm that uses DNN-based image embeddings to retrieve the images most similar to a given image. RESULTS: Our model achieved accuracy of 90.3%, (95% CI: 86.3-93.7%) specificity of 90% (95% CI: 84.3-94%), and sensitivity of 90.5% (95% CI: 85-94%) on a test dataset comprising 15% (350/2326) of the original images. The AUC of the ROC curve is 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97). CONCLUSION: We provide deep learning models, trained and evaluated on CXRs that can assist medical efforts and reduce medical staff workload in handling COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ A machine learning model was able to detect chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with accuracy and detection rate above 90%. â¢ A tool was created for finding existing CXR images with imaging characteristics most similar to a given CXR, according to the model's image embeddings.","Keidar, Daphna; Yaron, Daniel; Goldstein, Elisha; Shachar, Yair; Blass, Ayelet; Charbinsky, Leonid; Aharony, Israel; Lifshitz, Liza; Lumelsky, Dimitri; Neeman, Ziv; Mizrachi, Matti; Hajouj, Majd; Eizenbach, Nethanel; Sela, Eyal; Weiss, Chedva S; Levin, Philip; Benjaminov, Ofer; Bachar, Gil N; Tamir, Shlomit; Rapson, Yael; Suhami, Dror; Atar, Eli; Dror, Amiel A; Bogot, Naama R; Grubstein, Ahuva; Shabshin, Nogah; Elyada, Yishai M; Eldar, Yonina C",Eur. radiol,,408

398518,Health Care Worker Strikes and the Covid Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There are few studies that compare the cadaver dissections with the medical simulators in means of talent improvement. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. Material / Methods: The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroSTM, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. RESULTS: Group 2 had statistically significant higher Simulation Overview Procedure Time values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 3), the meaning of which is: Participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher Scratching of Humerus Cartilage values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 4), which means: Participants trained with simulation has less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare VR Simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR Simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects. As medical education will face a total change all around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has the potential to be an important guide during and after this period.","HurI, GazI; GÜlSen, Mert RuSen; KarmiS, Ece Belen; KaragÜven, DoGaÇ",,,408

401259,Are older adults also at higher psychological risk from COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Human movement is among the essential forces that drive spatial spread of infectious diseases. To date, reducing and tracking human movement during the pandemic have proven effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Existing methods for monitoring and modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases rely on various data sources as proxies of human movement, such as airline travel data, mobile phone data, and dollar bills tracking. However, intrinsic limitations of these data sources prevent us from systematic monitoring and analyses of human movement from different spatial scales (from local to global). OBJECTIVE: Big social media data such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (e.g., from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big Twitter data coupled with other human mobility data sources and AI to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local) for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. METHODS: This research will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multi-source datasets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. This research will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms, to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns from big geotagged Twitter data and other human mobility data sources for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: This project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project. CONCLUSIONS: Research findings can help government officials, public health managers and emergency responders, and researchers to answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of the social/physical distancing practice in curtaining the spread of the virus.

This is cause for concern with regard to bioethics and good clinical practice. The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials. Hydroxychloroquine also carries contraindications in the case of conditions such as maculopathy, retinopathy and QTc prolongation and should be used with caution in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnancy, lactation and the elderly. Despite this, there has been a rush to procure and self-medicate with hydroxychloroquine, which has been addressed by the National Task Force. The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19. While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG). The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind. It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a larger online cross-sectional study designed to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown across Spain. We analyzed a total of 1690 respondents aged &#8805;60 years and compared them with 13,363 respondents under 60 years of age. We employed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale to evaluate psychological responses. RESULTS: In all, 52.6% of women and 34.3% of men were found to be probable cases of any emotional distress (p < 0.001). In both sexes, the most common psychological response was avoidance behavior (34.7% and 23.8%, respectively), followed by depression (28.5 and 14.2%). Older women and men were considered probable cases of any emotional distress less often than younger ones (women: 52.6% vs. 72.3%, p < 0.001; men: 34.3% vs. 50.6%, p < 0.001). Finally, the results of the binary logistic regression showed that only depressive and stress responses are psychological factors associated with age group [age &#8805; 60 years, O.R. = 0.617 (95% CI = 0.501 - 0.759) and 0.437 (95% CI = 0.334 - 0.573), respectively]. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis and despite the high percentage of emotional distress we found in older adults, especially women, they are actually at lower risk of developing depressive and stress consequences from COVID-19 and lockdown than those under 60 years of age. That said, we believe our results highlight the need for expert guidance in this age group, especially older women living alone.","García-Portilla, Paz; de la Fuente Tomás, Lorena; Bobes-Bascarán, Teresa; Jiménez Treviño, Luis; Zurrón Madera, Paula; Suárez Álvarez, María; Menéndez Miranda, Isabel; García Álvarez, Leticia; Sáiz Martínez, Pilar A; Bobes, Julio",Aging Ment Health,,408

While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis.","Lv, Yanling; Chen, Liangkai; Liang, Xiaoling; Liu, Xiaohui; Gao, Ming; Wang, Qiang; Wei, Qing; Liu, Liegang",Clin. nutr.

405972,Smart technology for physical activity and health assessment during COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: The preliminary report of the RECOVERY large randomised controlled trial indicated a promising survival effect for dexamethasone therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. METHODS: In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models. It seems that propranolol would be a safe, potential, and prudent choice to invest in treating COVID-19 patients.","Hosseinzadeh, Mohammad Hossein; Shamshirian, Amir; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali",Int J Clin Pract,,408
406168,Social isolation and self-reported cognitive decline among older adults in Japan: A longitudinal study in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and instigated a widespread fear, threatening global health safety. To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are under way to test possible therapies. During this urgent situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication apparatus has indicated the highest potential towards antiviral drug discovery. In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach has facilitated the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak.","Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Froeyen, Matheus",J Pharm Anal,,408

Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients seem to be more common and have different clinical characteristics. Here we report 9 patients who had pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum during their stay in the ICU. Patients who were admitted to ICU between March 2020 and December 2020, were reviewed for presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema during their ICU stay. Demographic characteristics, mechanical ventilation settings, documented ventilation parameters, outcomes were studied. A total of 161 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period, 96 were invasively ventilated. Nine patients had developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema during their admission. Five of them were men and median age was 66.6 years. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients were managed conservatively. One patient was discharged from ICU, the others were lost due to other complications related to COVID-19. Upon detection of pneumothorax and/or mediastinum all patients were managed conservatively by limiting their PEEP and maximum inspiratory pressures and were followed by daily chest X-rays (CXR) for detection of any progress. None of the patients showed increase in size of their pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. Hemodynamically instability due to pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum was not observed in any of the patients. Tension pneumothorax was not observed in any of the patients. Most common reason for death was sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation or palpation of crepitation over thorax and neck in a COVID-19 patient should prompt a search for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Conservative management may be an option as long as the patients are stable.","Talan, Leyla; Sasal Solmaz, F Gonca; Ercan, Ugur; Akdemir Kalkan, Irem; Yenigün, Bülent Mustafa; Yüksel, Cabir; Altintas, N Defne",Tuberk Toraks,,408
407102,Shared Mental Models: Insights and Perspectives on Ideologies and Institutions,2020,"Traditional drug discovery methods are costly and time-consuming. Drug repositioning (DR) is a common strategy to overcome these issues. Recently, machine learning methods have been used extensively in DR problem. The performance of these methods depends on the features, representations and training dataset. In this problem, feature sets include many redundant features, which have a negative effect on the performance of methods. Moreover, selecting an appropriate training set is influential in the rise of machine learning method accuracy. However, in this problem, we face two obstacles to find the proper training set. First, most methods employ known and unknown drug-disease pairs as positive and negative sets, respectively. While the number of known pairs is much less than unknowns, it leads to machine learning performance error because of biasing to the majority group. Second, the absence of a drug-disease association means this association has not been approved experimentally and may be changed. In this paper, DRP-VEM framework is proposed to overcome the challenges. We assess DRP-VEM based on different parameters: disease and drug feature representations, classification methods, and voting ensemble training approaches. DRP-VEM is evaluated using heterogenous evaluation criteria. Moreover, we compare DRP-VEM using the best combination of parameters with DisDrugPred.","Ghorbanali, Zahra; Zare-Mirakabad, Fatemeh; Mohammadpour, Bahram",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01403v1.pdf,408

Residents from two other homeless shelters (B and C) used shelter A's day center services. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was offered to available residents and staff members at the three shelters during March 30-April 1, 2020. Among the 181 persons tested, 19 (10.5%) had positive test results (15 residents and four staff members). On April 1, PHSKC and CDC collaborated to conduct site assessments and symptom screening, isolate ill residents and staff members, reinforce infection prevention and control practices, provide face masks, and advise on sheltering-in-place. Repeat testing was offered April 7-8 to all residents and staff members who were not tested initially or who had negative test results. Among the 118 persons tested in the second round of testing, 18 (15.3%) had positive test results (16 residents and two staff members). In addition to the 31 residents and six staff members identified through testing at the shelters, two additional cases in residents were identified during separate symptom screening events, and four were identified after two residents and two staff members independently sought health care. In total, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members who received testing at the shelter or were evaluated elsewhere. COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary. CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident's heads are at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1).","Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Gonzales, Elysia; Self, Julie L; Rao, Carol Y; Keating, Ryan; Marx, Grace E; McMichael, Temet M; Lukoff, Margaret D; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Huster, Karin; Rauch, Jody; McLendon, Hedda; Hanson, Matthew; Nichols, Dave; Pogosjans, Sargis; Fagalde, Meaghan; Lenahan, Jennifer; Maier, Emily; Whitney, Holly; Sugg, Nancy; Chu, Helen; Rogers, Julia; Mosites, Emily; Kay, Meagan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,408

However, there are few reports regarding the prescription pattern of the triple-whammy. Objective To elucidate the patterns of the triple-whammy prescription in Japan. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed using a health-insurance-claims database that included Japanese people under 75 years of age, and enrolled outpatients that were prescribed any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, and diuretics between April 2017 and June 2017. As an outcome, the proportion of triple-whammy prescriptions was evaluated. Among the patients who received triple-whammy prescriptions, we evaluated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the proportion of prescriptions provided for these three drugs from different clinical departments and institutions. Results Overall, 730 of 246,721 (0.3%) patients received triple-whammy prescriptions. Among these patients, 13.3% had underlying chronic kidney disease. The proportions of any of the three drug types prescribed by different clinical departments and institutions was 48.2% and 61.8%, respectively. Conclusions We examined the patterns of triple-whammy prescriptions and concluded that pharmacists need to pay attention to triple-whammy prescriptions if the prescriptions are provided by multiple clinical departments or institutions.","Imai, Shungo; Momo, Kenji; Kashiwagi, Hitoshi; Miyai, Takayuki; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Takekuma, Yoh",Int. j. clin. pharm,,408

However, such abundant expert knowledge is available only for a handful of languages (e.g., English). In this work, by proposing a novel cross-lingual biomedical entity linking task (XL-BEL) and establishing a new XL-BEL benchmark spanning 10 typologically diverse languages, we first investigate the ability of standard knowledge-agnostic as well as knowledge-enhanced monolingual and multilingual LMs beyond the standard monolingual English BEL task. The scores indicate large gaps to English performance. We then address the challenge of transferring domain-specific knowledge in resource-rich languages to resource-poor ones. To this end, we propose and evaluate a series of cross-lingual transfer methods for the XL-BEL task, and demonstrate that general-domain bitext helps propagate the available English knowledge to languages with little to no in-domain data. Remarkably, we show that our proposed domain-specific transfer methods yield consistent gains across all target languages, sometimes up to 20 Precision@1 points, without any in-domain knowledge in the target language, and without any in-domain parallel data.","Liu, Fangyu; Vuli'c, Ivan; Korhonen, Anna; Collier, Nigel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14398v1.pdf,408
409426,The anxiety in healthcare workers and other populations due to the spread of COVID-19,2021,"Background: The role of immunosuppression/compromise (ISC) in risk of severe COVID-19 is unknown. While ISC could reduce control of SARS-CoV-2 viremia, it might also dampen the severe immune response to the virus;data comparing ISC groups is limited. Methods: Using patient-level data from 34 sites in the U.S. National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), we compared risk of COVID-19 hospitalization amongst COVID-19 patients in 3 ISC groups (1,300 persons with HIV [PWH];2,142 solid organ transplant [SOT] patients;41 PWH with SOT) to 288,743 COVID-19 patients without HIV or SOT (HIV-/SOT-). COVID-19+ was defined by RT-PCR, antibody test, or diagnostic codes. HIV infection, SOT and comorbidities were defined by conditions/diagnostic codes within 2 years prior to first COVID-19+. Hospitalization was defined by inpatient care between 14 days prior to 45 days after the first COVID-19+. Odds ratios of hospitalization were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for demographics, study site, and comorbidities (severe liver disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and total comorbidities [0, 1, 2, ≥3]). Results: Of 292,226 COVID-19+ patients, the median age was 41 years (IQR: 25-58), 46% male, 47% non-Hispanic white (NHW), and 17% non-Hispanic black (NHB). PWH and SOT patients, respectively, were more likely to be older (median: 50 & 56), male (70% & 60%), and had ≥ 3 comorbidities than overall N3C patients (30% & 64% vs. 8%). PWH were more likely to be NHB (50%) and SOT patients were more likely to be NHW (41%). Overall, 26% of HIV-/ SOT- COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. In crude analyses with HIV-/SOT- as the referent group (Table), COVID-19 patients with HIV, SOT or both had a 2.3, 4.4, or 6.9-fold increased odds of hospitalization, respectively. After adjustment for demographics and site, the risk was attenuated but remained statistically significant (Model a). Sequential adjustment for the type and number of comorbidities obviated the estimated risk among PWH, while SOT patients had persistently increased odds of hospitalization (Model b). Conclusion: ISC patients (PWH and SOT) are more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 independent of demographics. However, this increased hospitalization risk was driven mainly by the high burden of comorbidities in both groups. Only SOT patients had an independent risk of hospitalization after adjusting for comorbidities. Ongoing analyses will examine the impact of ISC on additional COVID-19 outcomes (i.e. ventilation use, death).","Sun, J.; Patel, R.; Madhira, V.; Olex, A. L.; French, E.; Islam, J.

A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drug's properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug's P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","Arutyunova, Elena; Bashir Khan, Muhammad; Fischer, Conrad; Lu, Jimmy; Lamer, Tess; Vuong, Wayne; van Belkum, Marco J; McKay, Ryan T; Lorne Tyrrell, D; Vederas, John C; Young, Howard S; Joanne Lemieux, M",J Mol Biol,,408

PROCEDURES: A secondary data analysis was conducted from the Domestic Violence Enhanced Perinatal Home Visits (DOVE) study of abused pregnant women (N = 239) and their infants' neurodevelopment from baseline through 12-months postpartum. RESULTS: Although all women reported decreased violence from baseline to 12 months postpartum, there was a significant main effect between baseline IPV scores and infant risk for developmental delay at 12 months (ß = .19; p < .05) and a significant interaction between baseline IPV scores and multiple partner categories (ß = .89; p < .01). Women in the single abusive partner category demonstrated a negative association between baseline IPV and 12-month infant risk scores (ß = -.56; p < .01). Whereas women in the mixed and multiple abusive partner groups demonstrated a positive association between IPV and infant risk scores (ß = .32; p < .05). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that an infant's neurodevelopment is impacted by exposure to violence in the home. Additional research is needed to examine the full impact, not only the effects of single and/or abusive partners on child development, but also the possible effect of multiple non-abusive partners on development.","Bullock, L; Ghazarian, S; Nimer, M; Signing, L; Herbell, K; Farje, D; Campbell, J C; Sharps, P",Matern. child health j,,408

Early clinical experience with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination suggests that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause a notably higher incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy on breast MRI compared to other vaccines. Guidelines are needed to appropriately manage MRI-detected unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy in the era of COVID-19 vaccination and to avoid biopsies of benign reactive nodes. This article examines the available data on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and offers a basic strategy to assess axillary lymphadenopathy on MRI and to guide management. At our institution, we are adding questions regarding the date(s) and laterality of administration of COVID-19 vaccination to our intake form before all breast imaging examinations. We consider MRI-detected isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination arm to be most likely COVID-19 vaccine-related if within four weeks of either dose. In these cases, we assess the lymphadenopathy as BI-RADS 3 and recommend a follow-up ultrasound be performed within 6-8 weeks after the second dose. These guidelines may be refined as we gain further data on the expected time-course of axillary lymphadenopathy post COVID-19 vaccination. Until that time, this management pathway will help avoid unnecessary biopsies of benign vaccine-related reactive lymphadenopathy.","Edmonds, Christine E; Zuckerman, Samantha P; Conant, Emily F",,,408

413001,Handling children in COVID wards: A narrative experience and suggestions for providing psychological support,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although pertussis cases globally have been controlled through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the incidence of pertussis has increased significantly in recent years, with a ""resurgence"" of pertussis occurring in developed countries with high immunization coverage. Attracted by its fast-developing economy, the population of Shenzhen has reached 14 million and has become one of the top five largest cities by population size in China. The incidence of pertussis here was about 2.02/100,000, far exceeding that of the whole province and the whole country (both < 1/100,000). There are increasing numbers of reports demonstrating variation in Bordetella pertussis antigens and genes, which may be associated with the increased incidence. Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 387 suspected cases were collected in Shenzhen in 2018 for genotypic and molecular epidemiological analysis. METHODS: There were 387 suspected cases of pertussis enrolled at surveillance sites in Shenzhen from June to August 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected pertussis cases were collected for bacterial culture and the identity of putative Bordetella pertussis isolates was confirmed by real-time PCR. The immunization history of each patient was taken. The acellular pertussis vaccine (APV) antigen genes for pertussis toxin (ptxA, ptxC), pertactin (prn) and fimbriae (fim2 and fim3) together with the pertussis toxin promoter region (ptxP) were analyzed by second-generation sequencing. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences publicly available from GenBank, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ). The antimicrobial susceptibility was test by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. RESULTS: Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis were successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 387 suspected cases, with a positivity rate of 16.79%, including 28 males and 22 females, accounting for 56.0% and 44.0% respectively. Thirty-eight of the 50 (76%) patients were found to be positive for B. pertussis by culture. Among the positive cases with a history of vaccination, 30 of 42 (71.4%) cases had an incomplete pertussis vaccination history according to the national recommendation. Three phylogenetic groups (PG1-PG3) were identified each containing a predominant genotype. The two vaccines strains, CS and Tohama I, were distantly related to these three groups. Thirty-one out of fifty (62%) isolates belonged to genotype PG1, with the allelic profile prn2/ptxC2/ptxP3/ptxA1/fim3-1/fim2-1. Eighteen out of fifty (36%) isolates contained the A2047G mutation and were highly resistant to erythromycin, and all belonged to genotype PG3 (prn1/ptxA1/ptxP1/ptxC1/fim3-1/fim2-1), which is closely related to the recent epidemic strains found in northern China. CONCLUSIONS: The positive rate of cases under one-year-old was significantly higher than that of other age groups and should be monitored. The dominant antigen genotypes of 50 Shenzhen isolates are closely related to the epidemic strains in the United States, Australia and many countries in Europe. Despite high rates of immunization with APV, epidemics of pertussis have recently occurred in these countries. Therefore, genomic analysis of circulating isolates of B. pertussis should be continued, for it will benefit the control of whooping cough and development of improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies.","Wu, Shuang; Hu, Qinghua; Yang, Chao; Zhou, Haijian; Chen, Hongyu; Zhang, Yanwei; Jiang, Min; He, Yuxiang; Shi, Xiaolu",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,408

However, there is a limited amount of data regarding the prevention and management of VTE in severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RECENT FINDINGS: In this article, we review currently available clinical data, and mechanisms for COVID-associated coagulopathy, and propose algorithms for screening, prevention (including extended-duration prophylaxis), and treatment of these patients. Although these recommendations are subject to change given rapidly evolving data, we provide a framework that can guide clinicians in managing thrombotic complications in this challenging condition.","Aryal, Madan Raj; Gosain, Rohit; Donato, Anthony; Pathak, Ranjan; Bhatt, Vijaya Raj; Katel, Anjan; Kouides, Peter",Curr Cardiol Rep,,408

DESIGN: Before-and-after intervention study without a control group (interrupted time-series analysis). SETTING: All 29 Israeli general hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs. INTERVENTIONS: Two national regulations were issued on March 25, 2020: one required universal masking of HCWs, patients, and visitors in general hospitals and the second defined what constitutes HCW exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and when quarantine is required. RESULTS: Overall, 283 HCWs were infected at work or from an unknown source. Before the intervention, the number of HCWs infected at work increased by 0.5 per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.7; P < .001), peaking at 16. After the intervention, new infections declined by 0.2 per day (95% CI, -0.3 to -0.1; P < .001). Before the intervention, the number of HCWs in quarantine or isolation increased by 97 per day (95% CI, 90-104; P < .001), peaking at 2,444. After the intervention, prevalence decreased by 59 per day (95% CI, -72 to -46; P < .001). Epidemiological investigations determined that the most common source of HCW infection (58%) was a coworker. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking in general hospitals reduced the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 among HCWs. Universal masking combined with uniform definitions of HCW exposure and criteria for quarantine limited the absence of HCWs from the workforce.","Temkin, Elizabeth; Schwaber, Mitchell J; Vaturi, Azza; Nadir, Eyal; Zilber, Rama; Barel, Osnat; Pavlov, Lidia; Carmeli, Yehuda",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,408

Using prospective cohorts of health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers* in eight U.S. locations during December 14, 2020-March 13, 2021, CDC routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections every week regardless of symptom status and at the onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19-associated illness. Among 3,950 participants with no previous laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,479 (62.8%) received both recommended mRNA doses and 477 (12.1%) received only one dose of mRNA vaccine. Among unvaccinated participants, 1.38 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per 1,000 person-days.§ In contrast, among fully immunized (&#8805;14 days after second dose) persons, 0.04 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported, and among partially immunized (&#8805;14 days after first dose and before second dose) persons, 0.19 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported. Estimated mRNA vaccine effectiveness for prevention of infection, adjusted for study site, was 90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization. These findings indicate that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, among working-age adults in real-world conditions. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons.","Thompson, Mark G; Burgess, Jefferey L; Naleway, Allison L; Tyner, Harmony L; Yoon, Sarang K; Meece, Jennifer; Olsho, Lauren E W; Caban-Martinez, Alberto J; Fowlkes, Ashley; Lutrick, Karen; Kuntz, Jennifer L; Dunnigan, Kayan; Odean, Marilyn J; Hegmann, Kurt T; Stefanski, Elisha; Edwards, Laura J; Schaefer-Solle, Natasha; Grant, Lauren; Ellingson, Katherine; Groom, Holly C; Zunie, Tnelda; Thiese, Matthew S; Ivacic, Lynn; Wesley, Meredith G; Lamberte, Julie Mayo; Sun, Xiaoxiao; Smith, Michael E; Phillips, Andrew L; Groover, Kimberly D; Yoo, Young M; Gerald, Joe; Brown, Rachel T; Herring, Meghan K; Joseph, Gregory; Beitel, Shawn; Morrill, Tyler C; Mak, Josephine; Rivers, Patrick; Harris, Katherine M; Hunt, Danielle R; Arvay, Melissa L; Kutty, Preeta; Fry, Alicia M; Gaglani, Manjusha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,408

This study examines whether and how students' prior and current experiences of digital inequality-defined as constrained access to the internet and internet-connecting devices-were associated with their remote learning experiences. METHOD: An anonymous, online survey of 2,913 undergraduate college students from 30 U.S. universities completing their spring term remotely was conducted between April and May 2020. Hypothesis testing utilized a structural equation model with cluster-bootstrapped standard errors and p-values, to account for students being clustered by university. RESULTS: Findings revealed that students' challenges with internet connectivity and digital devices during remote learning were associated with lower remote learning proficiency (RLP). Difficulty communicating with professors and teaching assistants was also associated with lower RLP. Prior experience with online coursework was associated with higher RLP, and digital inequality challenges during the year prior to the pandemic with lower RLP. Moreover, students who reported greater financial hardship since the start of the pandemic experienced significantly more connectivity, device, and faculty communication challenges during remote learning, and had significantly lower RLP. CONCLUSIONS: Many students will continue to learn remotely in some form until the pandemic recedes. We identify key factors associated with students' remote learning proficiency: (1) consistent, high-speed internet connectivity and functioning devices to connect to it, and (2) the ability to relate to and communicate easily with professors and teaching assistants. This study identifies potential barriers to effective remote learning, as well as possible opportunities to improve students' experiences.","Katz, Vikki S; Jordan, Amy B; Ognyanova, Katherine",PLoS One,,408

By the time this sentence is published we will have well surpassed 1.5 million whole genomes, more than 4 times the number of all microbial whole genomes deposited in GenBank and 35 times the total number of viral genomes. This extraordinary dataset that accrued in near real time has also given us an opportunity to chart the global and local evolution of a virus as it moves through the world population. The data itself presents challenges that have never been dealt with in molecular epidemiology, and tracking a virus that is changing so rapidly means that we are often running to catch up. Here we review what is known about the evolution of the virus, and the critical impact that whole genomes have had on our ability to trace back and track forward the spread of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. We then review what whole genomes have told us about basic biological properties of the virus such as transmissibility, virulence, and immune escape with a special emphasis on pediatric disease. We couch this discussion within the framework of systematic biology and phylogenetics, disciplines that have proven their worth again and again for identifying and deciphering the spread of epidemics, though they were largely developed in areas far removed from infectious disease and medicine.","Moustafa, Ahmed M; Planet, Paul J",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,408
423018,Telepsychotherapy during a pandemic: A traumatic stress perspective,2020,"This preliminary study proposed the diagnosis of COVID-19 by means of Raman spectroscopy. Samples of blood serum from 10 patients positive and 10 patients negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR RNA and ELISA tests were analyzed. Raman spectra were obtained with a dispersive Raman spectrometer (830 nm, 350 mW) in triplicate, being submitted to exploratory analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the spectral differences and discriminant analysis with PCA (PCA-DA) and partial least squares (PLS-DA) for classification of the blood serum spectra into Control and COVID-19. The spectra of both groups positive and negative for COVID-19 showed peaks referred to the basal constitution of the serum (mainly albumin). The difference spectra showed decrease in the peaks referred to proteins and amino acids for the group positive. PCA variables showed more detailed spectral differences related to the biochemical alterations due to the COVID-19 such as increase in lipids, nitrogen compounds (urea and amines/amides) and nucleic acids, and decrease of proteins and amino acids (tryptophan) in the COVID-19 group. The discriminant analysis applied to the principal component loadings (PC 2, PC 4, PC 5 and PC 6) could classify spectra with 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity indicated in the RT-PCR kit leaflet, demonstrating the possibilities of a rapid, label-free and costless technique for diagnosing COVID-19 infection.","Goulart, Ana Cristina Castro; Silveira, Landulfo; Carvalho, Henrique Cunha; Dorta, Cristiane Bissoli; Pacheco, Marcos Tadeu Tavares; Zangaro, Renato Amaro",,,408

This virtual conference was held online from 15 to 16 December 2020 via the GoogleMeet platform, and was officiated by the Vice Chancellor of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. The virtual platform was chosen in the first place due to travel restrictions and safety reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we ensured that this platform is as good as any face-to-face conference as all plenary sessions were open to every participants to build efficient research networks. In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the 2 Keynote sessions were made live via the official Facebook of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. Our conference participants represented Malaysia, Philippines, Nepal and Indonesia. Keep the network growing! We have seen global scenarios of environmental pollution resulting from burning of agricultural wastes. Also, almost all biodiversity is not plastic-free today, and plastics are not renewable. Thus this brings us to the theme of the conference this year, which was “Biomass Innovation for Sustainable Development”. This theme has been chosen in view of the current revolution and rapid developments in the field of biomass utilization. With breakthrough research and novel findings, agricultural wastes can be made directly into valuable chemicals and products with an increase in value. A number of 117 papers were published and organised around broad subdisciplines such as such as sustainable biomass resources for decarbonising the economy, biomass conversion technologies for bioenergy, biomass conversion to intermediates and products, bioeconomy sustainability, impacts and policies, bioenergy integration and many more. A total of 16 plenary virtual sessions were conducted with 79 oral presentations (15 minutes presentation and 5 minutes Q&A) and 42 posters.

Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures.","McMichael, Temet M; Clark, Shauna; Pogosjans, Sargis; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Baer, Atar; Kawakami, Vance; Lukoff, Margaret D; Ferro, Jessica; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Riedo, Francis X; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Montgomery, Patricia; Rao, Agam K; Currie, Dustin W; Chow, Eric J; Tobolowsky, Farrell; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Jacobs, Jesica R; Schwartz, Noah G; Stone, Nimalie; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A; Honein, Margaret A; Clark, Thomas A; Duchin, Jeffrey S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,408
426302,COVID-19 Precautions Are Scarce in Non–Health Care Workplaces: The Journal of the American Medical Association,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic results in disproportional consequences for psychiatric patients. Due to restraints in physical contacts, providers switched from face-to-face contacts to teletherapy, but prior experiences were mostly limited. The study aimed at assessing symptom dynamics, potentially increased adversities and factors influencing a successful transition into teletherapy in adolescent psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Thirty adolescent psychiatric outpatients participated in an interview-based study. The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by integrating patients' and psychiatrists' judgements. RESULTS: Patients who reported deteriorated symptoms and patients who showed (partial) improvement of symptomatology could be separated by feelings of isolation (specific to deterioration) and perceived reduction in school-associated stress (unique to improvement). Patients with worsening symptomatology showed a significantly higher degree of psychosocial disability before lockdown and at the first interview. Patients who deteriorated in their level of psychosocial functioning also reported negatively on teletherapy. These patients were verbally less differentiated concerning emotions and affect, reported introspection and rumination, and stated distinctly lower levels of perceived social support. Concerning adversities, no clear trend could be identified, but some patients reported increased domestic violence and neglect. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a higher degree of psychosocial disability suffer disproportionally from the crisis, so that an assessment of functioning should serve as a triage tool. Also, a screening of the perceived level of social support should be established before offering teletherapy. Additionally, the provision of strategies to enhance verbalisation and differentiation of emotions and affect might be beneficial.","Huscsava, Mercedes M; Scharinger, Christian; Plener, Paul L; Kothgassner, Oswald D",Child and adolescent mental health,,408
426562,"Perspective on COVID-19: Finally, Telemedicine at Center Stage",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess past infection, evaluate responses to vaccines in development, and determine individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which have not scaled to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests so far. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood with direct, visual readout. Two novel fusion proteins, RBD-2E8 and B6-CH1-RBD, were designed to bind red blood cells (RBCs) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), thereby displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Mixing mammalian-derived RBD-2E8 and B6-CH1-RBD with convalescent COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs led to visible hemagglutination, indicating the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. B6-CH1-RBD made in bacteria was not as effective in inducing agglutination, indicating better recognition of RBD epitopes from mammalian cells. Given that our hemagglutination test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world for blood typing, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed at minimal cost. We anticipate our hemagglutination assay may find extensive use in low-resource settings for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Kruse, Robert L; Huang, Yuting; Smetana, Heather; Gehrie, Eric A; Amukele, Timothy K; Tobian, Aaron A R; Mostafa, Heba H; Wang, Zack Z",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,408

Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric complications, suggesting that the ""psychoneuroimmunity"" model might be beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special Issue on ""Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic"" was launched immediately after the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020. A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders, encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A ""three-steps"" Neuro-COVID infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion.

Therefore, we improved our practice in consideration of COVID-19 lockdown, by converting non-urgent control visits to telephone follow-up. We aimed to evaluate patients' satisfaction for this alternative approach. Material and Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted using a validated questionnaire to investigate pelvic floor symptoms. Patients were also asked if they have other symptoms / disorders, to identify patients who may need urgent hospital evaluation. At the end of the phone call, patients were asked to score their satisfaction with the telephone follow-up in a range from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) with the following 3 questions: 1) ""was the telephone interview useful to check your state of health?""; 2) ""was the telephone interview an adequate healthcare tool in consideration of COVID-19 outbreak?""; 3) ""could the telephone interview replace the conventional visit?"". Results: Fifty-three patients were evaluated. All patients showed great satisfaction with telephone follow-up (Q1=9.7) and considered telephone interviews as an adequate tool in consideration of COVID-19 lockdown (Q2=9.8). Moreover most of them felt that this approach can even replace conventional check-up (Q3=7.0). Conclusion: This simple experience showed that phone interviews with validated questionnaires are appreciated and effective to safely perform follow-up of urogynecologic patients.","Frigerio, Matteo; Barba, Marta; Manodoro, Stefano; Bosio, Sara; Locatelli, Luca",,,408

Recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic has added to recognition of this unmet need. There needs to be more effective clinical integration of relevant services, which must be informed by patient choice and clinical need, and accessible throughout the patient's whole cancer journey. This needs to be accompanied by training and research integration as well as more effective and creative use of technology such as virtual reality and simulation, quality assuring apps, and mobile technologies. Finally, as a clinical community we need to drive a shift in culture towards measurement of patient quality of life as a marker of treatment effectiveness. We also need to support our own clinical workforce with their own mental health needs so that we prevent the alarming rates of burnout prevalent among clinicians treating cancer. The call to action for innovation and staff support has been amplified by experience in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report highlights the unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Patients need effective access to psychological support and mental health services throughout their cancer journey, including better use of technology. There is also a need to support the psychological wellbeing of cancer clinicians.","Fernando, Asanga",Eur Urol Focus,,408
433696,A Theory of Change for Web-Based Therapy and Support Services for Children and Young People: Collaborative Qualitative Exploration,2021,"Study Objectives: NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst, a public hospital in Queens, NY, was one of the first and hardest hit hospitals in the COVID-19 pandemic Emergency department (ED) clinicians anecdotally began to note a rise in ED visit volumes near the end of February 2020, which quickly became an unprecedented surge before tapering to unprecedentedly low levels This study quantifies Elmhurst ED volumes throughout the pandemic, from early March to late May 2020, and compares them to the corresponding 2019 volumes In addition, rates of admission from the ED to the hospital are examined to help determine the severity of symptoms in patients who did present to the ED, especially as volumes declined Methods: Number of daily ED visits and daily admissions were obtained from the electronic medical record, EPIC, for the 12 weeks beginning the first Sunday of March 2020 (March 1-May 23, 2020) and the corresponding 12 weeks of 2019 (March 3-May 25, 2019) Daily ED visits were counted by the number of patients who registered to be seen during the 24-hour period Results: A sharply increasing trend in ED volumes began around March 10, 2020 and peaked on March 18, when the daily ED volume was 68% greater than on the corresponding Wednesday of 2019 A sharp decrease in ED volumes followed, leveling off around the week of April 12 Between April 12 and May 23, the average daily ED volume was 65% less than for the corresponding period in 2019 In addition, the daily percentage of ED visits admitted to the hospital began to rise around the fourth week of March 2020, peaking at 59% admitted on April 2 The admission rate trended down through April and May but remained notably higher than 2019: for example, between May 3 and May 23, 2020, the average daily admission rate was 22%, compared to 14% during the corresponding period in 2019, a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0 001) Conclusion: Although other sources have reported decreased ED volumes in some areas throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note the two-stage response at the epicenter of the crisis Similar patterns might be observed if COVID-19 spreads to new areas or reappears as a second wave, or in the event of a different, future pandemic The speed and magnitude of the surge in ED volumes suggest that ED staff, testing capacity, and other resources can quickly be overwhelmed without advance preparation In addition, the striking decrease in ED volumes in April and May 2020 compared to 2019, not unlike patterns being seen across the country, raises concern about delays in care due to the public’s fear of seeking medical attention during the pandemic The markedly elevated rates of admission from the ED to the hospital during this time confirm that patients presenting to the ED have more severe symptoms on average, possibly due to delaying seeking care for mild or early symptoms of serious conditions [Formula presented]","Feldman, N.; Lane, R.; Iavicoli, L.; Fairweather, P.; Kessler, S.; Bentley, S.

Complement was implicated as key contributor to this process, therefore we hypothesized that markers of the complement profile, indicative for the activation state of the system, may be related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Methods: In this prospective cohort study samples of 102 hospitalized and 26 outpatients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Primary outcome was in-hospital, COVID-19 related mortality, and secondary outcome was COVID-19 severity as assessed by the WHO ordinal scale. Complement activity of alternative and classical pathways, its factors, regulators, and activation products were measured by hemolytic titration, turbidimetry, or enzyme-immunoassays. Clinical covariates and markers of inflammation were extracted from hospital records. Results: Increased complement activation was characteristic for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Complement activation was significantly associated with markers of inflammation, such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Twenty-five patients died during hospital stay due to COVID-19 related illness. Patients with uncontrolled complement activation leading to consumption of C3 and decrease of complement activity were more likely to die, than those who had complement activation without consumption. Cox models identified anaphylatoxin C3a, and C3 overactivation and consumption (ratio of C3a/C3) as predictors of in-hospital mortality [HR of 3.63 (1.55-8.45, 95% CI) and 6.1 (2.1-17.8), respectively]. Conclusion: Increased complement activation is associated with advanced disease severity of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to die when the disease is accompanied by overactivation and consumption of C3. These results may provide observational evidence and further support to studies on complement inhibitory drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sinkovits, György; Mezo, Blanka; Réti, Marienn; Müller, Veronika; Iványi, Zsolt; Gál, János; Gopcsa, László; Reményi, Péter; Szathmáry, Beáta; Lakatos, Botond; Szlávik, János; Bobek, Ilona; Prohászka, Zita Z; Förhécz, Zsolt; Csuka, Dorottya; Hurler, Lisa; Kajdácsi, Erika; Cervenak, László; Kiszel, Petra; Masszi, Tamás; Vályi-Nagy, István; Prohászka, Zoltán",Front Immunol,,408
436308,The psychological impact of COVID-19 on 'hidden' frontline healthcare workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, clinical data from various parts of the world have been reported. Up till now, there has been no clinical data with regards to COVID-19 from Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). The aim was to report on the first cohort of patients from B&H and to analyze factors that influence COVID-19 patient's length of hospitalization (LOH). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Tuzla University Clinical Center (UKC), B&H. It involved 25 COVID-19 positive patients that needed hospitalisation between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The LOH was measured from the time of admission to discharge. Factors analyzed induced age, BMI, presence of known comorbidities, serum creatinine and O2 saturation upon admission. RESULTS: The mean age was 52.92 ± 19.15 years and BMI 28.80 ± 4.22. LOH for patients with BMI < 25 was 9 ± SE2.646 days (CI 95% 3.814-14.816) vs 14.182 ± SE .937 (CI 95% 12.346-16.018 p < 0.05; HR 5.148 CI95% 1.217 to 21.772 p = 0.026) for &#8805;25 BMI. The mean LOH of patients with normal levels of O2 &#8805; 95% was 11.667 ± SE1.202 (CI95% 8.261 to 13.739; p = 0.046), while LOH for patients with < 95% was 14.625 ± SE 1.231 CI95% 12.184 to 16.757 p = 0.042; HR 3.732 CI95%1.137-12.251 p = 0.03). Patients without known comorbidities had a mean LOH of 11.700 ± SE1.075 (CI 95% 9.592-13.808), while those with comorbidities had a mean of 14.8 ± 1.303 (CI 95% 12.247-17.353; p = 0.029) with HR2.552. CONCLUSION: LOH varied among COVID-19 patients and was prolonged when analyzed for BMI &#8805;25, comorbidities, elevated creatinine, and O2 saturation < 95%. Furthermore, risk factors for COVID-19 patients in B&H do not deviate from those reported in other countries.","Trnacevic, Alma; Mujkanovic, Amer; Al-Salloum, Noura; Sakusic, Amra; Trnacevic, Emir; Jusufovic, Emir; Hukic, Fatima; Jahic, Rahima; Stratton, Richard",BMC Infect Dis,,408

The repurposing of existing drugs seems to be the best solution in this situation. In this study, the molecular docking method was used to test 248 drugs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for viral entry into the host cell. Among the top-ranked ligands are drugs that are used for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments (paritaprevir, ledipasvir, simeprevir) and a natural biflavonoid amentoflavone. The binding sites of the HCV drugs and amentoflavone are different. Therefore, the ternary complexes of the HCV drug, amentoflavone, and RBD can be created. For the 5 top-ranked ligands, the validating molecular dynamics simulations of binary and ternary complexes with RBD were performed. According to the MMPBSA-binding free energies, the HCV drugs ledipasvir and paritaprevir (in a neutral form) are the most efficient binders of the RBD when used in combination with amentoflavone.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

existing methodologies of the global monitoring and forecasting of socio-political destabilization A systematic analysis of the correlation between the forecasts of destabilization generated by these systems and the actual levels of destabilization observed in the respective countries has been carried out The analysis shows that the forecast, based on the assumption that the level of destabilization in each country in the following year will be proportional to the actual level of destabilization of the current year, turns out, in all cases, to be more predictive than the forecasts made on the basis of any of the considered indices of the risk of destabilization (at least for all cases when the relevant forecasts were published) At the same time, it is shown that, before the Arab Spring, the indices we considered still performed some useful function, allowing us to identify not so much countries with a high risk of destabilization as those countries with particularly low risks of this kind However, in 2010-2011, all destabilization risk indices had a very serious failure High index values not only turned out to be not-very-good predictors of a high degree of the actual destabilization in 2011, but also low index values turned out to be bad predictors of a low degree of actual destabilization As a result, all destabilization risk indices in 2010/2011 showed extremely low statistically-insignificant correlations between the expected and observed levels of destabilization, which can be attributed to the anomalous wave of 2011 launched by the events of the Arab Spring As we have shown in several ways, the predictive ability of indices had been restored to some extent, again becoming statistically significant after 2011, but it has not returned to the level observed before the Arab Spring This confirms the conclusions of our previous work that the Arab Spring in 2011 acted as a trigger for the global phase transition, resulting in the World System changing into a qualitatively new state in which we observe some new patterns that were not taken into account by the systems developed before the Arab Spring Thus, the existing systems of forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization have lost the last “competitive advantages” over the method of simple extrapolation There are grounds to believe that the pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 may lead to an additional decrease in the prognostic ability of the indices we have examined All this, of course, suggests the need to develop a new generation of systems for forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization В статье приводится систематический обзор основных методологий глобального мониторинга и прогнозирования социально-политической дестабилизации Проведен анализ корреляции между прогнозами дестабилизации, генерировавшимися данными системами, и актуально наблюдавшимися уровнями дестабилизации в соответствующих странах Прогноз, построенный на допущении о том, что уровень дестабилизации в каждой данной стране в следующем году будет пропорционален актуальному уровню дестабилизации в этом году, оказывается во всех случаях обладающим большей прогностической силой, чем прогнозы на базе любого из рассмотренных нами индексов риска дестабилизации (по крайней мере, для всех случаев, когда соответствующие прогнозы были опубликованы) Вместе с тем показано, что до Арабской весны рассмотренные нами индексы все-таки выполняли некоторую полезную функцию, позволяя идентифицировать не столько страны с высоким риском дестабилизации, сколько с особо низкими рисками такого рода Однако в 2010-2011 годах все индексы рисков дестабилизации дали серьезный сбой Высокие значения индексов не только оказались не очень хорошими предикторами высокой степени актуальной дестабилизации в 2011 году, но и низкие значения индексов оказались плохими предикторами низкой степени актуальной дестабилизации В итоге все индексы рисков дестабилизации в 2010-2011 годах продемонстрировали крайне низкие статистически незначимые корреляции между ожидаемыми и наблюдаемыми уровнями дестабилизации, что нельзя не связать с аномальной волной 2011 года, запущенной событиями Арабской весны Как показано нами несколькими способами, после 2011 года предиктивная способность индексов до некоторой степени восстанавливается, вновь становится статистически значимой, но на уровень, предшествующий Арабской весне, так и не выходит Это подтверждает выводы наших предыдущих работ о том, что Арабская весна в 2011 году выступила в качестве триггера глобального фазового перехода, в результате которого Мир-Система пришла в качественно новое состояние, в рамках которого стали наблюдаться новые закономерности, не учитываемые системами, разработанными до Арабской весны Таким образом, существующие системы прогнозирования рисков социально-политической дестабилизации утратили последние «конкуретные преимущества» перед методом простой экстраполяции Имеются основания предполагать, что пандемия коронавирусной инфекции COVID-19 может привести к дополнительному снижению прогностической способности рассмотренных нами индексов Все это, конечно же, говорит о необходимости разработки нового поколения систем прогнозирования рисков социально-политической дестабилизации","Korotayev, Andrey Medvedev Ilya Slinko Elena Shulgin Sergey",Sotsiologicheskoe

436682,Evaluating aerosol and splatter following dental procedures: Addressing new challenges for oral health care and rehabilitation,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: As of January 2021, over 88 million people have been infected with COVID-19. Almost two million people have died of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A high SOFA score and a D-Dimer >1 µg/mL identifies patients with high risk of mortality. High lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission are associated with severity and mortality. Different degrees of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) abnormalities have been reported in these patients, its association with a mortality risk remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between LDH and in-hospital mortality in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-centre cohort study with 377 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in three centres in Mexico City, Mexico, who were &#8805;18 years old and died or were discharged between April 1 and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 377 patients were evaluated, 298 (79.1%) patients were discharged, and 79 (20.9%) patients died during hospitalization. Non-survivors were older, with a median age of 46.7 ± 25.7 years old, most patients were male. An ALT > 61 U/l (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.27-9.37; p = 0.015), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 231 mg/l (OR 4.71, 95% CI 2.35-9.46; p = 0.000), LDH > 561 U/l (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.40-6.55; p = 0.005) were associated with higher odds for in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that higher levels of LDH, CRP, and ALT are associated with higher in-hospital mortality risk in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19.","Vidal-Cevallos, Paulina; Higuera-De-La-Tijera, Fatima; Chávez-Tapia, Norberto C; Sanchez-Giron, Francisco; Cerda-Reyes, Eira; Rosales-Salyano, Victor Hugo; Servin-Caamaño, Alfredo; Vázquez-Medina, Martín Uriel; Méndez-Sánchez, Nahum",Ann Hepatol,,408

The Role of Aging beyond Topics,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The phosphodiesterase inhibitors theophylline and pentoxifylline have anti-inflammatory properties that may make them useful in COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen who received these drugs. OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential efficacy and safety of theophylline and pentoxifylline in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: Adults with a positive test for SARS-COV2 and were hospitalized due to pneumonia requiring either high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation were included. Patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were preferentially given theophylline. All other patients received pentoxifylline 400 mg orally TID. A group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care acted as a comparison group. The coprimary outcomes were a change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and ROX score between groups from day 1 to day 4 of therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine inpatients were reviewed. Fifty-eight patients received pentoxifylline/theophylline, with 151 patients serving as the comparison group. Active therapy was associated with an increase in the ROX score (mean: 2.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 5.1)) and decrease in CRP (mean: -0.7 (95% CI: -4.7, 3.2). Mortality rates were theophylline/pentoxifylline 24% and comparison group had a 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, theophylline and pentoxifylline were associated with an increase in ROX score and nominal decreases in CRP and mortality. Treatment was safe with few adverse reactions documented. We believe that this study could the basis for randomized-controlled trials to further explore these drugs' role in COVID-19.","Wall, Geoffrey C; Smith, Hayden L; Trump, Matthew W; Mohr, Jason D; DuMontier, Samuel P; Sabates, Becca L; Ganapathiraju, Iaswarya; Kable, Tim J",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),,408
436950,Leveraging Telehealth in the United States to Increase Access to Opioid Use Disorder Treatment in Pregnancy and Postpartum During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"We propose the SEIRS compartmental epidemiology model aimed at modeling the COVID-19 pandemy dynamics. The limit case of no acquired immunity (neither natural nor via vaccination) is considered mimicking the situation (i) when no effective vaccine being developed or available yet, and (ii) the virus strongly mutates causing massive re-infections. Therefore, the only means of suppressing the virus spread are via quarantine measures and effective identification and isolation of infected individuals. We found both the disease-free and the endemic fixed points and examined their stability. The basic reproduction ratio is obtained and its dependence on the parameters of the model is dis-cussed. We found the presence of the contact rate threshold beyond which the disease-free fixed point cannot be reached. Using the numeric solution, the approximate analytic solution of the model, characterized by rescaled contact rate, is obtained. Several possible “quarantine on”/“quarantine off” scenarios are considered and the one combined with flex-ible adjustment of the identification and isolation rates is found to be the most effective in bringing the second and consequent waves down. The study can be interpreted as a reference point for the case when the natural or acquired immunity, as well as vaccination, are taken into account. It will be a topic of a separate study. © 2021, Lviv Polytechnic National University. All rights reserved.","Ilnytskyi, J. M.",Mathematical Modeling and Computing,,408
437128,"Knowledge, attitude and practice on COVID-19 among students during the early phase of pandemic in a university in Borneo, Malaysia",2021,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control computer applications by modulating their brain activity. Since BCIs rely solely on brain activity, they have enormous potential as an alternative access method for engaging children with severe disabilities and/or medical complexities in therapeutic recreation and leisure. In particular, one commercially available BCI platform is the Emotiv EPOC headset, which is a portable and affordable electroencephalography (EEG) device. Combined with the EmotivBCI software, the Emotiv system can generate a model to discern between different mental tasks based on the user's EEG signals in real-time. While the Emotiv system shows promise for use by the pediatric population in the setting of a BCI clinic, it lacks integrated support that allows users to directly control computer applications using the generated classification output. To achieve this, users would have to create their own program, which can be challenging for those who may not be technologically inclined. To address this gap, we developed a freely available and user-friendly BCI software application called EmoconLite. Using the classification output from EmotivBCI, EmoconLite allows users to play YouTube video clips and a variety of video games from multiple platforms, ultimately creating an end-to-end solution for users. Through its deployment in the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital's BCI clinic, EmoconLite is bridging the gap between research and clinical practice, providing children with access to BCI technology and supporting BCI-enabled play.","Anaraki, Javad Rahimipour; Rauh, Chelsea Anne; Leung, Jason; Chau, Tom",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02768v3.pdf,408

438331,Implementation of a medical student-run telemedicine program for medications for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric illness affecting >7 million people every year in the US. Recently, we have shown that the mouse model of predator odor trauma (POT) displayed contextual conditioning and core features of PTSD including sleep disturbances (hyperarousal) and retrieval of traumatic memories following exposure to objective reminders (re-experiencing). PTSD is a disorder of memory function. Since memory consolidation requires the expression of BDNF along with an activation of MAPK/pERK signaling pathway in limbic brain structures (hippocampus and amygdala) and sleep favors memory consolidation, we hypothesized that short-term sleep deprivation (SD, 3 hours), immediately after contextual conditioning will attenuate molecular correlates of memory consolidation, sleep disturbances, and memory consolidation. We performed two experiments in adult male C57BL/6J mice to test our hypothesis. Experiment 1 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning and changes in sleep wakefulness. Experiment 2 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning-induced changes in the expression of BDNF and pERK in hippocampus and amygdala. SD immediately after contextual conditioning (POT+SD group) significantly attenuated sleep disturbances, memory retrieval, and expression of pERK and BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala as compared to POT-SD group (no SD after contextual conditioning). No significant differences were observed between POT+SD, NOC-SD (no contextual conditioning + no SD), and NOC+SD (no contextual conditioning + SD) groups. Memory consolidation requires sleep and the expression of pERK and BDNF in hippocampus and amygdala immediately after contextual conditioning in POT model of PTSD in mice.","Sharma, Rishi; Sahota, Pradeep; Thakkar, Mahesh M",Brain Res,,408
438864,Changes in College Student Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Perceived Drinking Norms Still Relevant?,2021,"Recent years have seen an increasingly widespread use of online learning technologies. This has prompted universities to make huge investments in technology to augment their position in the face of extensive competition and to enhance their students’ learning experience and efficiency. Numerous studies have been carried out regarding the use of online and mobile phone learning platforms. However, there are very few studies focusing on how university students will accept and adopt smartphones as a new platform for taking examinations. Many reasons, but most recently and importantly the COVID-19 pandemic, have prompted educational institutions to move toward using both online and mobile learning techniques. This study is a pioneer in examining the intention to use mobile exam platforms and the prerequisites of such intention. The purpose of this study is to expand the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by including four additional constructs: namely, content quality, service quality, information quality, and system quality. A self-survey method was prepared and carried out to obtain the necessary basic data. In total, 566 students from universities in the United Arab Emirates took part in this survey. Smart PLS was used to test the study constructs and the structural model. Results showed that all study hypotheses are supported and confirmed the effect of the TAM extension factors within the UAE higher education setting. These outcomes suggest that the policymakers and education developers should consider mobile exam platforms as a new assessment platform and a possible technological solution, especially when considering the distance learning concept. It is good to bear in mind that this study is initial and designed to explore using smartphones as a new platform for student examinations. Furthermore, mixed-method research is needed to check the effectiveness and the suitability of using the examination platforms, especially for postgraduate higher educational levels.","Alshurideh, Muhammad Turki Al Kurdi Barween AlHamad Ahmad Qasim Salloum Said A.; Alkurdi, Shireen Dehghan Ahlam Abuhashesh Mohammad Masa’deh Ra’ed",Informatics,,408

Amostras de sangue venoso foram obtidas de 16 equinos da raça Quarto de Milha, divididos em dois grupos: grupo de treinamento regular (GTR) e grupo de treinamento esporádico (GTE), em sete diferentes momentos: 30 minutos antes do exercício (M0), imediatamente após (M1), 30 minutos (M2), uma (M3), duas (M4), seis (M5) e 24 (M6) horas após o exercício. Para a análise estatística, os dados foram testados quanto à normalidade e homogeneidade de variâncias. Para comparar os grupos e os momentos em cada grupo foram utilizados testes paramétricos (ANOVA) para a análise das atividades séricas das enzimas musculares e não paramétricos (Mann-Whitney e Friedmann) para a análise do lactato sanguíneo (P<0,05). Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos para nenhuma variável. No entanto, dentro dos grupos experimentais foi possível observar diferenças significativas entre os momentos avaliados, em relação ao lactato e à LDH. No GTE, foram observadas diferenças significativas quanto ao lactato, entre o M0 e o M1, com valores respectivos de 0,90 mmol/L (mín. 0,8 - máx. 1,6) e 3,65mmo/L (mín. 1,0 - máx. 5,7) e quanto à LDH, onde os valores descritos no M6 diferiram significativamente de M0, M1, M2, M3 e M4. No GTR, diferenças significativas entre os momentos experimentais foram observadas em relação à LDH, sendo que os valores observados no M6 foram os menores e diferiram significativamente daqueles encontrados no M1, M2, M3 e M4. Em conclusão, não houve diferença entre o condicionamento físico dos animais treinados regularmente e aqueles treinados esporadicamente. A baixa magnitude das elevações das concentrações de CK, AST e LDH após o exercício e o rápido retorno aos valores basais, inclusive do lactato, observados em ambos os grupos, sugere que todos os animais avaliados estavam condicionados e aptos a realizar tal atividade física.(AU)","Pereira, Mariana S; Gerardi, Bianca; Denadai, Daniela S; Chaves, Arthur A; Barbosa, João P.

Patients admitted with COVID-19 and monitored by telemetry were prospectively enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics, hospital course, treatment and complications were collected from the patients' medical records. Telemetry was monitored to detect the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence and types of cardiac arrhythmias were analyzed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Among 143 patients admitted with telemetry monitoring, overall in-hospital mortality was 25.2% (36/143 patients) during the period of observation (mean follow-up 23.7 days). Survivors were less tachycardic on initial presentation (heart rate 90.6 ± 19.6 vs. 99.3 ± 23.1 bpm, p = 0.030) and had lower troponin (peak troponin 0.03 vs. 0.18 ng/ml. p = 0.004), C-reactive protein (peak C-reactive protein 97 vs. 181 mg/dl, p = 0.029), and interleukin-6 levels (peak interleukin-6 30 vs. 246 pg/ml, p = 0.003). Sinus tachycardia, the most common arrhythmia (detected in 39.9% [57/143] of patients), occurred more frequently in non-survivors (58.3% vs. 33.6% in survivors, p = 0.009). Premature ventricular complexes occurred in 28.7% (41/143), and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15.4% (22/143) of patients, with no difference between survivors and non-survivors. Sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were not frequent (seen only in 1.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively).

Herein, we investigated the link between family history and breast cancer features to elucidate the importance of family history in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Data from 10,549 patients with breast cancer were collected from 2014 to 2017. Detailed information about the family history of the patients including the degree and number of relatives affected and the types of cancer was recorded. The tumors were pathologically and clinically classified based on the stage, grade, ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 status, and subtypes, according to standard guidelines. Data were analyzed using &#967;2 test and multiple logistic regression. Patients with a family history of other cancer types were significantly older at diagnosis than patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p = 0.002) and those without a family history of cancer (p < 0.001). Patients without a family history of cancer were typically diagnosed at a later stage, including high frequency in N2 (p = 0.035) and TNM stage III (p = 0.015). Compared with patients with second-/third-degree relatives, those with first-degree relatives having breast/ovarian cancer had a higher median age (54.1, p < 0.001) at diagnosis and showed more advanced disease. No significant difference was found between ER, PR, and HER2 status in patients with and without a family history of cancer. Family history of breast cancer can influence the cancer characteristics of the patients at diagnosis, especially patient age, tumor stage, and grade.","Liu, Lei; Hao, Xiaomeng; Song, Zian; Zhi, Xiangcheng; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jin",Sci Rep,,408
444611,Evolution of changes in physical activity over lockdown time: physical activity datasets of four independent adult sample groups corresponding to each of the last four of the six COVID-19 lockdown weeks in Greece,2020,"Online therapy sessions and other forms of digital mental health services (DMH) have seen a sharp spike in new users since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked-hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services.","van Grunsven, Janna",Ethics Inf Technol,,408

No specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are currently available. A recent study has reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with neutrophil-specific plasma membrane rupture, and release excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and extracellular DNAs (eDNAs). This mechanism involves the activation of NETosis, a neutrophil-specific programmed cell death, which is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further progression of the disease can cause uncontrolled inflammation, leading to the initiation of cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. Herein, it is reported that DNase-I-coated melanin-like nanospheres (DNase-I pMNSs) mitigate sepsis-associated NETosis dysregulation, thereby preventing further progression of the disease. Recombinant DNase-I and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are used as coatings to promote the lengthy circulation and dissolution of NET structure. The data indicate that the application of bioinspired DNase-I pMNSs reduce neutrophil counts and NETosis-related factors in the plasma of SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients, alleviates systemic inflammation, and attenuates mortality in a septic mouse model. Altogether, the findings suggest that these nanoparticles have potential applications in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-related illnesses and other beta-CoV-related diseases.","Park, Hee Ho; Park, Wooram; Lee, Yun Young; Kim, Hyelim; Seo, Hee Seung; Choi, Dong Wook; Kwon, Ho-Keun; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, Tae-Hyung; Choy, Young Bin; Ahn, June Hong; Lee, Wonhwa; Park, Chun Gwon",Adv Sci (Weinh),,408

Use of steroids may reactivate the infection and repeated intravitreal therapy with anti-vascular growth factor inhibitors (Anti-VEGF) puts the patient again at the risk of exacerbation of inflammation or endophthalmitis. We describe a case of CME post traumatic endophthalmitis successfully treated with topical interferon therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old Asian Indian lady with a history of cat bite to her right eye and treated elsewhere as traumatic endophthalmitis with recurrent macular edema, presented to us 1 year after the injury. She had received anti-VEGF injection for same. Her medical history was non-contributory except for close contact with her cat. Therapeutic trials with oral doxycycline followed by oral albendazole with steroids, as well as repeated anti-VEGF therapy failed to prevent recurrence of CME. Patient's steroid responsiveness and reluctance for injections, made us to opt for a novel topical Interferon therapy. Macular edema resolved in 2 months. Interruption of interferon therapy due to COVID-lock down resulted in recurrence of the CME, which again responded well to interferon monotherapy. CONCLUSION: Topical interferon may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory macular edema and can serve as a, safer, economical and non-invasive treatment option compared to intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGFs.","Kawali, Ankush; Srinivasan, Sanjay; Mahendradas, Padmamalini; Shetty, Rohit",Eur J Ophthalmol,,408
454373,"Risk perceptions and preventive practices of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals in public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",2021,"Modern methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading to similar performance to the full supervision case.","Liu, Weizhe; Salzmann, Mathieu; Fua, Pascal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00452v2.pdf,408

The State of São Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 60,000 cases to date. Here we investigate the spatial distribution and spreading patterns of COVID-19 in the SSP by mapping the spatial autocorrelation and the clustering patterns of the virus in relation to the population density and the number of hospital beds. Clustering analysis indicated that São Paulo City is a significant hotspot for both the confirmed cases and deaths, whereas other cities across the state were less affected. Bivariate Moran's I showed a low relationship between the number of deaths and population density, whereas the number of hospital beds was less related, implying that the fatality depends substantially on the actual patients' conditions. Multivariate Local Geary showed a positive relationship between the number of deaths and population density, with two cities near São Paulo City being negatively related; the relationship between the number of deaths and hospital beds availability in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area was basically positive. Social isolation measures throughout the State of São Paulo have been gradually increasing since early March, an action that helped to slow down the emergence of the new confirmed cases, highlighting the importance of the safe-distancing measures in mitigating the local transmission within and between cities in the state.","Alcântara, Enner; Mantovani, José; Rotta, Luiz; Park, Edward; Rodrigues, Thanan; Campos Carvalho, Fernando; Roberto Souza Filho, Carlos",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),,408

El objetivo de este documento es explorar las contribuciones de tres vías de transmisión-contacto, gota e inhalación-al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal sanitario en el ámbito laboral. El método consistió en la evaluación cuantitativa de los riesgos microbianos y de un modelo de exposición cuyos posibles parámetros se basaron en datos específicos del virus SARS-CoV-2 cuando se disponía de ellos. El hallazgo clave fue que las vías de transmisión por gotas e inhalación predominan sobre la vía de contacto, contribuyendo en promedio 35%, 57% y 8.2% a la probabilidad de infección cuando no se usa equipo de protección personal. En promedio, 80% de la exposición a la inhalación ocurre cuando el personal sanitario está cerca de los pacientes. La contribución relativa de las gotas y la inhalación depende de la emisión de SARS-CoV-2 en las partículas respirables (<10 µm) a través de la exhalación, y la inhalación se vuelve predominante, en promedio, cuando la emisión supera las cinco copias genéticas por minuto. La concentración prevista del SARS-CoV-2 en el aire de la habitación del paciente es baja (<1 copia del gen por m3 en promedio) y probablemente se encuentre por debajo del límite de cuantificación de muchos métodos de muestreo del aire. Los resultados demuestran el valor que supone la protección respiratoria del personal sanitario y que el muestreo de campo puede no ser lo suficientemente sensible para verificar la contribución que realiza la inhalación del SARS-CoV-2 al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal. La emisión e ineficacia del SARS-CoV-2 en gotas respiratorias de diferente tamaño es aún una brecha en el conocimiento, fundamental para comprender y controlar la transmisión de la COVID-19.","Jones, Rachael M",J Occup Environ Hyg,,408

We found that some countries (such as the USA, the UK and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. Regardless of the best fitting law, many countries can be shown to follow a common trajectory that is similar to Italy (the epicentre at the time of analysis), but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with 'younger' epidemics, i.e. countries where the epidemic started more recently, tend to exhibit more exponential like behaviour, while countries that were closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may be a natural progression of the epidemic in each country. On the practical side, this indicates that (i) even in the absence of strict social distancing interventions, exponential growth is not an accurate predictor of longer term infection spread, and (ii) a deviation from exponential spread and a reduction of estimated doubling times do not necessarily indicate successful interventions, which are instead indicated by a transition to a reduced power or by a deviation from power law behaviour.","Komarova, Natalia L; Schang, Luis M; Wodarz, Dominik",J R Soc Interface,,408
459526,"Comparison of attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare between dental and nursing students before and after oral healthcare education",2021,"INTRODUCTION: In breast cancer, local tumour control is thought to be optimised by administering higher local levels of cytotoxic chemotherapy, in particular doxorubicin. However, systemic administration of higher dosages of doxorubicin is hampered by its toxic side effects. In this study, we aim to increase doxorubicin deposition in the primary breast tumour without changing systemic doxorubicin concentration and thus without interfering with systemic efficacy and toxicity. This is to be achieved by combining Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox, Celsion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA) with mild local hyperthermia, induced by Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). When heated above 39.5°C, LTLD releases a high concentration of doxorubicin intravascularly within seconds. In the absence of hyperthermia, LTLD leads to a similar biodistribution and antitumour efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm phase I study in 12 chemotherapy-naïve patients with de novo stage IV HER2-negative breast cancer. Previous endocrine treatment is allowed. Study treatment consists of up to six cycles of LTLD at 21-day intervals, administered during MR-HIFU-induced hyperthermia to the primary tumour. We will aim for 60 min of hyperthermia at 40°C-42°C using a dedicated MR-HIFU breast system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada). Afterwards, intravenous cyclophosphamide will be administered. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and feasibility. The secondary endpoint is efficacy, assessed by radiological response.This approach could lead to optimal loco-regional control with less extensive or even no surgery, in de novo stage IV patients and in stage II/III patients allocated to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has obtained ethical approval by the Medical Research Ethics Committee Utrecht (Protocol NL67422.041.18, METC number 18-702). Informed consent will be obtained from all patients before study participation. Results will be published in an academic peer-reviewed journal.

460665,Getting Closer to Our Unpleasant Previse: Possible Rise in Suicide Rate in Iran During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Obese patients are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. During the H1N1 pandemic, obesity was associated with an increased risk of influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer duration of ICU and hospital length of stay compared with the non-obese. These observations have raised a concern about the correlation between obesity and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we have outlined the potential impacts of obesity on respiratory physiology and the function of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Also, it has been clearly illustrated that obese patients are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and more contagious than lean patients. The comorbidities associated with obesity were found to be correlated with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 and increased mortality and high BMI has been shown to be correlated with hospitalisation, the need for mechanical ventilation and non-survival. The review also sheds light on the challenges that obese patients pose for healthcare providers inside and outside ICUs.","Albashir, Ahmed Abdalazim Dafallah",Clin Med (Lond),,408

461586,Use of buprenorphine for those with employer-sponsored insurance during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) in seminal fluid of patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to describe the expression profile of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) within the testicle. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENT(S): Thirty-four adult Chinese males diagnosed with COVID-19 through confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab samples. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR of single ejaculated semen samples. Semen quality was not assessed. Expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human testis are explored through previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets. RESULT(S): Six patients (19%) demonstrated scrotal discomfort suggestive of viral orchitis around the time of COVID-19 confirmation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 was not detected in semen after a median of 31 days (interquartile range, 29-36 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrates sparse expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with almost no overlapping gene expression. CONCLUSION(S): Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 was not detected in the semen of patients recovering from COVID-19 1 month after COVID-19 diagnosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells is unlikely to occur within the human testicle based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function remain unknown.","Pan, Feng; Xiao, Xingyuan; Guo, Jingtao; Song, Yarong; Li, Honggang; Patel, Darshan P; Spivak, Adam M; Alukal, Joseph P; Zhang, Xiaoping; Xiong, Chengliang; Li, Philip S; Hotaling, James M",Fertil Steril,,408

We sought to study all possible complications of COVID-19 to confirm previously reported complications and to identify potential complications not yet known. METHODS: Using United States health claims data, we compared the frequency of all International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes occurring before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in an exposure-crossover design. We included patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 between Mar. 1, 2020, and Apr. 30, 2020, and computed risk estimates and odds ratios (ORs) of association with COVID-19 for every ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. RESULTS: Among 70 288 patients with COVID-19, 69 of 1724 analyzed ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes were significantly associated with COVID-19. Disorders showing both strong association with COVID-19 and high absolute risk included viral pneumonia (OR 177.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 147.19-214.37, absolute risk 27.6%), respiratory failure (OR 11.36, 95% CI 10.74-12.02, absolute risk 22.6%), acute kidney failure (OR 3.50, 95% CI 3.34-3.68, absolute risk 11.8%) and sepsis (OR 4.23, 95% CI 4.01-4.46, absolute risk 10.4%). Disorders showing strong associations with COVID-19 but low absolute risk included myocarditis (OR 8.17, 95% CI 3.58-18.62, absolute risk 0.1%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR 11.83, 95% CI 5.26-26.62, absolute risk 0.1%) and pneumothorax (OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.68-4.26, absolute risk 0.4%). INTERPRETATION: We confirmed and provided risk estimates for numerous complications of COVID-19.

We aim to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. METHODS: Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42 hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100, mortality can be reduced to 60% or less. Prolonged interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent mortality.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spinal implant-associated infections between 2015 and 2019 were prospectively included and treated according to a standardized algorithm. Infections were classified as early-onset (&#8804;6 weeks) and late-onset (>6 weeks). RESULTS: Among 250 patients, 152 (61%) had an early-onset and 98 (39%) late-onset infection. Local inflammatory signs was the most common manifestation in early-onset infections (84%), whereas late-onset infections presented mainly with persisting or increasing local pain (71%). Sonication fluid were more often positive than peri-implant tissue samples (90% vs. 79%, p=0.016), particularly in late-onset infections (92% vs. 75%, p=0.005). Predominant pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium spp. Debridement and implant retention was the most common surgical approach in early-onset infection (85%), whereas partial or complete implant exchange was mainly performed in late-onset infections (61%). 218 patients (87%) received biofilm-active antibiotics, the median treatment duration was 11.7 weeks. 49 patients (20%) needed more than one revision for infection, six patients (2.4%) died during their hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Most spinal implant-associated infections were acquired during surgery and presented within 6 weeks of surgery. Infections presented mainly with local inflammatory signs in early-onset and with persisting or increasing pain in late-onset infections. Sonication was the most sensitive microbiological method, particularly in late-onset infections. Debridement and implant retention was used in well-integrated implants without loosening implant parts, independent of the time of infection onset.","Margaryan, Donara; Renz, Nora; Bervar, Maja; Zahn, Robert; Onken, Julia; Putzier, Michael; Vajkoczy, Peter; Trampuz, Andrej",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,408

This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system's performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems.

477564,[Strengthening the culture of public health surveillance and population health monitoring],2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that significantly impacts people living with diabetes. Diabetes-related factors of glycemic control, medication pharmacodynamics, and insulin access can impact the severity of a COVID-19 infection. In this commentary, we explore how digital health can support the diabetes community through the pandemic. For those living with diabetes, digital health presents the opportunity to access care with greater convenience while not having to expose themselves to infection in an in-person clinic. Digital diabetes apps can increase agency in self-care and produce clinically significant improvement in glycemic control through facilitating the capture of diabetes device data. However, the ability to share these data back to the clinic to inform virtual care and enhance diabetes coaching and guidance remains a challenge. In the end, it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinic's part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits, virtual or otherwise. As the world comes together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, close collaboration among the global diabetes community is critical to understand and manage the sustained impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes.","Gamble, Anissa; Pham, Quynh; Goyal, Shivani; Cafazzo, Joseph A",JMIR Diabetes,,408
478388,Can digital phenotyping be an answer to the COVID-19 challenges in psychiatry in India?,2021,"The continuing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally and its reliable diagnosis is one of the foremost priorities for protecting public health. Herein a rapid (<1 h), easy-to-implement, and accurate CRISPR-based evanescent wave fluorescence biosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 is reported. The collateral effect of Cas13a is combined with a universal autonomous enzyme-free hybridization chain reaction (HCR) by designing a cleavage hairpin reporter, which is cleaved upon target recognition, and hence releasing the initiator sequence to trigger the downstream HCR circuits. Detection of HCR assemblies is accomplished by first adsorbing to the desthiobiotin-modified optical fiber, followed by fluorescence emission induced by an evanescent field. Three Cas13a crRNAs targeting the genes of S, N and Orf1ab of SARS-CoV-2 are programmed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 or broadly detect related coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The HCR amplification coupled Cas13a-based biosensing platform is capable of rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with attomolar sensitivity. This method is further validated by adding target RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in negative oropharyngeal swabs. The good discrimination capability of this technique demonstrates its promising potential for point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19.","Yang, Yihan; Liu, Jinchuan; Zhou, Xiaohong",Biosens Bioelectron,,408

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population cohort study of hospital admissions in New Zealand between 23 April and 27 May 1988-2018. We compared acute and arranged hospitalisation and mortality rates in holiday (Anzac Day Monday to Friday) and non-holiday (Anzac Day Saturday or Sunday) years, for mid-week holidays and long weekends; and measured total weekly average acute and arranged hospitalisation counts. RESULTS: Hospitalisation rates were lower in holiday years than non-holiday years (rate ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.96, p<0.001), with fewer arranged admissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.94, p<0.001), but no significant difference for acute admissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00, p=0.087). Holiday year acute admission rates were lower than non-holiday years for children aged 0-4 years, but higher for adults aged 15-44 years. Holidays reduced arranged admissions most in children and areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. There was no significant difference for mortality. Average weekly acute hospitalisations were higher than arranged admissions between 10 June and 7 October. CONCLUSION: Secondary holidays do not reduce deaths; or acute hospital admissions except in the holiday week; and may delay elective treatment. However, if New Zealand is to add a new public holiday, it would have least detrimental health effect scheduled between 10 June and 7 October.","Telfar Barnard, Lucy Frances",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,408

Healthcare personnel are particularly exposed to additional stressors. OBJECTIVE: To identify the mental burden, resilience, tendency towards absenteeism and associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in an anonymous cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data on sociodemographics, occupational situation, contact to COVID-19 patients, mental burden, stressors, resilience, risk and protective factors were assessed among a convenience sample of healthcare personnel in spring 2020 (5 April 2020-7 May 2020). A comparison with the general population in Germany before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. RESULTS: After the evaluation of 650 completed questionnaires, an increased mental burden was found compared to the German general population before the pandemic, while the mental burden was reduced compared to the general population during the pandemic. The self-reported resilience was slightly higher compared to the general population before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19-related stressors and worries were the most important risk factors, self-efficacy and optimism the most important protective factors. The mental burden was moderately correlated with the intention to change the profession and the tendency towards absenteeism. CONCLUSION: Mental burden in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a higher tendency towards taking sick leave. In order to support healthcare personnel interventions that foster resources, such as self-efficacy and optimism should be offered to particularly vulnerable groups .","Röthke, Nikolaus; Wollschläger, Daniel; Kunzler, Angela M; Rohde, Annika; Molter, Stefan; Bodenstein, Marc; Reif, Andreas; Walter, Henrik; Lieb, Klaus; Tüscher, Oliver",Nervenarzt,,408
479763,Psychological Distress Reported by Primary Care Physicians in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background and Objectives: To clarify whether awareness of the extent and severity of exposure to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the social networks of older adults is related to the engagement by the latter in self-protective behaviors. The inquiry is guided by the Health Belief Model and by concepts from the domain of social networks. Research Design and Methods: Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were used, including the SHARE COVID-19 Survey executed in the summer of 2020. The study sample numbered 33,053 persons aged 50 and older in 26 countries. We regressed a logged count of self-protective behaviors on network-exposure severity, controlling for sociodemographic background, country, personality traits, and self-exposure severity. Age and network-exposure interaction terms were examined, as were ""close family"" and ""other"" network ties. Results: Network-exposure severity was positively associated with the extent of engagement in self-protective behaviors among older adults, but mainly among the oldest group, aged 70 and older. Awareness of exposure severity in ""close family"" and ""other"" networks were similarly associated with self-protection. Respondents from countries with the lowest rates of COVID-19 infection at the time (Latvia, Finland, and Denmark) engaged in fewer self-protective behaviors, while those from countries with high infection rates (Spain, Italy, and Portugal) self-protected to a greater degree. Discussion and Implications: The study findings point to the role of the social network, even if indirect, in promoting self-protective behaviors among the oldest segment of society. Policymakers should collaborate with the social networks of older adults in order to promote the adoption of self-protective behaviors. Such intervention might help to reduce the threat of infection among the most vulnerable age group.","Litwin, H.; Levinsky, M.",Innovation in Aging,,408

481473,Estimating the burden of COVID-19 on the Australian healthcare workers and health system during the first six months of the pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is an airway disease that has affected ~125 million people worldwide, caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), spread through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and aerosol transmission. Although most patients presenting with absent or mild symptoms recover completely, the highest morbidity and mortality rates are seen in the elderly, and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immunosuppressive diseases, diabetes, and pre-existing respiratory illnesses. Several therapeutic strategies have been examined, but a wide-ranging therapeutic option for particularly severe cases of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. Considering the indications presented by COVID-19 patients who present similarly with inflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been examined as a possible route to reduce proinflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP and ferritin by reducing inflammation, based on its anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by utilisation of IVIG for numerous other inflammatory conditions. Herein, summarising the recent key clinical evaluations of IVIG administration, we present our hypothesis that administration of IVIG within a specific dosage would be extremely beneficial towards reducing mortality and perhaps even the length of hospitalisation of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Ambia, Ayesha Rahman; Elgazzar, Tasnim Atef; AlSaud, Maha Bint Mishari; Kashir, Junaid",Med Hypotheses,,408

The scarcity of health services, the lack of information sharing, and the absence of reliable data in Venezuela create challenges for confronting developing health emergencies and disease outbreaks. The need for accurate data is especially dire given the current COVID-19 pandemic and evolving movement of refugees. While countries and international organizations came together to form a coordinated response to Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis, this geopolitical progress is threatened by the rapid spread of COVID-19, and the instinct for countries to focus inwards on domestic response priorities, rather than engage in regional cooperation. It is critical that the international community set aside geopolitical differences and cooperate to seek an accurate picture of the conditions on the ground to improve the welfare of Venezuelan migrants and to provide a more robust response to the current pandemic.","Standley, Claire J; Chu, Eric; Kathawala, Emrose; Ventura, Deisy; Sorrell, Erin M",Global Health,,408

485443,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult mental health,2020,"Since the first report in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world, with over 21.5 million people infected and nearly 768,000 deaths to date. Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics.","Han, Jie; He, Shanshan",Sci Total Environ,,408

Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of virus-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible.

489082,Supporting the well-being of healthcare workers during and after COVID-19,2020,"In February 2020, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was raging in Wuhan, China and quickly spreading to the rest of the world. This period was fraught with uncertainty for those in the affected areas. The present investigation examined the role of two potential coping resources during this stressful period of uncertainty: flow and mindfulness. Participants in Wuhan and other major cities affected by COVID-19 (N = 5115) completed an online survey assessing subjective experiences of flow, mindfulness, and well-being. Longer quarantine was associated with poorer well-being; flow and mindfulness were associated with better well-being on some measures. However, flow-but not mindfulness-moderated the link between quarantine length and well-being, such that people who experienced high levels flow showed little or no association between quarantine length and poorer well-being. These findings suggest that experiencing flow (typically by engaging in flow-inducing activities) may be a particularly effective way to protect against potentially deleterious effects of a period of quarantine.","Sweeny, Kate; Rankin, Kyla; Cheng, Xiaorong; Hou, Lulu; Long, Fangfang; Meng, Yao; Azer, Lilian; Zhou, Renlai; Zhang, Weiwei",PLoS One,,408

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to confirm the effect of patellofemoral contact mechanics after craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity in normal canine hindlimbs. METHODS: Craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity was performed in 5 specimens, respectively. The pressure was measured in the specimen before TTT, and then in the same specimen after TTT. In this process, data was obtained in 10 specimens. The measurement results were output as visualization data through the manufacturer's software and numerical data through spreadsheet. Based on these 2 data and the anatomical structure of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) surface, whole measurement area was analysed by dividing into medial, lateral and central area. RESULTS: In craniolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, medial, central contact pressure was decreased and lateral contact pressure was not statistically changed lateral contact pressure than normal PFJ. In caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, lateral contact pressure was increased and medial contact pressure was not statistically changed than normal PFJ. Although not statistically significant changed, central contact pressure in caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity was increased in all 5 specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that traditional TTT, prone to caudal shift of patellar tendon, can increase retropatellar pressure may lead to various complications and diseases of the stifle joint.","Park, Donghee; Kang, Jinsu; Kim, Namsoo; Heo, Suyoung",J Vet Sci,,408

No effective treatment is yet in sight for this catastrophic illness. Several antiviral agents and vaccines are in clinical trials, and drug repurposings as immediate and alternative choices are also under consideration. Immunomodulatory agents like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as well as biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as tocilizumab and anakinra received worldwide attention for treatment of critical patients with COVID-19. This is of interest to rheumatologists, who are well versed with rational use of these agents. This brief review addresses the understandings of some of the common immunopathogenetic mechanisms in the context of autoimmune rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and COVID-19. Apart from demographic comparisons, the role of type I interferons (IFN), presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and finally mechanism of action of HCQ in both the scenarios are discussed here. High risks for fatal disease in COVID-19 include older age, metabolic syndrome, male gender, and individuals who develop delayed type I IFN response. HCQ acts by different mechanisms including prevention of cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of type I IFN signaling. Recent controversies regarding efficacy of HCQ in management of COVID-19 warrant more studies in that direction. Autoantibodies were also reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as in COVID-19. Rheumatologists need to wait and see whether SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers development of autoimmunity in patients with COVID-19 infection in the long run.","Kabeerdoss, Jayakanthan; Danda, Debashish",Int J Rheum Dis,,408

495633,Young Minds: Mental Health and Transitional Care in Adolescent and Young Adult Rheumatology,2020,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical neurodegenerative syndrome with word finding problems as a core clinical symptom. Many aspects of word finding have been clarified in psycholinguistics using picture naming and a picture-word interference (PWI) paradigm, which emulates naming under contextual noise. However, little is known about how word finding depends on white-matter tract integrity, in particular, the atrophy of tracts located ventrally to the Sylvian fissure. To elucidate this question, we examined word finding in individuals with PPA and healthy controls employing PWI, tractography, and computer simulations using the WEAVER++ model of word finding. Twenty-three individuals with PPA and twenty healthy controls named pictures in two noise conditions. Mixed-effects modelling was performed on naming accuracy and reaction time (RT) and fixel-based tractography analyses were conducted to assess the relation between ventral white-matter integrity and naming performance. Naming RTs were longer for individuals with PPA compared to controls and, critically, individuals with PPA showed a larger noise effect compared to controls. Moreover, this difference in noise effect was differentially related to tract integrity. Whereas the noise effect did not depend much on tract integrity in controls, a lower tract integrity was related to a smaller noise effect in individuals with PPA. Computer simulations supported an explanation of this paradoxical finding in terms of reduced propagation of noise when tract integrity is low. By using multimodal analyses, our study indicates the significance of the ventral pathway for naming and the importance of RT measurement in the clinical assessment of PPA.","Janssen, Nikki; Roelofs, Ardi; Mangnus, Margot; Sierpowska, Joanna; Kessels, Roy P C; Piai, Vitória",Neuroimage Clin,,408

Because these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6 to 18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFT, which includes spirometry, lung volume, and diffusion capacity measurement, is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, and novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers and mobile health technologies along with integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options comes important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed. However, the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic also presents a unique opportunity to augment conventional testing by including innovative and emerging approaches to measuring lung function remotely in patients with respiratory disease. The benefits of such an approach have the potential to enhance respiratory care and empower patient self-management well beyond the current global pandemic.","Kouri, Andrew; Gupta, Samir; Yadollahi, Azadeh; Ryan, Clodagh M; Gershon, Andrea S; To, Teresa; Tarlo, Susan M; Goldstein, Roger S; Chapman, Kenneth R; Chow, Chung-Wai",Chest,,408
496870,The Impact of Telehealth Implementation on Underserved Populations and No-Show Rates by Medical Specialty During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Aims: Healthcare systems have been rapidly restructured to meet COVID-19 demand. Clinicians are working to novel clinical guidelines, treating new patient cohorts and working in unfamiliar environments. Trauma and orthopaedics (T&O) has experienced cancellation of routine clinics and operating, with redistribution of the workload and human resources. To date, no studies have evaluated the mental health impact of these changes on the T&O workforce. We report the results of a novel survey on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of our orthopaedic workforce and the contributory factors. Methods: A 20-question survey-based cross-sectional study of orthopaedic team members was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to identify the impact of the pandemic on mental health in the form of major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD). The survey incorporated the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2), which is validated for screening of MDD, and the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-2), which is validated for screening of GAD. Results: There were 62 respondents (18 females and 44 males). As compared to the general population, we noted a greater estimated prevalence of GAD (17.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.0009297) and MDD (19.4% vs 3.3%, p = 0.0000007731). The prevalence of MDD symptoms was greatest among senior house officers (SHOs) (p = 0.02216). Female respondents scored higher for symptoms of MDD (p = 0.03583) and GAD (p = 0.0001086). Those identifying as 'Black, African, Caribbean or Black British' displayed a higher prevalence of GAD symptoms (p = 0.001575) and felt least supported at work (p = 0.001341). Conclusion: Our study, in the first of its kind, shows a significant prevalence of GAD and MDD in the workforce. We found that SHOs, females and those of Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British origin were disproportionately affected.

498167,Digital Clinical Trials for Substance Use Disorders in the Age of Covid-19,2020,"Sustainably feeding the growing population amid rising global temperatures and dwindling resources is a grand challenge facing mankind. Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha-1, especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PM enhanced grain yield and net economic return while lowering the N footprint without increasing Nr emission. Therefore, PM has great potential to mitigate Nr loss in China when crop species, N fertilization rate, and local environmental factors (i.e., growing region and annual precipitation) are appropriately considered.","Wang, Linlin; Coulter, Jeffrey A; Li, Lingling; Luo, Zhuzhu; Chen, Yinglong; Deng, Xiping; Xie, Junhong",Sci Total Environ,,408

498278,The Impact of Frailty on the Relationship between Life-Space Mobility and Quality of Life in Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic impedes therapy and care activities. Tele-health, i.e., the provision of health care at a distance (HCD), is a promising way to fill the supply gap. However, facilitators and barriers influence the use and experience of HCD for occupational therapists (OTs) and midwives. We identified use of services and appraisal of experiences of Switzerland-based OTs and midwives regarding the provision of HCD during the lockdown as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. 1. HYPOTHESIS: Profession, age in years, and area of work have a significant and meaningful influence over whether HCD is provided. 2. HYPOTHESIS: Profession, age in years, area of work, possibility of reimbursement by health insurance, and application used have a significant and meaningful influence on the experience of HCD. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 5755 OTs and midwives were contacted to fill out an online questionnaire with 13 questions regarding demographic information, use of HCD, and experiences while providing the service. Eleven potential facilitators and barriers and areas where there was desire for support were identified. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 1269 health professionals (response rate 22.5%). 73.4% of responding OTs (n = 431) and midwives (n = 501) provided HCD during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Profession and area of work had a significant influence on whether HCD was provided. Age only had a significant influence on the use of videotelephony, SMS, and chat services. OTs experienced HCD significantly more positively than midwives (log odds = 1.3; p &#8804; .01). Video-telephony (log odds = 1.1; p &#8804; .01) and use of phone (log odds = 0.8; p = .01) were positive predictors for positive experience, while use of SMS (log odds = - 0.33; p = .02) was a negative predictor. Among OTs, 67.5% experienced HCD as positive or mostly positive, while 27.0% experienced it as negative or mostly negative. Among midwives, 39.5% experienced it as positive or mostly positive, while 57.5% experienced it as negative or mostly negative. Most respondents desired support concerning reimbursement by health insurance (70.8%), followed by law and data protection (60.4%). CONCLUSIONS: HCD during the early COVID-19 pandemic was generally perceived as positive by OTs and midwives. There is need for training opportunities in connection with HCD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Klamroth-Marganska, Verena; Gemperle, Michael; Ballmer, Thomas; Grylka-Baeschlin, Susanne; Pehlke-Milde, Jessica; Gantschnig, Brigitte E",BMC Health Serv Res,,408

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F(1,347) = 60.82, p < 0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F(1,347) = 56.54, p < 0.001), financial insecurity (F(1,347) = 19.96, p < 0.001), internalized shame (F(1,347) = 71.40, p < 0.001) and social isolation (F(1,347) = 34.73, p < 0.001). Status as a COVID-19 survivor, having family members infected with COVID-19, being married, economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher overall stigma levels (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related stigma is commonly experienced among COVID-19 survivors even though the outbreak has been well-contained in China. Routine assessment of stigma experiences should be conducted on COVID-19 survivors and appropriate psychological assistance, public education, and anti-stigma campaigns and policies should be enforced to reduce stigma within this vulnerable subpopulation.","Yuan, Yuan; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qing-E; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Jiang, Guo-Qing; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Global Health,,408

504731,The impact of mindfulness on self-stigma and affective symptoms among sexual minorities,2021,"The indan-1,3-dione and its derivatives are important building blocks in organic synthesis and present important biological activities. Herein, the leishmanicidal and cytotoxicity evaluation of 16 2-arylidene indan-1,3-diones is described. The compounds were evaluated against the leukemia cell lines HL60 and Nalm6, and the most effective ones were 2-(4-nitrobenzylidene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (4) and 4-[(1,3-dioxo-1H-inden-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl]benzonitrile (10), presenting IC50 values of around 30 µmol/L against Nalm6. The leishmanicidal activity was assessed on Leishmania amazonensis, with derivative 4 (IC50 = 16.6 µmol/L) being the most active. A four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity analysis (4D-QSAR) was applied to the indandione derivatives, through partial least-squares regression. The statistics presented by the regression models built with the selected field descriptors of Coulomb (C) and Lennard-Jones (L) nature, considering the activities against L. amazonensis, HL60, and Nalm6 leukemia cells, were, respectively, R2 = 0.88, 0.92, and 0.98; Q2 = 0.83, 0.88, and 0.97. The presence of positive Coulomb descriptors near the carbonyl groups indicates that these polar groups are related to the activities. Besides, the presence of positive Lennard-Jones descriptors close to substituents R3 or R1 indicates that bulky nonpolar substituents in these positions tend to increase the activities. This study provides useful insights into the mode of action of indandione derivatives for each biological activity involved.","de Souza, Ana P M; Costa, Maria C A; de Aguiar, Alex R; Bressan, Gustavo C; de Almeida Lima, Graziela D; Lima, Wallace P; Borsodi, Maria P G; Bergmann, Bartira R; Ferreira, Márcia M C; Teixeira, Róbson R",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),,408

The model assumes that the images in the dataset are non-linear mappings of low-dimensional latent vectors. We use the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to represent the non-linear transformation. The parameters of the generator as well as the low-dimensional latent vectors are jointly estimated only from the undersampled measurements. This approach is different from traditional CNN approaches that require extensive fully sampled training data. We penalize the norm of the gradients of the non-linear mapping to constrain the manifold to be smooth, while temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to obtain a smoothly varying time-series. The proposed scheme brings in the spatial regularization provided by the convolutional network. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is the improvement in image quality and the orders-of-magnitude reduction in memory demand compared to traditional manifold models. To minimize the computational complexity of the algorithm, we introduce an efficient progressive training-in-time approach and an approximate cost function. These approaches speed up the image reconstructions and offers better reconstruction performance.","Zou, Qing; Ahmed, Abdul Haseeb; Nagpal, Prashant; Kruger, Stanley; Jacob, Mathews",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00034v2.pdf,408

We included studies with animal models of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and exercise training from PubMed, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases. The outcome was the mean difference (MD) in fractional shortening (FS, %) assessed by echocardiography between sedentary and trained DOX-treated animals. Trained DOX-treated animals improved 7.40% (95% CI 5.75-9.05, p < 0.001) in FS vs. sedentary animals. Subgroup analyses revealed a superior effect of exercise training execution prior to DOX exposure (MD = 8.20, 95% CI 6.27-10.13, p = 0.010). The assessment of cardiac function up to 10 days after DOX exposure and completion of exercise protocol was also associated with superior effect size in FS (MD = 7.89, 95% CI 6.11-9.67, p = 0.020) vs. an echocardiography after over 4 weeks. Modality and duration of exercise, gender and cumulative DOX dose did were not individually associated with changes on FS. Exercise training is a cardioprotective approach in rodent models of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

Despite the persistent production of antiviral drugs and vaccines in the global market, viruses still remain as one of the leading causes of deadly human diseases. Effective control of viral diseases, particularly Zika virus disease, Nipah virus disease, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Coronavirus disease, Herpes simplex virus infection, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and Ebola virus disease remain promising goal amidst the mutating viral strains. Current trends in the development of antiviral drugs focus solely on testing novel drugs or repurposing drugs against potential targets of the viruses. Compared to synthetic drugs, medicines from natural resources offer less side-effect to humans and are often cost-effective in the productivity approaches. This review intends not only to emphasize on the major viral disease outbreaks in the past few decades and but also explores the potentialities of natural substances as antiviral traits to combat viral pathogens. Here, we spotlighted a comprehensive overview of antiviral components present in varied natural sources, including plants, fungi, and microorganisms in order to identify potent antiviral agents for developing alternative therapy in future.","Sagaya Jansi, R; Khusro, Ameer; Agastian, Paul; Alfarhan, Ahmed; Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah; Arasu, Mariadhas Valan; Rajagopal, Rajakrishnan; Barcelo, Damia; Al-Tamimi, Amal",Sci Total Environ,,408
512366,How to make a protective face shield or visor,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has shown its potential to cause severe manifestations among individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). The patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with pre-existing CVD are more likely to relapse. There are several reasons, including the prolonged hospitalization time as a consequence of their more severe illness and aberrant expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the cell surface receptor of SARS-COV2 that is present on cardiac cells - and using drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that alter the expression of ACE2. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 shares structural similarities with SARS-CoV-1, and that patients recovered from SARS-CoV1 have shown an increased risk of developing inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiac diseases. It makes some concerns that people who recovered from SARS-CoV2 are also liable to develop these chronic conditions later. Further studies should investigate the probability of recurrence of COVID-19 in patients with CVD and the development of approaches for the prevention of chronic inflammatory conditions in patients with CVD who recovered from COVID-19.","Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Heidari, Arash; Shakerian, Narges; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Acta Biomed,,408

One of the serious complications associated with the virus is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). It is characterised by inflammation leading to organ damage, in the setting of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C is thought to be a postviral reaction where most children are negative on PCR testing but are positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently defined the same phenomenon occurring in adults as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) and emphasised on the use of antibody testing in this population. Here we describe an adult woman with an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 who presented with unexplained organ failure and shock. Positive antibody testing was the only clue to the diagnosis of MIS-A. We stress the importance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in order to identify these cases.","Veyseh, Maedeh; Webster, Patrick; Blanco, Irene",BMJ case reports,,408

Our literature review indicates a total number of 198 studies, with the overwhelming majority published as journal articles (n = 186). In total, these literature items offer information on 145 bird species. 85 of these species are characterized by low genetic differentiation, 46 species indicate genetic variation but no geographic structuring i.e. panmixia, while 14 species show geographically distinct lineages and haplotypes. Majority of bird species inhabiting the Western Palearctic display genetic admixture. The glaciation cycles in the past few million years were pivotal factors in shaping this situation: during warm periods many species expanded their distribution range to the north over wide areas of Eurasia; whereas, during ice ages most areas were no longer suitable and species retreated to refugia, where lineages mixed.

Information about disease and drug history was extracted from their medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain. Seropositivity was expressed according to validated cut-off indices. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles using data from people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (Univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following SARS-CoV2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modelling to explore the effect of factors including vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type and lymphocyte count on vaccine response. ResultsCompared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio 0.03; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.06, p<0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All other drug groups did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly related with response to vaccination. Vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. InterpretationSome disease modifying therapies carry a risk of attenuated response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group.","Tallantyre, Emma C; Vickaryous, Nicola; Anderson, Valerie; Asardag, Aliye Nazli; Baker, David; Bestwick, Jonathan P; Bramhall, Kathryn; Chance, Randy; Evangelou, Nikos; George, Katila; Giovannoni, Gavin; Grant, Leanne; Harding, Katharine E; Hibbert, Aimee; Ingram, Gillian; Jones, Meleri; Kang, Angray S; Loveless, Samantha; Moat, Stuart; Robertson, Neil P; Schmierer, Klaus; Shah, Sitash Navin; Simmons, Jessica; Upcott, Matthew; Willis, Mark D; Jolles, Stephen; Dobson, Ruth",,,408

Inclui-se aqui o estabelecimento de protocolos anestésicos que proporcionem segurança e bem-estar aos animais, com redução da porcentagem de óbitos. Considerando que os fármacos, individualmente, não possuem todas as propriedades necessárias para promover uma anestesia ideal, é interessante o estabelecimento de protocolos anestésicos multimodais a fim de potencializar as propriedades anestésicas e analgésicas das drogas e minimizar os efeitos adversos. Ainda, a maioria dos autores não menciona a administração de protocolos anestésicos com associação de mais de dois fármacos em pequenos roedores. Assim, o objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar a segurança e a duração de dois protocolos de anestesia injetável em hamsters, com associação de fármacos anestésicos e analgésicos, bem como suas alterações em parâmetros bioquímicos e hematológicos. Ambas associações promoveram anestesia cirúrgica e se mostraram seguras para hamsters, sem ocorrência de óbitos. Entretanto, o protocolo AXCM promoveu uma anestesia de maior duração e menor período de indução e recuperação para ambos os sexos, parecendo ser mais adequada para hamsters do que o protocolo AXCT. Os machos levaram mais tempo para entrar em plano de anestesia cirúrgica e tiveram menor período de anestesia quando comparados com fêmeas. Em ambos os protocolos observamos que os parâmetros fisiológicos se mantiveram mais altos para as fêmeas durante todo o período anestésico. Ambas associações promoveram diminuição de saturação de oxigênio, a qual foi muito expressiva nas fêmeas do grupo AXCT e prontamente corrigida com a utilização de máscara de oxigênio. A queda de temperatura, crítica em pequenos roedores, foi controlada por meio do fornecimento de calor, tendo sido mínima e permanecendo estável. O monitoramento dos parâmetros fisiológicos por meio de equipamento adequado para a espécie mostra-se também como importante auxiliar na manutenção do bem-estar animal, permitindo uma pronta intervenção caso necessário. A hiperglicemia promovida pelo uso de agonistas de receptores 2-adrenérgicos, e mais discretamente pelo uso de cetamina e acepromazina, pode ser prevenida ou reduzida a partir de um período de jejum curto de até quatro horas e não mais do que isso uma vez que os pequenos roedores possuem um metabolismo acelerado, estando muito suscetíveis a hipoglicemia. Por último, torna-se importante avaliar a trombocitopenia sob o ponto de vista clínico, uma vez que essa condição pode determinar um aumento no risco de sangramento durante procedimentos cirúrgicos.","SEABRA, DENISE ISOLDI",,,408

Physicians managing patients with cancer now have to deal not only with the disease but also the restrictions and limitations imposed because of the global pandemic. We aimed to determine how surgical preferences in breast cancer management were affected globally using a questionnaire-based survey. Methods: Under the auspices of the Turkish Senology Society (SENATURK) we asked 122 surgeons from 27 countries to reply to a 26-question survey designed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on their surgical practice when treating patients with breast cancer. Results: The characteristics of participant surgeons were statistically similar when comparing the participants' answers from Turkey and other countries. From the responses given to our questionnaire, it was understood that breast cancer surgery decreased by 25% (p<0.05) in institutions all over the world, including Turkey, but there was no change in the approach technique to the axilla. Conclusions: Globally breast surgeons have adapted to the new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many surgical approaches and some follow up protocols have been changed, although the degree of change has varied from country to country. In addition, the availability of multidisciplinary case conferences has been reduced in some centers which may affect the quality of services provided to patients. © 2021 Zerbinis Publications.

517498,Considerations about cognitive communication deficits following COVID-19,2020,"Phospholipids play important roles in biological process even at a very low level. For example, bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP) is involved in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage diseases, and polyphosphoinositides (PPI) play critical roles in cellular signaling and functions. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a structural isomer of BMP, mediates lipid-protein and lipid-lipid interactions, and inhibits platelet activating factor and phosphatidylcholine transferring. However, due to their low abundance, the analysis of these phospholipids from biological samples is technically challenging. Therefore, the cellular function and metabolism of these phospholipids are still elusive. This chapter overviews a novel method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation with trimethylsilyl-diazomethane (TMS-D) for accurate and comprehensive analysis of these phospholipid species in biological samples. Firstly, a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure is performed to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis, whereas modified methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE) extraction and modified Folch extraction methods are described to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis. Secondly, TMS-D methylation is performed to derivatize PG/BMP and PPI, respectively. Then, we described the shotgun lipidomics strategies that can be used as cost-effective and relatively high-throughput methods to determine BMP, PG, and PPI species and isomers with different phosphate position(s) and fatty acyl chains. The described method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation achieves feasible and reliable quantitative analysis of low-abundance lipid classes. The application of this novel method should enable us to reveal the metabolism and functions of these phospholipids in healthy and disease states.","Pan, Meixia; Qin, Chao; Han, Xianlin",Methods Mol Biol,,408

Based on some recent studies on COVID-19 and the older population, the various cascades toward health inequity have been projected. This study highlights how the COVID-19 is met by health inequity triggers, such as global trade inequality, ageist social regulations, and the existing social inequity. While those triggers are applicable to all the populations, there seems to be specific amplifiers for health inequity among the older populations. In particular, six types of amplifiers have been identified: (1) expansion of riskscape, (2) reduction of social ties, (3) uncertainty of future, (4) losing trust in institutions, (5) coping with new knowledge, and (6) straining on public spending. While the fundamental mitigating responses to health inequity among the older population is tackling existing inequalities, this study may help to shed light on emerging vulnerabilities among the older population to alleviate far-reaching consequences of COVID-19 of the identified inequity amplifiers.","Lee, Sora",Front Public Health,,408

Unfortunately, it is currently bottlenecked by the computational power and memory bandwidth limitations of existing systems, as many of the steps in genome sequence analysis must process a large amount of data. A major contributor to this bottleneck is approximate string matching (ASM). We propose GenASM, the first ASM acceleration framework for genome sequence analysis. We modify the underlying ASM algorithm (Bitap) to significantly increase its parallelism and reduce its memory footprint, and we design the first hardware accelerator for Bitap. Our hardware accelerator consists of specialized compute units and on-chip SRAMs that are designed to match the rate of computation with memory capacity and bandwidth. We demonstrate that GenASM is a flexible, high-performance, and low-power framework, which provides significant performance and power benefits for three different use cases in genome sequence analysis: 1) GenASM accelerates read alignment for both long reads and short reads. For long reads, GenASM outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 116x and 3.9x, respectively, while consuming 37x and 2.7x less power. For short reads, GenASM outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 111x and 1.9x. 2) GenASM accelerates pre-alignment filtering for short reads, with 3.7x the performance of a state-of-the-art pre-alignment filter, while consuming 1.7x less power and significantly improving the filtering accuracy. 3) GenASM accelerates edit distance calculation, with 22-12501x and 9.3-400x speedups over the state-of-the-art software library and FPGA-based accelerator, respectively, while consuming 548-582x and 67x less power.","Cali, Damla Senol; Kalsi, Gurpreet S.; Bingol, Zulal; Firtina, Can; Subramanian, Lavanya; Kim, Jeremie S.; Ausavarungnirun, Rachata; Alser, Mohammed; Gomez-Luna, Juan; Boroumand, Amirali; Nori, Anant; Scibisz, Allison; Subramoney, Sreenivas; Alkan, Can; Ghose, Saugata; Mutlu, Onur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07692v1.pdf,408

519667,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance among Health Care Workers in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adopting the family-centered care (FCC) approach in the neonatal care has been shown to improve breastfeeding rate and parental satisfaction. To minimize the transmission of COVID-19, family visit in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was suspended in China. In order to maintain the benefits of FCC, the Hong Kong University-Shenzhen Hospital NICU modified FCC strategies. We evaluated the effects of new strategies and aimed to share our results and experience with other NICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using prospectively collected hospital databases, we retrospectively compared the demographic and clinical data of neonates, rates of breastfeeding at discharge, nosocomial infection and parental satisfaction one month before (open group) and after (closed group) the implementation of alternative FCC management strategies when family visit was suspended during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized a multidisciplinary task force and adopted strategies of triage and screening, management of suspected infants, and breastfeeding promotion with effective communication. The nosocomial infection rate and parental satisfaction for open and closed groups (144 and 108 term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, respectively) were not different (1% vs. 0%, p = 1.00; 98.6 vs. 98.8, p = .80; respectively). Breastfeeding rate at discharge decreased but the difference was not significant (74% vs. 80%, p = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, in term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, the alternative FCC strategies maintained high parental satisfaction without increased nosocomial infection rate, but strong support for breastfeeding was needed. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the continuation of ""modified"" FCC in a level III NICU is feasible in the context of COVID-19 pandemic with reduced family visitation and participation in the care.","Yi, Yan-Zhi; Su, Ting; Jia, Yi-Zhen; Xue, Yin; Chen, Yu-Zhi; Zhang, Qian-Shen; Chow, Chun-Bong; Lee, Winnie Gun-Ping; Cheung, Po-Yin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,408
520554,Depressive symptoms as a moderator of college student response to computerized alcohol intervention,2020,"Neighbor Discovery (ND) is the process employed by two wireless devices to discover each other. There are many different ND protocols, both in the scientific literature and also those employed in practice. All ND protocols involve devices sending beacons, and also listening for them. Protocols differ in terms of how the beacon transmissions and reception windows are scheduled, and the device sleeps in between consecutive transmissions and reception windows in order to save energy. A successful discovery constitutes a sending device's beacon overlapping with a receiving device's reception window. The goal of all ND protocols is to minimize the discovery latency. In spite of the ubiquity of ND protocols and active research on this topic for over two decades, the basic question""Given an energy budget, what is the minimum guaranteed ND latency?"", however, still remains unanswered. Given the different kinds of protocols that exist, there has also been no standard way of comparing them and their performance. This paper, for the first time, answers the question on the best-achievable ND latency for a given energy budget. We derive discovery latencies for different scenarios, e.g., when both devices have the same energy budgets, and both devices have different energy budgets. We also show that some existing protocols can be parametrized such that they perform optimally. The fact that the parametrizations of some other protocols were optimal was not known before, and can now be established using our technique. Our results are restricted to the case when a few devices discover each other at a time, as is the case in most real-life scenarios. When many devices need to discover each other simultaneously, packet collisions play a dominant role in the discovery latency and how to analyze such scenarios need further study.","Kindt, Philipp H.; Chakraborty, Samarjit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05026v1.pdf,408

In this paper, the lockdown effect on the traffic-related mortality in hedgehogs in an urban area was studied. Comparing the pre-pandemic (2018 and 2019) and pandemic (2020) years, we showed that hedgehog roadkill levels during the lockdown period were over 50% lower (which means a decrease greater than the decrease in road traffic in the same period measured by the number of accidents or the average number of vehicles per day). Based on literature data, we showed that this may mean at least tens of thousands of hedgehogs have survived on a national scale. We report the need to start intensive research on the possible demographic and genetic effects of this unique phenomenon. We also ask how stable the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on wildlife and whether the lockdown (which is an anthropause) may reverse the negative trends in the decline in the number of wild species, including hedgehogs.","Lopucki, Rafal; Kitowski, Ignacy; Perlinska-Teresiak, Magdalena; Klich, Daniel",,,408

METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort of outpatients with covid-19, diagnosed between the 10th March and the 2nd April, 2020 with a daily collection of symptoms by an on-line auto-questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were included (median age, 41 years [interquartile range, 19-78 years]; 74.2% female), of whom 132 (71%) were HCWs. The median follow-up after symptom onset was 14 (min 4-max 24) days. HCWs were significantly younger than non-HCWs (median age 40.3 years vs. 47.2 years [P<0.005]), and 81.8% were women. Four patients (2.2%) were hospitalized including one HCW. The median time to recovery was 9 days after symptom onset (95% CI 8-11) in the global population and respectively 8 (95% CI 8-9) and 13 (95% CI 11-15) days in HCWs and in non-HCWs (P<0.005). After adjusting for age, co-morbidities, and gender, the instantaneous risk ratio for symptom absence in HCWs was 1.76 compared with non-HCWs (95% CI [1.16-2.67], P=0.037).

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions, RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false negatives are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 h with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples. We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid-phase hybridization of fluorescently-labeled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 min. We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity we were able to identify a false-negative sample. CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows the reduction of both the amount of false-negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 h.","Damin, Francesco; Galbiati, Silvia; Gagliardi, Stella; Cereda, Cristina; Dragoni, Francesca; Fenizia, Claudio; Savasi, Valeria; Sola, Laura; Chiari, Marcella",Sensors (Basel),,408

To ensure high expression of the recombinant vaccine in E. coli, codon optimization and in-silico cloning were also carried out. The designed vaccine with high molecular affinity to TLR3 and TLR4, was found capable to initiate effective innate and adaptive immune response. The immune simulation also suggested uprising high levels of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared antigen from the system. The proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence, should be tested by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, Abhishek; Thakur, Mukesh; Sharma, Lalit Kumar; Chandra, Kailash",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.040618,408

We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the structural basis for their potent neutralizing activity remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG-form or in both IgG-form and Fab-form bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBDs in the “up” conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of a large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides a structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and its correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","Yan, Renhong; Wang, Ruoke; Ju, Bin; Yu, Jinfang; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Nan; Wang, Jia; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Peng; Zhou, Bing; Li, Yaning; Shen, Yaping; Zhang, Shuyuan; Tian, Long; Guo, Yingying; Xia, Lu; Zhong, Xinyue; Cheng, Lin; Ge, Xiangyang; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi; Zhou, Qiang",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731853/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-021-00487-9,408

Here, we report a key immunometabolic and epigenetic pathway mediated by the miR–9-5p-isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α) axis in trained immunity. We found that β-glucan–trained miR–9-5p(–/–) monocytes showed decreased IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α production after LPS stimulation. Trained miR–9-5p(–/–) mice produced decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines upon rechallenge in vivo and had worse protection against Candida albicans infection. miR–9-5p targeted IDH3α and reduced α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) levels to stabilize HIF-1α, which promoted glycolysis. Accumulating succinate and fumarate via miR–9-5p action integrated immunometabolic circuits to induce histone modifications by inhibiting KDM5 demethylases. β-Glucan–trained monocytes exhibited low IDH3α levels, and IDH3α overexpression blocked the induction of trained immunity by monocytes. Monocytes with IDH3α variants from autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa patients showed a trained immunity phenotype at immunometabolic and epigenetic levels. These findings suggest that miR–9-5p and IDH3α act as critical metabolic and epigenetic switches in trained immunity.","Su, Haibo; Liang, Zhongping; Weng, ShuFeng; Sun, Chaonan; Huang, Jiaxin; Zhang, TianRan; Wang, Xialian; Wu, Shanshan; Zhang, Zhi; Zhang, Yiqi; Gong, Qing; Xu, Ying",JCI insight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986196/; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.144260,408

Nigeria was locked down in March, 2020 as the country battled to contain the spread of the disease. By August 2020, phase-by-phase easing of the lockdown was commenced and university students will soon return for academic activities. This study undertakes some epidemiological analysis of the Nigerian COVID-19 data to help the government and university administrators make informed decisions on the safety of personnel and students. The COVID-19 data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered were obtained from the website of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from April 2, 2020 to August 24, 2020. The infection rate, prevalence, ratio, cause-specific death rate, and case recovery rate were used to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic in Nigeria. Exponential smoothing was adopted in modeling the time series data and forecasting the pandemic in Nigeria up to January 31, 2021. The results indicated that the pandemic had infection rate of at most 3 infections per 1 million per day from April to August 2020. The death rate was 5 persons per 1 million during the period of study while recovery rate was 747 persons per 1000 infections. Analysis of forecast data showed steady but gradual decrease in the daily infection rate and death rate and substantial increase in the recovery rate, 975 recoveries per 1000 infections. In general, the epidemiological attributes of the pandemic from the original data and the forecast data indicated optimism in the decrease in the rate of infection and death in the future. Moreover, the infection rate, prevalence and death rate in January 2021 coincided with the predictions based on the analysis. Therefore, the Nigerian government is encouraged to allow universities in the country to reopen while university administrators set up the necessary protocols for strict adherence to safety measures.","Chigbu, Baptista C.; Edikpa, Edith C.; Onu, Eucharia A.; Nwabueze, Akachukwu I.; Aneke, Mary C.; Vita-Agundu, Uche C.; Adepoju, Esther B.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397825/,408

The aim of the present study was to determine the cytokines concentration and leukocyte subpopulations profiles in the severe COVID-19 (n = 23) and critical (n = 18) COVID-19 group distinguished by the computed tomography (CT) severity score. We observed lower percentage of lymphocyte subpopulation, higher neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and higher IL-6 concentration in critical COVID-19 group than in severe group. CT severity score was negative correlated with proportion of lymphocytes, lymphocytes T, CD4+ cells, Treg cells and NK cells and positive correlated with neutrophils, NLR, and IL-6. In critical group more correlations between cytokines and lymphocytes were observed, mainly between TNF-α, IL-1β and lymphocyte subpopulations. The collective assessment of the cytokine profile, leukocyte subpopulations and the CT severity score can help to characterize and differentiate patient in advanced COVID-19 than the study of single parameters.

Since obesity is a risk factor for COVID‐19 in adults, children (including adolescents) with obesity might perceive themselves to be vulnerable. Using a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we explored COVID‐19 related anxiety in paediatric patients with severe obesity in the Netherlands using semi‐structured telephone interviews and the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire, which had also been completed by the study population at baseline in the year prior to the COVID‐19 outbreak. In total, 75 families participated in the semi‐structured telephone interviews during the lockdown, April 2020. Characteristics of included patients were: median age 10.5 years (interquartile range = 7.6‐15.2); 52% female; mean BMI standard deviation score 3.8 (SD = 1.0). COVID‐19 related anxiety was reported for 24/75 (32%) children. The mean decrease in PedsQL score between baseline visit and COVID‐19 outbreak did not differ between children for whom anxiety was reported vs those for whom it was not (mean change −10.3 ± 36.5 vs −3.3 ± 24.4, P = .54). Self‐imposed strict quarantine measures were taken by 19/75 (25%) families. During follow‐up, several families reported that the previous contact alleviated their anxiety.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was very recently identified as a functional receptor for SARS virus and is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention. Rats of both genders at three distinct ages (young-adult, 3 months; middle-aged, 12 months; old, 24 months) were evaluated to determine the characteristic of ACE2 expression in lung and the effect of aging and gender on its expression. ACE2 was predominantly expressed in alveolar epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium and smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels with similar content, whereas no obvious signal was detected in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. ACE2 expression is dramatically reduced with aging in both genders: young-adult vs. old P < 0.001 (by 78% in male and 67% in female, respectively) and middle-aged vs. old P < 0.001 (by 71% in male rats and 59% in female rats, respectively). The decrease of ACE2 content was relatively slight between young-adult and middle-aged groups (by 25% in male and 18% in female, respectively). Although there was no gender-related difference of ACE2 in young-adult and middle-aged groups, a significantly higher ACE2 content was detected in old female rats than male. In conclusion, the more elevated ACE2 in young adults as compared to aged groups may contribute to the predominance in SARS attacks in this age group.","Xudong, Xie; Junzhu, Chen; Xingxiang, Wang; Furong, Zhang; Yanrong, Liu",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16303146/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505010386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320505010386,408

RESULTS In total, 179 SARS-CoV-2[+] children (44% females, median age 3.5 years, range: 0.1-19.0 years) were matched to 391 SARS-CoV-2[-] children (42% female, median age 3.7 years, range: 0.1-18.3 years). The commonest comorbidities showed similar frequencies in the SARS-CoV-2[+] and [-] groups: asthma (n = 9, 5% vs. n = 17, 4.4%, p = 0.71), congenital heart disease (n = 6, 3.4% vs. n = 7, 1.8%, p = 0.25) and obstructive sleep apnoea (n = 4, 2.2% vs. n = 10, 2.3%, p = 0.82). In the SARS-CoV-2[+] group, the prevalence of symptomatic disease was similar among children with and without cardiorespiratory comorbidities (n = 12, 75% vs. n = 103, 57%, p = 0.35). A high proportion of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection had cardiac comorbidities (23.8%). CONCLUSIONS In this single site data set, rates of pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease were similar in SARS-CoV-2[+] and SARS-CoV-2[-] children. Rates of symptomatic infection were similar between children with and without cardiorespiratory comorbidity. High rates of comorbid cardiac disease were observed among hospitalized children with COVID-19 warranting further research to inform vaccine prioritization.","Du Berry, Cassidy; Saunders, Thomas; McMinn, Alissa; Tosif, Shidan; Shanthikumar, Shivanthan; Vandeleur, Moya; Harrison, Joanne; Burgner, David; Ranganathan, Sarath; Crawford, Nigel; Wurzel, Danielle",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473903/,408

In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of YFSJF in treating PF, network pharmacology was used to predict the cooperative ingredients and associated pathways. METHODS: Firstly, we collected potential active ingredients of YFSJF by TCMSP databases. Secondly, we obtained PF-associated targets through OMIM and Genecards database. Finally, metascape was applied for the analysis of GO terms and KEGG pathways. RESULTS: We screened out 76 potential active ingredients and 98 associated proteins. A total of 5715 items were obtained by GO enrichment analysis (P < 0.05), including 4632 biological processes, 444 cellular components, and 639 molecular functions. A total of 143 related KEGG pathways were enriched (P < 0.05), including IL-17 signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, TH17 cell differentiation, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: YFSJF can interfere with immune and inflammatory response through multiple targets and pathways, which has a certain role in the treatment of PF. This study lays a foundation for future experimental research.","Qiao, Bo; Wu, Yueying; Li, Xiaoya; Xu, Zhenyuan; Duan, Weigang; Hu, Yanan; Jia, Wenqing; Fan, Qiuyang; Xing, Haijing",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335558/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8887017,408

According to the clinical data of infected patients, radiologic evidence of lung edema is common and deserves clinical attention. Lung edema is a manifestation of acute lung injury (ALI) and may progress to hypoxemia and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients diagnosed with ARDS have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality. Although no effective treatment is formally approved for COVID‐19 infection, support of ventilation with oxygen therapy and sometimes mechanical ventilation is often required. Treatment with systemic and/or local glucocorticoids might be helpful to alleviate the pulmonary inflammation and edema, which may decrease the development and/or consequences of ARDS. In this article, we focus on the lung edema and ALI of patients with this widely transmitted COVID‐19 infection in order to provide clinical indications and potential therapeutic targets for clinicians and researchers.","Li, Liyang; Huang, Qihong; Wang, Diane C.; Ingbar, David H.; Wang, Xiangdong",Clin Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508022/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.16,408

Data from the medical field are thus mandatory. We report our experience with a BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine in a retrospective analysis of 241 dialysis patients including 193 who underwent anti-Spike-Protein-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) IgG analysis. We show that a pro-active vaccine campaign is effective in convincing most patients to be vaccinated (95%) and frequently elicits a specific antibody response (94.3% after two doses and 98.4% after three doses). Only immunocompromised Status is associated with lack of seroconversion (OR 7.6 [1.5–38.2], p = 0.02). We also identify factors associated with low response (last quartile; IgG<500AU/mL): immunocompromised status, age, absence of RAAS inhibitors, low lymphocytes count, high C Reactive Protein; and with high response (high quartile; IgG>7000AU/mL): age; previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and active Cancer. From this experience, we propose a strategy integrating anti-spike IgG monitoring to guide revaccination and dialysis center management in pandemic times.","Bachelet, Thomas; Bourdenx, Jean-Philippe; Martinez, Charlie; Mucha, Simon; Martin-Dupont, Philippe; Perier, Valerie; Pommereau, Antoine",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610031/,408

TIM1 has been proposed to serve as a cellular receptor for hepatitis A virus and Ebola virus and as an entry factor for dengue virus. Here we show that TIM1 promotes infection of retroviruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with a range of viral entry proteins, in particular those from the filovirus, flavivirus, New World arenavirus and alphavirus families. TIM1 also robustly enhanced the infection of replication-competent viruses from the same families, including dengue, Tacaribe, Sindbis and Ross River viruses. All interactions between TIM1 and pseudoviruses or VLPs were PS-mediated, as demonstrated with liposome blocking and TIM1 mutagenesis experiments. In addition, other PS-binding proteins, such as Axl and TIM4, promoted infection similarly to TIM1. Finally, the blocking of PS receptors on macrophages inhibited the entry of Ebola VLPs, suggesting that PS receptors can contribute to infection in physiologically relevant cells. Notably, infection mediated by the entry proteins of Lassa fever virus, influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus was largely unaffected by TIM1 expression. Taken together our data show that TIM1 and related PS-binding proteins promote infection of diverse families of enveloped viruses, and may therefore be useful targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.","Jemielity, Stephanie; Wang, Jinyize J.; Chan, Ying Kai; Ahmed, Asim A.; Li, Wenhui; Monahan, Sheena; Bu, Xia; Farzan, Michael; Freeman, Gordon J.; Umetsu, Dale T.; DeKruyff, Rosemarie H.; Choe, Hyeryun",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23555248/,408

In particular, System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations are performed for a prototype model with key parameters that contribute to church growth. Potential parameters reflecting sustainability for churches trigger dramatic growth in church populations. We categorized five dimensions of sustainability with various multi-dimensional indicators in order to measure the level of sustainability, and we obtained the values of the indicators by analyzing a number of news articles searched with a text mining technique. As time-dependent values of sustainability are imposed on the generic SD model for church population dynamics as sustainable potential parameters, the optimized result reproduces specific features for the church population.

Healthcare professionals directly involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: This study investigated the prevalence of PTSD among nurses working in a COVID hospital and evaluated associated factors. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Crema Hospital and the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) was administered. Data collection took place from July to September 2020, during which 275 questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 39.88% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis deserving of further analysis. Nurses stated that they were predominantly overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts (M = 1.55). Working in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR=2.40; p=0.02), irregular work shifts (OR=5.41; p=0.01) and coming from a mental health ward (OR=3.80; p=0.02) increased the risk of receiving a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Our findings showed significantly higher IES-R scores among women than among men (p = 0.01). The activities that caused the most distress were related to technical skills required for managing ventilation and intubation devices. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study highlighted the presence of considerable psychological distress in the sample.

The search strings consisted of various search terms related to the concepts of mortality of critically ill patients and clinical interventions. Study Selection: After eliminating duplicates, two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts first, and then the full texts of potentially relevant articles were reviewed to identify cohort studies and case series that focus on the mortality of critically ill patients and clinical interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The secondary outcomes included all sorts of supportive care. Results: There were 27 cohort studies and six case series involving 42,219 participants that met our inclusion criteria. All-cause mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 35% and mortality in hospital was 32% in critically ill patients with COVID-19 for the year 2020, with very high between-study heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%; p < 0.01).

The aim was to document and compare the current use of wild and semi-cultivated plant food taxa by Romanians living in Romania and Ukraine. These two groups share similar ecological conditions and historically belonged to the same province, but were divided in the 1940s by the creation of a state border. We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with rural residents. The contemporary use of 46 taxa (plus 5 cultivated taxa with uncommon uses), belonging to 20 families, for food consumption were recorded. Romanians in Romanian Bukovina used 27 taxa belonging to 15 families, while in Ukraine they used 40 taxa belonging to 18 families. Jams, sarmale, homemade beer, and the homemade alcoholic drink “socată” are used more by Romanians in Southern Bukovina, while tea, soups, and birch sap are used more in Northern Bukovina. We discuss the strong influence of socio-political scenarios on the use of wild food plants. Cross-ethnic marriages, as well as markets and women’s networks, i.e., “neighbors do so”, may have had a great impact on changes in wild food use. In addition, rapid changes in lifestyle (open work market and social migration) are other explanations for the abandonment of wild edible plants.","Stryamets, Nataliya; Mattalia, Giulia; Pieroni, Andrea; Khomyn, Ihor; Sõukand, Renata",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430148/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10010126,408
603848,"COVID-19 Prevention Practices and Associated Factors Among Frontline Community Health Workers in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia",2021-08-18,"Effective risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical for encouraging appropriate public health behaviors. One way that the public is informed about COVID-19 numbers is through reports of daily new cases. However, presenting daily cases has the potential to lead to a dynamic reasoning bias that stems from intuitive misunderstandings of accumulation. Previous work in system dynamics shows that even highly educated individuals with training in science and math misunderstand basic concepts of accumulation. In the context of COVID-19, relying on the single cue of daily new cases can lead to relaxed attitudes about the risk of COVID-19 when daily new cases begin to decline. This situation is at the very point when risk is highest because even though daily new cases have declined, the active number of cases are highest because they have been accumulating over time. In an experiment with young adults from the USA and Canada (N = 551), we confirm that individuals fail to understand accumulation regarding COVID-19, have less concern regarding COVID-19, and decrease endorsement for public health measures as new cases decline but when active cases are at the highest point. Moreover, we experimentally manipulate different dynamic data visualizations and show that presenting data highlighting active cases and minimizing new cases led to increased concern and increased endorsement for COVID-19 health measures compared to a control condition highlighting daily cases. These results hold regardless of country, political affiliation, and individual differences in decision making.

In contrast to cytokine blockers, therapeutic blockade of TREM‐1 can blunt excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control. However, the nature of the TREM‐1 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM‐1 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM‐1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti‐arthritic activity of a novel, ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that was rationally designed using the signalling chain homo oligomerization (SCHOOL) model of cell signalling. Free GF9 and GF9 bound to macrophage‐targeted nanoparticles that mimic human high‐density lipoproteins (GF9‐HDL) were used to treat collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA). We also tested if 31‐mer peptides with sequences from GF9 and helices 4 (GE31) and 6 (GA31) of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A‐I, are able to perform three functions: assist in the self‐assembly of GA/E31‐HDL, target these particles to macrophages and block TREM‐1 signalling. We showed that GF9, but not control peptide, ameliorated CIA and protected against bone and cartilage damage. The therapeutic effect of GF9 was accompanied by a reduction in the plasma levels of macrophage colony‐stimulating factor and pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α, interleukin (IL)‐1 and IL‐6. Incorporation of GF9 alone or as a part of GE31 and GA31 peptides into HDL significantly increased its therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, our findings suggest that TREM‐1 inhibitory SCHOOL sequences may be promising alternatives for the treatment of RA.","Shen, Zu T.; Sigalov, Alexander B.",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382703/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.13173,408
604071,More Frequent Internet Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic Associates with Enhanced Quality of Life and Lower Depression Scores in Middle-Aged and Older Adults,2021-04-01,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.","Arim, M.; Herrera-Esposito, D.; Bermolen, P.; Cabana, A.; Fariello, M.

A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Role of Demographic and Geographic Factors,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the epidemiological features and outcomes of AKI among COVID-19 patients with ARDS are unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited consecutive adult COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed with ARDS according to Berlin definition from 13 designated intensive care units in the city of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors of AKI as well as the relation between AKI and in-hospital mortality were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 275 COVID-19 patients with ARDS were included in the study, and 49.5% of them developed AKI during their hospital stay. In comparison with patients without AKI, patients who developed AKI were older, tended to have chronic kidney disease, had higher Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score on day 1, and were more likely to receive invasive ventilation and develop acute organ dysfunction. Multivariate analysis showed that age, history of chronic kidney disease, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and albumin level were independently associated with the occurrence of AKI. Importantly, increasing AKI severity was associated with increased in-hospital mortality when adjusted for other potential variables: odds ratio of stage 1 = 5.374 (95% CI: 2.147–13.452; p < 0.001), stage 2 = 6.216 (95% CI: 2.011–19.210; p = 0.002), and stage 3 = 34.033 (95% CI: 9.723–119.129; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this multicenter retrospective study, we found that nearly half of COVID-19 patients with ARDS experienced AKI during their hospital stay. The coexistence of AKI significantly increased the mortality of these patients.","Wang, Feilong; Ran, Linyu; Qian, Chenchen; Hua, Jing; Luo, Zhibing; Ding, Min; Zhang, Xing; Guo, Wei; Gao, Shaoyong; Gao, Weibo; Li, Chaoping; Liu, Zhongmin; Li, Qiang; Ronco, Claudio",Blood Purif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291098/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000512371,408
604214,Rapid multi‐professional training for COVID‐19 in rural hospitals,2020-11-20,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced dramatic changes to the healthcare systems throughout the world. Time-sensitive management of cardiovascular emergencies such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has yet to be evaluated in the context of these new policies, particularly in so-called “hot spot” cities. Methods We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). Results The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P= 0.007). In contrast, additional safety protocols do not appear to have significantly affected delays between FMC and first intracoronary device activation (Group C 102 IQR [73.0, 133.0] min vs. Group A 104 IQR [87.0, 146.0] min vs. Group B 99.5 IQR [80.0, 150.0] min, P=0.37). Patients that presented during the outbreak were more likely to be unstable with a higher incidence of Killip classes II-IV compared to groups A and B (28.3% vs. 18.3% vs. 5.6% respectively, P=0.008). Worse in-hospital outcomes were also noted with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (Group A 5.0% vs. Group B 11.1% vs. Group C 22.6%, P=0.007). Conclusion During the lockdown period, many patients appear to have been reluctant to present to hospitals. This was associated with more unstable STEMI presentations and worse in-hospital course. Importantly, the health care system appears able to ensure timely acute cardiac care while ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are respected.","Haddad, Kevin; Potter, Brian J.; Matteau, Alexis; Gobeil, François; Mansour, Samer",Cardiovasc Revasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2020.09.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32988743/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155383892030573X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S155383892030573X,408

605472,The Persian Version of the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (Persian-C19P-S) and the Differences in COVID-19-Related Phobic Reactions in Patients with Anxiety Disorders,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of COVID-19 in a nursing home in the Netherlands, following an on-site church service held on March 8 (th), 2020, triggered an investigation to unravel sources and chain(s) of transmission. METHODS: Epidemiological data were collected from registries and through a questionnaire among church attendees. Symptomatic residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Sequences from a selection of people from the same area were included as community reference. RESULTS: After the church service, 30 of 39 attendees (77%) developed symptoms; 14 were tested and were positive for COVID-19 (11 residents and 3 non-residents). In the following five weeks, 62 of 300 residents (21%) and 30 of 640 HCWs (5%) tested positive for COVID-19; 21 of 62 residents (34%) died. The outbreak was controlled through a cascade of measures. WGS of samples from residents and HCWs identified a diversity of sequence types, grouped into eight clusters. Seven resident church attendees all were infected with distinct viruses, four of which belonged to two larger clusters in the nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: Although initial investigation suggested the church service as source of the outbreak, detailed analysis showed a more complex picture, most consistent with widespread regional circulation of the virus in the weeks before the outbreak, and multiple introductions into the nursing home before the visitor ban. The findings underscore the importance of careful outbreak investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission to develop evidence-based mitigation measures.","Voeten, Helene A C M; Sikkema, Reina S; Damen, Marjolein; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Arends, Carla; Stobberingh, Ellen; Hoogervorst, Ellen; Koopmans, Marion P G; Fanoy, Ewout",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119065/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1664,408

An open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial was conducted at five hospitals in Tehran and Isfahan provinces of Iran on 358 hospitalized adult patients. A total of 174 patients received standard care and 184 received herbal remedies (polyherbal decoction every 8 hr and two herbal capsules every 12 hr) plus standard care for 7 days. The primary clinical endpoint was the duration of hospital stay, and secondary outcomes were clinical improvement of symptoms based on self-assessment questionnaire. Results demonstrated that these natural decoction and capsules treatment plus routine care significantly decreased duration of hospital dyspnea (3.291 day vs. 6.468 days), accelerated clinical improvement, and decreased symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia, chills, runny nose, sputum cough, and vertigo in the treatment group compared with standard-care group. Significant effects of these polyherbal formulations on improving the symptoms of COVID-19 could be incredibly promising for managing this pandemic with acceptable tolerability.","Karimi, Mehrdad; Zarei, Azadeh; Soleymani, Samaneh; Jamalimoghadamsiahkali, Saeidreza; Asadi, Asmaa; Shati, Mohsen; Jafari, Mohieddin; Rezadoost, Hassan; Kordafshar, Gholamreza; Naghizadeh, Ayeh; Mardi, Raefeh; Namiranian, Parva; Khamechi, Seyed Peyman; Ansari, Narges; Adel Mehraban, Mohammad Sadegh; Aliakbarzadeh, Hananeh; Khanavi, Mahnaz; Esmaealzadeh, Niusha; Moravveji, Alireza; Salahi, Mehrdad; Khoi, Maryam; Razzaghi, Reza; Banafshe, Hamid Reza; Alizadeh, Mostafa; Akhbari, Marzieh; Atharizadeh, Mina; Izadikhah, Akram; Elsagh, Mahin; Hossein Zade Ghahnavieh, Mahdi; Eghbalian, Fatemeh; Vanai, Azam; Izadi, Hossein; Moravej, Seyed Ali Al-Hadi; Jazayeri, Seyede Ferdos; Bayat, Houman; Emadi Koochak, Hamid; Zargaran, Arman",Phytother. res,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606123/,408

This is particularly the case whenever there is a need for advanced strategic reasoning and analysis of vast amounts of data in order to solve complex problems. Few human activities fit this description better than politics. In politics we deal with some of the most complex issues humans face, short-term and long-term consequences have to be balanced, and we make decisions knowing that we do not fully understand their consequences. I examine an extreme case of the application of AI in the domain of government, and use this case to examine a subset of the potential harms associated with algorithmic governance. I focus on five objections based on political theoretical considerations and the potential political harms of an AI technocracy. These are objections based on the ideas of ‘political man’ and participation as a prerequisite for legitimacy, the non-morality of machines and the value of transparency and accountability. I conclude that these objections do not successfully derail AI technocracy, if we make sure that mechanisms for control and backup are in place, and if we design a system in which humans have control over the direction and fundamental goals of society. Such a technocracy, if the AI capabilities of policy formation here assumed becomes reality, may, in theory, provide us with better means of participation, legitimacy, and more efficient government.","Sætra (Sætra is the family name), Henrik Skaug",Technol Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X19305925?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160791X19305925; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32536737/,408

607457,A systems approach to scale-up for population health improvement,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse (TNG) youth encounter barriers to psychosocial wellness and also describe exploring identities and communities on the web. Studies of cisgender youth connect increased digital technology use with lower well-being, parent relationships, and body image scores as well as increased loneliness and fear of missing out (FOMO). However, little is known about the psychosocial factors associated with digital technology use among TNG compared with cisgender youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the associations between psychosocial measures and digital technology use and its importance for cisgender and TNG youth. METHODS: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of adolescents (aged 13-18 years) about psychosocial wellness and digital technology use. Psychosocial measures included assessment of well-being, parental relationships, body image, loneliness, and FOMO. Digital media use assessments included the short Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening Scale-3 and the Adolescent Digital Technology Interactions and Importance (ADTI) scale and subscales. We compared psychosocial measures between gender identity groups. We also compared stratified correlations for psychosocial measures (well-being, parent relationships, body image, loneliness, and FOMO) with ADTI and Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening Scale-3 scores between gender identity groups. All comparisons were adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 4575 adolescents, 53 (1.16%) self-identified as TNG youth. TNG youth had lower scores for well-being (23.76 vs 26.47; P<.001), parent relationships (19.29 vs 23.32; P<.001), and body image (13.50 vs 17.12; P<.001), and higher scores for loneliness (9.28 vs 6.55; P<.001) and FOMO (27.93 vs 23.89; P=.004), compared with cisgender peers. In a pattern different from that of their cisgender peers, better well-being scores and body image for TNG youth predicted higher problematic internet use (PIU) scores (correlation coefficients of 0.32 vs −0.07; P=.004 and 0.26 vs −0.21; P=.002, respectively). FOMO was a stronger positive predictor of higher ADTI total and subscale scores for cisgender youth compared with TNG youth. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study supports previously demonstrated disparities in the psychosocial wellness of TNG youth and adds that these disparities include loneliness and FOMO. This study shows prediction of PIU by both higher well-being and better body image, indicating that PIU may not be unilaterally driven by problematic factors among TNG youth. We suggest that this may be because of the specific digital media functions that TNG youth engage with as a disenfranchised population.","Allen, Brittany J; Stratman, Zoe E; Kerr, Bradley R; Zhao, Qianqian; Moreno, Megan A",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://doi.org/10.2196/25801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398792/,408

This necessitated prompt deployment of a monitoring and treatment strategy which included twice-daily blood count assessment, multiple platelet transfusions and anti-coagulation therapy with dose-adjustment per blood count during both induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Multiple factors are believed to contribute to the development of thrombosis in acute leukemia such as diffuse intravascular coagulation, cytokine release and chemotherapy. CASE REPORT: Our patient presented early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying his seeking out medical treatment and we suspect this to have contributed to his 'catastrophic' thrombotic presentation. Well-structured guidelines to help clinicians manage these patients are lacking, and most data are from retrospective analyses or case reports. Our patient continued full-dose anticoagulant therapy until successfully undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant. The thrombi eventually diminished in size, and the patient was not diagnosed with any further thrombotic events.

608621,Recommendations for Physical Inactivity and Sedentary Behavior During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020-05-12,"Electrification is widely considered as a viable strategy for reducing the oil dependency and environmental impacts of road transportation. In pursuit of this strategy, most attention has been paid to electric cars. However, substantial, yet untapped, potentials could be realized in urban areas through the large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers. Here, we review the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers, demonstrating that these are generally more energy efficient and less polluting than conventionally-powered motor vehicles. Electric two-wheelers tend to decrease exposure to pollution as their environmental impacts largely result from vehicle production and electricity generation outside of urban areas. Our analysis suggests that the price of e-bikes has been decreasing at a learning rate of 8%. Despite price differentials of 5000 ± 1800 EUR(2012) kW h(−1) in Europe, e-bikes are penetrating the market because they appear to offer an apparent additional use value relative to bicycles. Mid-size and large electric two-wheelers do not offer such an additional use value compared to their conventional counterparts and constitute niche products at price differentials of 700 ± 360 EUR(2012) kW(−1) and 160 ± 90 EUR(2012) kW(−1), respectively. The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of urban infrastructure and safety regulations. A case-specific assessment as part of an integrated urban mobility planning that accounts, e.g., for the local electricity mix, infrastructure characteristics, and mode-shift behavior, should be conducted before drawing conclusions about the sustainability impacts of electric two-wheelers.","Weiss, Martin; Dekker, Peter; Moro, Alberto; Scholz, Harald; Patel, Martin K.",Transp Res D Transp Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288595/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2015.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920915001315; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1361920915001315,408
609390,CD08: Occupational dermatoses during the second COVID‐19 pandemic wave: an audit of 401 healthcare workers,2021-07-06,"The current growth of the human population, the intensification of animal production, climate change or globalization favors an increase in the transmission of infectious diseases. Risk analysis is the tool that allows the identification of the factors involved in the introduction and the spread of infectious diseases. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the risk of entry of animal infectious zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases from North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to countries of the European Union. A probabilistic formulation has been developed to obtain the probabilities of introduction of diseases associated with each possible route of entry in the European Union. The results show that, among the infectious diseases analyzed in this study, avian influenza and Newcastle disease are the ones with a higher risk of entry in the European Union and the wild bird's migration is the route with greater impact. It is confirmed a moderate probability of entry of some vector-borne diseases, bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease, through wind flow from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Due to the absence of live dromedary movement to Europe, the more likely way of entry of the Middle East respiratory syndrome is through the infected people movement from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This study includes different methodologies. A model of vectors dispersion in wind currents has been established to assess the risk of introduction of vector borne diseases. It is applicable both in animal health and public health. A periodical update would be useful to obtain a periodically updated risk analysis and to allow early detection of potential hazard with an increased risk over the previous years.","Massó Sagüés, Elena; Fernández-Carrión, Eduardo; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, Jose Manuel",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555676/,408

There is accumulating evidence showing ATP released from Panx1 channels, as well as metabolites, provide effective paracrine and autocrine signaling molecules that regulate different elements of the injury response. As channels with a broad range of permselectivity, Panx1 channels mediate the secretion and uptake of multiple solutes, ranging from calcium to bacterial derived molecules. In this review, we describe how Panx1 functions in response to different pro-inflammatory stimuli, focusing mainly on signaling coordinated by the vasculature. How Panx1 mediates ATP release by injured cells is also discussed. The ability of Panx1 to serve as a central component of many diverse physiologic responses has proven to be critically dependent on the context of expression, post-translational modification, interacting partners, and the mode of stimulation.","Koval, Michael; Cwiek, Aleksandra; Carr, Thomas; Good, Miranda E.; Lohman, Alexander W.; Isakson, Brant E.",Purinergic Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251590/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11302-021-09804-8,408

In this context, medical treatments such as hyperthermia and cryotherapy, but also the development and use of hydrogel-based biomaterials are of particular concern. To enable accurate temperature measurement without perturbing or even destroying the biological tissue or material to be monitored, contactless thermometry methods are preferred. Among these, the most suitable are based on magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI, MRS). Here, we address the latest developments in this field as well as their current and anticipated practical applications. We highlight recent progress aimed at rendering MR thermometry faster and more reproducible, versatile and sophisticated, and provide our perspective on how these new techniques broaden the range of applications in medical treatments and biomaterial development by enabling insight into finer details of thermal behavior.

610302,Competing Crises: COVID‐19 Countermeasures and Social Isolation among Older Adults in Long Term Care,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of coronavirus disease spreading is impacting mental health globally. Even though the pandemic is challenging for patients, the community, policymakers, as well as health organizations, and teams, the data on COVID-19 and its association with anxiety and coping mechanisms towards infection among community members are currently limited. Thus, the study is intended to assess COVID-19-related levels of anxiety and coping strategies among community members of Bale and East Bale Zones, Southeast Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based survey was carried out among 634 study participants of Bale and East Bale Zones from June 1 to 20, 2020. The level of anxiety was determined by using the 5-item Coronavirus Scale and the coping strategies were determined by using the 15-item Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. Bi-variable analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the relationship among the variables. RESULTS: COVID-19-related dysfunctional level of anxiety was found 95 (16.58%). About 290 (50.6%) respondents were copied from anxiety that occurred as a result of COVID-19. Factors significantly associated with the dysfunctional level of anxiety related to COVID-19 were being an urban resident (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.86), those who had no information from TV/radio (AOR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.84), and walking a long distance more than 1 hour from the health institution (AOR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related dysfunctional levels of anxiety were 16.58% in the study community. Half of the community was coped with COVID-19-related anxiety. Being an urban resident and walking along distances more than 1 hour from the health facility were the factors that decreased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety, whereas respondents who had no information from TV/radio increased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety. Accordingly, focusing on these identified factors could improve a dysfunctional level of anxiety in the study community.","Teferu Engida, Zinash; Solomon Shiferaw, Damtew; Kumbi Ketaro, Musa; Mamo, Ayele; Aliyi, Ahmednur Adem; Hussein Mohamed, Abduljewad; Mohammed Hassen, Mesud; Mohammed Abduletif, Abdulshakur; Lette Wodera, Abate; Hailu Ayene, Sintayehu; Kasim Esamael, Jeylan; Gezahegn, Habtamu; Esmael, Adem",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285604/; https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s309806,408

Unfortunately, towards the end of 2020, the number of daily new cases exponentially increased. Herein, we analyzed the country-wide genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 and April 2021. We identified that the most prevalent viral variant during the first epidemic wave in Uruguay (December 2020–February 2021) was a B.1.1.28 sublineage carrying Spike mutations Q675H + Q677H, now designated as P.6, followed by lineages P.2 and P.7. P.6 probably arose around November 2020, in Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital department, and rapidly spread to other departments, with evidence of further local transmission clusters; it also spread sporadically to the USA and Spain. The more efficient dissemination of lineage P.6 with respect to P.2 and P.7 and the presence of mutations (Q675H and Q677H) in the proximity of the key cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary suggest that P.6 may be more transmissible than other lineages co-circulating in Uruguay. Although P.6 was replaced by the variant of concern (VOC) P.1 as the predominant lineage in Uruguay since April 2021, the monitoring of the concurrent emergence of Q675H + Q677H in VOCs should be of worldwide interest.","Rego, Natalia; Salazar, Cecilia; Paz, Mercedes; Costábile, Alicia; Fajardo, Alvaro; Ferrés, Ignacio; Perbolianachis, Paula; Fernández-Calero, Tamara; Noya, Veronica; Machado, Matias R.; Brandes, Mariana; Arce, Rodrigo; Arleo, Mailen; Possi, Tania; Reyes, Natalia; Bentancor, María Noel; Lizasoain, Andrés; Bortagaray, Viviana; Moller, Ana; Chappos, Odhille; Nin, Nicolas; Hurtado, Javier; Duquía, Melissa; González, Maria Belén; Griffero, Luciana; Méndez, Mauricio; Techera, Maria Pía; Zanetti, Juan; Pereira, Emiliano; Rivera, Bernardina; Maidana, Matías; Alonso, Martina; Smircich, Pablo; Arantes, Ighor; Mir, Daiana; Alonso, Cecilia; Medina, Julio; Albornoz, Henry; Colina, Rodney; Bello, Gonzalo; Moreno, Pilar; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Iraola, Gregorio; Spangenberg, Lucía",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578382/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091801,408

Contaminated feed has been suggested as a vehicle of transmission for PEDV. The objective of this study was to compare thermal and electron beam processing, and the inclusion of feed additives on the inactivation of PEDV in feed. Feed samples were spiked with PEDV and then heated to 120–145°C for up to 30 min or irradiated at 0–50 kGy. Another set of feed samples spiked with PEDV and mixed with Ultracid P (Nutriad), Activate DA (Novus International), KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifood), Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition), sugar or salt was incubated at room temperature (~25°C) for up to 21 days. At the end of incubation, the virus titers were determined by inoculation of Vero-81 cells and the virus inactivation kinetics were modeled using the Weibull distribution model. The Weibull kinetic parameter delta represented the time or eBeam dose required to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For thermal processing, delta values ranged from 16.52 min at 120°C to 1.30 min at 145°C. For eBeam processing, a target dose of 50 kGy reduced PEDV concentration by 3 log. All additives tested were effective in reducing the survival of PEDV when compared with the control sample (delta = 17.23 days). Activate DA (0.81) and KEM-GEST (3.28) produced the fastest inactivation. In conclusion, heating swine feed at temperatures over 130°C or eBeam processing of feed with a dose over 50 kGy are effective processing steps to reduce PEDV survival. Additionally, the inclusion of selected additives can decrease PEDV survivability.","Trudeau, Michaela P.; Verma, Harsha; Sampedro, Fernando; Urriola, Pedro E.; Shurson, Gerald C.; McKelvey, Jessica; Pillai, Suresh D.; Goyal, Sagar M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27341670/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158128,408

In order to develop therapeutic interventions against this condition, one promising strategy is to target spike, the trimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that the virus uses to recognise and bind its host cells. Here we use a metainference cryo-electron microscopy approach to determine the opening pathway that brings spike from its inactive (closed) conformation to its active (open) one. The knowledge of the structures of the intermediate states of spike along this opening pathway enables us to identify a cryptic pocket that is not exposed in the open and closed states. These results underline the opportunities offered by the determination of the structures of the transient intermediate states populated during the dynamics of proteins to allow the therapeutic targeting of otherwise invisible cryptic binding sites.","Brotzakis, Z.

However, the fear of provoking laryngospasm may cause avoidance of deep or sedated extubation techniques which could reduce coughing and infection risk. This fear may be alleviated with clear understanding of the mechanisms and effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction including laryngospasm. We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1. The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2. The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can “break” laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature. We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.","Sibert, Karen S; Long, Jennifer L; Haddy, Steven M",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440387/,408

This study was designed to compare the maternal and perinatal clinical outcomes in obstetrics patients with COVID-19 between the two waves of infection in Spain. We conducted an observational, analytical, ambispective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up of mothers with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection from different hospitals in our country between March–November 2020. We recruited 1295 pregnant women with SARS-CoV2 infection from 78 hospitals, 846 (65.3%) of whom were diagnosed during the first wave and 449 (34.7%) during the second wave. Our results show that patients developing COVID-19 during the first wave had more symptoms at triage, early in pregnancy with greater rates of COVID-19-related maternal morbidity; caesarean section and preterm birth in the first wave. We register two cases of maternal mortality and only during the first wave. Maternal morbidity events showed a strong link to perinatal mortality events in the first wave compared to the second wave, in which maternal morbidity was more associated with pneumonia. Likewise, maternal morbidity showed a strong correlation with perinatal morbidity events in both waves. We describe the differences between the patients’ profiles and management between the two waves and related to maternal and perinatal outcomes. Differences were also observed in the management of pregnant women with COVID-19. Thus, there were fewer caesarean sections, and maternal and perinatal morbidity events were reduced in the second wave, while the impacts of respiratory symptoms and their severity, including a greater need for maternal treatment, were greater in this last period. Identifying the impact that changes in the profile as well as in the treatment have on maternal–perinatal morbidity and mortality will help improve the well-being of our patients and their newborns.","Cuñarro-López, Yolanda; Pintado-Recarte, Pilar; Hernández-Martín, Concepción; Paya-Martínez, Pilar; López-Pérez, Rocío; Cueto-Hernández, Ignacio; Ruiz-Labarta, Javier; Cano-Valderrama, Óscar; Martínez-Pérez, Óscar; Bravo-Arribas, Coral; Ortega, Miguel A.; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11070599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201923/,408

To enforce these measures, restrictions on outdoor behaviour have been implemented, limiting access to parks and recreational outdoor spaces. New evidence shows that COVID-19 restrictions are associated with an overall lower amount of time spent in outdoor play among Canadian children and youth. This is concerning, as outdoor play is important for children’s physical and mental health and helps provide them with a sense of control during times of uncertainty and stress. As policies on access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 outbreak vary by province, it is possible that policy differences have led to regional differences in changes in outdoor play among children and youth. In this commentary, we examine regional differences in outdoor play among children and youth across Canada, and the association between provincial policies related to COVID-19 and outdoor play. We argue that through the recovery process, in the event of a second wave of infections, and in preparing for future public health challenges, policy decisions should consider ways to preserve outdoor play for Canadian children and youth.","de Lannoy, Louise; Rhodes, Ryan E.; Moore, Sarah A.; Faulkner, Guy; Tremblay, Mark S.",Can J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057923/; https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00412-4,408

Regardless of model complexity, forecasts of future COVID-19 infections, deaths and hospitalization are associated with large uncertainties, and critically depend on the quality of the training data, and in particular how well the recorded national or regional numbers of infections, deaths and recoveries reflect the the actual situation. In turn, this depends on, e.g., local test and abatement strategies, treatment capacities and available technologies. Other influencing factors including temperature and humidity, which are suggested by several authors to affect the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, are generally only considered by the most complex models and further serve to inflate the uncertainty. Here we use comparative and retrospective analyses to illuminate the aggregated effect of these systematic biases on ensemble-based model forecasts. We compare the actual progression of active infections across ten of the most affected countries in the world until late November 2020 with “re-forecasts” produced by two of the most commonly used model types: (i) a compartment-type, susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model; and (ii) a statistical (Holt-Winters) time series model. We specifically examine the sensitivity of the model parameters, estimated systematically from different subsets of the data and thereby different time windows, to illustrate the associated implications for short- to medium-term forecasting and for probabilistic projections based on (single) model ensembles as inspired by, e.g., weather forecasting and climate research. Our findings portray considerable variations in forecasting skill in between the ten countries and demonstrate that individual model predictions are highly sensitive to parameter assumptions. Significant skill is generally only confirmed for short-term forecasts (up to a few weeks) with some variation across locations and periods.","Drews, Martin; Kumar, Pavan; Singh, Ram Kumar; De La Sen, Manuel; Singh, Sati Shankar; Pandey, Ajai Kumar; Kumar, Manoj; Rani, Meenu; Srivastava, Prashant Kumar",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972105717X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592277/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972105717X?v=s5,408

Hence, our goal was to broadly characterize hMPV infection in patients of all ages hospitalized with acute respiratory infections in Córdoba, Argentina, including epidemiology, clinical features and genetic diversity. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained from 795 patients during 2011–2013, 621 patients were 0–25 years old and 174 were 26–85 years old. HMPV was assayed by RT-PCR and other respiratory viruses by indirect immunofluorescence. Local strains were identified by sequence analysis. Human Metapneumovirus was detected in 20.3% (161/795) patients, 13.1% as single infections and 7.2% in co-infections, more frequently with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. HMPV circulated during late winter and spring in all age patients, but mainly in children under 4 years old in 71.4% (115/161) and adults between 26 and 59 years old in 12.4% (20/161).

Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D insufficiency is related to a higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID-19 infection, and assess whether such an association differed according to the different levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D. METHODS: This study included 8297 adults who have records of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank (from 16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020). The use of vitamin D supplements, circulating vitamin D levels, and main covariates were measured at baseline (2006–2010). Genetically predicted vitamin D levels were evaluated by genetic risk score. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, the habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45–0.97; P = 0.034). Circulating vitamin D levels at baseline or genetically predicted vitamin D levels were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that habitual use of vitamin D supplements is related to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inverse association is due to residual confounding or selection bias. Further clinical trials are needed to verify these results.","Ma, Hao; Zhou, Tao; Heianza, Yoriko; Qi, Lu",Am J Clin Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515005/,408

For example, protective equipment is now being extensively used, which was otherwise only used in selected situations. Working in such an environment is to be evaluated differently under the aspect of occupational safety than other patient care, especially as more than 1900 suspected cases of a SARS-CoV-19 occupational disease were reported among healthcare workers in Germany. Even in a pandemic, the legal requirements remain valid and personal protective equipment (PPE) has to comply with given standards. The use of FFP3 masks is required in aerosol-forming situations, such as endotracheal intubation or bronchoscopy. In contrast to surgical face masks, there is a maximum wearing time for FFPs masks. Furthermore, in a pandemic there is a basic danger of PPE shortage and recycling of face masks is under discussion. Therefore, usage of non-EU certified PPE may come into effect but this has to follow the requirements defined by European regulations. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the currently relevant rules and regulations in Germany.","Mayr, N.

Center-specific protocols have been developed and transplant societies propose limiting elective LDLT. We have looked at outcomes of LDLT during the pandemic in an exclusively LDLT center. METHODS: Patients were grouped into pre-COVID (January 2019-February 2020) (n = 162) and COVID (March 2020-January 2021) (n = 53) cohorts. We looked at patient characteristics, 30-day morbidity, and mortality. Outcomes were also assessed in donors and recipients who underwent surgery after recovery from COVID-19. RESULTS: The average number of transplants reduced from 11.5/month to 4.8/month. Fewer patients with MELD > 20 underwent LDLT in the COVID cohort (41.3% versus 24.5%, P = 0.03). Out of nine patients with a positive pretransplant COVID-19 PCR, there were 2 (22.3%) deaths on the waiting list. Seven patients underwent LT after recovery from COVID-19 with one 30-day mortality due to biliary sepsis. Three donors with positive COVID-19 PCR underwent uneventful donation after testing negative for COVID-19. No significant difference in 30-day survival was observed in the pre-COVID and COVID cohorts (93.2% versus 90.6%) (P = 0.3). Out of two recipients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia within 30 days after LT, there was one mortality. The 1-year survival for the entire cohort with a MELD cutoff of 20 was 90% and 84% (P = 0.2). CONCLUSION: Despite comparable outcomes, fewer sick patients might undergo LDLT during the pandemic. Individuals recovered from COVID-19 might be safely considered for donation or transplantation.","Bhatti, Abu Bakar Hafeez; Nazish, Malka; Khan, Nusrat Yar; Manan, Fazal; Zia, Haseeb Haider; Ilyas, Abid; Ishtiaq, Wasib; Khan, Nasir Ayub",J Gastrointest Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131867/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-021-05057-3,408
618027,How can medical schools combat declining mental health amongst their students during the COVID-19 quarantine period?,2021,"Following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in late 2019, a large number of antibody tests were developed for use in seroprevalence studies aimed at determining the extent of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in a given population. The vast majority of these tests are qualitative and use a single target for antibody detection, incorporating either full-length or truncated versions of the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, mono-epitope tests - whether qualitative or quantitative - are unable to localise antibody binding or characterise the distribution and titres of epitope recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within an individual or across a population. However, it seems plausible that if such information were available, it may correlate with the presence of potent, high-titre, neutralising antibodies that afford protection again imminent re-infection, as well as with the likelihood of developing a memory B-cell response that would provide more durable protection. We have developed a novel, quantitative, multi-antigen, multiplexed, array-based immunoassay platform, ImmuSAFE COVID+ (ImmuSAFE) comprising 6 functionally validated domains or regions of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed using Sengenics KREX technology. This array platform enables determination of both the position and breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination. To validate our platform, 100 serum samples (confirmed sero-positive COVID-19 cases, n=50; pre-pandemic HIV positive controls, n=50) were tested for IgG seropositivity to the N antigen, yielding 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. All 50 cases showed positive antibody reactivity towards at least one N protein epitope, whilst all 50 controls showed antibody reactivity below threshold values. Broad variation was also observed in the magnitude and breadth of antibodies present, represented as an Epitope Coverage score (EPC). A positive correlation was observed between increasing age and EPC values, with individuals under 40 years old having a mean EPC score of 3.1, whilst individuals above the age of 60 had a mean EPC of 5.1. This finding may have broad implications for the natural history of COVID-19 disease in different individuals.","Blackburn, Jonathan M; Anuar, Nur Diana; Tan, Ti-Myen; Nel, Andrew JM; Smith, Muneerah; Ellan, Kavithambigai; Bahrin, Nur Izwani Shaiful; Rosli, Nurul Shielawati Mohamed; Badri, Noorul Hidayah; Rahman, Teh Norleila Abdul; Anwar, Arif; Zain, Rozainanee Mohd",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201269v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201269,408

We report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cluster infections. Methods Data of clustered cases were retrieved from the public health emergency monitoring information system of China. We analyzed the incubation period, generation gap, secondary attack rate, and viral load in various grouped cases. Results A total of 60 COVID-19 infection clusters including 226 patients and 19 asymptomatic cases involving four generations were analyzed. With the increase of transmission generations, secondary attack rate decreased (P＜0.001) and severity alleviated (P = 0.008). The median incubation period and intergenerational interval were 9 and 6 days, respectively. The secondary attack rate was 7.1% in the index cases, 5.0% in the first generation, 1.0% in the second generation, and 4.7% overall. Severe cases were seen more in the index (13, 65%) and first generation (7, 35%) ones, who had a significantly higher viral load than the mild and moderate ones. Conclusions With the increase of transmission generation, secondary infection rate and severity decreased. Severe patients had a higher virus load. Patients in the incubation period and asymptomatic carriers were potential infection sources who might play an important role in transmission.","Wu, Jiabing; Chen, Xiuzhi; Gong, Lei; Huo, Shaohu; Gao, Xuehuan; Nie, Shuang; Chen, Fang; Hou, Sai; Song, Dandan; Ma, Wanwan; Jiang, Xuqin; Liu, Zhirong",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003763?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984511/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221003763,408
618707,COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers,2020-02-23,"During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan’s connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.","Menkir, Tigist F.; Chin, Taylor; Hay, James; Surface, Erik D.; De Salazar, Pablo M.; Buckee, Caroline O.; Watts, Alexander; Khan, Kamran; Mina, Michael; Lipsitch, Marc; Niehus, Rene",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511613/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20038331,408
619066,Trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms during enforced isolation due to COVID-19 in England: a longitudinal observational study,2020-12-09,"2′-β-d-Arabinouridine (AraU), the uridine analogue of the anticancer agent AraC, was synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity. In addition, a series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs in the form of triester phosphoramidates (ProTides) were also synthesized and tested against a range of viruses, leukaemia and solid tumour cell lines. Unfortunately, neither the parent compound (AraU) nor any of its ProTides showed antiviral activity, nor potent inhibitory activity against any of the cancer cell lines. Therefore, the metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates to release AraU monophosphate was investigated. The results showed carboxypeptidase Y, hog liver esterase and crude CEM tumor cell extracts to hydrolyse the ester motif of phosphoramidates with subsequent loss of the aryl group, while molecular modelling studies suggested that the AraU l-alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative might not be a good substrate for the phosphoramidase enzyme Hint-1. These findings are in agreement with the observed disappearance of intact prodrug and concomitant appearance of the corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative in CEM cell extracts without measurable formation of araU monophosphate. These findings may explain the poor antiviral/cytostatic potential of the prodrugs.","Mehellou, Youcef; Valente, Rocco; Mottram, Huw; Walsby, Elisabeth; Mills, Kenneth I.; Balzarini, Jan; McGuigan, Christopher",Bioorg Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089610001902; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2010.02.059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089610001902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299228/,408

For these reasons, agentic engagement during video‐conferencing became critical for successful learning outcomes. This study explores the mediating effect agentic engagement has on collaborative language learning orientations (CLLO) within an EFL video‐conferencing course to understand better how interactions influence academic learning expectations. A total of 329 (Male = 132, Female = 197) students were recruited from four South Korean universities to participate in this questionnaire study. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical software packages SPSS, and a series of data screening procedures were carried out. Findings revealed that collaborative language learning orientations were a statistically significant predictor of academic learning expectations, but this relationship was fully mediated when agentic engagement was added to the model. Students with a propensity for social language learning strategies believe they will succeed; however, this relationship is explained by their propensity to interact with the instructor when video‐conferencing. An assortment of learning activities should be provided to support both collaborative and individual learning orientations for academic success. Students with collaborative learning tendencies and a propensity to actively engage the instructor during video conference classes are active participants in the eLearning context, possibly leading to positive course expectations.","Almusharraf, Norah Mansour; Bailey, Daniel",J Comput Assist Learn,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcal.12569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226784/,408

In addition, the stability of endemic equilibrium is analyzed. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the epidemic threshold increases with the increase of two kinds of death rates, while it decreases with the increase of the modularity coefficient and network size.","Chanchan, Li; Guoping, Jiang",The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1005888516600614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1005888516600614,408

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for T2D, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified. Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality. Furthermore, metformin use was significantly associated with reduced heart failure and inflammation. Our findings provide clinical evidence in support of continuing metformin treatment in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D, but acidosis and kidney function should be carefully monitored in individuals with severe COVID-19.","Cheng, Xu; Liu, Ye-Mao; Li, Haomiao; Zhang, Xin; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Chen, Ze; Deng, Ke-Qiong; Lin, Lijin; Chen, Ming-Ming; Song, Xiaohui; Xia, Meng; Huang, Xuewei; Liu, Weifang; Cai, Jingjing; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Zhou, Feng; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Yibin; Ma, Xinliang; Xu, Qingbo; Yang, Juan; Ye, Ping; Mao, Weiming; Huang, Xiaodong; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Guo, Jiao; Zhu, Lihua; Lu, Zhibing; Yuan, Yufeng; Wei, Xiang; She, Zhi-Gang; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861268/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.08.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120304265?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120304265,408

622572,Functional Impairment in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic among Cannabis Users.,2021-10-05,"(1) Background: People with disabilities may benefit from an assistance dog (AD). Despite regulations that prohibit the denial of ADs to public places, this still occurs on a regular basis. The main argument for denial of access is that dogs compromise hygiene with their presence, which could cause a health hazard. Meanwhile, people are allowed to walk into and out of public places freely. (2) Objective: As a pilot study, to investigate the number of Enterobacteriaceae and the presence of Clostridium difficile bacteria on the paws of ADs and pet dogs (PDs) as well as the shoe soles of their users and owners. With the results, an assessment can be made as to whether measures are required to reduce environmental contamination (e.g., in hospitals). (3) Methods: In total, 25 ADs, 25 PDs, and their 50 users/owners participated in the study. Each participant walked their dog for 15–30 min prior to the sampling of the front paws. Each PD owner or AD user filled out a general questionnaire about the care of their dogs, and AD users were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire on their experiences regarding the admittance of their ADs to public places (in particular, hospitals). Dutch hospitals were questioned on their protocols regarding the admittance of ADs and their visitor numbers, including the percentage of AD users, to put these numbers into perspective. (4) Results: Dog paws were more often negative for Enterobacteriaceae compared to shoe soles (72% and 42%, respectively) and also had significantly lower bacterial counts (mean of 3.54log(10) and 5.03log(10) colony-forming units (CFUs), respectively; p < 0.05). This was most distinct in the comparison between PDs and their owners (3.75log(10) and 5.25log(10) CFUs; p < 0.05); the numbers were similar between ADs and their users (3.09log(10) and 4.58log(10) CFUs; p = 0.2). C. difficile was found on one (4%) AD user’s shoe soles. Moreover, 81% of AD users had been denied access with their current AD once or several times, the main reason being hygiene. The results of the visibly and invisibly disabled were significantly different. The number of AD users as opposed to the total number of hospital visitors was 0.03% in one hospital and is estimated to be 0.02% in the Netherlands. (5) Conclusions: The general hygiene of dogs’ paws is far better than that of shoe soles, mostly demonstrated by the better general hygiene of PD paws compared with their owners’ shoe soles; ADs and their users had comparable levels of general hygiene. In addition, the number of AD users amongst the total number of hospital visitors in the Netherlands is very limited. Thus, hygiene measures to reduce any contamination due to dog paws do not seem necessary.","Vos, S. Jasmijn; Wijnker, Joris J.; Overgaauw, Paul A.

Forming an integrative approach to thrombo-prophylaxis and coagulation treatment for COVID-19 patients ensues. We aim at reviewing the literature for anticoagulation in the setting of COVID-19 infection to provide a summary on anticoagulation for this patient population. COVID-19 infection is associated with a state of continuous inflammation, which results in macrophage activation syndrome and an increased rate of thrombosis. Risk assessment models to predict the risk of thrombosis in critically ill patients have not yet been validated. Currently published guidelines suggest the use of prophylactic intensity over intermediate intensity or therapeutic intensity anticoagulant for patients with critical illness or acute illness related to COVID-19 infection. Critically ill COVID-19 patients who are diagnosed with acute VTE are considered to have a provoking factor, and, therefore, treatment duration should be at least 3 months. Patients with proximal deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism should receive parenteral over oral anticoagulants with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux preferred over unfractionated heparin. In patients with impending hemodynamic compromise due to PE, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding, reperfusion may be necessary. Internists should remain updated on new emerging evidence regarding anticoagulation for COVID-19 patients. Awaiting these findings, we invite internists to perform individualized decisions that are unique for every patient and to base them on clinical judgment for risk assessment.","Kreidieh, Firas; Temraz, Sally",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595937/; https://doi.org/10.1177/10760296211039288,408

Through activation of the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), they induce expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins capable of suppressing viral replication and promoting viral clearance. Many highly pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade an IFN response and the balance between the robustness of the host immune response and viral antagonistic mechanisms determines whether or not the virus is cleared. Here, we discuss IFNs as broad-spectrum antivirals for treatment of acute virus infections. In particular, they are useful for treatment of re-emerging virus infections, where direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have limited utility due to DAA-resistant mutations, and for newly emerging virus strains in which the time to vaccine availability precludes vaccination at the onset of an outbreak.","Wang, Ben X.; Fish, Eleanor N.",Trends Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471490612000051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321608/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471490612000051; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2012.01.004,408

Rabies glycoprotein was also tough to express at sufficient level in soluble form in both E. coli and plant. The present work was aimed to over-express and purify this membrane protein from soluble extract of E. coli. Fusion of Small Ubiqutin like Modifier (SUMO) with rabies glycoprotein increased ~1.5 fold higher expression and ~3.0 fold solubility in comparison to non-fused in E. coli. The SUMO fusion also simplified the purification process. Previously engineered rabies glycoprotein gene in tobacco plants provides complete protection to mice, but the expression was very low for purification. Our finding demonstrated that the SUMO-fusion was useful for enhancing expression and solubility of the membrane protein and again proves to be a good alternative technology for applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.

However, CT is not only costly but also associated with an increased incidence of cancer, in particular for children. This study will question whether clinical symptoms and laboratory results can predict the CT outcomes for the pediatric patients with positive RT-PCR testing results in order to determine the necessity of CT for such a vulnerable group. Clinical data were collected from 244 consecutive pediatric patients (16 years of age and under) treated at Wuhan Children's Hospital with positive RT-PCR testing, and the chest CT were performed within 3 days of clinical data collection, from January 21 to March 8, 2020. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Wuhan Children's Hospital. Advanced decision tree based machine learning models were developed for the prediction of CT outcomes. Results have shown that age, lymphocyte, neutrophils, ferritin and C-reactive protein are the most related clinical indicators for predicting CT outcomes for pediatric patients with positive RT-PCR testing. Our decision support system has managed to achieve an AUC of 0.84 with 0.82 accuracy and 0.84 sensitivity for predicting CT outcomes.

Different types of convolutional architectures were used for feature extraction. The hybrid model (CNN-LSTM) hyperparameters were optimized using the Optuna framework. The best hybrid model was composed of an Xception pre-trained on ImageNet and an LSTM containing 512 units, configured with a dropout rate of 0.4, two fully connected layers containing 1024 neurons each, and a sequence of 20 frames in the input layer [Formula: see text]. The model presented an average accuracy of 93% and sensitivity of 97% for COVID-19, outperforming models based purely on spatial approaches.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the rate, timing, causes, predictors and outcomes of 30‐day readmission after COVID‐19 hospitalization. METHODS: From 13 March to 9 April 2020, all patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 and discharged alive were included in this retrospective observational study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of 30‐day readmission, and a restricted cubic spline function was utilized to assess the linearity of the association between continuous predictors and 30‐day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow‐up time of 62 days. The mean age of patients was 56.5 years, and 40.5% were women. At the end of the study, a total of 48 (4.5%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and a median time to readmission was 5 days. The most common primary diagnosis of 30‐day readmission was a hypoxic respiratory failure (68.8%) followed by thromboembolism (12.5%) and sepsis (6.3%). The patients with a peak serum creatinine level of ≥1.29 mg/dL during the index hospitalization, compared to those with a creatinine of <1.29 mg/dL, had 2.4 times increased risk of 30‐day readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.23–4.74). The mortality rate during the readmission was 22.9%. CONCLUSION: With 4.5% of the thirty‐day readmission rate, COVID‐19 survivors were readmitted early after hospital discharge, mainly due to morbidities of COVID‐19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred forty-eight patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis were recruited; their therapy was switched from BPs or NBPs to Zol or DMAb plus ELD (BP-Zol: 43, NBP-Zol: 32, BP-DMAb: 35, and NBP-DMAb: 38). Longitudinal changes in bone metabolic markers (P1NP and TRACP-5b) and BMD were evaluated. RESULTS: In the BP-Zol group, P1NP did not change after 6 months and increased by 38.9% after 12 months. TRACP-5b decreased 15.8% after 6 months, but came back to baseline values 12 months after administration. In the rest of the groups, the bone metabolic markers remained suppressed after 6 and 12 months. Compared with baseline, all groups showed increase in BMD after 6 and 12 months. Bone metabolic markers at baseline were correlated with %change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 12 months. P1NP and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels at baseline were identified as potential predictors of development of acute-phase reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of Zol or DMAb and ELD may increase BMD at 12 months after the first administration in Japanese patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, regardless of BPs pretreatment. Bone metabolic markers at baseline may be useful predictors for reaction to the therapy and side effects caused by these combination therapies in postmenopausal osteoporosis.","Nakamura, Yumejiro; Shimizu, Tomohiro; Asano, Tsuyoshi; Shimodan, Shun; Ishizu, Hotaka; Takahashi, Daisuke; Takahata, Masahiko; Iwasaki, Norimasa",J Bone Miner Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821302/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-021-01221-6,408

Convalescent plasma represents a promising COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report on the manufacturing of a plasma-based product containing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 obtained from recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma donors were screened as follows: 1) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by real-time PCR (RT-PCR)); 2) a subsequent negative PCR test followed by a 2-week waiting period; 3) an additional negative PCR test prior to plasmapheresis; and 4) confirmation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Convalescent plasma was stored fresh (2–6°C) for up to 5 days or frozen (-30°C) for long-term storage. Donor peripheral blood and final plasma product were assayed for binding antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and their titers measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We performed 72 plasmaphereses resulting in 248 final products. Convalescent plasma contained an RBD-specific antibody titer (IgG) ranging from 1:100 to 1:3200 (median 1:800). The titer was congruent to the titer of the blood (n = 34) before collection (1:100–1:6400, median 1:800). Levels of IL-8 and LBP of donors were slightly increased. Therapeutic products derived from a human origin must undergo rigorous testing to ensure uniform quality and patient safety. Whilst previous publications recommended RBD-specific binding antibody titers of ≥ 1:320, we selected a minimum titer of 1:800 in order to maximize antibody delivery. Production of highly standardized convalescent plasma was safe, feasible and was readily implemented in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Hähnel, Viola; Peterhoff, David; Bäuerlein, Veronika; Brosig, Andreas-Michael; Pamler, Irene; Johnson, Christian; Bica, Adelina; Totir, Monica; Ossner, Thomas; Stemmer, Barbara; Toelge, Martina; Schütz, Anja; Niller, Hans-Helmut; Schmidt, Barbara; Wagner, Ralf; Gessner, André; Burkhard, Ralph; Offner, Robert",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351831/,408

A cardinal pathogenetic feature of SS is B-cell hyperactivity, which has invited efforts on optimal B-cell targeted therapy, whereas conventional corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are restricted to symptomatic relief. As per the first EULAR recommendation for pSS patients published in 2020, regimens with monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells may be initiated in patients with severe, refractory systemic disease, notably rituximab (RTX), a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 antigen and contributes to B-cell depletion.

We found that RVS treatment significantly reduced viral replication when evaluated with green fluorescent protein- (GFP-) tagged virus (influenza A virus, A/PR/8/34-GFP) in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. RVS showed significant inhibition of neuraminidase from A/PR/8/34. Subsequently, three fractions were prepared from an ethanolic crude extract of RVS.

In related SARS-CoV-1, 3a is implicated in viral release, inflammasome activation, and cell death and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in animal models, suggesting 3a-targeted therapeutics could treat SARS and COVID-19. However, the structural basis for the function of 3a is unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-2 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in Alpha- and Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.","Kern, David M.; Sorum, Ben; Hoel, Christopher M.; Sridharan, Savitha; Remis, Jonathan P.; Toso, Daniel B.; Brohawn, Stephen G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.156554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587976/,408
632631,Attitudes of patients with severe mental illness towards COVID-19 vaccinations: A preliminary report from a public psychiatric hospital,2021-08-20,"Confronted by rapidly growing infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths, governments around the world have introduced stringent containment measures to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. This public health response has had an unprecedented impact on people’s daily lives which, unsurprisingly, has also had widely observed implications in terms of crime and public safety. Drawing upon theories from environmental criminology, this study examines officially recorded property crime rates between March and June 2020 as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute 6-month-ahead forecasts of property damage, shop theft, residential burglary, fraud, and motor vehicle theft rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March through to June. We conclude that, with the exception of fraud, all property offence categories declined significantly. For some offence types (shop stealing, other theft offences, and residential burglary), the decrease commenced as early as March. For other offence types, the decline was lagged and did not occur until April or May. Non-residential burglary was the only offence type to significantly increase, which it did in March, only to then decline significantly thereafter. These trends, while broadly consistent across the state’s 77 local government areas still varied in meaningful ways and we discuss possible explanations and implications.","Payne, Jason L.; Morgan, Anthony; Piquero, Alex R.",Crime Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-020-00136-3,408

633388,No Evidence for a Decrease in Physical Activity Among Swiss Office Workers During COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study,2021-02-11,"Modification of host-cell ionic content is a significant issue for viruses, as several viral proteins displaying ion channel activity, named viroporins, have been identified. Viroporins interact with different cellular membranes and self-assemble forming ion conductive pores. In general, these channels display mild ion selectivity, and, eventually, membrane lipids play key structural and functional roles in the pore. Viroporins stimulate virus production through different mechanisms, and ion channel conductivity has been proved particularly relevant in several cases. Key stages of the viral cycle such as virus uncoating, transport and maturation are ion-influenced processes in many viral species. Besides boosting virus propagation, viroporins have also been associated with pathogenesis. Linking pathogenesis either to the ion conductivity or to other functions of viroporins has been elusive for a long time. This article summarizes novel pathways leading to disease stimulated by viroporin ion conduction, such as inflammasome driven immunopathology.","Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Verdiá-Báguena, Carmina; Castaño-Rodriguez, Carlos; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Enjuanes, Luis",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151305/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7072786,408

The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of DEBs in a sample of Italian children and adolescents with T1D and in matched-pair healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 138 children and adolescents with T1D (aged 8.01–19.11 years, 65 boys) attending a Southern Italian diabetic service and 276 age- and gender-matched healthy peers voluntarily completed an online survey about eating behaviors (ChEAT and EAT-26), anthropometric characteristics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 8.69% (N = 12) of participants with T1D and 13.4% (N = 37) of controls had ChEAT/EAT-26 scores indicating presence of DEBs, with no differences between patients—whether children (total ChEAT score F(1, 157) = .104, p = .748) or adolescents (total EAT-26 score F(1, 255) = .135, p = .731)—and healthy peers. zBMI values were lower than those measured in the latest diabetes visit (p < .0001), while HbA1c values remained unchanged (p = .110). In both groups, adolescents had lower Oral Control scores than children (T1D: F(1, 138) = 20.411, p < .0001, η(2) = .132, controls: F(1, 276) = 18.271, p < .0001, η(2) = .063); additionally, gender (female) and age were found to be significant predictors of several ChEAT/EAT-26 scores. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggested that children and adolescents with T1D did not experience more DEB symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to healthy controls. Results revealed DEBs as more of a female adolescent developmental issue rather than a result of the challenges of living with a chronic illness under quarantine measures. Possible effects of parental pressure on their children’s eating behaviors in the context of home confinement and of using a non-diabetes-specific measure to assess DEBs are discussed.","Troncone, Alda; Chianese, Antonietta; Zanfardino, Angela; Cascella, Crescenzo; Piscopo, Alessia; Borriello, Anna; Rollato, Serena; Casaburo, Francesca; Testa, Veronica; Iafusco, Dario",J Eat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-020-00353-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292623/,408
634418,Professional roles and relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study among US clinicians,2021-03-25,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread worldwide since December 2019. To contain it, preventive measures including social distancing, economic shutdown, and school closures were introduced, carrying the risk of mental health burden in adults and children. Although the knowledge base regarding children's response to trauma and adverse events in general has broadened, descriptions of their mental health during epidemics remain scarce. In particular, the role of family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health are poorly understood. METHODS: We assessed the correlates of children’s emotional difficulties and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French community-based sample. Data came from 432 community-based parents (27–46 years, TEMPO cohort) and their children (mean age 6.8 ± 4.1) interviewed online. Children’s symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention were assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire during the 5th week of home confinement. Family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health and substance use were assessed weekly during the first 5 weeks of home confinement. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: 7.1% of children presented symptoms of emotional difficulties and 24.7% symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. Family financial difficulties and parental symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as children’s sleeping difficulties and screen time, were associated with the presence of psychological difficulties. CONCLUSION: Children's emotional and behavioural difficulties are associated with parental mental health and socioeconomic difficulties. In the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 epidemic, parents and professionals involved in caring for children should pay special attention to their mental health needs.","Moulin, Flore; El-Aarbaoui, Tarik; Bustamante, Joel José Herranz; Héron, Mégane; Mary-Krause, Murielle; Rouquette, Alexandra; Galéra, Cédric; Melchior, Maria",Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01752-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751230/,408

This study aimed to analyze the complete genome sequence, i.e., 11 genome segments of the lapine rotavirus (LRV) identified in the intestine of a dead rabbit in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to describe the genetic relationships between this lapine isolate [RVA/Rabbit-wt/KOR/Rab1404/2014/G3P[22] (Rab1404)] and other lapine isolates/strains. Rab1404 possessed the following genotype constellation: G3-P[22]-I2-R3-C3-M3-A9-N2-T3-E3-H3. The P[22] genotype was found to originate from rabbits and was for the first time identified in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rab1404 possessed VP1-3 and VP7 genes, which were closely related to those of the bat strain LZHP2; NSP1-4 genes, which were closely related to those of the simian strain RRV; and VP4, VP6, and NSP5 genes, which were closely related to the genes obtained from other rabbits. Interestingly, a close relationship between Rab1404 and simian RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] for 8 gene segments was observed. RRV is believed to be a reassortant between bovine-like RVA strain and canine/feline RVA strains. Rab1404 and canine/feline RVAs shared the genes encoding VP1, VP3, VP7, NSP3, and NSP4. Additionally, the genome segments VP6 (I2), NSP1 (N2), and NSP5 (H3) of Rab1404 were closely related to those of bovine RVAs. This is the first report describing the complete genome sequence of an LRV detected in the ROK. These results indicate that Rab1404 could be a result of interspecies transmission, possibly through multiple reassortment events in the strains of various animal species and the subsequent transmission of the virus to a rabbit. Additional studies are required to determine the evolutionary source and to identify possible reservoirs of RVAs in nature.","Oem, Jae-Ku; Lee, Soo-Young; Kim, Young-Sik; Na, Eun-Jee; Choi, Kyoung-Seong",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819301042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134819301042; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173932/,408

The replication strategy of coronaviruses involves recombination and mutation events that lead to the possibility of cross-species transmission. The high plasticity of the viral receptor due to a continuous modification of the host species habitat may be the cause of cross-species transmission that can turn into a threat to other species including the human population. The successive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in 2012, and the recent SARS-CoV-2 has incentivized a number of studies on the molecular basis of the coronavirus and its pathogenesis. The high degree of interrelatedness between humans and wild and domestic animals and the modification of animal habitats by human urbanization, has favored new viral spreads. Hence, knowledge on the main clinical signs of coronavirus infection in the different hosts and the distinctive molecular characteristics of each coronavirus is essential to prevent the emergence of new coronavirus diseases. The coronavirus infections routinely studied in veterinary medicine must be properly recognized and diagnosed not only to prevent animal disease but also to promote public health.","Colina, S.E.; Serena, M.S.; Echeverría, M.G.; Metz, G.E.",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221000897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705799/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221000897?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198382,408

AIM: In this study, we aimed to define the characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and their relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: The baseline peripheral lymphocyte subsets were compared between 55 healthy controls and 95 patients with confirmed COVID-19, and between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients with or without DM. RESULTS: The prevalence of DM in the COVID-19 group was 20%, and patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of DM than those with non-severe disease (P = 0.006). Moreover, a significantly poor prognosis and a higher rate of severity were found in those with DM relative to those without DM (P = 0.001, 0.003). Generally, all lymphocytes and subsets of lymphocytes, especially B and T cells, were significant reduced in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with DM. Patients with severe COVID-19 and DM had the lowest lymphocyte counts compared with those with severe COVID-19 without DM, and those with non-severe COVID-19 with or without DM. Partially decreased lymphocyte subsets, age and DM were closely related to disease progression and prognosis.

640691,Patients’ Habits and the Role of Pharmacists and Telemedicine as Elements of a Modern Health Care System during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-17,"The emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entails an urgent need for specific and sensitive high-throughput serological assays to assess SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We, therefore, aimed at developing a fluorescent-bead based SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay for detection of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a COVID-19 case cohort (n = 48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n = 85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. A sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86–100%) was achieved in COVID-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96–100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response.

However, detecting adventitious sounds outside medical facilities remains challenging. We assessed the feasibility of lung auscultation using the smartphone built-in microphone in real-world clinical practice. We recruited 134 patients (median[interquartile range] 16[11–22.25]y; 54% male; 31% cystic fibrosis, 29% other respiratory diseases, 28% asthma; 12% no respiratory diseases) at the Pediatrics and Pulmonology departments of a tertiary hospital. First, clinicians performed conventional auscultation with analog stethoscopes at 4 locations (trachea, right anterior chest, right and left lung bases), and documented any adventitious sounds. Then, smartphone auscultation was recorded twice in the same four locations. The recordings (n = 1060) were classified by two annotators. Seventy-three percent of recordings had quality (obtained in 92% of the participants), with the quality proportion being higher at the trachea (82%) and in the children’s group (75%). Adventitious sounds were present in only 35% of the participants and 14% of the recordings, which may have contributed to the fair agreement between conventional and smartphone auscultation (85%; k = 0.35(95% CI 0.26–0.44)). Our results show that smartphone auscultation was feasible, but further investigation is required to improve its agreement with conventional auscultation.","Ferreira-Cardoso, Henrique; Jácome, Cristina; Silva, Sónia; Amorim, Adelina; Redondo, Margarida T.; Fontoura-Matias, José; Vicente-Ferreira, Margarida; Vieira-Marques, Pedro; Valente, José; Almeida, Rute; Fonseca, João Almeida; Azevedo, Inês",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300670/,408

However, large emerging economies present significant regional heterogeneity that is usually uncounted for. This study uses the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and regional data on the 27 Brazilian states to investigate the growth-CO(2) nexus under distinct development stages. To perform this analysis, we divided the states into three groups according to their average annual GDP (i.e., richer, intermediate, and poorer regions). The results suggest that richer and poorer regions, particularly, present economic and demographic developments that are environmentally costly. Also, population and per capita GDP have the largest influences on CO(2) emissions. The roles of the industrial sector and the ascending service sector are also subject to criticism. Moreover, Brazil arguably suffers from technological stagnation as its energy intensity is growing and boosting CO(2) emissions. We discuss the policy implications of these findings and suggest a future research agenda.","Polloni-Silva, Eduardo; Silveira, Naijela; Ferraz, Diogo; de Mello, Diego Scarpa; Moralles, Herick Fernando",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993445/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14097-w,408

In this study, we have prepared the C(10)-C(18) set of benzoxonium-like salts to evaluate the effect of their chemical and biological decontamination capabilities. In particular, biocidal activity against a panel of bacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus in biofilm form was screened. In addition, the most promising compounds were successfully tested against Francisella tularensis as a representative of potential biological warfare agents. From a point of view of chemical warfare protection, the efficiency of BOC-like compounds to degrade the organophosphate simulant fenitrothion was examined. Notwithstanding that no single compound with universal effectiveness was identified, a mixture of only two compounds from this group would be able to satisfactorily cover the proposed decontamination spectrum. In addition, the compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity as a basic safety parameter for potential use in practice. In summary, the dual effect on chemical and biological agents of benzoxonium-like salts offer attractive potential as active components of decontamination mixtures in the case of a terrorist threat or chemical or biological accidents.","Markova, Aneta; Hympanova, Michaela; Matula, Marek; Prchal, Lukas; Sleha, Radek; Benkova, Marketa; Pulkrabkova, Lenka; Soukup, Ondrej; Krocova, Zuzana; Jun, Daniel; Marek, Jan",Toxics,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics9090222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564373/,408

The objective of our study was to characterize exposure risk factors for transmission and subsequent COVID positivity among the frontline healthcare workers in our institution during the pandemic period. Methods: The retrospective observational study conducted over a period of 6 months from June 2020 to November 2020 at a 1300-bedded South Indian tertiary care centre included frontline healthcare workers who were assessed for their identified encounter with COVID positive individual using a modified WHO COVID risk assessment tool. Results: Among a total of 4744 contacts with COVID positive individuals assessed for risk stratification during the study period , 942 (19.8%) were high risk and 3802 (80.2%) were low risk exposures respectively. 106 (2.2%) turned COVID positive during the surveillance period of 14 days. Frontline workers working in COVID areas had significant low COVID rates as compared to other areas (N=1, 0.9%). The average monthly COVID positivity rates being 1.66%, the attack rates among high risk and low risk contacts among the total HCWs screened were 5% (46/942) and 1.57% (60/3802) respectively. Shared space (70%) and IPC breaches (66%) were found to be highly prevalent in the COVID positive cohort, along with maskless encounters (43%) and multiple exposure (39%). The attack rate among the 6 identified COVID cluster groups (5.5%) were found to be higher than the attack rate (2.2%) noted among the total contacts screened and no significant association was observed between risk categories in the clusters. Discussion: Our study highlights higher risk of COVID positivity among high risk contacts as compared to low risk contacts. However, the high COVID positivity rate in low risk group among cluster transmissions and its lack of association with risk assessment highlight the suboptimal utility of the risk assessment strategy among cluster groups.","Moni, M.; Kulirankal, K.

However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g., use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post-decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration efficiency.","Hossain, Emroj; Bhadra, Satyanu; Jain, Harsh; Das, Soumen; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Ghosh, Shankar; Levine, Dov",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0023940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982134/,408

In this article, we take a model for the spread of an infectious disease in a single town and scale it up to simulate a region containing multiple towns. The model is validated by looking at how adding additional towns and commuters influences the outbreak in a single town. We then look at how the centrality of a town within a network influences the outbreak. Our main finding is that the commuters coming into a town have a greater effect on whether an outbreak will spread to a town than the commuters going out. The findings on centrality of a town and how it influences an outbreak could potentially be used to help influence future policy and intervention strategies such as school closure policies.","Hunter, Elizabeth; Mac Namee, Brian; Kelleher, John D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365775/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093119,408

METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6 × 10(–7)) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","Aamodt, Anne Hege; Høgestøl, Einar August; Popperud, Trine Haug; Holter, Jan Cato; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne Ma; Tonby, Kristian; Stiksrud, Birgitte; Quist-Paulsen, Else; Berge, Tone; Barratt-Due, Andreas; Aukrust, Pål; Heggelund, Lars; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Harbo, Hanne Flinstad",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743046/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10517-6,408

The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis, but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult. Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison with the existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.","Dev, Kapal; Khowaja, Sunder Ali; Bist, Ankur Singh; Saini, Vaibhav; Bhatia, Surbhi",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649695/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05641-9,408

In this study, we present an epidemiological framework and BSE investigation questionnaire to aid the investigation of suspect BSE cases, and illustrate its application during the investigation of a BSE case in Ireland in 2015. It is recommended that the framework and questionnaire are used concurrently: the framework provides structure and focus, whereas the questionnaire (with 135 questions) aids data collection. The framework focuses on confirmation and discrimination, estimating the date and location of exposure, and determining the method/source of exposure. The BSE case in Ireland in 2015 was a BARB case born in 2010. It was identified with classical BSE at an authorised knackery as part of Ireland’s targeted active surveillance programme for BSE.

For those infected thus far, there is a prevailing perspective that devising recognition for protective immunity will progressively allow segments of society to return to some functionality more than is existing. At this time, the best correlates with protection from natural coronavirus infections are systemic neutralizing antibody and mucosal IgA. Serum neutralizing antibody more easily fulfills the latter requisite, but current live virus methods for neutralization prevent large-scale application. It is conceivable that the exposure of previously infected individuals can allow for the definition of protective thresholds of neutralizing antibody. Thereafter, many other antibody assays will be able to screen for surrogate protection after correlations with protective neutralizing antibody are made. Specificity of common antibody tests would benefit from confirmatory blocking systems or confirmatory immunoblotting fingerprints with well-defined antigen(s).

The human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently recognized parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions. OBJECTIVES: To define the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in adult and pediatric patients with evidence of HBoV. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2005 through October 2006, we screened respiratory samples from children and adults negative for common respiratory pathogens for HBoV by PCR. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records of HBoV positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 2075 samples screened, 1826 (88.0%) represented distinct respiratory events: 1539 (84.3%) were pediatric (<18 years), and 273 (15.0%) adult (≥18 years). Forty (2.2%) patients had HBoV: 36 (2.3%) children and 4 (1.5%) adults. HBoV positive children had history of prematurity (31.3%) and cardiac disease (18.8%). Adults had underlying pulmonary (100%) and cardiac (50%) disease. Twenty-seven children (84.4%) were hospitalized; 9 (28.1%) required intensive care. All adults were hospitalized; none required intensive care. Nosocomial acquisition likely occurred in 3 patients.

The frequent handwashing and use of sanitizers resulted in notable skin changes among some individuals. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of the new onset of dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic in a university population from Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered online questionnaire by sending an invitation link to students and employees of Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University in June 2020. A chi-squared test was used to note differences regarding hand and face dermatitis. RESULTS: Of the total 2356 participants, 34.8% reported skin changes or symptoms over hands, and 15.3% reported skin changes on their face during this pandemic. 88.7% of the participants reported a change in handwashing habits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62.2% of participants were not using any hand sanitizers before COVID-19 but began using them during the pandemic. There were significantly higher percentage of skin conditions in females (on hands (ScH): 42.6% and face (ScF):19.2%), individuals working in environments requiring frequent handwashing (ScH: 40.3% vs. ScF: 17.2%), those working in facilities where they have to interact with people during the pandemic (ScH: 41.1% vs. ScF: 18.7%), those encountering COVID-19 patients (ScH: 48.6% vs. ScF: 24.8%), those exposed to chemicals (ScH: 48.6% vs. ScF: 24.8%), and healthcare workers (ScH: 51.3% vs. ScF: 24.3%). CONCLUSION: It was found that during the pandemic, skin changes were common among the general population as well as among healthcare workers. The frequency of handwashing and the use of alcohol-based sanitizers were contributing factors for dermatitis.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids, commonly utilized antiinflammatory agents, to treat COVID-19-induced CRS is controversial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-induced CRS, compare the CRS in COVID-19 with that in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and summarize the existing therapies for CRS. We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application.","Liu, Bingwen; Li, Min; Zhou, Zhiguang; Guan, Xuan; Xiang, Yufei",J Autoimmun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841120300676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291137/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841120300676?v=s5,408

We have previously shown that inhibiting Wnt/β‐catenin pathway reduces IAV infection. In this study, we aimed to identify antiviral human microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway. Using a miRNA expression library, we identified 85 miRNAs that up‐regulated and 20 miRNAs that down‐regulated the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway. Fifteen miRNAs were validated to up‐regulate and five miRNAs to down‐regulate the pathway. Overexpression of four selected miRNAs (miR‐193b, miR‐548f‐1, miR‐1‐1, and miR‐509‐1) that down‐regulated the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway reduced viral mRNA, protein levels in A/PR/8/34‐infected HEK293 cells, and progeny virus production. Overexpression of miR‐193b in lung epithelial A549 cells also resulted in decreases of A/PR/8/34 infection. Furthermore, miR‐193b inhibited the replication of various strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/33, A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and H3N2 (A/Oklahoma/309/2006), as determined by a viral reporter luciferase assay. Further studies revealed that β‐catenin was a target of miR‐193b, and β‐catenin rescued miR‐193b‐mediated suppression of IAV infection. miR‐193b induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and delayed vRNP nuclear import. Finally, adenovirus‐mediated gene transfer of miR‐193b to the lung reduced viral load in mice challenged by a sublethal dose of A/PR/8/34. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR‐193b represses IAV infection by inhibiting Wnt/β‐catenin signalling.","Yang, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Chunling; Bamunuarachchi, Gayan; Wang, Yang; Liang, Yurong; Huang, Chaoqun; Zhu, Zhengyu; Xu, Dao; Lin, Kong; Senavirathna, Lakmini Kumari; Xu, Lan; Liu, Lin",Cell Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.13001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650225/,408

Currently there is no recognized practical procedure which will accurately differentiate infections with these strains. Using SDAV- and PRC-infected L-2 cells as the source of antigen, and sera from rats collected post inoculation with either of these viral strains, the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) procedure was used to determine whether antibody titers could be used to differentiate infections from the homologous and heterologous virus. There was no detectable difference in the sensitivity or specificity of these systems in detecting antibody to the homologous or heterologous virus. Thus there was no evidence that SDAV- and PRC-infected cells would serve to differentiate antibody to the homologous virus using the IFA technique. In addition, antibody titers were similar when mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells were used as the source of antigen for the IFA technique. However, using MHV or SDAV-infected cells as the source of antigen, there was a significant difference in antibody titers to the homologous virus detected using the immunoenzyme technique.","Percy, D.

Iatrogenic injury from endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy insertion is the most common cause of LTS. We present the first reported experience of managing a patient diagnosed with subglottic stenosis (a subtype of LTS) following previous intubation and tracheostomy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This patient required an urgent surgical tracheostomy and subsequent referral to a tertiary airway surgery unit for definitive treatment, which included microlaryngoscopy, laser excision and balloon dilatation. This case highlights that LTS should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients re-presenting with breathing difficulties after prolonged intubation or tracheostomy for COVID-19. Furthermore, it raises the concern of a rise in the incidence of this condition and an increased burden on the few units specializing in airway surgery.","Vasanthan, Rishi; Sorooshian, Parviz; Sri Shanmuganathan, Vishnu; Al-Hashim, Muhannad",J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33505658/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaa569,408

El establecimiento de prioridades está siempre presente en los sistemas sanitarios y depende de la teoría de justicia aplicable en cada sociedad. El racionamiento de recursos ha sido necesario en la pandemia por COVID-19, por lo que se han publicado documentos de consenso para la toma de decisiones sustentadas en cuatro valores éticos fundamentales: maximización de los beneficios, tratar a las personas igualmente, contribuir en la creación de valor social y dar prioridad a la situación más grave. De ellos derivan recomendaciones específicas: maximizar beneficios; priorizar a los trabajadores de la salud; no priorizar la asistencia por orden de llegada; ser sensible a la evidencia científica; reconocer la participación en la investigación y aplicar los mismos principios a los pacientes COVID-19 que a los no-COVID-19. Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has raised ethical and medico-legal problems, which include the equitable allocation of health resources, especially in relation to the prioritization of patients and the rationing of resources. Priority setting is always present in healthcare systems and depends on the theory of justice applicable in each society. Resource rationing has been necessary in the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore consensus documents have been published for decision-making based on four fundamental ethical values: maximization of benefits, treating people equally, contributing to creating social value and giving priority to the worst off, from which specific recommendations derive: maximize benefits; prioritize health workers; do not prioritize attendance on a first-come, first-served basis; be sensitive to scientific evidence; recognize participation in research and apply the same principles to COVID-19 patients as to non-COVID-19 patients.","Martin-Fumadó, Carles; Gómez-Durán, Esperanza L.; Morlans-Molina, Màrius",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377473220300249?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377473220300249,408

METHOD: Cross-sectional study of both states in the US and counties in NY state. RESULTS: Population density was found to be significantly associated with state-level coronavirus infection and mortality rate (b = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34, 0.64, P < .0001). States that have lower socioeconomic status, lower mean age and denser populations are associated with higher incidence rates. In regard to NY state, counties with a higher percentage of minority residents had higher COVID-19 mortality rates (b = 2.61, 95% CI: 0.36, 4.87, P = 0.023). Larger population cohorts were associated with lower COVID-19 mortality rates after adjusting for other variables in the model (b = −1.39, 95% CI: −2.07, −0.71, P < 0.001). Population density was not significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality rates after adjustment across counties in the NY state. Public ridership was not indicative of cases or mortality across states in the USA; however, it is a significant factor associated with incidence (but not mortality) in NY counties. CONCLUSION: Population density was the only significant predictor of mortality across states in the USA. Lower mean age, lower median household incomes and more densely populated states were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Population density was not found to be a significant independent variable compared to minority status and socioeconomic factors in the New York epicenter. Meanwhile, public ridership was found to be a significant factor associated with incidence in New York counties.","Pekmezaris, Renee; Zhu, Xu; Hentz, Roland; Lesser, Martin L; Wang, Jason J; Jelavic, Matthew",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142150/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab191,408

Available evidence supports a number of potential pathophysiological pathways through which acute kidney injury (AKI) can develop in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Histopathological findings have highlighted both similarities and differences between AKI in patients with COVID-19 and in those with AKI in non-COVID-related sepsis. Acute tubular injury is common, although it is often mild, despite markedly reduced kidney function. Systemic haemodynamic instability very likely contributes to tubular injury. Despite descriptions of COVID-19 as a cytokine storm syndrome, levels of circulating cytokines are often lower in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with causes other than COVID-19. Tissue inflammation and local immune cell infiltration have been repeatedly observed and might have a critical role in kidney injury, as might endothelial injury and microvascular thrombi. Findings of high viral load in patients who have died with AKI suggest a contribution of viral invasion in the kidneys, although the issue of renal tropism remains controversial. An impaired type I interferon response has also been reported in patients with severe COVID-19. In light of these observations, the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19-associated AKI may provide insights into therapeutic strategies.","Legrand, Matthieu; Bell, Samira; Forni, Lui; Joannidis, Michael; Koyner, Jay L.; Liu, Kathleen; Cantaluppi, Vincenzo",Nat Rev Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-021-00452-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226718/,408

Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently.

Methods We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and flow cytometric analysis of NK cells from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 at multiple time points in the course of the disease using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results In RNA-seq analysis, the NK cells exhibited distinctive features compared to healthy donors, with significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Intriguingly, we found that the unconventional CD56dimCD16neg (uCD56dim) NK cell population expanded in cryopreserved PBMCs from COVID-19 patients regardless of disease severity, accompanied by decreased NK cell cytotoxicity. The NK cell population was rapidly normalized alongside the disappearance of uCD56dim NK cells and the recovery of NK cell cytotoxicity in mild COVID-19 patients, but this occurred slowly in severe COVID-19 patients.

The nucleo-protein core of this coronavirus, which contains RNA of positive polarity and is helical in configuration, becomes incorporated into enveloped particles in the same manner as the nucleocapsids of the orthomyxo- and paramyxoviruses. However, JHM virus is assembled intracellularly by budding at surfaces of smooth membranous vacuoles. A comparison of JHMvirus replication in L2 and 17C1-1 cell lines revealed that L2 cells undergo more rapid cytopathology and cease virus production much sooner than 17C1-1 cells. In L2 cells the accumulation of core material appears to continue after the abrupt cessation of virus assembly. This is evident by the massive cytoplasmic accumulation of structures resembling nucleocapsids, which react with hybridoma antibody to the nucleocapsid antigen as demonstrated by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The current findings are consistent with our previously published demonstration, using cells of neural and other deviation, of the fundamental role of the host cell type in regulating the replication and expression of coronaviruses.","Massalski, Andrew; Coulter-Mackie, Marion; Knobler, Robert L.; Buchmeier, Michael J.; Dales, Samuel",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6292128/,408

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians. Methods IRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020. Findings From an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts. Interpretation Many resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.

The results were compaired with the datas obtained from the primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma and metastasis. The tumor cells of the metastasis and of the xenograft showed all morphological criteria of a non-ceratinizing squamous epithelial carcinoma of undifferentiated type. The ultrastructural criteria of the human NPC-tumor cells were all present including cytoplasmic deposits of Corona viruses and Herpes virus-like particles within the nuclei and the cytoplasm.,"Arnold, W.; Huth, F.; Lindenberger, J.; Vosteen, K.

660993,Psychological Distress and Its Association With Quality of Life in Organ Transplant Recipients During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-24,"Summary Increasing levels of obesity, arising from energy-rich diets and sedentary lifestyles, are driving a global pandemic of type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide is set to increase from its present level of 150 million, to 225 million by the end of the decade and to as many as 300 million by 2025. Shocking as they are, these figures represent only clinically diagnosed diabetes, and many more cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, up to one-quarter of western populations have impaired glucose tolerance or the dysmetabolic syndrome, which are considered to represent pre-diabetic states. Type 2 diabetes is appearing increasingly in children and adolescents, and the frequency of diagnosis of paediatric type 2 diabetes is outstripping that of type 1 diabetes in some areas. The long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes carries a crushing burden of morbidity and mortality, and most type 2 diabetic patients die prematurely from a cardiovascular event. Diabetic patients are more than twice as costly to manage as non-diabetic patients, due mainly to the high costs associated with management of diabetic complications. Indeed, diabetes care already accounts for about 2-7% of the total national health care budgets of western European countries. Controlling the type 2 diabetes epidemic will require changes to the structure of healthcare delivery. Well-resourced interventions will be required, with effective co-ordination between all levels of government, health care agencies, multidisciplinary health care teams, professional organisations, and patient advocacy groups. Above all, intervention is needed today.","Zimmet, P.",Diabetes & Metabolism,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363603727839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14502096/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363603727839,408

Currently, an important percentage of patients in haemodialysis are elderly. Herein, we investigated the impact of age on mortality among haemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Data was obtained from the Spanish COVID-19 chronic kidney disease (CKD) Working Group Registry. From 18 March 2020 to 27 August 2020, 930 patients on haemodialysis affected by COVID-19 were included in the Registry. A total of 254 patients were under 65 years old and 676 were 65 years or older (elderly group). Mortality was 25.1% higher (95% CI: 22.2–28.0%) in the elderly as compared to the non-elderly group. Death from COVID-19 was increased 6.2-fold in haemodialysis patients as compared to the mortality in the general population in a similar time frame. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95% CI: 1.31–1.93), dyspnea at presentation (HR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.11–2.04), pneumonia (HR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.10–2.73) and admission to hospital (HR 4.00, 95% CI: 1.83–8.70) were identified as independent mortality risk factors in the elderly haemodialysis population. Treatment with glucocorticoids reduced the risk of death (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.96). In conclusion, mortality is dramatically increased in elderly haemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest that this high risk population should be prioritized in terms of protection and vaccination.","Vergara, Ander; Molina-Van den Bosch, Mireia; Toapanta, Néstor; Villegas, Andrés; Sánchez-Cámara, Luis; de Sequera, Patricia; Manrique, Joaquín; Shabaka, Amir; Aragoncillo, Inés; Ruiz, María Carmen; Benito, Silvia; Sánchez, Emilio; Soler, María José",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300188/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10143022,408

Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-λ), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN-λ (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. METHODS: Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN-λ levels by ELISA. To study the IFN-λ response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN-λ on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN-λ in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN-λ inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISG’s peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-λ1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence described here suggests that IFN-λ is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN- λ need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease. Furthermore, we report a novel epithelial model to study dengue infection in vitro.","Palma-Ocampo, Helen K.; Flores-Alonso, Juan C.; Vallejo-Ruiz, Verónica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Flores-Mendoza, Lilian; Herrera-Camacho, Irma; Rosas-Murrieta, Nora H.; Santos-López, Gerardo",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26411318/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0383-4,408

To better understand the state of RBM implementation across the clinical trial industry, the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) conducted a landscape survey among its member companies across 6,513 clinical trials ongoing at the end of 2019. Of these trials, 22% included at least 1 of the 5 RBM components: key risk indicators (KRIs), centralized monitoring, off-site/remote-site monitoring, reduced source data verification (SDV), and reduced source document review (SDR). The implementation rates for the individual RBM components ranged 8%–19%, with the most frequently implemented component being centralized monitoring and the least frequently implemented being reduced SDR. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, additional data were collected to assess its impact on trial monitoring, focusing specifically on trials switching from on-site monitoring to off-site/remote-site monitoring. These mid-pandemic data show that the vast majority of monitoring visits were on-site in February 2020, but an even higher percentage were off-site in April, corresponding with the first peak of the pandemic. Despite this shift, similar numbers of non-COVID-related protocol deviations were detected from February through June, suggesting little or no reduction in monitoring effectiveness. The pre- and mid-pandemic data provide two very different snapshots of RBM implementation, but both support the need to promote adoption of this approach while also highlighting an opportunity to capitalize on the recent shift toward greater RBM uptake in a post-pandemic environment.","Barnes, Brian; Stansbury, Nicole; Brown, Debby; Garson, Lauren; Gerard, Geoff; Piccoli, Nickolas; Jendrasek, Debra; May, Nick; Castillo, Vanesa; Adelfio, Anina; Ramirez, Nycole; McSweeney, Andrea; Berlien, Ruth; Butler, Paula Jo",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914298/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-021-00295-8,408
662554,P211 Changes in sexual behavior during COVID-19 among men who have sex with men in a sexual network study,2021,"In vivo and ex vivo models of reoviral encephalitis were utilized to delineate the contribution of type I interferon (IFN) to the host’s defense against local central nervous system (CNS) viral infection and systemic viral spread. Following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation with either serotype 3 (T3) or serotype 1 (T1) reovirus, increased expression of IFN-α, IFN-β, and myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx1; a prototypical IFN stimulated gene) was observed in mouse brain tissue. Type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR(−/−)) had accelerated lethality, compared to wildtype (B6wt) controls, following i.c. T1 or T3 challenge. Although viral titers in the brain and eyes of reovirus infected IFNAR(−/−) mice were significantly increased, these mice did not develop neurologic signs or brain injury. In contrast, increased reovirus titers in peripheral tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and blood) of IFNAR(−/−) mice were associated with severe intestinal and liver injury. These results suggest that reovirus-infected IFNAR(−/−) mice succumb to peripheral disease rather than encephalitis per se. To investigate the potential role of type I IFN in brain tissue, brain slice cultures (BSCs) were prepared from IFNAR(−/−) mice and B6wt controls for ex vivo T3 reovirus infection. Compared to B6wt controls, reoviral replication and virus-induced apoptosis were enhanced in IFNAR(−/−) BSCs indicating that a type I IFN response, initiated by resident CNS cells, mediates innate viral immunity within the brain. T3 reovirus tropism was extended in IFNAR(−/−) brains to include dentate neurons, ependymal cells, and meningeal cells indicating that reovirus tropism within the CNS is dependent upon type I interferon signaling.","Dionne, Kalen R.; Galvin, John M.; Schittone, Stephanie A.; Clarke, Penny; Tyler, Kenneth L.",Journal of NeuroVirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671121/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-011-0038-1; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3163031?pdf=render,408

Art is a highly engaging tool that promotes positive well-being and increases community engagement and participation. The ‘Create Hope Mural’ campaign emerged as an arts-based health promotion response to inspire dialogue on why hope is so important for Canadians during these challenging times. This initiative is a partnership between a health promotion network based in Vancouver and an ‘open air’ art museum based in Toronto. Families were invited to submit artwork online that represents the concept of hope. This paper discusses the reflections of organizers of this arts-based health promotion initiative during the early months of the pandemic in Canada. Our findings reveal the importance of decolonizing practices, centring the voices of those impacted by crisis, while being attentive to the social and political context.

663325,COVID-19-Related French Lockdown: Impact on the Physical and Psychological Health of Older Adults,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a global public health problem. For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. METHODS: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs’ knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal–Wallis test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Kruskal–Wallis test revealed no difference in mean knowledge, attitude, or practice scores between nurses/ doctors or the genders. There was a significant difference in knowledge score and practice scores between the Intensive care unit & the Paediatric ward /infection control department with the maximum scores in knowledge and practice among participants from the intensive care unit. Logistic regression analysis for dependent variables (knowledge and attitude) and independent variables like age, gender, designation, and departments was not significant. The qualitative data yielded four themes: knowledge of HAI and infection control, infection control measures in practice, a shortfall in infection control measures and HAI, and required implementation. Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) revealed lapses in handwashing practice and proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially surgical masks. CONCLUSION: Early introduction of training programmes in medical and nursing schools and video demonstrations of appropriate infection control practices during sterile procedures would be highly beneficial to HCWs. A possible reason for the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in this part of Saudi Arabia could be a lapse in PPE usage. Intensive training programs for all the HCWs, strict vigilant protocols, and a willingness to change behaviour and practice, will significantly benefit the spread of outbreaks.","Paul, Esther; Alzaydani Asiri, Ibrahim A.; Al-Hakami, Ahmed; Chandramoorthy, Harish C.; Alshehri, Sarah; Beynon, C.

While anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia have been identified as highly prevalent symptoms, there are wide geographic variations, necessitating the regional evaluation of the prevalence of the symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (over 18 years old) who underwent COVID-19 tests at an ambulatory assessment centre. We identified 1,345 patients (102 positive and 1,243 negative) who visited the assessment centre between March 16 and April 15, 2020. We randomly sampled negative patients in a 1:3 ratio. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between COVID-19 positivity and loss of smell and taste. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 102 (50%) positive patients and 72 of 306 (23.5%) negative patients completed the survey. Anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia were more prevalent among COVID-19 positive patients (41.1% v. 4.2%, p < 0.001 for smell and 46.4% v. 5.6%, p < 0.001 for taste). Anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia were independently highly associated with COVID-19 positivity (adjusted odds ratios 14.4 and 11.4 for smell and taste, respectively). CONCLUSION: In this Canadian study, smell and taste loss may be key symptoms of COVID-19.

So far, China has successfully controlled transmission of COVID-19 through implementing stringent preventive measures. In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of preventive measures taken in thirteen regions of China based on the feedback provided by 1135 international students studying in China. The study uses factor analysis combined with varimax rotation of variables. It was found that awareness raising and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding trust and adapting measures remained significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector are imperative. The findings of this study revealed that trust, students’ health, waste disposal, and the efforts of the Chinese government/international institute of education to prevent this pandemic were significantly and positively associated with preventive measures. The results showed that prior knowledge, global pandemics, and food and grocery purchases were firmly related to the preventive measures of COVID-19. Moreover, anxiety, transportation, and economic status were negatively related to the preventive measures. During this epidemic situation, international students suffered various types of mental stresses and anxiety, especially living in most affected regions of China.

There are currently no studies in Colombia that describe the disease’s clinical and treatment aspects in detail. OBJECTIVE: Describe the characteristics and clinical management of a group of admitted patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a private clinic in Montería, Córdoba-Colombia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive observational study was carried out between May and August 2020 in 209 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Upon admittance, clinical, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and complications were analyzed. Additionally, the effect of the following medications was described: 1—antibiotics (cefepime, piperacillin, tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin) + low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) + corticosteroids (dexamethasone–methylprednisolone) + colchicine. 2— Antibiotic + LMWH + corticosteroids. 3—LMWH + corticosteroids. 4—LMWH + corticosteroids + colchicine. 5—Other treatments (Tocilizumab). RESULTS: 107 (51%) of the 209 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 passed away. The main comorbidities related to mortality of these hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were obesity and kidney disease (P < 0.05). The main complications associated with fatal outcomes in this group of patients were Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, it was evidenced that the colchicine combination showed a significant difference in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients compared to the other therapeutic regimens (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A mortality rate of 51% was found attributable to several factors such as advanced age, obesity, kidney disease, and an average time in days of late consultation. The implementation of the colchicine combination could reduce the mortality rate in this disease.","García-Posada, Mara; Aruachan-Vesga, Sandra; Mestra, Danis; Humánez, Katherine; Serrano-Coll, Héctor; Cabrales, Heriberto; Faccini, Álvaro; Mattar, Salim",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121000575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020208/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121000575?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.02.013,408

Caloric restriction and subsequent weight loss have been associated with both improvements and, in some cases, remission of T2D. AIM: To systematically review the safety and effectiveness of calorie‐restricted diets on weight change and the remission of T2D. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched. Intervention trials including a calorie restriction, published between 2010 and 2020, evaluating the remission of T2D (HbA1c <6.5% without diabetes medication) were selected. Risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: Eight trials met inclusion criteria including four randomized controlled and four single‐arm trials. Three controlled trials found greater remission in the calorie‐restricted arm (p < 0.05). A recent diagnosis of diabetes was associated with higher remission rates (75%–80%) with an inverse association between duration of diabetes and rate of remission (r = −0.94). A higher level of remission was observed with greater calorie restriction in non‐new diagnosis studies. Greater weight loss was associated with increasing rates of remission (r = 0.83). No reported adverse events led to withdrawal from trials. There was great heterogeneity in study design. CONCLUSION: Remission rate of T2D achieved through calorie restriction is high and similar to that reported in the bariatric surgery literature. Remission should be the aim at diagnosis and calorie restriction could be used to achieve this. The target weight loss should be >10% body weight in people with obesity. More research is needed into the optimum level of calorie restriction and the support required for long‐term remission. National guidelines should be updated to reflect recent evidence.","Jacob, Elizabeth; Avery, Amanda",Obes Sci Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631138/; https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.504,408

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the evolution dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed over the last three months (up to 3/22/2020) in China. The model results revealed that 1) the transmission, infection and recovery dynamics follow the integral-order SEIR model with significant spatiotemporal variations in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China, and 2) the evolution of number of deaths follows the time FDE, likely due to the time memory in the death toll. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. In addition, a time FDE model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the FDE model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread. Therefore, caution is needed when applying FDEs to model the coronavirus outbreak, since specific COVID-19 kinetics may not exhibit nonlocal behavior. Particularly, the spread of COVID-19 may be affected by the rapid improvement of health care systems which may remove the memory impact in COVID-19 dynamics (resulting in a short-tailed recovery curve), while the death toll and mitigation of COVID-19 can be captured by the time FDEs due to the nonlocal, memory impact in fatality and human activities.","Zhang, Yong; Yu, Xiangnan; Sun, HongGuang; Tick, Geoffrey R.; Wei, Wei; Jin, Bin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834580/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303581; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303581?v=s5,408

The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the CRP level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p < 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration. CONCLUSIONS: The level of plasma CRP was positively correlated to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings could assist to discern patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from the mild ones. Our findings may be useful as an earlier indicator for severe illness and help physicians to stratify patients for intense care unit transfer.","Chen, Wei; Zheng, Kenneth I.; Liu, Saiduo; Yan, Zhihan; Xu, Chongyong; Qiao, Zengpei",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414383/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12941-020-00362-2,408

Several governments of the world have decided to take drastic actions in order to combat the spread of the disease, including the closing of air, maritime and land borders, as an extreme measure of isolation of each country/region. However, such measures had not prevented the disease from spreading globally; as COVID-19 has already spread in almost all countries. This virus's main victims are the healthcare personnel (HCP), who are physically and psychologically affected. The HCP serves as the first line of defense against this pandemic, what if we faced a significant loss in their number? And what if our HCP was going through a deep dark depression? The condition would be terrifying not only for now but also in the future. This raises the need for an intensified International collaboration, that mainly supports the HCP. We are throwing by challenging moments, and it is clear that social distancing, cooperation, hygiene awareness and abide by the recommendation and help of all governments, as well as obtaining the support of international organizations could be an excellent tool for preventing an increase in the number of cases, principally in countries and regions were COVID-19 is in the early stage of the epidemic. However, this is not the final solution for the current pandemic.

668705,Eye health in older people at the time of corona,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the impact of tocilizumab use on severe COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pneumonia mortality. METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by inverse probability of the treatment weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab's effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48 h following inclusion was analysed. RESULTS: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days [interquartile range (IQR) 8–14]. Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls: 16.8% versus 31.5%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.514 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.355–0.744], p < 0.001; weighted HR 0.741 (95% CI 0.619–0.887), p = 0.001. Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment [relative risk reduction (RRR) 46.7%]. We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in those treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone [10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 (95% CI 0.352–0.741), p = 0.036; weighted HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.449–0.804), p < 0.001] (interaction p = 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in those treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated and that tocilizumab's effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated patients with COVID-19 during the first 48 h of presenting with respiratory failure despite oxygen therapy.

Interrupting the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may reduce the incidence of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). Herein we provide a protocol for a cluster randomized trial that will examine the effectiveness of treatment with interferon (IFN) ß-1a compared to standard of care in limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Co-primary objectives are to determine whether IFN therapy reduces (a) the proportion of infected cases shedding SARS-CoV-2 at day 11 post randomization and (b) the incidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from index cases to treatment-eligible household post-exposure contacts at day 11 after randomization. Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of IFN treatment on duration of viral clearance, hospitalizations and fatalities, and evaluating the safety of IFN treatment. METHODS: Three hundred and ten households, each including an index case with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one asymptomatic treatment-eligible household contact, will be randomized to receive 3 doses of 125 μg IFN ß-1a by subcutaneous administration (days 1, 6, and 11), or standard of care. All participants will be followed until day 29. DISCUSSION: The results from this trial will identify whether IFN ß treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 cases accelerates viral clearance and prevents disease progression and whether IFN ß treatment of post-exposure contacts of COVID-19 cases reduces transmission of infection.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human norovirus surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r(2) = 0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D(90) – dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21.5 and 28 J/m(2), respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m(2) obtained from published experimental data for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D(90) of 21 J/m(2) close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D(90) values of 69.1, 89, and 77.6 J/m(2) for genogroups GI, GII, and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D(90) = 100 J/m(2) was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential non-pathogenic (to humans) surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","Pendyala, Brahmaiah; Patras, Ankit; Pokharel, Bharat; D’Souza, Doris",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133042/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.572331,408
670004,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece",2020-11-02,"Microplastics (MPs) are distributed in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems throughout the planet. They are known to adsorb hazardous substances and can transfer them across the trophic web. To eliminate MPs pollution in an environmentally friendly process, we propose using a photocatalytic process that can easily be implemented in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As photocatalysis involves the formation of reactive species such as holes (h(+)), electrons (e(−)), hydroxyl (OH(●)), and superoxide ion (O(2)(●−)) radicals, it is imperative to determine the role of those species in the degradation process to design an effective photocatalytic system. However, for MPs, this information is limited in the literature. Therefore, we present such reactive species’ role in the degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MPs using C,N-TiO(2). Tert-butanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), Tiron, and Cu(NO(3))(2) were confirmed as adequate OH(●), h(+), O(2)(●−) and e(−) scavengers. These results revealed for the first time that the formation of free OH(●) through the pathways involving the photogenerated e(−) plays an essential role in the MPs’ degradation. Furthermore, the degradation behaviors observed when h(+) and O(2)(●−) were removed from the reaction system suggest that these species can also perform the initiating step of degradation.","Vital-Grappin, Aranza Denisse; Ariza-Tarazona, Maria Camila; Luna-Hernández, Valeria Montserrat; Villarreal-Chiu, Juan Francisco; Hernández-López, Juan Manuel; Siligardi, Cristina; Cedillo-González, Erika Iveth",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805116/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13070999,408

To mitigate viral escape, we developed a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting epitopes located on different domains of spike (S) protein. Screening of a library of monoclonal antibodies generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 convalescent patients yielded potent NAbs, targeting N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD domain of S, effective at nM concentrations. Remarkably, combination of RBD-targeting NAbs and NTD-binding NAb, FC05, dramatically enhanced the neutralization potency in cell-based assays and animal model. Results of competitive SPR assays and cryo-EM structures of Fabs bound to S unveil determinants of immunogenicity. Combinations of immunogens, identified in NTD and RBD of S, when immunized in rabbits elicited potent protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

The most relevant antiviral activities of Qx are related to its ability to raise pH in acidic organelles, diminishing viral enzymatic activity for viral cell entry, and its ability to bind to viral DNA and RNA. Moreover, Qx has been used as an immunomodulator in cutaneous lupus erythematosus and various rheumatological diseases, by inhibiting phospholipase A2 modulating the Th1/Th2 response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential antiviral effect of Qx against denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of Qx in Vero E6 cells was determined by the MTT assay. Afterwards, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at different multiplicities of infections (MOIs) of 0.1 and 0.01 in the presence of Qx (0–30 µM) to determinate the half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)). After 48 h, the effect of Qx against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by viral cytotoxicity and viral copy numbers, the last were determined by digital real-time RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR).

Currently, there is neither a licensed vaccine nor effective treatment, characterizing an unmet clinical need. The IgY refers to the egg yolk immunoglobulin (Y = yolk) and its production and use are subjects of many studies due to the diversity of its diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Several researchers have shown that the use of specific IgY may prevent and/or control infectious and parasitic diseases. Based on these evidences, the aim of this study was to immunize chickens with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi in order to produce highly effective and pure antibodies (IgY), as well as extract, characterize, quantify, and verify cytotoxic effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi. After the induction of IgY production by chickens, the eggs were collected and the IgY was extracted by method of precipitation of polyethylene glycol 6000. The IgY anti-T. cruzi characterization was performed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western-blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, the cytotoxic or proliferative effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi was verified by MTT assay. The concentration of IgY in yolk was 8.41 ± 1.47 mg/mL. The characterization of IgY reveled bands of stained peptides with molecular weight between 75 and 50 kDa and 37 and 25 kDa. In the ELISA test was observed that there was antigen-antibody reaction throughout the sample period. The concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mg/mL of IgY anti-T. cruzi presented no cytotoxic of proliferative effects in mononuclear and VERO cells in vitro.

A cross-sectional study,2021-08-30,"Tocilizumab, an interleukin‐6 inhibitor, may ameliorate the inflammatory manifestations associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and thus improve clinical outcomes. This was a retrospective review of patients with laboratory‐confirmed severe COVID‐19 who received tocilizumab and completed 14 days of follow up. Twenty‐five patients were included, median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50‐63) and the majority were males (92%). Co‐morbidities included diabetes mellitus (48%), chronic kidney disease (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%). Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms.

Pregnant women are a vulnerable population to infectious disease pandemics with dramatically increased infectious diseases-related serious complications, such as the need of hospitalizations, the need of admission to intensive care unit and the final disease-related death compared to those nonpregnant counterparts or those pregnant women without infection. Several studies have shown that vaccinations in pregnancy are a safe and highly effective strategy, not only to pregnant women themselves but also to fetus and/or newborn because of the passive transplacental transfer of antibodies to the offspring. Active and passive prevention of infectious diseases is approved effective strategies for women who attempt to be pregnant or during pregnancy. Despite the large and proven scientific evidence, pregnant women still puzzle over whether they should get vaccinated. The question therefore arises: why are pregnant women so reluctant to receive vaccination? The explanation is more likely in the way that these benefits of vaccination has been communicated-""confusedly"". In fact, like virtually all clinical trials, all the COVID-19 vaccine trials have excluded pregnant and lactating women form participating, contributing to uncertainty of safety and efficacy in COVID-19 vaccines which have been well prepared and available for the general adult population worldly. Moreover, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine is a relatively brand-new vaccine, and experience about this-type vaccine is still scarce. It is a hard work to overcome this innovation deadlock. With the knowledge and awareness of pregnant women who are at risk, and full information about knowledge of vaccines and related preventable diseases in pregnant women may avoid hesitancy and increase vaccine acceptance. The current review is a part II addressing the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women. We focus the up-to-date information about application of vaccination on pregnant women, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Peng-Hui; Lee, Wen-Ling; Yang, Szu-Ting; Tsui, Kuan-Hao; Chang, Cheng-Chang; Lee, Fa-Kung",J.

Regression tree, cluster analysis and principal component analysis are implemented to global COVID-19 data of 133 countries obtained from the Worldometer website as reported as on April 17, 2020. Our results suggest that there are four major clusters among the countries. First cluster consists of 8 countries where cumulative infected cases and deaths are highest. It is also revealed that there are two principal components. The countries which play vital role to explain the 60\% variation of the total variations by the first component characterized by all variables except the rate variables include USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Iran. Remaining countries contribute to explaining 20\% variation of the total variations by the second component characterized by only three rate variables. We also found that the number of tests by the country variable among other variables country, number of active cases, number of deaths, number of recovered patients, number of serious cases, and number of new cases is an unimportant variable to predict cumulative number of confirmed cases. Hence, the number of tests might play vital role to individual country level who are in the primary level of virus spread but not to the global level.","Rahaman Khan, Hasinur; Hossain, Ahmed",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078238; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078238v1?rss=1,408
675291,Lifestyle behaviours during the COVID‐19 – time to connect,2020-05-12,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in Toronto resulted in a large number of autopsies on its victims. We describe the pulmonary pathology of patients who died in the 2003 Toronto outbreak. Autopsy material from the lungs of 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 were characterized by histology, molecular biology, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD68, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex viruses. Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval. The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5–108 days). Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization. Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns. Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases. Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts. Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels. Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus. Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury. Cases of SARS may be complicated by coexistent infections and therapy-related lung injury.","Hwang, David M; Chamberlain, Dean W; Poutanen, Susan M; Low, Donald E; Asa, Sylvia L; Butany, Jagdish",Mod Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272286/,408

[Participants and Methods] A total of 780 community-dwelling older adults (age ≥65 years) were classified based on whether they had fallen in the past year as those who had fallen at least once (fall group), and those who had not (non-fall group). We compared the study groups using sub-items of the FSI to extract more specific fall-related factors. The FSI is a questionnaire that comprises five items with simple ‘yes/no’ responses. [Results] The following three out of five sub-items of the FSI were extracted as fall-related factors: 1) “no” to the question, “Do you do physical exercise, like walking, at least once a week?”; 2) “yes” to the question, “Do you think you walk slower than before?”; and 3) “yes” to the question, “Have you felt tired for no reason (in the past two weeks)?” [Conclusion] The study results suggest the significance of paying attention to participant responses to the sub-items on the FSI, instead of merely determining their frailty risk based on their total score.","Murayama, Akihiko; Saida, Kosuke; Tanaka, Shigeya; Shinohara, Tomoyuki",J Phys Ther Sci,https://doi.org/10.1589/jpts.33.413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083880/,408
675656,Grief and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults,2020-06-27,"Background and Aims: Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the key molecule for understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The risk of COVID-19 and impact of immunosuppressive treatment on disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain controversial. We aimed to determine the change of intestinal ACE2 expression before and after biologics treatment including anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα), anti-integrin, and anti-interleukin (IL)12/23 in IBD patients. Methods: We analyzed the ACE2 expression through the public database of paired intestinal biopsies from IBD patients before and after biologic therapy. Change of ACE2 RNA and protein expression were validated in two independent cohorts (Birmingham cohort and Guangzhou cohort). The correlation between ACE2 expression and disease activity was also analyzed. Results: Mining information from the GEO database showed that compared with healthy control, intestinal ACE2 expression was downregulated in ileum of CD patients, while upregulated in colon of both CD and UC patients. Colonic ACE2 RNA expression was decreased significantly in patients responding to anti-TNFα but not anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, which was validated in the Birmingham cohort. Using the Guangzhou cohort including 53 patients matched by pre- and post-anti-TNFα therapy, colonic ACE2 protein expression was significantly downregulated after anti-TNFα treatment in responders (P < 0.001) rather than non-responders. Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in patients with severe histologically active disease compared with those with moderate (P < 0.0001) and mild (P = 0.0002) histologically active disease. Conclusion: Intestinal inflammation influences the expression of intestinal ACE2 in IBD patients, with different alterations in the ileum and colon. Colonic ACE2 expression was downregulated after anti-TNFα therapy in IBD patients responding to treatment. This might provide new clues regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential benefit of sustaining anti-TNFα treatment in patients with IBD.","Li, Xiao-Zhi; Qiu, Yun; Jeffery, Louisa; Liu, Fen; Feng, Rui; He, Jin-Shen; Tan, Jin-Yu; Ye, Zi-Yin; Lin, Si-Nan; Ghosh, Subrata; Iacucci, Marietta; Chen, Min-Hu; Mao, Ren",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.613475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511147/,408
676122,Contingency Plan for the Intensive Care Services for the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-14,"Google searches create a window into population-wide thoughts and plans not just of individuals, but populations at large. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to contain it, searches for socially distanced activities have trended. We hypothesize that trends in the volume of search queries related to activities associated with COVID-19 transmission correlate with subsequent COVID-19 caseloads. We present a preliminary analytics framework that examines the relationship between Google search queries and the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. We designed an experimental tool with search volume indices to track interest in queries related to two themes: isolation and mobility. Our goal was to capture the underlying social dynamics of an unprecedented pandemic using alternative data sources that are new to epidemiology. Our results indicate that the net movement index we defined correlates with COVID-19 weekly new case growth rate with a lag of between 10 and 14 days for the United States at-large, as well as at the state level for 42 out of 50 states with the exception of 8 states (DE, IA, KS, NE, ND, SD, WV, WY) from March to June 2020. In addition, an increasing caseload was seen over the summer in some southern US states. A sharp rise in mobility indices was followed by a sharp increase, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas. A sharp decline in mobility indices is often followed by a sharp decline, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and New York. The digital epidemiology framework presented here aims to discover predictors of the pandemic’s curve, which could supplement traditional predictive models and inform early warning systems and public health policies.","Bari, Anasse; Khubchandani, Aashish; Wang, Junzhang; Heymann, Matthias; Coffee, Megan",Soc Netw Anal Min,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-021-00723-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558823/,408

Countries will face substantial health, economic and social burden deriving from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as influenza, pneumonia and herpes zoster in older adults. It will be essential that countries utilize several public health strategies, including immunization. Understanding the different approaches countries have taken on adult immunization could help provide future learnings and technical support for adult vaccines within life-course immunization strategies. In this study, we describe the priorities and approaches that underlie adult immunization decision-making and implementation processes in 32 high-and-middle-income countries and two territories (“34 countries”) who recommend adult vaccines in their national schedule. We conducted an archetype analysis based on a subset of two dozen indicators abstracted from a larger database. The analysis was based on a mixed-methods study, including results from 120 key informant interviews in six countries and a landscape review of secondary data from 34 countries. We found four distinct archetypes: disease prevention-focused; health security-focused; evolving adult focus; and, child-focused and cost-sensitive. The highest performing countries belonged to the disease prevention-focused and health security archetypes, although there was a range of performance within each archetype. Considering common barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation of adult vaccines within a primary archetype could help provide a framework for strategies to support countries with similar needs and approaches. It can also help in developing context-specific policies and guidance, including for countries prioritizing adult immunization programs in light of COVID-19. Further research may be beneficial to further refine archetypes and expand the understanding of what influences success within them. This can help advance policies and action that will improve vaccine access for older adults and build a stronger appreciation of the value of immunization amongst a variety of stakeholders.","Privor-Dumm, Lois; Vasudevan, Prarthana; Kobayashi, Kana; Gupta, Jaya",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20305077; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20305077; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376108/,408

This article tests the extent to which CCG can influence corporate performance of Taiwan's publicly traded hospitality companies. The variable of CCG is defined as the ratio of the total value of corporate giving to total sales revenue. The measures of corporate performance are profitability (return on assets and return on equity), stock performance and Tobin's Q. Panel regression test results reveal that CCG can affect all measures of corporate performance except for stock return. In particular, the impact of CCG on return on assets, return on equity and Tobin's Q is an inverted U-shape, implying that an increased CCG can enhance corporate performance, but as the level of CCG reaches its optimal point, an increase in CCG could have a negative influence on corporate performance.

Work was carried out in 22 sheep farms, with (i) flock size over 150 animals, (ii) presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and (iii) close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm. Faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48 h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs. Faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm. In total, samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies. Samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria, detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts. Escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study, were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies. E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism: 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered. Other bacteria isolated were Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., (lambs and puppies), Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundi, Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae (only lambs) and Streptococcus spp. (only puppies). Group A Rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs (2.5%) and Parvovirus in samples from puppies (5%). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies. This is the first report of isolation of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and of detection of Rotavirus from lambs in Greece. Rates of E. coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were, in general, smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs. Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.","Chatzopoulos, D.C.; Sarrou, S.; Vasileiou, N.G.C.; Ioannidi, K.S.; Peteinaki, E.; Valiakos, G.; Tsokana, C.N.; Papadopoulos, E.; Spyrou, V.; Mavrogianni, V.S.; Giannakopoulos, A.; Sbiraki, A.; Lacasta, D.; Bueso, J.P.; Athanasiou, L.V.; Billinis, C.; Fthenakis, G.C.",Small Rumin Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921448816301468; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288209/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921448816301468,408

In less than two months, the disease had spread to more than 200 herds in thirteen states. Experts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) engaged in laboratory diagnostics, analytic support, epidemiology expertise, and data management to facilitate the effort. By 2014, a great deal had been learned about the disease; however, the question of how it entered the United States remained unanswered. In 2014, USDA formed an investigative group to address the question and leverage current knowledge with resources and partnerships not readily available to non-federal investigators. The group formed collaborations with other government and non-government organizations and individuals, and followed many avenues of inquiry; ultimately arriving at a small number of scenarios that describe possible mechanisms for PED introduction. For a scenario to be plausible, it had to explain: contamination of a person or product in the source country, its transit and entry to the United States, rapid dispersal across a wide geographic area, and exposure/infection of pigs. It had to be compatible with findings of swine herd investigations and research studies. Potential products had to have been imported legally during the time prior to the beginning of the epidemic, or delivered to the United States through prohibited channels. Follow-up studies were initiated to gather more evidence for the most plausible scenarios. Of the scenarios, flexible intermediate bulk containers (“feed totes”) used to transport bulk feed serving as fomites for movement of PED virus provided the simplest explanation for the accumulated findings of the investigation.","Scott, Aaron; McCluskey, Brian; Brown-Reid, Monica; Grear, Dan; Pitcher, Paul; Ramos, Greg; Spencer, Denise; Singrey, Aaron",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711302/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.11.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300829; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300829,408
683970,Loneliness among older adults in the community during COVID-19,2020-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Neurological complications are common in patients affected by COVID-19 due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect brains. While the mechanisms of this process are not fully understood, it has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of the current study was to analyze the expression pattern of the main SARS-CoV-2 receptors in naïve and HIV-1-infected cells of the NVU in order to elucidate a possible pathway of the virus entry into the brain and a potential modulatory impact of HIV-1 in this process. METHODS: The gene and protein expression profile of ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, BSG, DPP4, AGTR2, ANPEP, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L was assessed by qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunostaining, respectively. In addition, we investigated if brain endothelial cells can be affected by the exposure to the S1 subunit of the S protein, the domain responsible for the direct binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptors. RESULTS: The receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection are co-expressed in the cells of the NVU, especially in astrocytes and microglial cells. These receptors are functionally active as exposure of endothelial cells to the SARS CoV-2 S1 protein subunit altered the expression pattern of tight junction proteins, such as claudin-5 and ZO-1. Additionally, HIV-1 infection upregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in brain astrocytes and microglia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide key insight into SARS-CoV-2 recognition by cells of the NVU and may help to develop possible treatment of CNS complications of COVID-19.

Following recommendations by the World Health Organization in 2016, Indonesia evaluated various approaches to aPN. We present the lessons learned from formative operational research undertaken to understand provider and patient perspectives on aPN from three demonstration sites in cities with a high HIV burden. METHODS: We conducted a formative qualitative study in three cities: Jakarta, Semarang, and Denpasar between September and October 2019. We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) (n = 44 participants) among health-care providers, people living with HIV and the general population. We explored participant preferences and concerns about how aPN should be delivered, including the methods of and messaging for contacting partners. All FGDs were conducted in the Indonesian language. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: aPN was acceptable across different participant populations, although with caveats. Some differences were observed between the general population, providers and people living with HIV. People living with HIV were mainly concerned with confidentiality of the procedure and preferred the use of telecommunication and messages that avoid explicit mention of HIV exposure. Providers preferred similar approaches but for different reasons, being concerned mainly with self-efficacy and security. There was consensus regarding dual referral models. The use of phone calls and short messages were preferred as these are perceived to minimize negative reactions and stigma, protect client confidentiality and are suitable in the current legal situation. The general population was mainly concerned with effectiveness and prefer direct provider-led approaches, such as preferring in-person meeting with explicit notification of potential HIV exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We found consensus among stakeholders on acceptance of aPN, especially dual referral methods. Development and implementation of aPN protocols should also consider clients’ individual situations and concerns regarding safeguarding of confidentiality, and offer a range of options to accommodate all stakeholders involved.

686142,A Two-to-Five Year Follow-Up of a Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome Cohort,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated the delivery of online higher education. Online learning is a novel experience for medical education in Sri Lanka. A novel approach to undergraduate surgical learning was taken up in an attempt to improve the interest amongst the students in clinical practice while maximizing the limited contact time. METHOD: Online learning activity was designed involving medical students from all stages and multi consultant panel discussions. The discussions were designed to cover each topic from basic sciences to high-level clinical management in an attempt to stimulate the student interest in clinical medicine. Online meeting platform with free to use basic plan and a social media platform were used in combination to communicate with the students. The student feedback was periodically assessed for individual topics as well as for general outcome. Lickert scales and numeric scales were used to acquire student agreement on the desired learning outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1047 student responses for 7 questionnaires were analysed. During a 6-week period, 24 surgical topics were discussed with 51 contact hours. Eighty-seven per cent definitely agreed (highest agreement) with the statement ‘students benefitted from the discussions’. Over 95% have either participated for all or most sessions. A majority of the respondents (83.4%) ‘definitely agreed’ that the discussions helped to improve their clinical sense. Of the total respondents, 79.3% definitely agreed that the discussions helped to build an interest in clinical medicine. Around 90% agreed that both exam-oriented and clinical practice-oriented topics were highly important and relevant. Most widely raised concerns were the poor Internet connectivity and limitation of access to the meeting platform. CONCLUSION: Online teaching with a novel structure is feasible and effective in a resource-limited setting. Students agree that it could improve clinical interest while meeting the expected learning outcomes.","Chandrasinghe, P. C.; Siriwardana, R. C.; Kumarage, S.

Patients with cancer have a higher risk to acquire the infection and worse prognosis as they have to attend more medical visits in healthcare institutions, receive medical and surgical treatments, and be subjected to diagnostic studies such as PET/CT in nuclear medicine services where the infection may be an incidental finding.

687613,Firefighters and COVID-19: An Occupational Health Perspective,2021-06-16,"Polymeric materials have drastically changed the society in the last century. However, their non-renewable origin, together with their indiscriminate use and disposal, resulted in a huge accumulation of waste in the environment and raised a wide discussion about the emission of greenhouse gases, which must be considerably reduced to minimize global warming. Thus, the establishment of a consolidated production of polymers prioritizing the use of renewable sources of raw materials became a hot research topic. Vegetable oils are protagonists of this initiative, and their carbon–carbon double bonds are convenient reactive sites for chain growth polymerization reactions. However, typical vegetable oil-based homopolymers often do not display competitive thermo-mechanical properties, and the preparation of the corresponding copolymers and composites is therefore an interesting alternative strategy. Herein, the preparation of composites based on a tung oil/furfuryl alcohol co-continuous network reinforced with bacterial cellulose fibers is described. For this purpose, the cellulose nanofibers were suspended in furfuryl alcohol, and different amounts of the ensuing suspension were mixed with tung oil in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as cationic initiator. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of all samples indicated the association of both tung oil and furfuryl alcohol in the final materials, with peaks belonging to cellulose superposed at the fingerprint regions of composites. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry demonstrated an interesting relationship between the composition and the corresponding thermal properties, and the morphology of the materials was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed a homogeneous distribution of cellulosic fibers at lower concentrations. The results gathered here contribute to the development of original macromolecular materials exclusively based on the renewable platform.","Valentino, Henrique Augusto Silva; de Tarso Laia dos Reis e Silva Pupio, Paulo; Gandini, Alessandro; Lacerda, Talita M.",Cellulose (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-03999-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177137/,408
687746,Editor's choice: this December 2020,2020-12-11,"CONTEXT: Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease of viral or postviral origin. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide and Italy has been severely affected by this outbreak. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to report the first case of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who came to our attention for fever, neck pain radiated to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days after a SARS-CoV-2–positive oropharyngeal swab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild and the patient had completely recovered in a few days. RESULTS: At physical examination the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful and enlarged thyroid on palpation. At laboratory exams free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, thyrotropin undetectable, and inflammatory markers and white blood cell count elevated. Bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas were detected at neck ultrasound. One month earlier, thyroid function and imaging both were normal. We diagnosed SAT and the patient started prednisone. Neck pain and fever recovered within 2 days and the remaining symptoms within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of SAT after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We alert clinicians to additional and unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.","Brancatella, Alessandro; Ricci, Debora; Viola, Nicola; Sgrò, Daniele; Santini, Ferruccio; Latrofa, Francesco",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436948/; https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa276,408
688413,Leveraging investments in Ebola preparedness for COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa,2020-03-18,"Published almost 50 years ago, the Limits to Growth remains relevant to contemporary environmental health, though, paradoxically, this relevance is scarcely recognized. The seminal ideas it presented provide a useful background, as do the later Planetary Boundaries analyses, with which to consider key issues in contemporary environmental health. To be more than reactive, it is necessary to understand the complexity and interactions of integrated environmental health risks, including the possibility of significant global population decline within the current century. This contribution provides an overview to the Limits to Growth, linking it especially to the “planetary boundaries” of climate change, biodiversity loss and novel entities (including artificial substances and genetically modified organisms). The gradual increase in the amount of primary energy required to generate useable energy is also argued to be an under-recognized contributing factor to the decline in real wages growth for much of the world’s population since then, although this aspect may be improving. These elements have positive and negative health effects, which we discuss.","Butler, Colin D.; Higgs, Kerryn; McFarlane, Rosemary Anne",Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095489106517; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489106517,408

689983,"Educational needs in the COVID-19 pandemic: a Delphi study among doctors and nurses in Wuhan, China",2021-04-09,"Background: Home quarantine is an important strategy to contain the mass spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there are a dearth of studies on the prevalence and risk factors of home quarantine strategy implementation among residents. This study aims to assess the state of home quarantine strategy implementation among Chinese residents, which could provide a reference for quarantine policymakers around the world during the pandemic. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 3,398 residents in China by adopting a convenience sampling strategy. We measured the prevalence and risk factors of home quarantine strategy implementation with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). A multivariable model was used to determine the factors associated with home quarantine strategy implementation. Results: A total of 2,936 (86.4%) respondents carried out home quarantine. There were some factors significantly associated with home quarantine strategy implementation among Chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who were male, lived in western and central China, were aware of the primary symptoms of COVID-19, were willing to accept recommendations on relevant protective measures, understood local quarantine measures, had better resilience, and had better social support were more likely to engage in home quarantine. Respondents who were married, were employed, were healthy, and had high depression scores were more likely to refuse to follow home quarantine guidance. Conclusions: Gender, region, marital status, employment status, health status, awareness of the primary symptoms of COVID-19, willingness to accept recommendations on relevant protective measures, understanding of local quarantine measures, depression, psychological resilience, and perceived social support were the main factors affecting the implementation of residents' home quarantine strategy. Health service policymakers should adopt relevant measures to improve the prevalence of home quarantine strategy implementation among residents during the pandemic.","Li, Liqing; Shen, Xin; Zhou, Xiaogang; Cao, Hui; Feng, Jing; Lei, Zihui; Tian, Kunming; Liang, Jiarui; Wang, Yuan; Lu, Zuxun; Gan, Yong",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.679538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594261/,408
