However, there are limited data on small thrombosed aneurysms as a possible cause of ischemic events. Three patients are reported who presented with acute ischemic stroke and in whom the initial imaging studies showed a small (<10 mm), unruptured, partially thrombosed aneurysm. In each case, the aneurysm location was confirmed by a conventional angiogram. In all cases, the aneurysms were found on the proximal middle cerebral artery, in the territory corresponding to the clinical symptoms of the stroke. The mechanism of middle cerebral artery embolic event was thought to be related to the thrombus within the aneurysm, causing subsequent embolization into distal related vascular territory. Two of these patients had craniotomy for aneurysm clipping; one was managed conservatively with medical therapy alone. Thrombosis of small, unruptured intracranial aneurysms should be considered as a possible cause of acute-onset stroke symptoms in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It is under-recognized in the current literature, and no guidelines currently exist for medical or surgical treatment of such aneurysms. Medical management is often decided on an individual basis. Surgical treatment mostly involves aneurysmal clipping rather than coiling.","Mokin, Maxim; Darkhabani, Ziad; Binning, Mandy J; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,910,11

It is paramount that the justice system systemically recognize young adults as a group with distinct developmental needs and align reform efforts with advancements made in medical and public health fields to better address the needs of justice-involved young adults with SUD. This article warns against reliance on the justice system for engaging young adults with SUD in treatment and presents 4 principles that were developed by a workgroup participating in a longitudinal meeting of experts sponsored by Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction. The goal of the principles is to support and guide policy and practice initiatives for developmentally appropriate justice responses to young adults with SUD. The article also reviews the evidence that underlies these principles and offers policy and practice considerations for their implementation.,"Siringil Perker, Selen; Chester, Lael E H",Pediatrics,910,17

SAR, which engages salicylic acid (SA) signaling, shares molecular components with the autonomous pathway, which is involved in controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD) is one such autonomous pathway component that is required for flowering time and the systemic accumulation of SA during SAR. Here, we show that CYP720A1, a putative cytochrome P450 monoxygenase, controls FLD expression and is required for the timing of flowering and the manifestation of SAR. The delayed flowering time in cyp720a1 mutant correlated with the elevated transcript level of the floral repressor FLC, while the SAR-deficiency phenotype of the cyp720a1 mutant correlated with the inability to systemically accumulate SA. CYP720A1 transcript abundance in shoots is poor compared to roots. Reciprocal root-shoot grafting confirmed that CYP720A1 function in the roots is critical for flowering time and SAR. We therefore suggest that root-to-shoot communication involving a CYP720A1-dependent factor contributes to the timing of reproductive development and defense in the foliage.","Chaturvedi, Ratnesh; Giri, Mrunmay; Chowdhury, Zulkarnain; Venables, Barney J; Mohanty, Devasantosh; Petros, Robby A; Shah, Jyoti",Journal of experimental botany,910,1

Our modelling, based on data from the UK, shows that contrary to reducing demand, the effect on both mortality and bed occupancy would be negative with 158 additional deaths per year for each 10% reduction in primary angioplasty and at a cost of ~8,000 additional bed days per year for the same reduction. Our analysis demonstrates that specialist services such as heart attack pathways should be protected during the COVID crisis to maximise the appropriate use of resource and prevent unnecessary mortality.","Dancy, Luke; O039,; Gallagher, Kevin; Ryan, Matthew; MacCarthy, Philip A; Shah, Ajay M",Clin Med (Lond),910,4

Quantile regression is employed to examine the heterogeneous relationship at different market conditions. The study documents evidence to support a negative relationship between the oil implied volatility shocks and stock returns in the selected stock markets, especially in downturns. Findings from this study also reveal that the oil implied volatility shocks can asymmetrically influence Africa's stocks. Specifically, our empirical evidence reveals that positive shocks in the oil implied volatility index play a key role in most of Africa's stock markets in market downturns while negative shocks play a moderate role during benign market conditions in some of Africa's stock markets during the pandemic. More importantly, our findings divulge that investors can find an invaluable shelter with a portfolio of the selected African stocks and oil market securities in the time of the pandemic. The policy implications are further discussed.","Boateng, Ebenezer Adam Anokye Mohammed Junior Peterson Owusu",Resources policy,910,16

This research explores the influence of COVID-19-related experiences on the emotional wellbeing and mental health of South African university students 3 months into the pandemic. Research data were obtained from an online survey completed by 5074 students. Students reported difficulties in coping with psychological challenges during the lockdown: 45.6% and 35.0% reported subjective experiences of anxiety and depression, respectively. Students scored low on the mental health continuum. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that some different dimensions predicted emotional difficulties or wellbeing and mental health – confirming the two continuum theory of Keyes. Students’ serious discomfort during lockdown, difficulty adjusting academically and feeling socially isolated contributed most to emotional difficulties. Females, students in their early years of study and students residing in informal settlements were most at risk of experiencing emotional difficulties. Mental health was most predicted by students’ hopefulness. Social, academic, spiritual and physical wellbeing and positive coping strategies influenced both emotional difficulties and mental health. The research serves to alert university authorities to students’ emotional wellbeing, especially of first-year students and students with limited resources. The results could assist university psychological services to provide appropriate support services to enhance students’ adjustment and promote their mental health amid a public health crisis.

As preventive medicine and health screening examinations are now becoming commonplace, the incidental detection of papillomacular bundle defect (PMBD) on fundus photography has been increasing. However, clinical significance of incidental PMBD has not been well documented to date. Thus, through long-term and longitudinal observation, we aimed to investigate the risk factors for the development and progression of PMBD and its predictive role associated with systemic diseases and glaucoma. Methods: This longitudinal study included subjects who had undergone standardized health screening. We retrospectively reviewed patients for whom PMBD had been detected in fundus photography and followed up for more than 5 years. For a comparative analysis, non-PMBD groups of age- and gender-matched healthy controls were selected. Results: A total of about 67,000 fundus photographs were analyzed for 8.0 years, and 587 PMBD eyes were found. Among them, 234 eyes of 234 patients who had had fundus photographs taken for more than 5 years were finally included. A total of 216 eyes (92.3%) did not progress during the 8.1 ± 2.7 years, whereas 18 eyes (7.7%) showed progression at 7.6 ± 2.9 years after initial detection. A multivariate logistic regression analysis using 224 non-PMBD healthy controls revealed low body mass index (BMI < 20 kg/m2), systemic hypertension, and sclerotic changes of retinal artery as the significant risk factors for the development of PMBD. Regarding PMBD progression, low BMI, concomitant retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) at non-PMB sites, optic disc hemorrhage, and higher vertical cup/disc ratio were individual significant risk factors. Conclusion: PMBD is associated with ischemic effects. Although the majority of PMBD do not progress, some of cases are associated with glaucomatous damage in a long-term way. PMBD might be a personalized indicator representing ischemia-associated diseases and a predictive factor for diagnosis and preventive management of glaucoma.","Baek, Sung Uk; Lee, Won June; Park, Ki Ho; Choi, Hyuk Jin",EPMA J,910,14

Qatar has a comprehensive surveillance system which includes influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and identification of the influenza and non-influenza viruses causing the infections. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the viruses causing acute respiratory illness in Qatar during 2013–2016. Methodology: Respiratory samples were collected from selected patients using WHO standard case definitions with ILI at the sentinel primary health care centre sites of the National Influenza Centre and patients with SARI admitted to sentinel hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible patients (standardized case definitions) for the period 2013–2016. Samples were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the National Influenza Centre, which tests for 22 types and subtypes of virus. Findings: In the study period, 43 106 patients were included and tested, 29 626 (68.7%) of whom tested positive for infection. Out of these, 8 829 (29.8%) were influenza positive, 6 655 (75.4%) of whom were influenza A and 2 174 (24.6%) were influenza B. Sub-typing of influenza A showed 3 721 (55.9%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Other respiratory viruses isolated included rhinovirus 4 626 (15.6%), respiratory syncytial virus 3 259 (11.0%), coronaviruses 1 824 (6.2%), adenovirus 1 689 (5.7%), parainfluenza virus 1 645 (5.6%), human metapneumovirus 1 357 (4.6%) Mycoplasma pneumoniae 1 053 (3.6%), bocavirus 874 (3.0%) and parechovirus 178 (0.6%). Seasonal variation was observed for influenza with the peak season being from October to March with an unexpected surge of cases seen in October to December 2016. Conclusions: Influenza viruses A and B are responsible for the majority of the ILI and SARI cases reported in Qatar; however many other viruses also contribute to the burden of respiratory illness in the country. The findings indicate other viral etiologies besides influenza which may influence the clinical management and outcome of the patient.

A large proportion of COVID-19 patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes. But whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of COVID-19 has not been well described. Methods We included COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to Tongji Hospital, Tongji medical college of HUST (Wuhan, China) from January, 27, 2020 to March, 8, 2020 in this retrospective cohort study. The final date of follow-up was March, 30, 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Prevention and control Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia published by National Health Commission of the People' s Republic of China and WHO interim. Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms and compared among different groups. Results 1031 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were dead in hospital. 73% of 165 dead patients had complicated chronic comorbidities. Of the 1031 patients, 514 (50%) were combined with chronic comorbidities, and showed CFR 2.8 times as that of patients without any underlying disease. The number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases. The univariable regression revealed that patients in the simple hypertension group showed overall risk higher than those in the simple diabetes mellitus group. In the age-grouped research, patients in the hypertension senile group were proved to be at the highest risk, which might be associated with the level of LDH and eGFR. In this retrospective cohort study, 166 (43%) patients with hypertension took CCB during the hospitalization, the odds ratio of CFR in patients with hypertension taking CCB group was 0.68 (P = 0.155), compared to those not. Conclusion Our data shows that the clinical manifestations of most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are actually systemic syndromes, although COVID-19 is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and does play a critical role in improving patients' clinical outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in patients with COVID-19 should be a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status.","Zeng, H.; Zhang, T.; He, X.; Du, Y.; Tong, Y.; Zhang, W.; Shen, Y.",,910,16
