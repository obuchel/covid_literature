To assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding by PCR in infected pregnant women with mild symptoms. 2. To assess the efficacy of HCQ to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in contact with an infected or suspected case. 3. To evaluate the effect of HCQ in preventing the development of the COVID-19 disease in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women. The secondary objectives are: 1. To determine the effect of HCQ on the clinical course and duration of the COVID-19 disease in SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women. 2. To determine the impact of HCQ on the risk of hospitalization and mortality of SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women. 3. To assess the safety and tolerability of HCQ in pregnant women. 4. To describe the clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. 5. To describe the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes by treatment group. 6. To determine the risk of vertical transmission (intra-utero and intra-partum) of SARS-CoV-2. TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled two-arm multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HCQ to prevent and/or minimize SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Participants will be randomized to receive a 14-day oral treatment course of HCQ or placebo, ratio 1:1. PARTICIPANTS: Study population: pregnant women undergoing routine prenatal follow up or attending emergency units at the participating hospitals who report either symptoms/signs suggestive of COVID-19 disease or close contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case. Inclusion criteria Women will be invited to participate in the trial and sign an informed consent if they meet the following inclusion criteria. â¢ Presenting with fever (&#8805;37.5°C) and/or one mild symptom suggestive of COVID-19 disease (cough, dyspnoea, chills, odynophagia, diarrhoea, muscle pain, anosmia, dysgeusia, headache) OR being contact* of a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected case in the past 14 days â¢ More than 12 weeks of gestation (dated by ultrasonography) â¢ Agreement to deliver in the study hospitals Exclusion criteria â¢ Known hypersensitivity to HCQ or other 4-amonoquinoline compounds â¢ History of retinopathy of any aetiology â¢ Concomitant use of digoxin, cyclosporine, cimetidine â¢ Known liver disease â¢ Clinical history of cardiac pathology including known long QT syndrome â¢ Unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study â¢ Participating in other intervention studies â¢ Delivery onset (characterized by painful uterine contractions and variable changes of the cervix, including some degree of effacement and slower progression of dilatation up to 5 cm for first and subsequent labours) The study participants will be stratified by clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. Assignment of participants to study groups will be as follows: â¢ SARS-CoV-2-PCR confirmed, infected pregnant women: a. symptomatic (n=100) b. asymptomatic (n=100) â¢ SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative pregnant women in contact* with a SARS-CoV-2-infected confirmed or suspected case (n=514). *The ECDC definition of close contact will be followed. The trial will be conducted in five hospitals in Spain: Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, in Barcelona, and HM Puerta del Sur and Hospital Universitario de Torrejón, in Madrid. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to HCQ (400 mg/day for three days, followed by 200 mg/day for 11 days) or placebo (2 tablets for three days, followed by one tablet for 11 days). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the number of PCR-confirmed infected pregnant women assessed from collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs at day 21 after treatment start (one week after treatment is completed). RANDOMISATION: Allocation of participants to study arms will be done centrally by the trial's Sponsor (the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, ISGlobal) by block randomization. This method will ensure balanced allocation to both arms. The electronic CRF will automatically assign a study number to each participant, depending on her study group and recruitment site. Each number will be related to a treatment number, which assigns them to one of the study arms. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, investigators and those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. Study tablets (HCQ and placebo) will be identically packaged in small opaque bottles. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This study requires 200 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 514 contact pregnant women, randomised 1:1 with 100 and 227 respectively in each study arm. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.0, from May 8th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing (first patient recruited the 19th May 2020 and recruitment end anticipated by December 2020). TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 2020-001587-29, registered 2 April 2020. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04410562 , retrospectively registered 1 June 2020.

We conducted a longitudinal web-based survey of 217 Italian participants at two time points: lockdown and subsequent follow-up. To thoroughly investigate lockdown-related changes in sleep quality, we first evaluated variations in overall sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We then examined sleep changes in specific components of sleep quality. Results revealed a clear dissociation of sleep effects, as a function of the specific domain considered, with longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, and massive sleep medication use during forced confinement. On the other hand, we simultaneously observed an increased sleep duration and better daytime functioning. Our present findings highlight the importance of an accurate examination of sleep quality during lockdown, as the effects were not uniform across populations and different sleep domains.","Alfonsi, Valentina; Gorgoni, Maurizio; Scarpelli, Serena; Zivi, Pierpaolo; Sdoia, Stefano; Mari, Emanuela; Fraschetti, Angelo; Ferlazzo, Fabio; Giannini, Anna Maria; De Gennaro, Luigi",J Sleep Res,965,26

Due to its molecular nature, the fundamental asymmetry of the hydrogen bond, and proton disorder, crystal defects in this condensed form of water reveal a complexity not usually seen in atomic crystalline solids. The discussion is organized in terms of the spatial extent of the defects. We start with zero-dimensional imperfections such as the molecular vacancy and interstitial, Bjerrum, and ionic defects, as well as possible defect complexes that can be formed from them. Subsequently, we turn to the properties of dislocations, which are the one-dimensional disturbances that carry plastic deformation in crystalline solids. Finally, we discuss two-dimensional defects such as stacking faults and grain boundaries and discuss to what extent the latter are similar to other interfaces in ice Ih such as the free surface. We conclude with an outlook at the road ahead, discussing future challenges toward understanding the role of crystal defects in the macroscopic behavior of ice Ih.","de Koning, Maurice",J Chem Phys,965,21

293985,293985,293985,COVID-19: An opportunity to vaccinate infants against rotavirus infections,21.205345,13.308167,2020,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies being present in COVID-19-infected patients. This has thus been identified in some publications as representing a high incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), whereas in others, findings have been tempered by general lack of functional reactivity using confirmation assays of serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA). Moreover, in at least two publications, data are provided suggesting that antibodies can arise in heparin naïve patients or that platelet activation may not be heparin-dependent. From this literature, we would conclude that platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies can be observed in COVID-19-infected patients, and they may occur at higher incidence than in historical non-COVID-19-infected cohorts. However, the situation is complex, since not all platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies may lead to platelet activation, and not all identified antibodies are heparin-dependent, such that they do not necessarily reflect ""true"" HIT. Most recently, a ""HIT-like"" syndrome has reported in patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Accordingly, much more is yet to be learnt about the insidious disease that COVID-19 represents, including autoimmune outcomes in affected patients.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe",Int. j. lab. hematol,965,24

393887,393887,393887,"COVID-19: Screen more, screen better",21.345348,13.360572,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several technologies for rapid molecular identification of pathogens are currently available; jointly with monitoring tools (i.e., web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelers, and epidemic intelligence methods), they represent important components for timely outbreak detection and identification of the involved pathogen. The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. METHODS: This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. RESULTS: IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.","Baldassi, Federico; Carestia, Mariachiara; Moramarco, Stefania; Malizia, Andrea; Gaudio, Pasquale",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),965,16

There have been similarities as well as differences in opinions regarding spread of the disease, the lockdown, its implementations and impacts. This qualitative study attempts to identify and understand the emerging pattern within the opinions of 16 social scientists from eminent institutes with rich socioeconomic and demographic research experience. Several key themes emerged from this study. While it is opined that the lockdown initially slowed down the spread of virus among Indian population, it continues to surge exponentially. Economy faced extreme hardship because of this extensive and abrupt national lockdown. State-wise variation in the COVID-19 scenario is noticed and the reason is attributed to the strictness of implementation of the lockdown by the respective state governments. However, a lockdown in phases is suggested that could have averted the economic crisis. Small businesses were the hardest hit. Migrant workers were not given deserved attention and support in terms of their travel to their natives, health or financial sustenance during the lockdown. The bailout has not been timely and enough thereby creating a group of new poor. From the opinions it emerges that the policy measures intended to revive back the micro, small and medium scale enterprises may not bring short-term solution pertaining to the labor crisis. Relaxation of lockdown also calls for stringent awareness generation among general population about health and hygiene maintenance to avoid further spread of COVID-19.","Gupta, Priya; Sengupta, Angan",J Public Aff,965,16

Direct patient interaction, especially in groups, in out-patient departments or wards, was also made difficult. Institutes have adapted to the changed circumstances by increasing the use of online learning. We share our experience with a module of online Dermatology for undergraduate students. METHODS: An online module, aligned with the existing course objectives was designed and applied for two cohorts (year 4 and year 5). The module included student manuals, Powerpoint- presentations, videos, and quizzes uploaded on dedicated online management systems. There were live interactive sessions in small groups also. The small group session included student-led case presentations and faculty-led simulated case discussions. Feedback was taken from both the students and the faculty regarding the module using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 45 students and 4 faculty responded to the respective questionnaires. A majority of the students felt that the module covered the planned content adequately. The faculty and the majority of the students were also satisfied with the technical aspects of the module. Student and faculty concerns were mainly in the area of assessment and practical skills. While faculty were concerned about the validity of the assessment, students were concerned mainly about difficulty and the need for more orientation regarding the assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The students and faculty were satisfied with the online Dermatology module in our study. However, the validity of assessment and the training of practical skills are major limitations.","Kaliyadan, Feroze; ElZorkany, Khaled; Al Wadani, Fahad",Indian Dermatol Online J,965,1

However, the estimated prevalence essential to guide public health policy varies in published literature. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate prevalence of smell and taste loss among COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES: We conducted systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for studies published on the prevalence of smell and taste loss in COVID-19 patients. REVIEW METHODS: Two authors extracted data on study characteristics and the prevalence of smell and taste loss. Random-effects modeling was used to estimate pooled prevalence. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. This study used PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 32 studies reported a prevalence of loss of smell, taste, or both from a combined sample of 20,451 COVID-19 patients. The estimated global pooled prevalence of loss of smell among 19,424 COVID-19 patients from 27 studies was 48.47% (95% CI, 33.78%-63.29%). Loss of taste was reported in 20 studies and 8001 patients with an estimated pooled prevalence of 41.47% (95% CI, 3.13%-31.03%), while 13 studies that reported combined loss of smell and taste in 5977 COVID-19 patients indicated a pooled prevalence of 35.04% (95% CI, 22.03%-49.26%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of smell and taste loss among COVID-19 patients was high globally, and regional differences supported the relevance of these symptoms as important markers. Health workers must consider them as suspicion indices for empirical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","Ibekwe, Titus Sunday; Fasunla, Ayotunde James; Orimadegun, Adebola Emmanuel",OTO Open,965,16
