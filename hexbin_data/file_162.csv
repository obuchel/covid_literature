359,359,359,"Seasonal influenza risk in hospital healthcare workers is more strongly associated with household than occupational exposures: results from a prospective cohort study in Berlin, Germany, 2006/07",15.934401,10.525267,2010-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Influenza immunisation for healthcare workers is encouraged to protect their often vulnerable patients but also due to a perceived higher risk for influenza. We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. RESULTS: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p < 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration. Asymptomatic infections are common, accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections.","Williams, Chris J; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Diner, Genia; Gerlach, Frank; Haaman, Frank; Krause, Gérard; Nienhaus, Albert; Buchholz, Udo",BMC Infect Dis,162,3
1650,1650,1650,Tuberculosis care for pregnant women: a systematic review,16.071669,10.675517,2014-11-19,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) during pregnancy may lead to severe consequences affecting both mother and child. Prenatal care could be a very good opportunity for TB care, especially for women who have limited access to health services. The aim of this review was to gather and evaluate studies on TB care for pregnant women. METHODS: We used a combination of the terms “tuberculosis” and “pregnancy”, limited to human, to search for published articles. Studies reflecting original data and focusing on TB care for pregnant women were included. All references retrieved were collected using the Reference Manager software (Version 11). RESULTS: Thirty five studies were selected for review and their data showed that diagnosis was often delayed because TB symptoms during pregnancy were not typical. TB prophylaxis and anti-TB therapy appeared to be safe and effective for pregnant women and their babies when suitable follow up and early initiation were present, but the compliance rate to TB prophylaxis is still low due to lack of follow up and referral services. TB care practices in the reviewed studies were in line in principle with the WHO International Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ISTC). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of TB care within prenatal care would improve TB diagnosis and treatment for pregnant women. To improve the quality of TB care, it is necessary to develop national level guidelines based on the ISTC with detailed guidelines for pregnant women.

2197,2197,2197,Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate lung protective ventilation and prevent ventilator-induced lung injury in severe Pneumocystis pneumonia with pneumomediastinum: a case report and short literature review,15.826178,10.531721,2016-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary infections caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii in immunocompromised host can be associated with cysts, pneumatoceles and air leaks that can progress to pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraxes. In such cases, it can be challenging to maintain adequate gas exchange by conventional mechanical ventilation and at the same time prevent further ventilator-induced lung injury. We report a young HIV positive male with poorly compliant lungs and pneumomediastinum secondary to severe Pneumocystis infection, rescued with veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). CASE PRESENTATION: A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history was admitted with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure. However, his respiratory function progressively deteriorated due to increasing pulmonary infiltrates and development of pneumomediastinum, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. Despite attempts at optimizing gas exchange by ventilatory maneuvers, patients’ pulmonary parameters worsened necessitating rescue ECMO therapy. The introduction of V-V ECMO facilitated the use of ultra-protective lung ventilation and prevented progression of pneumomediastinum, maintaining optimal gas exchange. It allowed time for the antibiotics to show effect and pulmonary parenchyma to heal. Further diagnostic workup revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii as the causative organism for pneumonia and serology confirmed Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Patient was successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials and de-cannulated after six days of ECMO support. CONCLUSION: ECMO was an effective salvage therapy in HIV positive patient with an otherwise fatal respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and air leak syndrome.","Ali, Husain Shabbir; Hassan, Ibrahim Fawzy; George, Saibu",BMC Pulm Med,162,0
3021,3021,3021,Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter species: a seven-year experience from a tertiary care center in Lebanon,15.599913,10.61394,2018-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter species have become increasingly common in the intensive care units (ICU) over the past two decades, causing serious infections. At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, the incidence of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) infections in the ICU increased sharply in 2007 by around 120%, and these infections have continued to cause a serious problem to this day. METHODS: We conducted a seven-year prospective cohort study between 2007 and 2014 in the ICU. Early in the epidemic, a case-control study was performed that included MDR-Ab cases diagnosed between 2007 and 2008 and uninfected controls admitted to the ICU during the same time. RESULTS: The total number of patients with MDR-Ab infections diagnosed between 2007 and 2014 was 128. There were also 99 patients with MDR-Ab colonization without evidence of active infection between 2011 and 2014. The incidence of MDR-Ab transmission was 315.4 cases/1000 ICU patient-days. The majority of infections were considered hospital-acquired (84%) and most consisted of respiratory infections (53.1%). The mortality rate of patients with MDR-Ab ranged from 52% to 66%. CONCLUSION: MDR-Ab infections mostly consisted of ventilator-associated pneumonia and were associated with a very high mortality rate. Infection control measures should be reinforced to control the transmission of these organisms in the ICU.","Kanafani, Zeina A.; Zahreddine, Nada; Tayyar, Ralph; Sfeir, Jad; Araj, George F.; Matar, Ghassan M.; Kanj, Souha S.",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,162,12

3969,3969,3969,Human metapneumovirus as cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia in adults: insights from a ten-year molecular and epidemiological analysis,15.981259,10.551209,2019-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical, epidemiological and molecular characterization of human metapneumovirus in critically ill adult patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the role of biomarkers identifying bacterial coinfection is scarce. METHODS: This is a retrospective epidemiological study of adult patients with hMPV severe CAP admitted to ICU during a ten-year period with admission PSI score ≥ 3. RESULTS: The 92.8% of the 28 patients with severe CAP due to human metapneumovirus were detected during the first half of the year. Median age was 62 years and 60.7% were male. The genotyping of isolated human metapneumovirus showed group B predominance (60.7%). All patients had acute respiratory failure. Median APACHE II and SOFA score were 13 and 6.55, respectively. The 25% were coinfected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. 60.7% of the patients had shock at admission and 50% underwent mechanical ventilation. Seven patients developed ARDS, three of them younger than 60 years and without comorbidities. Mortality in ICU was 14.3%. Among survivors, ICU and hospital stay were 6.5 and 14 days, respectively. Plasma levels of procalcitonin were higher in patients with bacterial coinfection (18.2 vs 0.54; p < 0.05). The levels of C-reactive protein, however, were similar. CONCLUSION: Human metapneumovirus was associated with severe CAP requiring ICU admission among elderly patients or patients with comorbidities, but also in healthy young subjects. These patients often underwent mechanical ventilation with elevated health resource consumption. While one out of four patients showed pneumococcal coinfection, plasma procalcitonin helped to implement antimicrobial stewardship.

4246,4246,4246,European intensive care physicians’ experience of infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria,16.001007,10.671923,2020-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) compromises the treatment of patients with serious infections in intensive care units (ICUs), and intensive care physicians are increasingly facing patients with bacterial infections with limited or no adequate therapeutic options. A survey was conducted to assess the intensive care physicians’ perception of the AMR situation in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). METHODS: Between May and July 2017, physicians working in European ICUs were invited to complete an online questionnaire hosted by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The survey included 20 questions on hospital and ICU characteristics, frequency of infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and relevance of AMR in the respondent’s ICU, management of antimicrobial treatment as well as the use of last-line antibiotics in the six months preceding the survey. For the analysis of regional differences, EU/EEA countries were grouped into the four sub-regions of Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Europe. RESULTS: Overall, 1062 responses from four European sub-regions were analysed. Infections with MDR bacteria in their ICU were rated as a major problem by 257 (24.2%), moderate problem by 360 (33.9%) and minor problem by 391 (36.8%) respondents. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently encountered MDR bacteria followed by, in order of decreasing frequency, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Perception of the relevance of the AMR problem and the frequency of specific MDR bacteria varied by European sub-region. Bacteria resistant to all or almost all available antibiotics were encountered by 132 (12.4%) respondents. Many physicians reported not having access to specific last-line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of European ICU physicians perceiving AMR as a substantial problem in their ICU is high with variation by sub-region in line with epidemiological studies. The reports of bacteria resistant to almost all available antibiotics and the limited availability of last-line antibiotics in ICUs in the EU/EEA are of concern.","Lepape, Alain; Jean, Astrid; De Waele, Jan; Friggeri, Arnaud; Savey, Anne; Vanhems, Philippe; Gustin, Marie Paule; Monnet, Dominique L.; Garnacho-Montero, José; Kohlenberg, Anke",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,162,12

METHODS: Design: Descriptive analysis of CRE HAIs and retrospective observational cohort study using national HAI surveillance data. Setting: Egyptian hospitals participating in the HAI surveillance system. The patient population included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in participating hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases were Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter isolates from blood, urine, wound or respiratory specimen collected on or after day 3 of ICU admission. CRE HAI cases were those resistant to at least one carbapenem. For CRE HAI cases reported during 2011–2017, a hospital-level and patient-level analysis were conducted using only the first CRE isolate by pathogen and specimen type for each patient. For facility, microbiology, and clinical characteristics, frequencies and means were calculated among CRE HAI cases and compared with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using STATA 13. RESULTS: There were 1598 Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases, of which 871 (54.1%) were carbapenem resistant. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that carbapenem resistance was associated with specimen type, pathogen, location prior to admission, and length of ICU stay. Between 2011 and 2017, there was an increase in the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases due to CRE (p-value = 0.003) and the incidence of CRE HAIs (p-value = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated a high and increasing burden of CRE in Egyptian hospitals, highlighting the importance of enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC) programs and antimicrobial stewardship activities and guiding the implementation of targeted IPC measures to contain CRE in Egyptian ICU’s .","Kotb, Sara; Lyman, Meghan; Ismail, Ghada; Abd El Fattah, Mohammad; Girgis, Samia A.; Etman, Ahmed; Hafez, Soad; El-Kholy, Jehan; Zaki, Maysaa El Sayed; Rashed, Hebat-allah G.; Khalil, Ghada M.; Sayyouh, Omar; Talaat, Maha",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,162,12
4355,4355,4355,Anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a case report,15.910116,10.368315,2020-01-20,"BACKGROUND: As patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) have long expected survival, the incidence of noncardiac surgery in this patient population is increasing. Here, we present the anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old man with LVAD was scheduled to undergo VATS because of repeated spontaneous pneumothorax. Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.","Iwata, Shihoko; Yokokawa, Sumire; Sato, Mihoshi; Ozaki, Makoto",BMC Anesthesiol,162,0
4367,4367,4367,"HIV testing, test results and factors influencing among infants born to HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Mekelle City, North Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study",16.01553,10.456105,2020-01-21,"BACKGROUND: Timely infant testing for HIV is critical to ensure optimal treatment outcomes among exposed infants. While world health organization recommends HIV exposed infants to be tested between 4 to 6 weeks of age, in developing countries like Ethiopia, access to timely infant testing is still very limited. The study is intended to assess timely infant testing, testing for HIV at the 18th month, test results and factors influencing HIV positivity among infants born to HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed on 558 HIV exposed infants, using consecutive sampling technique. A checklist was used to extract 4 years (January 2014–December 2017) secondary data, collected from January–April 2018. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20, and binary logistic regression model was used to examine the association of independent variables with the outcome variables. RESULTS: Timely infant testing for HIV accounted for 346(62.0%). Mothers who attended antenatal care (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.55) and who were counselled on feeding options (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.65) were strongly associated with timely infant testing. Poor maternal adherence status was associated with infants’ HIV positivity at the 18th month of antibody test (AOR: 15.93; 95% CI: 2.21, 94.66). Being rural resident (AOR: 4.0; 95% CI: 1.23, 13.04), being low birth weight (AOR: 5.64; 95% CI: 2.00, 16.71) and not receiving ARV prophylaxis (AOR: 4.70; 95% CI: 1.15, 19.11) were positively associated with the overall HIV positivity. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of exposed infants did not undergo timely testing for HIV. Antenatal care follow-up and counselling on feeding options were associated with timely infant testing. Mother’s poor adherence status was associated with infant’s HIV positivity at the 18th month of antibody testing. Being rural resident, being low birth weight, and not receiving ARV prophylaxis were the factors that enhance the overall HIV positivity. Timely infant testing, counselling on feeding options and adherence should be intensified, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission program in rural settings need to be strengthened.","Ebuy, Hiluf; Bekele, Alemayehu; Redae, Getachew",BMC Infect Dis,162,3

They are the current World Health Organization critical priority pathogens for resistance, Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and discovery of new antibiotics. However, there is paucity of data on nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by such superbugs in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the magnitude and profile of nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections among patients hospitalized at Felegehiwot referral hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felegehiwot referral hospital from April 1 to July 31, 2018. A total of 238 patients with blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site NIs were enrolled conveniently. Either blood, urine and wound swab specimens were collected and processed using standard bacteriological procedures. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard bacteriological techniques and confirmed by automated Vitek2 Compact. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates was performed using the disk diffusion technique. The results were interpreted as per the standard zone sizes of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables. P value < 0.05 was considered statistical significant. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years. Overall,20(8.4%) of patients had nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. The proportion of nosocomial MDR blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site infections were 13(8.9%), 5(8.3%) and 2 (6.3%), respectively. Patients with NI had lower mean age (24.9 years) (P = 0.035). All isolates of NIs were from patients with intravenous catheterization. The frequency of NI was 9(3.8%) for MDR A. baumannii and 11(4.6%) for MDR P.aeruginosa. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were 100% MDR. All isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 100% resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin.A. baumannii isolates were 33.3 and 44.5% resistance against meropenem and ciprofloxacin, respectively while P.aeruginosa isolates revealed 36.4 and 45.5% resistance against ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Health care associated infections of MDR A.baumannii and P. aeruginosa are critical problems in the study area. Therefore, urgent focused interventions required to contain the spreading of MDR NIs.

4492,4492,4492,Arnold–Chiari malformation type I and the posterior dislocation of the odontoid process aggravate prolonged weaning in a patient with severe viral pneumonia: a case report,16.064772,10.60939,2020-02-11,"Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","Wendt, Lisa; Brandt, Janine; Bodmer, Bianca S.; Reiche, Sven; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Traeger, Shelby; Hoenen, Thomas",Cells,162,0

A monovalent pH1N1 vaccine was separately produced in addition to the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Formulation of the seasonal influenza vaccine (injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV] vs. intranasal live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) was postulated to have impacted the efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccination. METHODS: We reviewed electronic health and databases, which included vaccination records, and healthcare encounters for influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza, and pneumonia among US military members. We examined rates by vaccination type to identify factors associated with the risk for study outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with those receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine alone, subjects receiving the pH1N1 vaccine, either alone (RR, 0.49) or in addition to the seasonal vaccine (RR, 0.51), had an approximately 50% reduction in ILI, 88% reduction in influenza (RR, 0.11 and 0.12, respectively), and 63% reduction in pneumonia (RR, 0.37 and 0.35, respectively). There was no clinically significant difference in ILI, influenza, or pneumonia attack rates among those receiving the pH1N1 vaccine with or without presence of the seasonal vaccine. Similarly, there was no clinically relevant difference in pH1N1 effectiveness between seasonal TIV and LAIV recipients. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2009–2010 pandemic, the pH1N1 vaccination was effective in reducing rates of ILI, influenza, and pneumonia. Administration of the seasonal vaccine should continue without concern of potential interference with a novel pandemic vaccine, though more studies are needed to determine if this is applicable to other influenza seasons.","Lee, Rachel U; Phillips, Christopher J; Faix, Dennis J",Clin Infect Dis,162,3

However, the full data set often contains thousands of sequences, because many of those unique sequences have multiple identical copies. Data sets of this size represent a computational challenge for currently available Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Through simulations, we explore how large data sets with duplicate sequences affect the speed and accuracy of phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis within BEAST 2. We show that using unique sequences only leads to biases, and using a random subset of sequences yields imprecise parameter estimates. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce PIQMEE, a BEAST 2 add-on that produces reliable parameter estimates from full data sets with increased computational efficiency as compared with the currently available methods within BEAST 2. The principle behind PIQMEE is to resolve the tree structure of the unique sequences only, while simultaneously estimating the branching times of the duplicate sequences. Distinguishing between unique and duplicate sequences allows our method to perform well even for very large data sets. Although the classic method converges poorly for data sets of 6,000 sequences when allowed to run for 7 days, our method converges in slightly more than 1 day. In fact, PIQMEE can handle data sets of around 21,000 sequences with 20 unique sequences in 14 days. Finally, we apply the method to a real, within-host HIV sequencing data set with several thousand sequences per patient.","Boskova, Veronika; Stadler, Tanja",Mol Biol Evol,162,0

It is intriguing to note that the profile-based approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard. To further improve protein remote homology detection, a key step is how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary information into the profiles. Results: Here, we propose a novel approach, the so-called profile-based protein representation, to extract the evolutionary information via the frequency profiles. The latter can be calculated from the multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST. Three top performing sequence-based kernels (SVM-Ngram, SVM-pairwise and SVM-LA) were combined with the profile-based protein representation. Various tests were conducted on a SCOP benchmark dataset that contains 54 families and 23 superfamilies. The results showed that the new approach is promising, and can obviously improve the performance of the three kernels.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Forty-three (43) facilities across 15 districts in Bangladesh, 16 in Ghana and 12 in Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Facility managers; 325 providers (nurses/midwives/doctors)—Bangladesh (158), Ghana (86) and Tanzania (81); and 849 recently delivered women—Bangladesh (295), Ghana (381) and Tanzania (173)—were interviewed. Observation of 641 client–provider interactions was conducted—Bangladesh (387), Ghana (134) and Tanzania (120). ASSESSMENT: Trained social scientists and clinicians assessed infrastructure, policies, provision and women’s experiences of RMC (emotional support, respectful care and communication). PRIMARY OUTCOME: RMC provided and/or experienced by women. RESULTS: Three (20%) facilities in Bangladesh, four (25%) in Ghana and three (25%) in Tanzania had no maternity clients’ toilets and one-half had no handwashing facilities. Policies for RMC such as identification of client abuses were available: 81% (Ghana), 73% (Bangladesh) and 50% (Tanzania), but response was poor. Ninety-four (60%) Bangladeshi, 26 (30%) Ghanaian and 20 (25%) Tanzanian providers were not RMC trained. They provided emotional support during labour care to 107 (80%) women in Ghana, 95 (79%) in Tanzania and 188 (48.5%) in Bangladesh, and were often courteous with them—236 (61%) in Bangladesh, 119 (89%) in Ghana and 108 (90%) in Tanzania. Due to structural challenges, 169 (44%) women in Bangladesh, 49 (36%) in Ghana and 77 (64%) in Tanzania had no privacy during labour. Care was refused to 13 (11%) Tanzanian and 2 Bangladeshi women who could not pay illegal charges. Twenty-five (7%) women in Ghana, nine (6%) in Bangladesh and eight (5%) in Tanzania were verbally abused during care. Providers in all countries highly rated their care provision (95%–100%), and 287 (97%) of Bangladeshi women, 368 (97%) Ghanaians and 152 (88%) Tanzanians reported ‘satisfaction’ with the care they received. However, based on their facility experiences, significant (p<0.001) percentages—20% (Ghana) to 57% (Bangladesh)—will not return to the same facilities for future childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Facilities in Bangladesh, Ghana and Tanzania have foundational systems that facilitate RMC. Structural inadequacies and policy gaps pose challenges. Many women were, however, unwilling to return to the same facilities for future deliveries although they (and providers) highly rated these facilities.","Manu, Alexander; Zaka, Nabila; Bianchessi, Christina; Maswanya, Edward; Williams, John; Arifeen, Shams E",BMJ Open,162,1

Only ten countries including Ethiopia attribute more than 65% of global burden of still birth. Ethiopia has the 7(th) highest still birth rate in the world. Identifying the predictors of stillbirth is critical for developing successful interventions and monitoring public health programs. Although certain studies have assessed the predictors of stillbirth, they failed in identify the proximate predictors of stillbirth. In addition, the inconsistent findings in identify the predictors of stillbirth, and the methodological limitations in previously published works are some of the gaps. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of stillbirth among mothers who gave birth in six referral hospitals in Southern, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in six referral hospitals in Southern, Ethiopia from October 2019 to June 2020. Consecutive sampling techniques and simple random techniques were used to recruit cases and controls respectively. A structured standard tool was used to identify the predictors of stillbirth. Data were entered into Epi Info 7 and exported to SPSS 23 for analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent predictors of stillbirth. The goodness of fit was tested using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit. In this study P-value < 0.05 was considered to declare a result as a statistically significant association. RESULTS: In this study 138 stillbirth cases and 269 controls were included. Women with multiple pregnancy [AOR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.39–6.36], having preterm birth [AOR = 2.83, 95%CI: 1.58–508], having cesarean mode of delivery [AOR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.87–5.44], having no ANC visit [AOR = 4.17, 95%CI: 2.38–7.33], and being hypertensive during pregnancy [AOR = 3.43, 95%CI: 1.93–6.06] were significantly associated with stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The predictors of stillbirth identified are manageable and can be amenable to interventions. Therefore, strengthening maternal antenatal care utilization should be encouraged by providing appropriate information to the mothers. There is a need to identify, screen, and critically follow high-risk mothers: those who have different complications during pregnancy, and those undergoing cesarean section due to different indications.","Abebe, Haimanot; Shitu, Solomon; Workye, Haile; Mose, Ayenew",PLoS One,162,0

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women that usually involves phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells and an heterogeneous stroma. In recent years, automated microscopy technologies are allowing the study of live cells over extended periods of time, simplifying the task of compiling large image databases. For instance, there have been several studies oriented towards building machine learning systems capable of automatically classifying images of different cell types (i.e. motor neurons, stem cells). In this work we were interested in classifying breast cancer cells as live or dead, based on a set of automatically retrieved morphological characteristics using image processing techniques. Our hypothesis is that live-dead classification can be performed without any staining and using only bright-field images as input. We tackled this problem using the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line that grows as an adherent monolayer. First, a vast image set composed by JIMT-1 human breast cancer cells that had been exposed to a chemotherapeutic drug treatment (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) or vehicle control was compiled. Next, several classifiers were trained based on well-known convolutional neural networks (CNN) backbones to perform supervised classification using labels obtained from fluorescence microscopy images associated with each bright-field image. Model performances were evaluated and compared on a large number of bright-field images. The best model reached an AUC = 0.941 for classifying breast cancer cells without treatment. Furthermore, it reached AUC = 0.978 when classifying breast cancer cells under drug treatment. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning and computational image analysis to build new diagnosis tools that benefit the biomedical field by reducing cost, time, and stimulating work reproducibility. More importantly, we analyzed the way our classifiers clusterize bright-field images in the learned high-dimensional embedding and linked these groups to salient visual characteristics in live-dead cell biology observed by trained experts.","Pattarone, Gisela; Acion, Laura; Simian, Marina; Iarussi, Emmanuel",Sci Rep,162,0

Topical formulations including cerates, lotions, sitz baths, and poultices for inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, anal fissure, endometriosis, and mastitis are known. However, there is no monograph in current pharmacopoeia for the wallflower drug. The present study is aimed to screen in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of wallflower and perform quality control and characterization tests for different organs of the herb. In this regard, albumin denaturation activity, macroscopic and microscopic, phytochemical, HPTLC, and FT-IR characteristics were investigated. Wallflower showed strong anti-inflammatory activity compared to diclofenac sodium. The root (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL) and flower (10 mg/mL) extract exhibited higher anti-inflammatory activities than that of other plant organs at the same concentrations. Moreover, total ash was found higher in aerial parts (21.52 ± 0.06%) than flower (11.01 ± 0.03%), root (5.03 ± 0.03%), and seed (6.95 ± 0.06%), while water-soluble ash was higher in seed (34.89 ± 0.26%) than flower (5.00 ± 0.03%), aerial parts (7.16 ± 0.06%), and root (5.04 ± 0.01%). Acid-insoluble ash and sulphated ash were higher in root (9.50 ± 0.04%) and aerial part (28.37 ± 0.57%), respectively. In addition, loss on drying was ranged from 2.20 ± 0.20% in flowers to 6.00 ± 0.10% in aerial parts. On the other hand, HPTLC analysis verified cardenolide compounds in all organs of the herb, and quercetin was detected in the flavonoid fingerprint of acid hydrolysed flowers.

This study used PALISADE data to estimate the reduction in the risk of systemic allergic reaction (SAR) after accidental exposure following 1 year of PTAH treatment. METHODS: Participants (aged 4–17 years) enrolled in PALISADE were included. Parametric interval-censoring survival analysis with the maximum likelihood estimation was used to construct a real-world distribution of peanut protein exposure using lifetime SAR history and highest tolerated dose (HTD) from a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge conducted at baseline. The SAR risk reduction was extrapolated using the exposure distribution and the HTD were collected at baseline and trial exit for PTAH- and placebo-treated participants. RESULTS: Assuming a maximum peanut protein intake of 1500 mg, participants were estimated to have < 1% probability of ingesting > 0.01 mg during daily life. The mean annual SAR risk at trial entry was 9.25–9.98%. At trial exit, the relative SAR risk reduction following accidental exposure was 94.9% for PTAH versus 6.4% for placebo. For PTAH-treated participants with exit HTD of 600 or 1000 mg without dose-limiting symptoms, the SAR risk reduction increased to 97.2%. The result was consistent in the sensitivity analysis across different parametric distributions. CONCLUSION: Oral immunotherapy with PTAH is expected to result in a substantially greater reduction in risk of SAR following accidental exposure compared to placebo among children with peanut allergy.

In addition, HNRNPA1, the protein identified as a prognostic marker of ACC based on proteomics, was validated in the immunohistochemistry staining. The prognostic protein biomarkers of ACC found in this study are expected to help determine the appropriate treatment plan for patients. ABSTRACT: Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare disease with a variable prognosis. Current prognostic markers have limitations in identifying patients with a poor prognosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic protein biomarkers of ACC using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. We performed the liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 45 adrenal tumors. Then, we selected 117 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among tumors with different stages using the machine learning algorithm. Next, we conducted a survival analysis to assess whether the levels of DEPs were related to survival. Among 117 DEPs, HNRNPA1, C8A, CHMP6, LTBP4, SPR, NCEH1, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were significantly correlated with the survival of ACC. In age- and stage-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models, only HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 expression remained significant. These five proteins were also validated in TCGA data as the prognostic biomarkers. In this study, we found that HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were protein biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of ACC.","Jang, Han Na; Moon, Sun Joon; Jung, Kyeong Cheon; Kim, Sang Wan; Kim, Hyeyoon; Han, Dohyun; Kim, Jung Hee",Cancers (Basel),162,3

METHODS: Retrospective study. Data on patient demographic, clinical and radiological findings, and administered treatments were collected. Remission status (complete [CR], partial [PR], no remission [NR]), based on changes in the EDSS score was evaluated before treatment, during attack, and at 6 months. CR was analyzed with a generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model. RESULTS: A total of 131 patients (120 NMOSD and 11 myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-antibody-associated diseases [MOGAD]), experiencing 262 NMOSD-related attacks and receiving 270 treatments were included. High-dose steroids (81.4%) was the most frequent treatment followed by plasmapheresis (15.5%). CR from attacks was observed in 47% (105/223) of all treated patients. During the first attack, we observed CR:71.2%, PR:16.3% and NR:12.5% after the first course of treatment. For second, third, fourth, and fifth attacks, CR was observed in 31.1%, 10.7%, 27.3%, and 33.3%, respectively. Remission rates were higher for optic neuritis vs. myelitis (p < 0.001). Predictor of CR in multivariate GEE analysis was age in both NMOSD (OR = 2.27, p = 0.002) and MOGAD (OR = 1.53, p = 0.03).

To fully understand how their microstructure responds to mechanical loading a non-invasive approach for 3D high resolution imaging suitable for soft tissue is required. Here we propose a protocol that can capture the complex 3D organization of the Achilles tendon microstructure, using phase-contrast enhanced synchrotron micro-tomography (SR-PhC-μCT). We investigate the effects that sample preparation and imaging conditions have on the resulting image quality, by considering four types of sample preparations and two imaging setups (sub-micrometric and micrometric final pixel sizes). The image quality is assessed using four quantitative parameters. The results show that for studying tendon collagen fibers, conventional invasive sample preparations such as fixation and embedding are not necessary or advantageous. Instead, fresh frozen samples result in high-quality images that capture the complex 3D organization of tendon fibers in conditions as close as possible to natural. The comprehensive nature of this innovative study by SR-PhC-μCT breaks ground for future studies of soft complex biological tissue in 3D with high resolution in close to natural conditions, which could be further used for in situ characterization of how soft tissue responds to mechanical stimuli on a microscopic level.","Pierantoni, Maria; Silva Barreto, Isabella; Hammerman, Malin; Verhoeven, Lissa; Törnquist, Elin; Novak, Vladimir; Mokso, Rajmund; Eliasson, Pernilla; Isaksson, Hanna",Sci Rep,162,3

This can have different effects on chemokine function, ranging from reduced, unchanged to enhanced activity. CD26 is differentially expressed in tumors, which affects the dominant chemokine isoform present in the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we aim to recapitulate the current knowledge on the interplay between CD26 and chemokine activity in cancer. ABSTRACT: Chemokines are a large family of small chemotactic cytokines that fulfill a central function in cancer. Both tumor-promoting and -impeding roles have been ascribed to chemokines, which they exert in a direct or indirect manner. An important post-translational modification that regulates chemokine activity is the NH(2)-terminal truncation by peptidases. CD26 is a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV), which typically clips a NH(2)-terminal dipeptide from the chemokine. With a certain degree of selectivity in terms of chemokine substrate, CD26 only recognizes chemokines with a penultimate proline or alanine. Chemokines can be protected against CD26 recognition by specific amino acid residues within the chemokine structure, by oligomerization or by binding to cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Upon truncation, the binding affinity for receptors and GAGs is altered, which influences chemokine function. The consequences of CD26-mediated clipping vary, as unchanged, enhanced, and reduced activities are reported. In tumors, CD26 most likely has the most profound effect on CXCL12 and the interferon (IFN)-inducible CXCR3 ligands, which are converted into receptor antagonists upon truncation. Depending on the tumor type, expression of CD26 is upregulated or downregulated and often results in the preferential generation of the chemokine isoform most favorable for tumor progression. Considering the tight relationship between chemokine sequence and chemokine binding specificity, molecules with the appropriate characteristics can be chemically engineered to provide innovative therapeutic strategies in a cancer setting.","De Zutter, Alexandra; Van Damme, Jo; Struyf, Sofie",Cancers (Basel),162,3

DM has also emerged as a commonly reported risk factor among people hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we sought to evaluate whether people with DM who are hospitalized with COVID-19 were more likely to experience poor early outcomes and whether this association remained after adjustment for obesity status. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) COVID-19 Data Registry. The sample included 450 people with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at MGH between March 11, 2020 and April 30, 2020. The primary outcomes were (1) admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and (2) need for mechanical ventilation or death, both within 14 days of presentation to care. Data were obtained by manual chart review and via an EMR-associated database. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between diabetes and these outcomes. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI category and key comorbidities. RESULTS: In this study, 178 (39.6%) of 450 participants had DM and 346 (76.9%) were overweight or obese. People with DM were on average older and had a higher BMI than those without DM. A higher percentage of patients with DM were admitted to the ICU (42.1% vs 29.8%, p=0.007) and required mechanical ventilation or died (46.6% vs 27.7%, p< 0.001), compared with patients without DM (Figure 1). In adjusted models, DM was associated with a greater odds of ICU admission (aOR: 1.58 [95% CI: 1.01–2.46]) and mechanical ventilation or death (2.15 [1.38–3.34). Obesity was associated with a greater odds of ICU admission (2.15 [1.20–3.86]) but not with mechanical ventilation or death (1.52 [0.87–2.67]). Table 1 provides the model results in full. Figure 1. ICU Admission and mechanical ventilation or death within 14-days by diabetes status among 450 people hospitalized with COVID-19 [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Diabetes was associated with poor outcomes within 14-days of presentation to care for COVID-19. These findings remained after adjustment for obesity. Our findings can help guide risk mitigation efforts and patient-centered care decision making for people with DM and obesity, particularly in areas of the US that have a high prevalence of DM and obesity and are in early phases of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

Recent experimental and clinical studies have indicated the cardioprotective role of sildenafil during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was designed to investigate if administration of sildenafil will attenuate post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by regulating miRNA-155 and miR-145 expressions. METHODS: Thirty-two male pigs (weighing 30 ± 2 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups, sildenafil group (n = 8), sildenafil +NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg L) group (n = 8), saline (SA group, n = 8); and sham operation group (sham group, n = 8). Eight minutes of untreated VF was followed by defibrillation in anesthetized, closed-chest pigs. Hemodynamic status and blood samples were obtained at 0 min, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the hearts were removed and analyzed under electron microscopy, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and ultra structural analysis were performed to evaluate myocardial injury. RESULTS: Compared with the sildenafil + L-NAME and saline groups, the sildenafil group had better outcomes in terms of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism parameters as well as 24-h survival rate, and attenuated myocardial injury; In this study, CA pigs showed evidently increased levels of miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p, while the sildenafil treatment decreased the levels of miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p in CA pigs. In addition, the levels of eNOS was decreased in CA pigs, validating sildenafil attenuating post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by regulating miRNA-155 and miR-145 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil group had better outcomes in terms of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism parameters as well as 24-h survival rate, inhibited the increases in the miR-155-5p and miR-145-5p levels and attenuated myocardial injury in a porcine model of CA and resuscitation.

To study the effects of this disruptive situation on the mobility behaviour of entire subgroups, and how they shape their mobility in reaction to the special circumstances, can help to better understand, how people react to external changes. METHODOLOGY: Aim of the study presented in this article was to investigate to what extent, how and in what areas mobility behaviour has changed during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. In addition, a focus was put on the comparison of federal states with and without lockdown in order to investigate a possible contribution of this measure to changes in mobility. We asked respondents via an online survey about their trip purposes and trip frequency, their choice of transport mode and the reasons for choosing it in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. For the analyses presented in this paper, we used the data of 4157survey participants (2512 without lockdown, 1645 with lockdown). RESULTS: The data confirmed a profound impact on the mobility behaviour with a shift away from public transport and increases in car usage, walking and cycling. Comparisons of federal states with and without lockdown revealed only isolated differences. It seems that, even if the lockdown had some minor effects, its role in the observed behavioural changes was minimal.","Anke, Juliane; Francke, Angela; Schaefer, Lisa-Marie; Petzoldt, Tibor",Eur,162,1

Its etiology is mostly viral. In 15%‐30% of cases, group A streptococci (GAS) are detected, which may cause acute rheumatic fever. We have done a worldwide systematic review to compare diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines across countries and regions. Previous reviews of sore throat guidelines were limited to specific regions and/or language; this is the first global review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE (key words: sore throat, pharyngitis, tonsillitis or pharyngotonsillitis, and management, guidance, guideline or recommendation) and on the web sites of major health authorities and associated institutions from Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania and South America. RESULTS: Thirty‐six guidelines were identified from 26 countries. Most common are recommendations relying on the symptom‐ and age‐based Centor or McIsaac scores. However, antibiotic treatment may be based on other symptomatic criteria; in the most extreme approach just sore throat in children. The recommendation of GAS‐specific diagnostic tests is mainly limited to countries where such tests are readily available, although some countries choose not to use them. Penicillins are consistently recommended as first‐line antibiotics. By contrast, guidance for symptomatic treatment is variable and mostly sparse or missing. African countries without sore throat guidelines and Asian countries bypassing them are afflicted by rising antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: The availability of sore throat guidelines varies considerably by region and country. Moreover, important divergence is found among the guidelines regarding diagnostic and treatment criteria. This may be explained by the historical background or adoption of external guidelines, rather than local incidences of GAS infections or acute rheumatic fever. Absence of recommendations on symptomatic treatment in many guidelines is concerning, and raises issues about antimicrobial stewardship, as this should be the mainstay of sore throat management, rather than antibiotics.","Coutinho, Graça; Duerden, Martin; Sessa, Aurelio; Caretta‐Barradas, Sergio; Altiner, Attila",Int J Clin Pract,162,0

Several studies address this issue with feature re-normalization on the output of the convolution. However, these models use a significant amount of learnable parameters for feature re-normalization [41, 48], or assume a binary representation of the certainty of an output [11, 26]. We propose (layer-wise) feature imputation of the missing input values to a convolution. In contrast to learned feature re-normalization [41, 48], our method is efficient and introduces a minimal number of parameters. Furthermore, we propose a revised gradient penalty for image inpainting, and a novel GAN architecture trained exclusively on adversarial loss. Our quantitative evaluation on the FDF dataset reflects that our revised gradient penalty and alternative convolution improves generated image quality significantly. We present comparisons on CelebA-HQ and Places2 to current state-of-the-art to validate our model. (Code is available at: github.com/hukkelas/DeepPrivacy.

METHODS: College students (n = 459; aged 18–23) at a midwestern university completed an online survey in mid-April 2020, which included the State and Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA) and an amended Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaires. Spearman rho correlation coefficients and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The overall sample reported a mean of 5.61(5.43) of GI symptoms. Moderate to severe symptoms of abdominal bloating (31.8%), nausea (16.2%), passing gas (29.1%), abdominal rumbling (28.1%), abdominal cramping (20.4%), diarrhea (18.8%), and constipation (14.7%) were reported in participants. Females had greater GI symptoms compared to males (Females: 6.16 ± 5.39; Males: 4.01 + 4.46; U = 15108.00; P < .001). Females also exhibited higher total State (females: 40.60 + 12.79; males: 35.24 + 11.69; U = 15348.5; P < .001) and Trait (Females: 31.26 + 9.99; Males: 28.52 + 7.59: U = 16218.5; P < .001) anxiety scores compared to males. Higher GI symptoms were significantly related to higher State-Cognitive (r(s) = .476; P < .01); State-Somatic (r(s) = .525; P < .01); Trait-Cognitive (r(s) = .367; P < .01); and Trait-Somatic (r(s) = .500; P < .01) anxiety subscales scores. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms and anxiety were prominent in our sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. Females exhibited higher GI symptoms and State and Trait anxiety compared to males. GI symptoms were positively correlated with State and Trait anxiety. It may be warranted to screen individuals, especially females, for anxiety when presenting with GI symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study explores adolescents’ experiences of what it is like to have a friend who self-harms by cutting and what this experience means for friendship, the wider peer group and psychological well-being. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with a community sample of eight females aged between 13 and 18 years, living in England. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Four superordinate themes emerged: desperately searching for meaning, I will be there at all costs, too hot to handle and identification. Adolescents were concerned about escalations in their friends’ behaviours and felt a sense of duty to help, but the majority experienced a dilemma as to whether to disclose to others and all reported some form of distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the important, yet complex nature of friendship in this context. Friends play a key role in supporting adolescents who self-harm but need greater support managing this role and the effects. Schools/colleges should educate young people about self-harm to increase their knowledge and skills in relation to supporting a friend with this issue. Furthermore, they should promote environments for talking about mental health openly to give young people increased opportunities for help-seeking.","Hall, Sarah; Melia, Yvonne",Child Youth Care Forum,162,17

In low- and middle-income countries, waste pickers underpin the recycling loop of the circular economy. Where informality and working poverty are the norm, waste pickers typically receive little social protection, work in dangerous conditions, and earn low wages. Nevertheless, waste pickers’ work addresses multiscalar environmental problems from localised flooding of plastic-clogged waterways, to preventing the release of greenhouse gases when plastic is burnt. Here, we review recent academic and grey literature on waste picking, the social circular economy, and corporate circularity to understand the role and position of waste pickers in the contemporary circular economy. We explain how given the recent outcry against plastic waste, and subsequent corporate commitments to plastic recycling, there has been greater action on material flows than in support of the people who move these flows. Overall, the corporate response remains limited, with a general preference for recycling over redesign and only a fifth of packaging accounted for. Based on this review, we present two models. The first is a hierarchy of plastic recycling showing the foundational role of waste pickers in the recycled plastics supply chain. As plastics move up the hierarchy, their value increases and working conditions improve. We also propose a new model for a socially restorative circular economy which provides fair pay, safe working conditions, social protection, legal rights, voice, respect, services, and education. Some governments, co-operatives, non-governmental organisations, and businesses are already working towards this—and their work offers pathways towards a new standard of fair trade recycled materials. We argue that for true sustainability and the best version of circularity to be achieved, deeply ingrained social challenges must be resolved.","Barford, Anna; Ahmad, Saffy Rose",Circ.Econ.Sust.,162,17

This property makes these cells particularly appropriate for therapeutic use in regenerative medicine.

We have investigated two different MSCs types, both from dental tissues: dental follicle progenitor stem cells (DFPCs) and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). After osteogenic differentiation, both DFPCs and DPSCs can be reverted to a naïve stem cell-like status; importantly, dedifferentiated DSCs showed a greater potential to further differentiate toward the osteogenic phenotype. Our report aims to demonstrate for the first time that it is possible, under physiological conditions, to control the dedifferentiation of DSCs and that the rerouting of cell fate could potentially be used to enhance their osteogenic therapeutic potential.

Breast thermography supported by deep convolutional neural networks is expected to contribute significantly to early detection and facilitate treatment at an early stage. The goal of this study is to investigate the behavior of different recent deep learning methods for identifying breast disorders. To evaluate our proposal, we built classifiers based on deep convolutional neural networks modelling inception V3, inception V4, and a modified version of the latter called inception MV4. MV4 was introduced to maintain the computational cost across all layers by making the resultant number of features and the number of pixel positions equal. DMR database was used for these deep learning models in classifying thermal images of healthy and sick patients. A set of epochs 3–30 were used in conjunction with learning rates 1 × 10(–3), 1 × 10(–4) and 1 × 10(–5), Minibatch 10 and different optimization methods. The training results showed that inception V4 and MV4 with color images, a learning rate of 1 × 10(–4), and SGDM optimization method, reached very high accuracy, verified through several experimental repetitions. With grayscale images, inception V3 outperforms V4 and MV4 by a considerable accuracy margin, for any optimization methods. In fact, the inception V3 (grayscale) performance is almost comparable to inception V4 and MV4 (color) performance but only after 20–30 epochs. inception MV4 achieved 7% faster classification response time compared to V4. The use of MV4 model is found to contribute to saving energy consumed and fluidity in arithmetic operations for the graphic processor. The results also indicate that increasing the number of layers may not necessarily be useful in improving the performance.","Al Husaini, Mohammed Abdulla Salim; Habaebi, Mohamed Hadi; Gunawan, Teddy Surya; Islam, Md Rafiqul; Elsheikh, Elfatih A.

We studied the safety and efficacy of this change. METHODS: Between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 2020 we prospectively collected data on consecutive unselected patients with UGIB at five large Scottish hospitals. Primary outcomes were length of stay, 30-day mortality and rebleeding. We compared the results with prospective prepandemic descriptive data. RESULTS: 397 patients were included, and 284 index endoscopies were performed. 26.4% of patients had endoscopic intervention at index endoscopy. 30-day all-cause mortality was 13.1% (53/397), and 33.3% (23/69) for pre-existing inpatients. Bleeding-related mortality was 5% (20/397). 30-day rebleeding rate was 6.3% (25/397). 84 patients had GBS 0–3, of whom 19 underwent inpatient endoscopy, 0 had rebleeding and 2 died. Compared with prepandemic data in three centres, there was a fall in mean number of UGIB presentations per week (19 vs 27.8; p=0.004), higher mean GBS (8.3 vs 6.5; p<0.001) with fewer GBS 0–3 presentations (21.5% vs 33.3%; p=0.003) and higher all-cause mortality (12.2% vs 6.8%; p=0.02). Predictors of mortality were cirrhosis, pre-existing inpatient status, age >70 and confirmed COVID-19. 14 patients were COVID-19 positive, 5 died but none from UGIB. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic when services were under severe pressure, extending the low-risk threshold for UGIB inpatient endoscopy to GBS 0–3 appears safe. The higher mortality of patients with UGIB during the pandemic is likely due to presentation of a fewer low-risk patients.","Dunne, Philip; Livie, Victoria; McGowan, Aaron; Siu, Wilson; Chaudhary, Sardar; Groome, Maximillian; Phull, Perminder; Fraser, Andrew; Morris, Allan John; Penman, Ian D; Stanley, Adrian J",Frontline Gastroenterol,162,1

The socioeconomic conditions for implementation of the conceptual project are considered, as well as changes in these factors and corresponding fundamental concepts over the past half century. It is demonstrated how the ideal model of the territorial structure of the cultural landscape is related to the lifestyle of its creator; how his ideas about work and leisure formed the pattern of a regular network of cities surrounded by buffer functional zones with decreasing population density from the center to the periphery, occupied by natural parks and reserves. The big city and wildlife are considered the equivalent poles of the biosphere. The author traces how Russia’s transport infrastructure has changed and how modern transport policy, at least in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, contradicts the ideas of a polarized biosphere. At the same time, the growth of territorial contrasts of socioeconomic development leads to growth of the so-called inner periphery, where the processes of restoration of natural landscapes proceed spontaneously as the anthropogenic load decreases. Some polarization of the landscape favorable for the biosphere, occurs by itself, and this process should not be hindered. The author traces the relationship of his concept with classical works on theoretical geography, in particular, with The Isolated State by I. von Thünen; he talks about the history of penetration of the polarized biosphere into the national geographical science, and outlines paths for further development of this project.","Rodoman, B.

In the early postoperative period, clinicians often find nonspecific indicators of infection. Although leukocytosis may be a sign of a developing infection in the early postoperative period, it may also be part of a normal surgical response. QUESTIONS AND PURPOSES: We determined (1) the natural history of white blood cell values after primary THA and TKA, (2) factors associated with early postoperative leukocytosis, and (3) the predictive value of white blood cell count for early postoperative periprosthetic joint infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using our institutional database, we identified all THA and TKA cases between January 2000 and December 2008. We determined the incidence of leukocytosis and characterized the natural history of postoperative white blood cell counts. We then investigated potential indicators of postoperative leukocytosis, including development of early periprosthetic infection. RESULTS The average postoperative white blood cell count increased to approximately 3 × 10(6) cells/μL over the first 2 postoperative days and then declined to a level slightly higher than the preoperative level by Postoperative Day 4. The incidence of postoperative leukocytosis for all patients was 38%. Factors associated with postoperative leukocytosis included TKA, bilateral procedures, older age, and higher modified Charlson Comorbidity Index. The sensitivity and specificity of white blood cell count for diagnosing early periprosthetic infection were 79% and 46%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative leukocytosis is common after THA and TKA and represents a normal physiologic response to surgery. In the absence of abnormal clinical signs and symptoms, postoperative leukocytosis may not warrant further workup for infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level III, diagnostic study.

The SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as COVID-19, has various clinical presentations, from asymptomatic or mild catarrhal processes to severe pneumonia that rapidly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. In the last few months, much scientific literature has been devoted to descriptions of different aspects of the coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19, particularly venous thromboembolism (VTE). These studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a prothrombotic state reflecting the high cumulative incidence of associated thrombotic events, particularly in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). As regards the coagulopathy observed in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mechanisms that activate coagulation have been hypothesized as being linked to immune responses, through the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that interact with platelets, stimulate the expression of tissue factor, induce an upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, suppress the fibrinolytic system and lead to endothelial dysfunction, triggering thrombogenesis. D-dimer elevation has been recognized as a useful biomarker of poor prognosis, although the best cut-off point for predicting VTE in COVID-19 patients has still not been clarified. This review will try to update all the available scientific information on this important topic with enormous clinical and therapeutic implications.","García-Ortega, Alberto; de la Rosa, David; Oscullo, Grace; Castillo-Villegas, Diego; López-Reyes, Raquel; Martínez-García, Miguel Ángel",Journal of thoracic disease,162,16

Enhancing the hemostatic potential of platelets could lead to further increases in the efficacy of transfusions, particularly for non-compressible torso hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage with coagulopathy, by decreasing blood loss and improving overall patient outcomes. Advances in gene therapies, including RNA therapies, are leading to new strategies to enhance platelets for better control of hemorrhage. This review will highlight three approaches for creating modified platelets using gene therapies: (i) direct transfection of transfusable platelets ex vivo, (ii) in vitro production of engineered platelets from platelet-precursor cells, and (iii) modifying the bone marrow for in vivo production of modified platelets. In summary, modifying platelets to enhance their hemostatic potential is an exciting new frontier in transfusion medicine, but more preclinical development as well as studies testing the safety and efficacy of these agents are needed.","Leung, Jerry; Cau, Massimo F; Kastrup, Christian J",Transfusion,162,1

OBJECTIVE Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an antigen ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The specific and high level of expression in ccRCC makes CAIX an excellent target for imaging ccRCC lesions. We present our experience with immuno-single-photon emission computed tomography (immunoSPECT) imaging with the indium-111 ((111)In)-labeled anti-CAIX antibody girentuximab in patients presenting with either a primary renal tumor or a history of ccRCC and lesions suspect for metastases during follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-nine patients received 100-200 MBq (111)In-labeled girentuximab. Whole-body and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were acquired after 4-7 d. INTERVENTION Injection with (111)In-girentuximab and image acquisition after 4-7 d. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Accuracy of (111)In-girentuximab immunoSPECT. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Distinct uptake of (111)In-girentuximab was seen in 16 of 22 patients presenting with a renal mass. All renal masses proven to be ccRCC after resection (n=15) were detected with (111)In-girentuximab. Suspect lesions of six patients showed no uptake of (111)In-girentuximab. In these patients, ccRCC was not found, nor progression occurred. Seven patients with a history of ccRCC and possible metastatic lesions on follow-up computed tomography scans were imaged with (111)In-girentuximab. In four of these patients, the lesions showed preferential uptake of (111)In-girentuximab and local or systemic treatment was initiated. In three other cases, no (111)In-girentuximab targeting was seen. During follow-up of these three patients, one showed progression, for which systemic treatment was started. In the two other patients, no progression occurred, suggesting a benign nature. CONCLUSIONS (111)In-girentuximab immunoSPECT can be used to detect ccRCC lesions in patients with a primary renal mass and to clarify the nature of lesions suspect for metastases in patients with a history of ccRCC.","Muselaers, Constantijn H J; Boerman, Otto C; Oosterwijk, Egbert; Langenhuijsen, Johannes F; Oyen, Wim J G; Mulders, Peter F A",European urology,162,16

The use of this technique for the placement of fiducial markers in patients with inoperable but early-stage lung cancer could present an innovative approach enabling risk-reduced therapy. METHODS We present seven clinical cases where conventional bronchoscopy and ENB were used as part of an experimental interdisciplinary approach to clinical management and therapy planning. In each case, we analyzed the clinical indication, endoscopic procedures and post-interventional outcome. RESULTS In six patients (three females, three males) with peripheral non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stage cT1cN0cM0, surgery and conventional stereotactic radiation therapy was not possible because of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ENB was used for fiducial marker placement prior to cyberknife radiotherapy. No procedure-related complications were observed. Complete remission could be achieved in four cases, partial remission in two cases and no relevant complications induced by radiotherapy were observed. In one male patient, an endoluminal relapse in the right lower lobe was diagnosed following a right upper lobe resection for a NSCLC. The tumor could not be clearly identified by computerized tomography, so that the bronchoscopic placement of a fiducial marker in the tumor was performed in order to allow stereotactic radiochemotherapy, by which complete remission could be achieved. CONCLUSION Fiducial marker placement may be an interesting bronchoscopic technique in the interdisciplinary therapeutic approach to inoperable early-stage lung cancer. In the described cases, therapy planning was successful and no procedure-related complications were observed.","Hagmeyer, Lars; Priegnitz, Christina; Kocher, Martin; Schilcher, Burkhart; Budach, Wilfried; Treml, Marcel; Stieglitz, Sven; Randerath, Winfried",The clinical respiratory journal,162,23

There is a paucity of observational data from schools and households, particularly in developing countries. Portable wireless sensors can record unbiased proximity events between individuals facing each other, shedding light on pathways of infection transmission. Design and methods: The aim is to characterize face-to-face contact patterns that may shape the transmission of respiratory infections in schools and households in Kilifi, Kenya. Two schools, one each from a rural and urban area, will be purposively selected. From each school, 350 students will be randomly selected proportional to class size and gender to participate. Nine index students from each school will be randomly selected and followed-up to their households. All index household residents will be recruited into the study. A further 3-5 neighbouring households will also be recruited to give a maximum of 350 participants per household setting. The sample size per site is limited by the number of sensors available for data collection. Each participant will wear a wireless proximity sensor lying on their chest area for 7 consecutive days. Data on proximal dyadic interactions will be collected automatically by the sensors only for participants who are face-to-face.

The objective of this study was to compare incision size, wound complications, and postoperative pain of LESS compared with those of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between January and June 2011 at two university hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic or LESS cholecystectomy. Skin and aponeurosis wound sizes were recorded. A 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain at postoperative hours 3 and 24. Healing and wound complications were assessed at follow-up. RESULTS A total of 57 patients, 53 women and 4 men with a mean age of 48.7 years, were randomly assigned to undergo LESS (n = 28) or LC (n = 29). The mean length of the umbilical skin incision was 4.0 cm (range = 2.1-5.8) in LESS and 2.7 cm (1.5-5.1) in LC (p < .0001). The mean internal aponeurosis diameter was 3.5 cm (2.0-5.5) in LESS and 2.3 cm (1.2-3.5) in LC (p < .0001). The mean operative time was 60.3 min (32-128) for LESS and 51.3 min (25-120) for LC (p = 0.11). Gallbladder perforation at detachment occurred in 15.69 % of the LESS cases and in 5.88 % of the LC cases (p = 0.028). The mean VAS score for pain at hour 3 was 2.0 points (0-7) for the LESS group and 4.0 (0-10) for the LC group (p = 0.07), and at postoperative hour 24 it was 0.3 points (0-6) for LESS and 2.3 (0-10) for LC (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in wound complications. Incisional hernias were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS The LESS single-port (SP) operations demand a bigger incision than LC surgery. However, there were no differences in healing, wound infections, and hernia development. We found a tendency of less postoperative pain associated with LESS/SP than with LC.","Madureira, Fernando Athayde Veloso; Manso, José Eduardo Ferreira; Madureira Fo, Delta; Iglesias, Antonio Carlos Garrido",Surgical endoscopy,162,23

This ""incomplete sleeve"" avoids gastric resection or band placement. In this paper, we report our experience of the laparoscopic approach of the technique in a selected obese population excluding prominent grazer and/or sweet eaters. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred patients (39 males, 61 females) underwent the procedure in a prospective trial. Mean age was 40 years (range 18-68). Mean preoperative BMI was 43.2 kg/m(2) (range 35-62). RESULTS The procedure was performed by laparoscopy starting with the creation of a circular opening at the junction of antrum and corpus followed by a vertical stapling to the angle of Hiss. Mean duration of the procedure was 67 (range 40-122) min. No intraoperative complication occurred. Mean hospital stay (SD) was 2.5 (0.9) days. The single postoperative complication consisted in a mild stenosis that responded to endoscopic dilatation. After a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 9-24), mean percentage of excess body weight loss (SD) was 48(14), 59(18) and 68(24)%, respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life appeared satisfactory with a low incidence of gastroesophageal reflux.

Combined with the demand for expansion in the STEM workforce, various retention reforms have been proposed, implemented, and in some cases integrated into policy following evidence of success. Still, new findings, technological advances, and socio-cultural shifts inevitably necessitate an on-going investigation as to how students approach learning. Among other factors, students who enter college without effective study skills are at much greater risk of being unsuccessful in their coursework. In order to construct an equitable learning environment, a mechanism must be developed to provide underprepared students with access to resources or interventions designed to refine the skills they need to be successful in the course. Early, reliable assessments can provide predictions of individual student outcomes in order to guide the development and implementation of such targeted interventions. In the present study, a model is developed to predict students' odds of success based their study approaches, as measured by their responses to twelve survey items from an existing instrument used in the Chemistry Education Research literature designed to measure students' deep and surface learning approaches. The model's prediction specificity ranges from 66.5% to 86.9% by semester. Two distinct sets of lower-performing students are identified in the data: those who align predominantly with surface approaches to learning versus those who indicate using both deep and surface approaches to learning. This supports the idea of a tailored approach to interventions, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Results from this instrument were correlated to students' reported study methods and beliefs.","Atieh, Emily L; York, Darrin M; Muñiz, Marc N",Journal of chemical education,162,20

It is likely that after a few months from the epidemic's onset, personal experience with the virus has altered the person's way to deal with the disease. This study explores the relation between exposure to Zika virus and the social representation of the epidemic. More specifically, one analyzes if increased exposure to the risk of Zika infection changes the characteristics of the web of meanings surrounding the epidemic. Between August and November of 2016, 150 interviews were conducted in the municipality of Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Based on the Free Words Association Technique, data on evocations related to the Zika virus were modeled by social network analysis, allowing the characterization of the web of meanings by level of exposure to the risk of Zika infection. The analysis performed here suggests that those never infected by any disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito have a lesser representation, incorporating information from the media through lay thinking. In contrast to those with low levels of exposure, the social representation of people infected by Zika is associated with meanings related to the most common symptoms, such as pain, rash, and itching. Personal experience seems to shape the social representation of the disease, increasing the focus on its proximate consequences. Public campaigns designed to foster protective behavior should take into consideration the heterogeneity in the representations of this epidemic to improve adherence to preventive behavior.","Guedes, Gilvan Ramalho; Coutinho, Raquel Zanatta; Marteleto, Leticia; Pereira, Wesley Henrique Silva; Duarte, Denise",Cadernos de saude publica,162,17

Millions of people were affected by this pandemic situation and as of now, no effective antiviral drug has been found for the management of this situation. Cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress, hypoxia and multi-organ failure are hallmark clinical conditions of this disease. Trials for several investigational and repurposed drugs are being conducted but none of them were found to be safe and effective. However, for the critically ill patient, plasma therapy, dexamethasone, and remdesivir are included in the treatment protocol. Since long time, various natural drugs have been used as antiviral agents in Indian and Chinese traditional medicines which can be explored as a potential therapeutic option in such situation, it is therefore speculated that proper screening and standardization of these medicines can be a breakthrough in the management and treatment of nCoV-19 infection. As natural products possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory properties and also specifically act on various viral enzymatic machinery and affect their replication process, thus they may be useful as alternatives in relieving symptoms and treatment of nCoV-19 infection. However, only on the basis of their traditional value, discriminate and off-label use of these natural drugs must be prevented and robust preclinical and clinical data along with appropriate guidelines are needed for them to enter into clinical practice.","Iqubal, Ashif; Iqubal, Mohammad Kashif; Ahmed, Musheer; Haque, Syed Ehtaishamul",Current pharmaceutical design,162,1

We aimed to explore this research burden (i.e., the psychological, physical, and financial burdens) experienced by patients through their participation in a RCT. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies exploring adult patients' experiences with RCT participation. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, and Embase (search date March 2018) for eligible reports. Qualitative data coding and indexing were assisted by NVivo. The quality of reports was assessed by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. RESULTS We included 45 qualitative studies that involved 1732 RCT participants. Important psychological burdens were identified at every stage of the trial process. Participants reported feeling anxiety and being afraid of ""being a 'guinea pig'"" and described undergoing randomization and allocation to a placebo as particularly difficult resulting in disappointment, anger, and depression. Patients' follow-up and trial closure were also responsible for a wide range of psychological, physical, and financial burdens. Furthermore, factors related to burdensome impacts and consequences were discerned. These factors involved trial information, poorly organized and too-demanding follow-up, and lack of appropriate management when the patient's participation ended. Trial participation was also associated with beneficial effects such as the satisfaction of feeling ""useful,"" gaining ""a sense of control,"" and receiving special attention. CONCLUSIONS Our finding provides a detailed description of research burden across the whole RCT process. Many of the burdens described could be anticipated, and some avoided in a movement toward minimally disruptive clinical research. Such an approach could improve trial recruitment and retention.

BACKGROUND RVF is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Limited data regarding efficacy of the CF-RVSD for RVF exist. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from 46 patients receiving a CF-RVSD for RVF from a registry comprising data from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in the United States. CF-RVSD use was recorded in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; myocarditis; chronic left heart failure; after valve surgery, orthotopic heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device surgery, coronary bypass grafting. Devices were implanted via the percutaneous (n = 22) or surgical (n = 24) route. RESULTS No intraprocedural mortality was observed. Mean time from admission to CF-RVSD implantation was 5.7 ± 8.5 days, with a mean of 6,769 ± 789 rotations/min, providing 4.2 ± 1.3 l/min of flow. Mean duration of support was 5.4 ± 5.1 days. Mean arterial pressure (65 ± 12 mm Hg vs. 73 ± 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05), right atrial pressure (21 ± 8 mm Hg vs. 16 ± 7 mm Hg; p = 0.05), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (43 ± 15 mm Hg vs. 33 ± 15 mm Hg; p = 0.01), and cardiac index (1.7 ± 0.7 vs. 2.2 ± 0.6; p = 0.01) were improved within 48 h of CF-RVSD implantation. Total in-hospital mortality was 57% and was lowest in the setting of left ventricular assist device implantation, chronic left heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Increased age, biventricular failure, and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-defined major bleeding were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS Use of the CF-RVSD for RVF is clinically feasible and associated with improved hemodynamic status. Observations from the registry of patients who have received this device may support the development of prospective studies that will examine the role of percutaneous circulatory support for RVF.","Kapur, Navin K; Paruchuri, Vikram; Jagannathan, Anand; Steinberg, Daniel; Chakrabarti, Anjan K; Pinto, Duane; Aghili, Nima; Najjar, Samer; Finley, John; Orr, Nicole M; Tempelhof, Michael; Mudd, James O; Kiernan, Michael S; Pham, Duc Thinh; DeNofrio, David",JACC.

Newer radiolabeled somatostatin analogs which can be used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and which have a higher affinity for the somatostatin receptor, especially receptor subtype-2, have been developed. It would be desirable, however, if one radiolabeled analog became the new standard for PET imaging, because the current application of a multitude of analogs implies a fragmented knowledge on the interpretation of the images that are obtained in clinical practice. In our view, the most likely candidates for such a universal PET tracer for SRI are [(68)Ga-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate or [(68)Ga-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide. Treatment with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a promising new tool in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Symptomatic improvement may occur with all (111)In-, (90)Y-, or (177)Lu-labeled somatostatin analogs that have been used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). The results that were obtained with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide and [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate are very encouraging in terms of tumor regression. Also, if kidney protective agents are used, the side effects of this therapy are few and mild, and the median duration of the therapy response for these radiopharmaceuticals is 30 and 40 months respectively. The patients' self-assessed quality of life increases significantly after treatment with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate. Lastly, compared to historical controls, there is a benefit in overall survival of several years from the time of diagnosis in patients treated with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate. These data compare favorably with the limited number of alternative treatment approaches. If more widespread use of PRRT can be guaranteed, such therapy may well become the therapy of first choice in patients with metastasized or inoperable GEPNETs.","Kwekkeboom, Dik J; Kam, Boen L; van Essen, Martijn; Teunissen, Jaap J M; van Eijck, Casper H J; Valkema, Roelf; de Jong, Marion; de Herder, Wouter W; Krenning, Eric P",Endocrine-related cancer,162,26

Areas covered: Emphasizing the literature from the past 5 years, this review covers the current offering of natural, synthetic or composite surgical sealant devices in liquid or patch form, their appropriate clinical indications as well as emerging technologies, strategies and products. Expert commentary: Recent years have been marked by dramatic and continuous progress towards the development of novel surgical sealant devices and their rigorous clinical testing. In addition, next-generation sealant formulations such as active hemostatic sealant patches and bio-inspired or nanoparticle-based sealant concepts have been developed and are constantly being evaluated and refined.","Heher, Philipp; Ferguson, James; Redl, Heinz; Slezak, Paul",Expert review of medical devices,162,1

The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion. AIMS (1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness. METHOD Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations. RESULTS About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed. Increasing people's social inclusion benefits service users in terms of improved mental health, better quality of life and reduced loneliness.","Mezey, Gillian; White, Sarah; Harrison, Isobel; Bousfield, Jennifer; Killaspy, Helen; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Payne, Sarah",The International journal of social psychiatry,162,33

Surgical meshes used for the repair of abdominal wall hernias are associated with wound infection rates ranging from 7 to 18 %. Although mesh infection is relatively rare, once a patient shows clinical signs of mesh infection, the surgeon may be required to remove the mesh, resulting in additional surgery, morbidity, and cost. The usual causative organisms associated with cases of mesh infection are Staphylococcus species. The first stage of implant infection is bacterial adherence to the biomaterial. An accurate assessment of adherent bacteria to medical prosthetics is therefore important in order to determine the infection risk associated with surgical implants. METHODS This experimental study evaluated the relationship between the size of the bacterial inoculum and bacterial adherence to three commonly used hernia prosthetics (polypropylene, polyester, and ePTFE). Tenfold dilutions of S. epidermidis (Evans-ATCC 12228) and S. aureus (Rosenbach-ATCC 25923), created with phosphate-buffered saline, were used to inoculate each of the meshes in 3 ml of tryptone soya broth for 18 h at 37 °C, 95 % air/5 % CO(2). The number of viable bacteria in each dilution was calculated using a spot plate technique. The number of adherent bacteria to the meshes was counted using direct imaging analysis with scanning electron microscopy and expressed as a mean. RESULTS One hundred eight mesh samples were analysed. The size of the bacterial inoculum of S. epidermidis significantly influenced the number of adherent bacteria to the mesh, and lower rates of adhesion were observed with smaller inoculums for all three meshes (polypropylene, p = 0.02; ePTFE p = 0.03; polyester p = 0.02). A similar, albeit less profound, pattern of results was observed with S. aureus. Bacterial adherence was observed with inoculum sizes as small as <10 bacteria. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that even a very low number of bacterial inoculums can result in adherence to hernia biomaterials and that the level of adherence is directly related to the size of the inoculum. These in vitro results provide evidence that the size of the inoculum is important in the colonization of hernia biomaterials and demonstrate the importance of minimising the bacterial inoculum in the clinical setting.","Sanders, David L; Kingsnorth, Andrew N; Lambie, Jaynnie; Bond, Peter; Moate, Roy; Steer, Jane A",Surgical endoscopy,162,31

There were no false-positive results on frozen section analysis. Errors on frozen section analysis interpretation did not negatively impact survival outcomes (mean survival = 2.2 years in those with concordant frozen section analysis vs 1.7 years in those with discordant frozen section analysis, P = .69). CONCLUSIONS Although intraoperative frozen section analysis is helpful for ensuring negative final margins, its usefulness for obtaining histologic diagnosis and determining resectability is limited by low negative predictive potential. These results highlight the importance of preoperative staging and intraoperative surgical judgment for questionable resectable disease.","Nelson, Daniel W; Blanchard, Terin H; Causey, Marlin W; Homann, Joseph F; Brown, Tommy A",American journal of surgery,162,16

Importantly, our previous studies have demonstrated that HAb18G/CD147 is a novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated antigen, and HAb18G/CD147 stimulates adjacent fibroblasts and HCC cells to produce elevated levels of several matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. In addition, HAb18G/CD147 has also been shown to be a novel universal cancer biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic assessment of a wide range of cancers. However, the structural basis underlying the multifunctional character of CD147 remains unresolved. We report here the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of HAb18G/CD147 at 2.8A resolution. The structure comprises an N-terminal IgC2 domain and a C-terminal IgI domain, which are connected by a 5-residue flexible linker. This unique C2-I domain organization is distinct from those of other IgSF members. Four homophilic dimers exist in the crystal and adopt C2-C2 and C2-I dimerization rather than V-V dimerization commonly found in other IgSF members. This type of homophilic association thus presents a novel model for homophilic interaction between C2 domains of IgSF members. Moreover, the crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147 provides a good structural explanation for the established multifunction of CD147 mediated by homo/hetero-oligomerizations and should represent a general architecture of other CD147 family members.","Yu, Xiao-Ling; Hu, Tiancen; Du, Jia-Mu; Ding, Jian-Ping; Yang, Xiang-Min; Zhang, Jian; Yang, Bin; Shen, Xu; Zhang, Zheng; Zhong, Wei-De; Wen, Ning; Jiang, Hualiang; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-Nan",The Journal of biological chemistry,162,1

There is increasing evidence that implicates viral infections as a major risk factor for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies have attempted to better characterize the epidemiology of viral infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, identify unique clinical manifestations of virus-associated exacerbations, and develop new diagnostic tools and treatments. RECENT FINDINGS Rhinovirus, the organism most often responsible for causing the common cold, is also the most common infectious cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus are other important viral causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. These exacerbations can be severe with prolonged recovery times. Although PCR technology has dramatically increased the detection rate of viruses in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it does not differentiate infection from colonization. The use of biomarkers represents an exciting new potential diagnostic tool that may lend new insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. SUMMARY Despite strong epidemiologic evidence linking respiratory virus infection to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which viruses cause exacerbations remain undetermined. Future research efforts to understand these mechanisms would aid the development of novel therapeutics to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease.","Varkey, Jay B; Varkey, Basil",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,162,16

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of 173 women who underwent LSH with bipolar electrocoagulation of the endocervical canal at Landeskrankenhaus Wolfsberg, Wolfsberg, Austria, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Long-term follow-up was assessed using a questionnaire. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis of 13 studies that reported on PCB after LSH were also conducted. RESULTS In all, 164 women (94.8%) had uneventful intraoperative and postoperative courses. By contrast, 9 of 146 premenopausal women (6.2%) experienced PCB. The meta-analysis (n=1822) revealed an overall PCB rate of 7.1%. Bipolar electrocoagulation of the endocervical canal was the most effective method for prevention of PCB (bleeding rate, 2.9%) followed by unipolar electrocoagulation (bleeding rate, 9.9%). Uterine resection below the internal cervical orifice was more effective for preventing PCB (13 of 633 women; 2.1%) than either amputation at this site or above this site (27 of 537 women [5.0%] and 88 of 640 women [13.8%]). CONCLUSION Bipolar coagulation of the endocervical canal and extensive resection with amputation below the level of the internal cervical orifice were effective for reducing rates of PCB.","Nouri, Kazem; Demmel, Maurus; Greilberger, Ulrike; Fischer, Eva-Maria; Seemann, Rudolf; Egarter, Christian; Ott, Johannes",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,162,32

The objective of this systematic review was to examine how combinations of physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep duration relate to depressive symptoms and other mental health indicators among children and adolescents. METHODS Literature was obtained through searching Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus up to September 30, 2019. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included if they met the following criteria: population (apparently healthy children and adolescents with a mean age of 5-17 years), intervention/exposure (combinations of physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep duration), and outcomes (depressive symptoms and other mental health indicators). A risk of bias assessment was completed for all included studies using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence for each health indicator. Narrative syntheses were employed to describe the results due to high levels of heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS A total of 13 cross-sectional studies comprised in 10 papers met inclusion criteria. Data across studies involved 115,540 children and adolescents from 12 countries. Overall, the findings indicated favourable associations between meeting all 3 recommendations and better mental health indicators among children and adolescents when compared with meeting none of the recommendations. There was evidence of a dose-response gradient between an increasing number of recommendations met and better mental health indicators. Meeting the screen time and sleep duration recommendations appeared to be associated with more mental health benefits than meeting the physical activity recommendation. The quality of evidence reviewed was ""very low"" according to GRADE. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate favourable associations between meeting all 3 movement behaviour recommendations in the 24-h guidelines and better mental health indicators among children and adolescents. There is a clear need for high-quality studies that use robust measures of all movement behaviours and validated measures of mental health to increase our understanding in this topic area.","Sampasa-Kanyinga, Hugues; Colman, Ian; Goldfield, Gary S; Janssen, Ian; Wang, JianLi; Podinic, Irina; Tremblay, Mark S; Saunders, Travis J; Sampson, Margaret; Chaput, Jean-Philippe",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,162,16

We report the incidence of thrombotic and bleeding events in a single center cohort of 30 consecutive patients with COVID-19 supported by veno-venous extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) and who had a whole body Computed Tomography Scanner (CT) on admission. METHODOLOGY All patients were initially admitted to other hospitals and later assessed and retrieved by our ECMO team. ECMO was initiated in the referral center and all patients admitted through our CT scan before settling in our intensive care unit. Clinical management was guided by our institutional ECMO guidelines, established since 2011 and applied to at least 40 patients every year. RESULTS We diagnosed a thrombotic event in 13 patients on the initial CT scan. Two of these 13 patients subsequently developed further thrombotic complications. Five of those 13 patients had a subsequent clinically significant major bleeding. In addition, two patients presented with isolated intracranial bleeds. Of the 11 patients who did not have baseline thrombotic events, one had a subsequent oropharyngeal hemorrhage. When analyzed by ROC analysis, the area under the curve for % time in intended anticoagulation range did not predict thrombosis or bleeding during the ECMO run (0.36 (95% CI 0.10-0.62); and 0.51 (95% CI 0.25-0.78); respectively).

The birds develop dark green and extremely foul-smelling diarrhea starting at 8-10 wk of age, which may last up to 15-16 wk of age. The affected turkey flocks show poor uniformity, and feed conversion and market weights are reduced. Multiple-age farms are affected more often than the single-age farms. Morbidity varies from flock to flock and in some cases reaches 100%. At necropsy, undigested feed with increased mucus is observed in the intestines along with prominent mucosal congestion and/or hemorrhage. Microscopically, lymphocytic infiltrates expand the villi in duodenum and jejunum to form lymphoid follicles, which are often accompanied by heterophils. Next generation sequencing (Illumina Miseq) on a pool of feces from affected birds identified genetic sequences of viruses belonging to Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Adenoviridae. On testing pools of fecal samples from apparently healthy (16 pools) and affected birds (30 pools), there was a higher viral load in the feces of affected birds. Picobirnavirus was detected only in the affected birds; 20 of 30 pools (66.7%) were positive. These results indicate that a high viral load of turkey picobirnavirus alone, or in association with novel picornaviruses, may be a cause of this new type of turkey enteritis.","Mor, Sunil K; Kumar, Rahul; Sobhy, Nader M; Singh, Azad; Kakrudi, Nima; Marusak, Rosemary A; Goyal, Sagar M; Porter, Robert E",Avian diseases,162,17

Prior studies on sex disparities were limited by moderate sample sizes, varying years of data acquisition, and inconsistent inclusions of covariates leading to controversial findings. We aimed to analyze sex differences in AIS severity, treatments, and early outcome and to systematically evaluate the effect of important covariates in a large German stroke registry. METHODS Analyses were based on the Stroke Registry of Northwestern Germany from 2000 to 2018. We focused on admission-stroke severity and disability, acute recanalization treatment, and early stroke outcomes. Potential sex divergences were investigated via odds ratio (OR) using logistic regression models. Covariates were introduced in 3 steps: (1) base models (age and admission year), (2) partially adjusted models (additionally corrected for acute stroke severity and recanalization treatment), (3) fully adjusted models (additionally adjusted for onset-to-admission time interval, prestroke functional status, comorbidities, and stroke cause). Models were separately fitted for the periods 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to 2018. RESULTS Data from 761 106 patients with AIS were included. In fully adjusted models, there were no sex differences with respect to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (2000-2009: OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.0 [0.98-1.02]), but women were more likely to receive intraarterial therapy (2010-2018: OR, 1.12 [1.08-1.15]). Despite higher disability on admission (2000-2009: OR, 1.10 [1.07-1.13]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.09 [1.07-1.10]), female patients were more likely to be discharged with a favorable functional outcome (2003-2009: OR, 1.05 [1.02-1.09]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.05 [1.04-1.07]) and experienced lower in-hospital mortality (2000-2009: OR, 0.92 [0.86-0.97]; 2010-2018: OR, 0.91 [0.88-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS Female patients with AIS have a higher chance of receiving intraarterial treatment that cannot be explained by clinical characteristics, such as age, premorbid disability, stroke severity, or cause. Women have a more favorable in-hospital recovery than men because their higher disability upon admission was followed by a lower in-hospital mortality and a higher likelihood of favorable functional outcome at discharge after adjustment for covariates.","Bonkhoff, Anna K; Karch, André; Weber, Ralph; Wellmann, Jürgen; Berger, Klaus",Stroke,162,23

However, it remains unknown whether these factors can drive variable aponeurosis behaviors across different muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengths and influence the subsequent fascicle strains during contraction. Here, we used ultrasound and elastography techniques to examine in vivo muscle fascicle behavior and central aponeurosis deformations of human tibialis anterior (TA) during force-matched voluntary isometric dorsiflexion contractions at three MTU lengths. We found that increases in TA MTU length increased both the length and apparent longitudinal stiffness of the central aponeurosis at low and moderate muscle forces (P < 0.01). We also found that increased aponeurosis stiffness was directly related to reduced magnitudes of TA muscle fascicle shortening for the same change in force (P < 0.01). The increase in slope and shift to longer overall lengths of the active aponeurosis force-length relationship as MTU length increased was likely due to a combination of parallel lengthening of aponeurosis and greater transverse aponeurosis strains. This study provides in vivo evidence that human aponeurosis stiffness is increased from low to moderate forces and that the fascicle strains for a given muscle force are MTU length dependent. Further testing is warranted to determine whether MTU length-dependent stiffness is a fundamental property of the aponeurosis in pennate muscles and evaluate whether this property can enhance muscle performance.","Raiteri, Brent James; Cresswell, Andrew Graham; Lichtwark, Glen Anthony",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,162,1

In general, a large number of training samples are required to improve the reconstruction performance of a certain model. However, in real clinical applications, it is difficult to obtain tens of thousands of raw patient data to train the model since saving k-space data is not in the routine clinical flow. Therefore, enhancing the generalizability of a network based on small samples is urgently needed. In this study, three novel applications were explored based on parallel imaging combined with the GAN model (PI-GAN) and transfer learning. The model was pre-trained with public Calgary brain images and then fine-tuned for use in (1) patients with tumors in our center; (2) different anatomies, including knee and liver; (3) different k-space sampling masks with acceleration factors (AFs) of 2 and 6. As for the brain tumor dataset, the transfer learning results could remove the artifacts found in PI-GAN and yield smoother brain edges. The transfer learning results for the knee and liver were superior to those of the PI-GAN model trained with its own dataset using a smaller number of training cases. However, the learning procedure converged more slowly in the knee datasets compared to the learning in the brain tumor datasets. The reconstruction performance was improved by transfer learning both in the models with AFs of 2 and 6. Of these two models, the one with AF = 2 showed better results. The results also showed that transfer learning with the pre-trained model could solve the problem of inconsistency between the training and test datasets and facilitate generalization to unseen data.","Lv, Jun; Li, Guangyuan; Tong, Xiangrong; Chen, Weibo; Huang, Jiahao; Wang, Chengyan; Yang, Guang",Computers in biology and medicine,162,16

Morbid obesity entails increased risk for thromboembolic events. There is no clear protocol for thromboembolic prophylaxis, regarding timing and length of treatment, in bariatric surgery. Thromboelastography provides data on a coagulation process from creation of the clot until the fibrinolysis. METHODS Ninety-three morbidly obese patients were prospectively recruited within a 2-year period. Coagulation profile was measured by thromboelastography before surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, within 3 h from surgery, and in the late postoperative period, within 10-14 days after surgery. Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis was achieved by giving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), once a day. RESULTS Of the eligible patients, 67 underwent sleeve gastrectomy while 23 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Normal values of coagulation factor function, clotting time, and fibrin function, as measured by R, K, and α (angle), were demonstrated in addition to higher maximal amplitude (MA) values, reflecting increased function of platelets. The average MA value before the surgery was above normal and continued rising consistently in the immediate postoperative as well as in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS Morbidly obese patients have a strong tendency toward thrombosis, as demonstrated by pathologically elevated MA values. Altered coagulation profiles were demonstrated 2 weeks postoperatively; thus, prophylaxis that continued at least for 2 weeks after bariatric surgery should be considered. Since LMW heparin is not sufficient alone as thromboembolic prophylaxis, we recommend adding antiplatelet therapy. Further evaluation of appropriate thromboprophylaxis is warranted.","Moaad, Farraj; Zakhar, Bramnik; Anton, Kvasha; Moner, Merie; Wisam, Sbeit; Safy, Farraj; Igor, Waksman",Obesity surgery,162,30

The classical CPP octaarginine (R8) enabled antisense peptide-nucleic-acid (PNA) oligomer delivery into nearly 100% of human blood-derived macrophages without apparent cytotoxicity even up to micromolar concentrations.

Interestingly, although it is often believed that fairly high concentrations (μM) are needed to achieve antisense activity, our PNA-R8 was effective at 200 nM. RNA-seq characterized microRNA-155 as a broad-acting riboregulator, feedback restraining a late myeloid differentiation-induced pro-inflammatory network, comprising MyD88-signalling and ubiquitin-proteasome components. Our results highlight the important role of the microRNA machinery in fine-control of blood-derived human phagocyte immunity and open the door for further studies on regulatory RNAs in difficult-to-transfect primary human immune cells.","Linden, Greta; Janga, Harshavardhan; Franz, Matthias; Nist, Andrea; Stiewe, Thorsten; Schmeck, Bernd; Vázquez, Olalla; Schulte, Leon N",RNA biology,162,19

It is usually prescribed with Fructus evodiae as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas. Here we report the influences of Fructus evodiae on the pharmacokinetics of the Rhizoma coptidis alkaloids and propose possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pharmacokinetic experiments were performed in rats. In vitro absorption experiments were performed in everted rat gut sacs, while in vitro metabolism experiments and determination of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 mRNA expression were performed in rat liver microsomes. RESULTS Pretreatment with Fructus evodiae extract for two weeks decreased the systemic exposure of the Rhizoma coptidis alkaloids. This effect was not due to inhibition of absorption or enhanced hepatic phase I metabolism of the Rhizoma coptidis alkaloids. However, Fructus evodiae pretreatment enhanced both the activity and expression of hepatic UGT1A1. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that Fructus evodiae pretreatment decreased the systemic exposure of the Rhizoma coptidis alkaloids by inducing hepatic UGT1A1.","Ma, Bing-Liang; Yao, Meng-Kan; Han, Xiang-Hui; Ma, Yue-Ming; Wu, Jia-Sheng; Wang, Chang-Hong",Journal of ethnopharmacology,162,31

Health care institutions rapidly transitioned to telehealth to provide care to patients. Prior to the pandemic, telehealth services extended mostly to patients with established diagnoses. Driven by a necessity to provide care to all patients during the pandemic, neurologists started evaluating new patients also via telehealth. OBJECTIVE To explore opportunities, challenges, and feasibility of telehealth for new patients with neuromuscular disorders. METHODS New patient visits performed in our neuromuscular clinic were analyzed from March 18, 2020 - July 31, 2020. Data collected included visit volume, demographics, geographic distance of patient's residence from our institution, and no-show and cancellation rates. RESULTS Total number of patients seen was 1,471; 472 (32%) were new patients. No-show and cancellation rates for telehealth visits were lower than historical in-person visits. There was a wide range of ages (35-74 years) with representation of new patients from a large geographical territory. CONCLUSION This study advances our understanding regarding the adoption and implementation of telehealth for new patients. Our clinic was able to provide timely access and care to a significant number of patients who could not travel to our institution during COVID-19.","Khan, Shaida; Kramer, Alan; McIver, Johnathan; Cady, Leah; Trivedi, Jaya R",Work,162,1

The Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), a contemporary instrument employed to measure SWB, was also examined for its psychometric performance to substantiate its use. METHOD A total of 302 older adults (age 65 + years) and 158 younger adults (age 35-46 years) were recruited from different districts. Data were collected by individual face-to-face interviews. RESULT While elderly people living in severely infected districts showed significantly lower levels of SWB, these levels and those of the younger sample were found to remain within the normative range. A major mitigating factor was an increased sense of community-connectedness. Other characteristics linked to low wellbeing levels included chronic illness, female gender, low education and unemployment. The living districts, characterized by varying extents of infection, had stronger associations with SWB than participants' age. The PWI demonstrated good psychometric performance and also more robustness with elderly people, including its sensitivity to the sense of population threat. CONCLUSION Psychological resilience was identified among both the elderly and younger age-groups in Hong Kong during the SARS pandemic. The PWI is verified as a suitable instrument for SWB measurements.","Lau, Anna L D; Chi, Iris; Cummins, Robert A; Lee, Tatia M C; Chou, Kee-L; Chung, Lawrence W M",Aging & mental health,162,1

Primary care's response to the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is arguably the most impactful natural experiment in our lifetime. EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19: We briefly describe the OCHIN PBRN of community health centers (CHCs), its partnership with implementation scientists, and how we are leveraging this infrastructure and expertise to create a rapid research response evaluating how CHCs across the country responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 RESEARCH ROADMAP: Our research agenda focuses on asking: How has care delivery in CHCs changed due to COVID-19? What impact has COVID-19 had on the delivery of preventive services in CHCs? Which PBRN services (e.g., data surveillance, training, evidence synthesis) are most impactful to real-world practices? What decision-making strategies were used in the PBRN and its practices to make real-time changes in response to the pandemic? What critical factors in successfully and sustainably transforming primary care are illuminated by pandemic-driven changes? DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS PBRNs enable real-world evaluation of practice change and natural experiments, and thus are ideal laboratories for implementation science research. We present a real-time example of how a PBRN Implementation Laboratory activated a response to study a historic natural experiment, to help other PBRNs charting a course through this pandemic.","DeVoe, Jennifer E; Likumahuwa-Ackman, Sonja M; Angier, Heather E; Huguet, Nathalie; Cohen, Deborah J; Flocke, Susan A; Marino, Miguel; Gold, Rachel",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,162,1

Therefore, a constant and timely effort is needed to identify new HIV-1 inhibitors active against drug-resistant variants. The ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a very promising target, but to date, still lacks an efficient inhibitor. Here, we characterize the mode of action of N'-(2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoylhydrazone (compound 13), an N-acylhydrazone derivative that inhibited viral replication (EC50 = 10 µM), while retaining full potency against the NNRTI-resistant double mutant K103N-Y181C virus. Time-of-addition and biochemical assays showed that compound 13 targeted the reverse-transcription step in cell-based assays and inhibited the RT-associated RNase H function, being >20-fold less potent against the RT polymerase activity. Docking calculations revealed that compound 13 binds within the RNase H domain in a position different from other selective RNase H inhibitors; site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed interactions with conserved amino acid within the RNase H domain, suggesting that compound 13 can be taken as starting point to generate a new series of more potent RNase H selective inhibitors active against circulating drug-resistant variants.","Corona, Angela; Ballana, Ester; Distinto, Simona; Rogolino, Dominga; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Carcelli, Mauro; Badia, Roger; Riveira-Muñoz, Eva; Esposito, Francesca; Parolin, Cristina; Esté, José A; Grandi, Nicole; Tramontano, Enzo",Viruses,162,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty adult Yorkshire pigs were randomly assigned to four groups: transgastric NOTES (gNOTES), transrectal NOTES (rNOTES), transvaginal NOTES (vNOTES), and laparoscopy (LAP). At the end of a 30-min peritoneoscopy with identification of seven predetermined organs, an array of eight receivers and the recorder were attached to the abdominal wall. The CE was delivered into the antrum with the help of an endoscope and a polypectomy snare. Animals were kept alive for 14 d. RESULTS Median time for surgery was longer in gNOTES (56 min, range 47-63) and vNOTES (54 min, range 44-79) than in LAP (32 min, range 32-33; P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) and in rNOTES (45.5 min, range 33-56) (P = ns). This increase was related to a larger incision and longer closure times. Images from the CE were successfully retrieved in 19 cases. The CE was retained in the stomach in all animals in gNOTES (459 min; range 360-600), but only in one animal in rNOTES and vNOTES and in none in the LAP group. Failure of passage of the CE beyond the stomach was associated with gNOTES and longer closure of the incision. Animals in the gNOTES group gained less weight than the others and this change was statistical significant when compared with vNOTES animals (1.7 kg, range -1.98 to 4.5 versus 8.4 kg, range 5.8 to 11.45; P < 0.01).

The study objectives were to describe guideline adherence and understand reasons for variation in EoE practice among pediatric gastroenterologists following publication of the updated 2018 international EoE guidelines. METHODS We developed and administered a 28-item survey to pediatric gastroenterologists via an email listserv using the PEDGI Bulletin Board from 03/2019 to 04/2019. The survey was developed using evidence-based review, expert validation, and cognitive interviews. Survey domains included respondent knowledge of and adherence to published guidelines, diagnostic and management approach and rationale, and participant demographics. Analysis included descriptive statistics and tests for association. RESULTS A total of 288 pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey, most of whom practiced in an academic center (73%). More than half (63%) reported knowledge of the 2018 updated guidelines; however, only 52% agreed with them and 50% reported adherence. Respondents who reported not agreeing with updated guidelines cited concerns regarding increasing number of endoscopies (72%), misdiagnosing eosinophilia from reflux (56%), and insufficient data (23%). The most common drivers of decision making with respect to therapy choice were patient/family preference, evidence/guidelines, and symptom burden. CONCLUSIONS Many physicians are not adherent to current guidelines for reasons which include lack of knowledge of updated guidelines and concern regarding the strength of the supporting evidence.

In this study, the relationship between BMI and chronobiological preferences was examined and a weight loss program was applied to refractory obese patients with evening type (ET). METHOD The study included 50 obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2 ), 50 overweight (BMI=25-29 kg/m2 ), and 50 normal normal-weight (BMI<25 kg/m2 ). The patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire including questions about sociodemographic characteristics, breakfast, and night eating habits, as well as the MEQ. In the second stage of the study, awareness interviews were held with ET obese patients in terms of eating time and habits. RESULTS A statistically significant difference was observed between the BMI averages and the MEQ scores of ET, Intermediate type (IT), and morning type (MT) groups (p=0.0001). There was a statistically significant difference between the ET, IT, and MT groups in terms of the distribution of late-night eating habits (p=0.0001). The habit of skipping breakfast and taking more calories at dinner was found to be high in the ET patients (respectively; p=0.021, p<0.001). According to the results of the 3-month follow-up and intervention, the ET patients lost an average of 9.07±SD kg and a significant decrease was observed in the BMI scores (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study results support the idea that an individualized weight loss program according to the patient's chronotype preferences may increase the success rate of obesity treatment. A weight loss program that includes the timing of food intake and regulation of eating habits in evening-type obese patients can be used in the treatment of obesity.","Gamsızkan, Zerrin; Önmez, Attila; Karakaş, Tuba Sahip",International journal of clinical practice,162,1

Median sample size was 133 participants. Vitamin D increased maternal/cord serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, but the dose-response effect was weak. Maternal clinical outcomes were rarely ascertained or reported, but available data did not provide evidence of benefits. Overall, vitamin D increased mean birth weight of 58.33 g (95% confidence interval 18.88 g to 97.78 g; 37 comparisons) and reduced the risk of small for gestational age births (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.90; seven comparisons), but findings were not robust in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. There was no effect on preterm birth (1.0, 0.77 to 1.30; 15 comparisons). There was strong evidence that prenatal vitamin D reduced the risk of offspring wheeze by age 3 years (0.81, 0.67 to 0.98; two comparisons). For most outcomes, meta-analyses included data from a minority of trials. Only eight of 43 trials (19%) had an overall low risk of bias. Thirty five planned/ongoing randomised controlled trials could contribute 12 530 additional participants to future reviews.Conclusions Most trials on prenatal vitamin D published by September 2017 were small and of low quality. The evidence to date seems insufficient to guide clinical or policy recommendations. Future trials should be designed and powered to examine clinical endpoints, including maternal conditions related to pregnancy (such as pre-eclampsia), infant growth, and respiratory outcomes.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42016051292.","Roth, Daniel E; Leung, Michael; Mesfin, Elnathan; Qamar, Huma; Watterworth, Jessica; Papp, Eszter",BMJ,162,1

METHODS Data from ≥15 year old clinically examined dentate participants in three 2-year survey cycles (NHANES 2011-2016) were analyzed. The 2015-2016 data include restorative material type, allowing for the first time a US estimate of amalgam-restored teeth. RESULTS The percent of the US population with at least one restoration (65.8 ± 1.4) was relatively constant in 2011-2016. Among those with restored teeth, the mean number of teeth with amalgam restorations increased with age from 4.71 among 15-24 year olds to 7.03 among those ≥75 years. Non-Hispanic Whites with restored teeth had the highest mean of teeth with amalgam restorations (5.94), while non-Hispanic Blacks had the lowest (5.08). CONCLUSION In 2015-2016, about half (51.5 percent) of restored teeth in the US population contained amalgam. Amalgam presence varied by age, tooth type, and race/ethnicity, but not by sex. These estimates can be used to assess future US caries prevention and dental amalgam reduction efforts.","Estrich, Cameron G; Lipman, Ruth D; Araujo, Marcelo W B",Journal of public health dentistry,162,1

DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Freestanding tertiary care academic pediatric hospital. PATIENTS Sixty-five consecutive children undergoing tracheotomy over 15 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative wound complications objectively and independently documented by an advanced practice nurse specializing in tracheotomy care. Secondary outcome measures included comorbidities, mortality rates, and wound status after subsequent examinations and management. RESULTS The mean (SEM) patient age at tracheotomy was 45 (8.7) months (median age, 9.1 months). The most common indication for tracheotomy was pulmonary disease (36.9%), followed by neurologic impairment and laryngeal abnormalities. There were 19 patients (29%) with and 46 patients (71%) without wound complications. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in age (P = .68) or weight (P = .55); however, infants younger than 12 months had an increased complication rate (39% vs. 17%, P = .04). The type of tracheotomy tube was predictive of postoperative wound complications (P = .02). All patients with wounds received aggressive local wound care. Five of 13 patients had complete resolution of stomal wounds, whereas 8 patients had persistent wound issues. There were 5 non-wound-related mortalities. CONCLUSIONS With attempts to classify tracheotomy wound breakdowns as reportable events, including never events, increasing emphasis is being placed on posttracheotomy care. This study demonstrates that wound breakdown in pediatric tracheotomy patients is common. These complications can be mitigated, although not prevented completely, with aggressive wound surveillance and specialized wound care.","Jaryszak, Eric M; Shah, Rahul K; Amling, June; Peña, Maria T",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,162,12

To define thresholds for tolerable impacts, there is a need for methods that can accurately monitor shock impacts in real-life settings. Therefore, the main aim of this scoping review was to present an overview of existing methods for assessments of shock impacts using wearable sensor technology within two domains: sports and occupational settings. Online databases were used to identify papers published in 2010-2020, from which we selected 34 papers that used wearable sensor technology to measure shock impacts. No studies were found on occupational settings. For the sports domain, accelerometry was the dominant type of wearable sensor technology utilized, interpreting peak acceleration as a proxy for impact. Of the included studies, 28 assessed foot strike in running, head impacts in invasion and team sports, or different forms of jump landings or plyometric movements. The included studies revealed a lack of consensus regarding sensor placement and interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the identified high proportion of validation studies support previous concerns that wearable sensors at present are inadequate as a stand-alone method for valid and accurate data on shock impacts in the field.","Eitzen, Ingrid; Renberg, Julie; Færevik, Hilde",Sensors,162,16

Implementation strategies that potentially impact implementation outcomes and implementation success have been identified. Which strategies are actually used in the implementation of eHealth interventions for patients with chronic illness and which ones are the most effective is unclear. OBJECTIVE This systematic realist review aimed to summarize evidence from empirical studies regarding (1) which implementation strategies are used when implementing eHealth interventions for patients with chronic illnesses living at home, (2) implementation outcomes, and (3) the relationship between implementation strategies, implementation outcomes, and degree of implementation success. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they described implementation strategies used to support the integration of eHealth interventions into practice. Implementation strategies were categorized according to 9 categories defined by the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change project: (1) engage consumers, (2) use evaluative and iterative strategies, (3) change infrastructure, (4) adapt and tailor to the context, (5) develop stakeholder interrelationships, (6) use financial strategies, (7) support clinicians, (8) provide interactive assistance, and (9) train and educate stakeholders. Implementation outcomes were extracted according to the implementation outcome framework by Proctor and colleagues: (1) acceptability, (2) adoption, (3) appropriateness, (4) cost, (5) feasibility, (6) fidelity, (7) penetration, and (8) sustainability. Implementation success was extracted according to the study authors' own evaluation of implementation success in relation to the used implementation strategies. RESULTS The implementation strategies management support and engagement, internal and external facilitation, training, and audit and feedback were directly related to implementation success in several studies. No clear relationship was found between the number of implementation strategies used and implementation success. CONCLUSIONS This is the first review examining implementation strategies, implementation outcomes, and implementation success of studies reporting the implementation of eHealth programs for patients with chronic illnesses living at home. The review indicates that internal and external facilitation, audit and feedback, management support, and training of clinicians are of importance for eHealth implementation. The review also points to the lack of eHealth studies that report implementation strategies in a comprehensive way and highlights the need to design robust studies focusing on implementation strategies in the future.

Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral enrichment. We tested viral culture coupled with third-generation sequencing for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses. Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, 2 influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding. Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with a minimum of 20× coverage depth for all 7 viruses, including a sample containing 2 viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26× coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the CDV sample through a pipeline devoid of CDV reference sequences modeled the ability of this protocol to detect unknown viruses. Our results show the ability of this technique to detect and characterize dsRNA, negative- and positive-sense ssRNA, and nonsegmented and segmented RNA viruses.","Young, Kelsey T; Lahmers, Kevin K; Sellers, Holly S; Stallknecht, David E; Poulson, Rebecca L; Saliki, Jerry T; Tompkins, Stephen Mark; Padykula, Ian; Siepker, Chris; Howerth, Elizabeth W; Todd, Michelle; Stanton, James B","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",162,1

METHODS We assessed CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with CSF biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation (CSF white blood cell count, neopterin, β2-microglobulin (β2M) and immunoglobulin G-index), blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity (albumin ratio), and axonal injury (CSF neurofilament light chain protein [NfL]) in 6 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms who had undergone a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Neurologic symptoms and signs included features of encephalopathies (4/6), suspected meningitis (1/6) and dysgeusia (1/6). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by rtPCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the plasma of 2 patients (Cycle threshold [Ct] value 35.0-37.0) and in CSF at low levels (Ct 37.2, 38.0, 39.0) in 3 patients in one but not in a second rtPCR assay. CSF neopterin (median, 43.0 nmol/L) and β2-microglobulin (median, 3.1 mg/L) were increased in all. Median IgG-index (0.39), albumin ratio (5.35) and CSF white blood cell count (<3 cells/µL) were normal in all, while CSF NfL was elevated in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Our results on patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms suggest an unusual pattern of marked CSF inflammation in which soluble markers were increased but white cell response and other immunologic features typical of CNS viral infections were absent. While our initial hypothesis centered on CNS SARS-CoV-2 invasion, we could not convincingly detect SARS-CoV-2 as the underlying driver of CNS inflammation. These features distinguish COVID-19 CSF from other viral CNS infections, and raise fundamental questions about the CNS pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Edén, Arvid; Kanberg, Nelly; Gostner, Johanna; Fuchs, Dietmar; Hagberg, Lars; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Lindh, Magnus; Price, Richard W; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",Neurology,162,11

BACKGROUND Equipment utilization for AWE has been variable and evolving over time. METHODS We examined device utilization during 694 AWE attempts in 679 patients performed at 15 experienced US centers between May 2012 and April 2015. RESULTS Mean age was 65.6 ± 9.7 years, and 85% of the patients were men. Successful wiring occurred in 436 AWE attempts (63%). Final technical and procedural success was 91% and 89%, respectively. The mean number of guidewire types used for AWE was 2.2 ± 1.4. The most frequently used guidewire types were the Pilot 200 (Abbott Vascular, 56% of AWE procedures), Fielder XT (Asahi Intecc, 45%), and the Confianza Pro 12 (Asahi Intecc, 28%). The same guidewires were the ones that most commonly crossed the occlusion: Pilot 200 (36% of successful AWE crossings), Fielder XT (20%), and Confianza Pro 12 (11%). A microcatheter or over-the-wire balloon was used for 81% of AWE attempts; the Corsair microcatheter (Asahi Intecc) was the most commonly used (44%).

Programmes and research collect multiple sources of PMTCT data, yet this data is rarely integrated in a systematic way. We conducted a data integration exercise to evaluate the Zimbabwe national PMTCT programme and derive lessons for strengthening implementation and documentation. METHODS We used data from four sources: research, Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) programme, Implementer - Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, and modelling. Research data came from serial population representative cross-sectional surveys that evaluated the national PMTCT programme in 2012, 2014 and 2017/2018. MOHCC and Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development collected data with similar indicators for the period 2018 to 2019. Modelling data from 2017/18 UNAIDS Spectrum was used. We systematically integrated data from the different sources to explore PMTCT programme performance at each step of the cascade. We also conducted spatial analysis to identify hotspots of MTCT. RESULTS We developed cascades for HIV-positive and negative-mothers, and HIV exposed and infected infants to 24 months post-partum. Most data were available on HIV positive mothers. Few data were available 6-8 weeks post-delivery for HIV exposed/infected infants and none were available post-delivery for HIV-negative mothers. The different data sources largely concurred. Antenatal care (ANC) registration was high, although women often presented late. There was variable implementation of PMTCT services, MTCT hotspots were identified. Factors positively associated with MTCT included delayed ANC registration and mobility (use of more than one health facility) during pregnancy/breastfeeding. There was reduced MTCT among women whose partners accompanied them to ANC, and infants receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis. Notably, the largest contribution to MTCT was from postnatal women who had previously tested negative (12/25 in survey data, 17.6% estimated by Spectrum modelling). Data integration enabled formulation of interventions to improve programmes. CONCLUSIONS Data integration was feasible and identified gaps in programme implementation/documentation leading to corrective interventions. Incident infections among mothers are the largest contributors to MTCT: there is need to strengthen the prevention cascade among HIV-negative women.","Sibanda, Euphemia L; Webb, Karen; Fahey, Carolyn A; Kang Dufour, Mi-Suk; McCoy, Sandra I; Watadzaushe, Constancia; Dirawo, Jeffrey; Deda, Marsha; Chimwaza, Anesu; Taramusi, Isaac; Mushavi, Angela; Mukungunugwa, Solomon; Padian, Nancy; Cowan, Frances M",Journal of the International AIDS Society,162,7

Furthermore, B. mallei is genetically related to B. pseudomallei, which is the causative agent of melioidosis. Both facultative intracellular bacteria are classified as tier 1 select biothreat agents. Our previous study with a B. mallei ΔtonB Δhcp1 (CLH001) live-attenuated vaccine demonstrated that it is attenuated, safe and protective against B. mallei wild-type strains in the susceptible BALB/c mouse model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING In our current work, we evaluated the protective efficacy of CLH001 against glanders and melioidosis in the more disease-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. The humoral as well as cellular immune responses were also examined. We found that CLH001-immunized mice showed 100% survival against intranasal and aerosol challenge with B. mallei ATCC 23344. Moreover, this vaccine also afforded significant cross-protection against B. pseudomallei K96243, with low level bacterial burden detected in organs. Immunization with a prime and boost regimen of CLH001 induced significantly greater levels of total and subclasses of IgG, and generated antigen-specific splenocyte production of IFN-γ and IL-17A. Interestingly, protection induced by CLH001 is primarily dependent on humoral immunity, while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells played a less critical protective role. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our data indicate that CLH001 serves as an effective live attenuated vaccine to prevent glanders and melioidosis. The quantity and quality of antibody responses as well as improving cell-mediated immune responses following vaccination need to be further investigated prior to advancement to preclinical studies.","Khakhum, Nittaya; Bharaj, Preeti; Myers, Julia N; Tapia, Daniel; Walker, David H; Endsley, Janice J; Torres, Alfredo G",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,162,1

The present work addresses the former point by systematically characterizing the boundary structures of 3D { 1 ¯ 012 } twins in magnesium using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Eight characteristic facets associated with twin boundaries are reported, five of which have never been experimentally observed before. Further, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the formation and motion of these facets is associated with the accumulation of twinning dislocations. This work provides insights into understanding the structural character of 3D twins and serves to develop strategies for modulating twin kinetics by modifying twin boundaries, such as solute segregation.","Wang, Shujuan; Gong, Mingyu; McCabe, Rodney J; Capolungo, Laurent; Wang, Jian; Tomé, Carlos N",Science advances,162,29

Some health protection agencies and their scientific advisory committees have concluded that there is no conclusive scientific evidence of harm. Several recent reviews by independent scientists, however, suggest that there is significant uncertainty on this question, with rapidly emerging evidence of potentially harmful biological effects from radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposures, at the levels 5G roll-out will entail. This essay identifies four relevant sources of scientific uncertainty and concern: (1) lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; (2) a rapidly accumulating body of laboratory studies documenting disruptive in vitro and in vivo effects of RF-EMFs-but one with many gaps in it; (3) an almost total lack (as yet) of high-quality epidemiological studies of adverse human health effects from 5G EMF exposure specifically, but rapidly emerging epidemiological evidence of such effects from past generations of RF-EMF exposure; (4) persistent allegations that some national telecommunications regulatory authorities do not base their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, related to unmanaged conflicts of interest. The author, an experienced epidemiologist, concludes that one cannot dismiss the growing health concerns about RF-EMFs, especially in an era when higher population levels of exposure are occurring widely, due to the spatially dense transmitters which 5G systems require. Based on the precautionary principle, the author echoes the calls of others for a moratorium on the further roll-out of 5G systems globally, pending more conclusive research on their safety.","Frank, John William",Journal of epidemiology and community health,162,11

A classical Langmuir monolayer approach based on thermodynamic analysis of interactions was complemented with microscopic visualization of films (Brewster angle microscopy), surface-sensitive spectroscopy (polarization modulation-infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy) and theoretical calculations (density functional theory modelling and molecular dynamics simulations). Strong interactions between 25-OH and both investigated sphingolipids enabled the formation of surface complexes. As known from previous studies, 25-OH in pure monolayers can be anchored to the water surface with a hydroxyl group at either C(3) or C(25). In this study, we investigated how the presence of additional strong interactions with sphingolipids modifies the surface arrangement of 25-OH. Results have shown that, in the 25-OH/GM1 system, there are no preferences regarding the orientation of the 25-OH molecule in surface complexes and two types of complexes are formed. On the other hand, SM enforces one specific orientation of 25-OH: being anchored with the C(3)-OH group to the water. The strength of interactions between the studied sphingolipids and 25-OH versus cholesterol is similar, which indicates that cholesterol may well be replaced by oxysterol in the lipid raft system. In this way, the composition of lipid rafts can be modified, changing their rheological properties and, as a consequence, influencing their proper functioning.","Kobierski, Jan; Wnętrzak, Anita; Chachaj-Brekiesz, Anna; Filiczkowska, Anna; Petelska, Aneta D; Dynarowicz-Latka, Patrycja","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",162,5

GEE has been shown to yield consistent estimates of the regression parameters for a marginal model when data are missing completely at random (MCAR). However, when data are missing at random (MAR), the GEE estimates may not be consistent; the MI approaches proposed in this paper minimize bias under MAR. The first MI approach proposed is based on a multivariate normal distribution, but with the addition of pairwise products among the binary outcomes to the multivariate normal vector. Even though the multivariate normal does not impute 0 or 1 values for the missing binary responses, as discussed by Horton et al. (Am Stat 57:229-232, 2003), we suggest not rounding when filling in the missing binary data because it could increase bias. The second MI approach considered is the fully conditional specification (FCS) approach. In this approach, we specify a logistic regression model for each outcome given the outcomes at other time points and the covariates. Typically, one would only include main effects of the outcome at the other times as predictors in the FCS approach, but we explore if bias can be reduced by also including pairwise interactions of the outcomes at other time point in the FCS. In a study of asymptotic bias with non-monotone missing data, the proposed MI approaches are also compared to GEE without imputation. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated using data from a longitudinal clinical trial comparing four psychosocial treatments from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study, where patients' cocaine use is collected monthly for 6 months during treatment.","Lipsitz, Stuart R; Fitzmaurice, Garrett M; Weiss, Roger D",Psychometrika,162,30

The present study was undertaken to describe MDR-TB treatment outcome trends in Delhi and their epidemiological correlates, to assess the adequacy of treatment records and to also generate evidence towards influencing and improving practices related to the MDR-TB control programme. Methods A retrospective record-based study (2009-2014) was conducted in three major drug resistance TB treatment centres of Delhi. Treatment outcomes and adverse effects were extracted from the existing programme records including patients' treatment cards and laboratory registers. Results A total of 2958 MDR-TB patients were identified from the treatment cards, of whom 1749 (59.12%) were males. The mean (±standard deviation) age was 30.56±13.5 years. Favourable treatment outcomes were reported in 1371 (53.28%) patients, but they showed a declining trend during the period of observation. On binomial logistic regression analysis, patients with age ≥35 yr, male sex and undernourishment (body mass index <18.5) at the time of treatment initiation had a significantly increased likelihood of unfavourable MDR-TB treatment outcome (P <0.001). Interpretation & conclusions The study showed an increasing burden of MDR-TB patients, especially in the young population with increased risk of transmission posing a major challenge in achieving TB elimination targets.","Sharma, Nandini; Khanna, Ashwani; Chandra, Shivani; Basu, Saurav; Chopra, Kamal K; Singla, Neeta; Babbar, Neeti; Kohli, Charu",The Indian journal of medical research,162,1

Autopsy studies show severe endothelial injury associated with thrombosis of the alveolar capillaries of the lungs and other organs. In the pathophysiology of this disease endothelial injury and dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis are key factors for the development of severe phenotypes. Therefore, we should consider this entity as a systemic endothelial disease in which an obstructive microvascular syndrome secondary to an intense thrombo-inflammatory response leads to acute respiratory insufficiency and multiorgan failure. Heparin is an excellent drug to treat Covid-19 patients due to its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and endothelial effects.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and sample sizes required to explore the relationship between CYP2B6*6 and GRIN2B single-nucleotide polymorphisms and ketamine-induced EP. METHODS This cross-sectional, pharmacogenetic candidate, gene pilot study recruited 75 patients having minor elective outpatient surgeries. EP was measured with the Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale. Genetic association of CYP2B6*6 and GRIN2B (rs1019385 and rs1806191) single-nucleotide polymorphisms and ketamine-induced EP occurrence and severity were tested using logistic and linear regression. RESULTS Forty-seven patients (63%) received ketamine and were genotyped, and 40% of them experienced EP. Occurrence and severity of EP were not associated with CYP2B6*6 or GRIN2B (p > .10). Exploratory analysis of nongenotype models containing age, ketamine dose, duration of anesthesia, and time from ketamine administration to assessment for EP significantly predicted EP occurrence (p = .001) and severity (p = .007). This pilot study demonstrates feasibility for implementing a pharmacogenetic study in a clinical setting, and we estimate that between 380 and 570 cases will be needed to adequately power future genetic association studies. DISCUSSION Younger age, higher dose, and longer duration of anesthesia significantly predicted EP occurrence and severity among our pilot sample. Although the small sample size limited our ability to demonstrate significant genotype differences, we generated effect sizes, sample size estimates, and nongenetic covariates information in order to support future pharmacogenetic study design for evaluating this adverse event.","Aroke, Edwin N; Crawford, Sybil L; Dungan, Jennifer R",Nursing research,162,5

Corticosteroid use in influenza is widespread, non-systematic and marked by controversy. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of adjuvant corticosteroids in influenza found an association with increased mortality but there were important concerns regarding the risks of bias. OBJECTIVES To (1) evaluate whether or not low-dose corticosteroids given as an adjunct to standard treatment is beneficial in patients who are hospitalised with severe pandemic influenza and (2) develop an 'off-the-shelf' clinical trial that is ready to be activated in a future pandemic. DESIGN Multicentre, pragmatic, blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Thirty to 40 hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS Adults (≥ 16 years) admitted to hospital with an influenza-like illness during a pandemic. INTERVENTION Five-day course of dexamethasone (Dexsol®, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd) 6 mg daily, started within 24 hours of admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Admission to Intensive Care Unit, or death, within 30 days of admission to hospital. RESULTS This trial has not yet been activated. It is currently set up with full ethics and regulatory approvals in place, ready for rapid activation at the onset of the next pandemic. Hurdles to setting up a pandemic trial include planning for pandemic-level pressures on UK NHS resources and co-enrolment of patients to multiple pandemic studies, ensuring adequate geographical distribution of participating sites, maintaining long-term low-level engagement with site investigators, addressing future trial-specific training needs of local investigators and resilience planning in trial management. Identified threats to trial delivery include changes to research capabilities or policies during the hibernation phase, lack of staff resources during a pandemic and the influence of media at the time of a pandemic. A mismatch in the approach to informed consent required by current regulations to that preferred by patients and the public was identified. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that advance set-up of a trial to be conducted during a pandemic, with full regulatory approvals in place, is possible. Regular review during the hibernation phase will be required.

We report three major results. First, novel auditory stimuli triggered midfrontal ~4-Hz rhythms, which were attenuated in PD patients but were not linked with cognitive function or novelty-associated slowing. Second, 32% of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons were response-modulated; nearly all (94%) of these were also modulated by novel stimuli. Finally, response-modulated STN neurons were coherent with midfrontal low-frequency activity. These findings link scalp-based measurements of neural activity with neuronal activity in the STN.

CANA also induces a reversible acute decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is believed to be a hemodynamic effect. Predictors of the initial decline and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown. Methods: This post-hoc study of the CREDENCE trial included 4289 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week 3. Participants were categorized by percentage decline in eGFR at week 3: >10%, ≤10% to >0%, and ≤0%. Baseline characteristics associated with acute eGFR declines >10% were evaluated using logistic regression. Long-term eGFR decline and safety outcomes were estimated in each eGFR decline category by linear mixed effects models and Cox regression after adjustment for laboratory measures and medication use. Results: More participants in the CANA (956 [45%]) versus placebo (PBO) group (450 [21%]) had an acute eGFR decline >10% (p<0.001). A >30% decline occurred infrequently (89 [4%] with CANA and 39 [2%] with PBO;p<0.001). In the CANA but not in the PBO group, older age (OR CANA 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.31;per 10 years) and history of heart failure (OR CANA 0.77, 0.59-0.99) were associated with a higher and lower likelihood of an acute eGFR decline >10%, respectively (both p for interaction <0.05). Following the initial eGFR change, long-term eGFR trajectories as well as overall safety profiles were similar across eGFR decline categories (all p values >0.05). Results were consistent when other decline thresholds (>20%) were used and in subgroup analysis by baseline eGFR (30-<45, 45-<60, and 60-<90 ml/min/1.73 m2). Conclusions: Although acute eGFR declines >10% occurred in nearly half of all patients following initiation of CANA, the benefit of CANA compared with placebo was observed regardless of the acute eGFR decline and safety profiles were similar.

This rich literature synthesis forms the basis of a novel theoretical framework that provides guidance and insight for blockchain adopters and vendors as well as delineate palpable benefits of this novel technology. An interpretivist philosophical design and inductive reasoning are adopted to conduct the systematic review of literature. A total of 867 papers were retrieved from Scopus database between the years of 2016 and 2020 and subsequently analysed via abductive reasoning, grounded theory and a thematic meta-analysis;where the latter was achieved using a scientometric approach and software tools such as VOS viewer and NVivo. Scientometric analysis revealed the most prolific countries, sources, publications and authors who reside at the vanguard of blockchain developments and adoption. Subsequent grounded theory analysis identified six main clusters of research endeavour viz: “case study”, “challenges and opportunity”, “traceability”, “smart contract” “blockchain and IoT” and “data security”. From 28 SCR metrics identified within literature, five were found to have been positively impacted by blockchain technology solutions, namely: “visibility”, “collaboration”, “integration”, “risk management” and “information sharing.” Prominent applications of blockchain technology in practice were “traceability systems” and “smart contracts” which are often implemented separately or in combination and primarily in food supply chains. This research constitutes the first study to critically synthesise extant literature for evaluation of blockchain solutions’ implication on SCR metrics. New perspectives obtained provided a basis for the novel theoretical framework for implementation that will be valued by software developers and adopting organizations, whilst creating new direction for researchers interested in blockchain technology.","Bayramova, Aya Roberts Chris",Buildings,162,16

Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1,262 metagenomes) and IBD (1,635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4,077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes.

Here we show that adenovirus particles contain a tunable linchpin protein with a dual function: response to host cues for scheduled DNA release into the nucleus, and innate immunity suppression by preventing unscheduled DNA release. Scheduled DNA release required the proteasome and ubiquitination of the viral core protein V. Cells lacking the E3 ligase Mind bomb 1 (Mib1) were resistant to wild-type adenovirus infection. Viruses lacking protein V or bearing non-ubiquitinable protein V, however, readily infected Mib1 knockout cells, yet were less infectious than wild-type virus. Their genomes were poorly imported into the nucleus and remained uncoated in the cytosol, thereby enhancing chemokine and interferon production through the DNA sensor cGAS. Our data uncover how the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the function of a virion linchpin protein suppressing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and triggers viral DNA uncoating at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear import and infection.","Bauer, Michael; Gomez-Gonzalez, Alfonso; Suomalainen, Maarit; Hemmi, Silvio; Greber, Urs F.",bioRxiv,162,16

There needs to be a better understanding of which cancer patients are at the greatest amount of risk to make informed decisions on how cancer treatment can be altered to protect patients from COVID-19 infection. The CAPITOL (COVID-19 CAncer PatIenT Outcomes in North London) study investigated the outcomes of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT) with regards to COVID-19 infection, as patients with cancer are hypothesised to be at higher risk. Methods: CAPITOL collected data from all patients receiving SACT at two cancer centres. The effect of clinical characteristics on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in patients on SACT was the primary outcome, and we used univariable and multivariable models in our analysis, adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. Results: 2871 patients were analysed from 2nd March to 31st May 2020, all of whom received SACT;during this time period 68 (2.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Receiving SACT increased the risk of death when contracting COVID-19 (adjusted (adj.) OR 9.84;95% CI 5.73 - 16.9). The risk of contracting COVID-19 was increased by receiving chemotherapy (adj. OR 2.99;95% CI = 1.72 - 5.21), with the risk significantly increased by high dose chemotherapy (adj. OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.35 - 6.48). Patients with comorbidities (adjusted OR 2.29;95% CI 1.19 - 4.38), or with a respiratory or intrathoracic neoplasm (adj. OR 2.12;95% CI 1.04 - 4.36) were also at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Cancer patients who received targeted treatment had a reduced risk of contracting COVID-19 (adj. OR 0.53;95% CI 0.30 - 0.95), while there was no significant change in risk caused by treatment intent (curative versus palliative), hormonal- or immunotherapy and solid versus haematological cancers. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first investigations into the risk of contracting COVID-19 in a cohort of all cancer patients on SACT. We found that patients on SACT are more likely to die if they contract COVID-19. The type of SACT received by cancer patients can affect their likelihood of contacting COVID-19, with chemotherapy increasing risk, targeted therapy decreasing risk and a potential protective effect for hormonal and immunotherapy.","Crolley, V.; Hanna, D.; Joharatnam-Hogan, N.; Chopra, N.; Bamac, E.; Desai, M.; Lam, Y.

The main purpose of our study is to help scholar communities distinguish between educational approaches that seek to sustain the “unsustainable” and to identify the problems of lecturer–student interaction in the midst of the mass transition to distance learning and to find ways to solve them. The results of our research show that the transition to distance education during the pandemic took place;however, it highlighted a whole complex of problems connected with deterioration of emotional state and reduction of incentives to study. That might challenge the existing status quo, a revision of the principles of “Humboldt universities” and the birth of new forms of education. The study consists of three parts that allow analyzing the lecturer–student relations, as well as the management of the learning process. The first part analyzes the characteristics and attitudes towards distance education in different countries. The second part presents the results of students’ emotional state in two countries with different population restriction regimes. The third part is devoted to the study of students’ time planning in the distance-learning environment.

It was named Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it caused was defined as Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The attitude of people and their knowledge level play an important role in coping with pandemics. Determining the level of public knowledge is also critical for identifying gaps in disease protection and strengthening disease prevention efforts. The present study aimed to describe the general knowledge regarding COVID-19 and the attitude toward the disease among patients applying to an otolaryngology clinic approximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We prepared a questionnaire comprising two sections with a total of 19 items. The first section had questions regarding demographic data including age, sex, education level, and job, and the second section had questions assessing knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. Each correct answer was assigned 1 point;incorrect answers or unknown answers were assigned 0 points. A participant could receive a total knowledge score of 0-19;higher scores indicate better knowledge of COVID-19. Results: A total of 404 participants were included in our study. The median knowledge score among all participants was 15.0±3.0. There was a statistically significant difference between primary school and university graduates (p<0.05) and between secondary school and university graduates in terms of knowledge scores (p=0.012). Similar to the primary and secondary school graduates, high school and university graduates differed significantly in terms of knowledge level (p=0.0001). Conclusion: The mean rate of correct answers among patients regarding knowledge and perception questions on COVID-19 was 77.67%. Our results demonstrated that the sample we selected from the patients visiting our otolaryngology clinic had a high COVID-19 knowledge score. The average knowledge score was possibly high in our study owing to the fact that the participants were mostly university graduates (52.5%).","Firat Koca, Ç","Mediterranean Journal of Infection, Microbes and Antimicrobials",162,17

To date, there are few therapeutic interventions able to affect the course of the disease once acquired, a deficit with stark consequences that were readily evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present the Cellular Immune Agent Based Model (CIABM) as a flexible framework for modeling acute viral infection and cellular immune memory development. The mechanism/rule-based nature of the CIABM allows for interrogation of the complex dynamics of the human immune system during various types of viral infections. The CIABM is an extension of a prior agent-based model of the innate immune response, incorporating additional cellular types and mediators involved in the response to viral infection. The CIABM simulates the dynamics of viral respiratory infection in terms of epithelial invasion, immune cellular population changes and cytokine measurements. Validation of the CIABM involved effectively replicating in vivo measurements of circulating mediator levels from a clinical cohort of influenza patients. The general purpose nature of the CIABM allows for both the representation of various types of known viral infections and facilitates the exploration of hypothetical, novel viral pathogens.","Becker, Andrew; An, Gary; Cockrell, Chase",bioRxiv,162,16

This virus also was found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine the dynamics and associated lesions of hMPV infection, six cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) were inoculated with hMPV and examined by pathological and virological assays. They were euthanized at 5 ( n = 2) or 9 ( n = 2) days post-infection (dpi), or monitored until 14 dpi ( n = 2). Viral excretion peaked at 4 dpi and decreased to zero by 10 dpi. Viral replication was restricted to the respiratory tract and associated with minimal to mild, multi-focal erosive and inflammatory changes in conducting airways, and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS. This study demonstrates that hMPV is a respiratory pathogen and indicates that viral replication is short-lived, polarized to the apical surface, and occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.","Kuiken, Thijs; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G.; van Riel, Debby A.J.; Laman, Jon D.; van Amerongen, Geert; Sprong, Leo; Fouchier, Ron A.M.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.",The American Journal of Pathology,162,1

The basic reproduction rate R0 was 2-5 for SARS-2003, 0.3-0.8 for MERS-2012 and 1.4- 5.7 for COVID-19. We found out the relation between number of mutations and mortality as well as phylogenetic relations. High number of mutations corresponded to higher mortality rate as in countries like Italy and Spain. Alpha and Beta-coronaviruses show a common ancestor from which they descended. Brazil and Iran have shown similar phylogenetic descent explaining their mortality rate. India however showed a distant relation from the common ancestor of other genome sequences. This study highlights the mutations of the SARS-CoV2 virus as well as sets up a comparison with the previous outbreaks.

A. fumigatus possesses and expresses a range of genetic determinants of virulence, which facilitate colonisation and disease progression, including the secretion of mycotoxins. Gliotoxin (GT) is the best studied A. fumigatus mycotoxin with a wide range of known toxic effects that impair human immune cell function. GT is also highly toxic to A. fumigatus and this fungus has evolved self-protection mechanisms that include (i) the GT efflux pump GliA, (ii) the GT neutralising enzyme GliT, and (iii) the negative regulation of GT biosynthesis by the bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA. The transcription factor (TF) RglT is the main regulator of GliT and this GT protection mechanism also occurs in the non-GT producing fungus A. nidulans. However, A. nidulans does not encode GtmA and GliA. This work aimed at analysing the transcriptional response to exogenous GT in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans, two distantly related Aspergillus species, and to identify additional components required for GT protection in Aspergillus species. RNA-sequencing shows a highly different transcriptional response to exogenous GT with the RglT-dependent regulon also significantly differing between A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. However, we were able to observe homologues whose expression pattern was similar in both species (43 RglT-independent and 12 RglT-dependent). Screening of an A. fumigatus deletion library of 484 transcription factors (TFs) for sensitivity to GT identified 15 TFs important for GT self-protection. Of these, the TF KojR, which is essential for kojic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus oryzae, was also essential for GT biosynthesis in A. fumigatus and for GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and A. oryzae. KojR regulates rglT and gliT expression in Aspergillus spp. Together, this study identified conserved components required for GT protection in Aspergillus species. Author Summary A. fumigatus secretes mycotoxins that are essential for its virulence and pathogenicity. Gliotoxin (GT) is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin, which is known to impair several aspects of the human immune response. GT is also toxic to different fungal species, which have evolved several GT protection strategies. To further decipher these responses, we used transcriptional profiling aiming to compare the response to GT in the GT producer A. fumigatus and the GT non- producer A. nidulans. This analysis allowed us to identify additional genes with a potential role in GT protection. We also identified A. fumigatus 15 transcription factors (TFs) that are important for conferring resistance to exogenous gliotoxin. One of these TFs, KojR, which is essential for A. oryzae kojic acid production, is also important for GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and A. oryzae.

We assessed opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination, willingness to be vaccinated, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey among 3,793 HCWs in December 2020 in the Canton of Solothurn, Switzerland, before the start of the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Results: Median age was 43 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-53), 2,841 were female (74.9%). 1,511 HCWs (39.8%) reported willingness to accept vaccination, while 1,114 (29.4%) were unsure, and 1,168 (30.8%) would decline vaccination. Among medical doctors, 76.1% were willing, while only 27.8% of nurses expressed willingness. Among 1,168 HCWs who would decline vaccination, 1,073 (91.9%) expressed concerns about vaccine safety and side effects. The willingness of HCWs to be vaccinated was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.97, 95%Cl 1.71-2.27) and having been vaccinated for influenza this year (aOR 2.70, 95%Cl 2.20-3.31). HCWs who reported a lack of confidence in government were less likely to be willing to be vaccinated (aOR 0.58, 95%Cl 0.40-0.84), and women were less willing to be vaccinated than men (OR 0.33 (0.28-0.38). Conclusion: Less than half of HCWs reported willingness to be vaccinated before the campaign start, but proportions varied greatly depending on the profession and workplace. Strategies with clear and objective messages that particularly address the concerns of HCWs are needed if their willingness to be vaccinated is to be increased.","Zuercher, K.; Mugglin, C.; Egger, M.; Mueller, S.; Fluri, M.; Bolick, L.; Piso, R.

Digoxin is one of the main drugs to treat CVD. Objective: The clinician conducted therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of digoxin according to the drug usage on patients to monitor the concentration of digoxin, so as to avoid its toxic and side effects, and provide a theoretical reference for clinical usage of digoxin in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A method for quantifying digoxin concentration in plasma with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed. After simple protein precipitation of plasma with methanol, digoxin and its internal standard (digoxin-d3) were detected in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. Results: Plasma digoxin in the range of 0.2 - 10 ng/mL had good linearity. The UPLC-MS/MS method was validated with inter-run accuracies ranging from 91.3% to 107.4% and precision less than 13%. Nine plasma samples (5 at valley concentration and 4 at follow-up after stopping dosing) from three patients with COVID-19 were tested. The mean plasma digoxin concentration was 0.73 ng/mL (ranged from 0 to 1.31 ng/mL). Digoxin was detected at the concentration of 0.93 ng/mL after stopping drug administration for 14 days. Conclusion: In this study, we established a simple UPLC-MS/MS method using protein-precipitation to perform TDM of digoxin in patients with COVID-19, and found that about 56% of digoxin plasma concentration was within the treatment window (0.8 - 2.0 ng/mL).

Recently it has been suggested that cycle threshold values obtained on polymerase chain reaction tests may serve as a marker of disease severity with lower values (i.e., higher viral load) being associated with higher mortality. This study was done to assess the impact of remdesivir use on the time to a negative COVID-19 PCR as well as the degree of change between two Ct’s based on treatment. A total of 30 kidney transplant patients with a new diagnosis of COVID-19 were assessed. Serial PCR results were followed from the time of diagnosis then every 2–4 weeks until negative. In patients who received remdesivir immediately after COVID-19 confirmation compared to no remdesivir, time to negative PCR was not statistically different with a median duration of 57 days in both groups (p = 0.369). The change in the Ct between the first and the second PCR test was also not statistically different between groups with a median change of 18.4 cycles in the remdesivir group and 15.7 cycles without remdesivir (p = 0.516). The results of this small single-center analysis suggest that remdesivir may not be beneficial in shortening time to a negative COVID-19 PCR.","Winstead, Ryan J.; Christensen, Johanna Sterling Sara Morales Megan Kumar Dhiren Bryson Alexandra Gupta Gaurav",Transplantology,162,24

This fusion protein was found to form protein nanoparticle spontaneously when expressed and purified protein stimulates long-lasting antibody responses in single immunization. Through modeling peptide structure and nanoparticle assembly, we have improved this vaccine carrier in complex stability. The revised vaccine carrier is able to stimulate constant antibody titer to a heterologous antigen for at least six months in single immunization.

In this three-wave prospective cohort study, we explore the potential psychological implications of suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic by examining relations among suffering, mental health, and psychological well-being in a sample of U.S. adults living with chronic health conditions. We analyzed data from n = 184 participants who completed assessments one month before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (February 2020) and then two months (April 2020) and four months later (May/June 2020). Analyses controlled for a range of factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, religious/spiritual factors, psychological characteristics, and prior values of the predictor and each of the outcomes assessed one month before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of the primary analysis indicated that greater overall suffering assessed one month into the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower psychological well-being (β = -.17, 95% CI: -.29, -.05) and higher levels of anxiety (β = .27, 95% CI: .13, .41) and depression (β = .16, 95% CI: .03, .29) two months later. In a secondary analysis that explored anxiety, depression, and psychological well-being as candidate antecedents of suffering, depression assessed one month into the COVID-19 pandemic was most strongly associated with worse overall suffering two months later. We highlight the implications of the findings for high-risk populations who are suffering amidst the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential benefits of both integrating assessments of suffering into screening procedures and addressing experiences of suffering in mental health service settings are discussed.","Cowden, Richard G.; Davis, Edward B.; Counted, Victor Chen Ying Rueger Sandra Y.; VanderWeele, Tyler J.; Lemke, Austin W.; Glowiak, Kevin J.; Worthington, Everett L.","Wellbeing, Space and Society",162,20

BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against COVID-19 and is currently authorized for emergency use or conditional approval worldwide. At the time of authorization, data beyond 2 months post-vaccination were unavailable. Methods: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy study, 44,165 [≥]16-year-old participants and 2,264 12-15-year-old participants were randomized to receive 2 doses, 21 days apart, of 30 g BNT162b2 or placebo. Study endpoints reported here are vaccine efficacy (VE) against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and safety data, both up to 6 months post-vaccination. Results: BNT162b2 continued to be safe and well tolerated. Few participants had adverse events leading to study withdrawal. VE against COVID-19 was 91% (95% CI 89.0-93.2) through up to 6 months of follow-up, among evaluable participants and irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE of 86%-100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and COVID-19 risk factors in participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE against severe disease was 97% % (95% CI 80.3-99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, B.1.351 (beta), was predominant, 100% (95% CI 53.5, 100.0) VE was observed.

Because of the phylogenetic similarity to humans, rhesus macaques are an animal model of choice for many virus-challenge and vaccine-evaluation studies, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein generates potent receptor binding domain cross- neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in contrast to human infection or vaccination where responses are typically SARS-CoV-2-specific. Furthermore, the macaque nAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structural studies show that different immunodominant sites are targeted by the two primate species. Human antibodies generally target epitopes strongly overlapping the ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS), whereas the macaque antibodies recognize a relatively conserved region proximal to the RBS that represents another potential pan-SARS-related virus site rarely targeted by human antibodies. B cell repertoire differences between the two primates appear to significantly influence the vaccine response and suggest care in the use of rhesus macaques in evaluation of vaccines to SARS-related viruses intended for human use. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Broadly neutralizing antibodies to an unappreciated site of conservation in the RBD in SARS- related viruses can be readily induced in rhesus macaques because of distinct properties of the naïve macaque B cell repertoire that suggest prudence in the use of the macaque model in SARS vaccine evaluation and design.","He, Wan-ting; Yuan, Meng; Callaghan, Sean; Musharrafieh, Rami; Song, Ge; Silva, Murillo; Beutler, Nathan; Lee, Wilma; Yong, Peter; Torres, Jonathan; Melo, Mariane; Zhou, Panpan; Zhao, Fangzhu; Zhu, Xueyong; Peng, Linghang; Huang, Deli; Anzanello, Fabio; Ricketts, James; Parren, Mara; Garcia, Elijah; Ferguson, Melissa; Rinaldi, William; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Nemazee, David; Smith, Davey M.; Briney, Bryan; Safonova, Yana; Rogers, Thomas F.; Crotty, Shane; Irvine, Darrell J.; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees",bioRxiv,162,1

Rapid global spread led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a vitally important tool in controlling the spread of the virus. Lateral flow devices (LFDs) offer the potential advantage of speed and on-site testing. The sensitivity of these devices compared to the gold standard RT-PCR has been questioned. We compared the performance of the Innova lateral flow kit, recommended by the UK government, with our rapid in-house RT-PCR protocol using stored positive patient samples. The LFD device was found to be 6,000-10,000 times less sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the LFD detected 46.2% of the positives detected by RT-PCR. 50% of the LFD results were observed to be weak positives, only visible after careful examination by experienced laboratory staff. At lower viral loads, such as 10,000-100,000 RNA copies/ml, the LFD detected 22.2% of positives. In addition, two strong positives (3 and 1.5 million RNA copies/ml) were not detected by the LFD. The argument for use of LFD kits, despite their lack of sensitivity, is that they detect infectious virus and hence contagious individuals. At present, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting this claim. The LFD used in the UK fails to identify individuals with considerable viral loads and has been subject to a class I recall by the US FDA but is still approved and recommended for use by the UK government. We believe that using LFD testing for assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk is a strategy which has risks that outweigh any benefits.","Taylor, A.; Calvez, R. M.; Atkins, M.; Fink, C. G.",,162,10

Here we introduce a probabilistic model which describes the worldwide spreading of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. It combines a stochastic local infection dynamics between individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network which takes into account the national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the SARS outbreak are in suprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spreading of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance.

Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans. SUMMARY In this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their repeated evolution in independent lineages.

Understand the importance of competitors’ analysis as a primary step of service marketing strategy in influencing “new normal” consumer behavior. Examine the utility of customer engagement through website blogs, social media posts, videos and continuously updated information on the mobile application in influencing the “new normal” customer behavior, from skinner operant conditioning behavior and Rusbolt’s investment model perspectives. Case overview/synopsis: Rafeeg is a mobile application-based home maintenance service providing company, conceived and founded in 2017 by Khamis Alsheryani – who, as an Emirati entrepreneur, has a prior record of accomplishing successful mobile applications and business ventures since 2004. The unique selling proposition of Rafeeg in the Abu Dhabi market is its functioning as the home maintenance services aggregator bringing its suppliers and consumers under-one-roof alongside maintaining ensuring high quality, punctuality and security at competitive prices. Rafeeg has collaborated with approximately 1,000 licensed suppliers using nearly 5,000 technicians and maintenance workers with a customer base of about 70,000 households. Although it is formally situated in Al Salam St, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the company communicates with its consumers virtually. However, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE in March 2020, Rafeeg witnessed a considerable decrease in service requests. Consumers’ psychological fear of the pandemics spread into their houses through the technicians and maintenance workers and the degree of hygienic practices the latter follows before their service provision acted as the major reason behind the fall in requests. Despite Alsheryani’s assurance on the provision of only those suppliers who are verified of their hygienic practices, negative COVID-19 test reports and their availability to the consumers as proof and regular temperature checks of the technicians, the consumer apprehensions remained stagnant and the loss of new service requests, as well as revenue, continued. The pandemic’s spread and consequent lockdown of services in the UAE affected Rafeeg’s business operations gravely, as projected by its sudden drop-in service requests – from 53,638 average monthly customer requests in January and February to approximately 10,000 in March and April. The sudden drop of 81% in new requests drove Alsheryani to develop a service marketing strategy in May to boost consumer behavior, encouraging them to resume their requests without further apprehensions. However, with the continuous rise in the pandemic and vaccines still under trial and research, Alsheryani contemplates the viability of the new marketing strategy. Alsheryani took measures in supplier training programs, excommunicating with suppliers who fail to comply with his strict safety regulations, developing the app with clearly stated, uniform, safety procedures and bearing the additional safety-related costs small suppliers provide quality work as part of the strategy. Despite so, will there be an increase in new requests? Will the bearing of additional costs on the suppliers’ behalf jeopardize its competitive advantage in UAE? Should he consider an alternate business model to adapt to the new normal environment? Complexity academic level: This case is written for undergraduate students majoring in consumer behavior, consumer engagement approaches, digital marketing approaches using websites, mobile applications, social media communities and service marketing strategies. Students, through this case, can relate the importance of virtual space in engaging consumers and the importance of the latter in addressing the dynamicity of consumer behavior, especially affected by sudden environmental change, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The case study also subtly highlights the importance of collaboration with suppliers in an aggregator business model to capture the essence of changing consumer behavior. This case study is appropriate for students having previous knowledge of Rusbolt’s investment model and skinner’s operant behavioral model of consumer behavior and their application in service marketing. Besides, students must be aware of the online business model and aggregator businesses in the service industry of the UAE. The case study purports to motivate critical analytical thinking among students and build their understanding of the importance of consumer behavior for business sustenance.

We investigated whether rates of influenza vaccination and refusal differ across NHs with varying concentrations of MA-enrolled residents. Methods: We analyzed 2014-2015 Medicare enrollment data and Minimum Data Set clinical assessments linked to NH-level characteristics, star ratings, and county-level MA penetration rates. The independent variable was the percentage of residents enrolled in MA at admission and categorized into three groups. We examined three NH-level outcomes: percentage of residents assessed and appropriately provided the influenza vaccine, receiving influenza vaccine, and refusing influenza vaccine. Results: There were 936,513 long-stay residents in 12,384 NHs. Categories for the prevalence of MA enrollment in NHs were low (0% to 3.3%; n=4131 NHs), moderate (3.4% to 18.6%; n=4127 NHs) and high (>18.6%; n=4126 NHs). Adjusting for covariates, influenza vaccination rates among long-stay residents were higher in NHs with moderate (1.7%, P<0.0001), or high (3.1%, P<0.0001) MA versus the lowest prevalence of MA. Influenza vaccine refusal was lower in NHs with moderate (-3.1%, P<0.0001), or high (-4.6% P<0.0001) MA compared with NHs with the lowest prevalence of MA. Among 753,616 short-stay residents in 12,205 NHs, there was no association between MA concentration and influenza vaccination receipt but vaccine refusal was greater in NHs with higher MA prevalence (high or moderate vs. low MA: 5.2%, P<0.0001). Conclusion: The relationship between MA concentration and influenza vaccination measures varied among post-acute and long-term NH residents. As MA takes a larger role in the Medicare program, and more MA beneficiaries enter NHs, there is need to consider how managed care can be leveraged to improve the delivery of preventive services such as influenza vaccinations in NH settings.","Moyo, P.; Bosco, E.; Bardenheier, B.

The home-learning system however theoretically generates the digital divide for the majority of poor students because they have less capital and resources. In order to be involved in the system they have to afford themselves in getting the digital devices such as smartphones and laptop. It uses the qualitative method undertaken in four regencies: Banyumas Purbalingga Banjarnegara and Tegal. The poor students who undergo the home-learning system in those regencies are enlisted to be purposive samples. The profile is selectively included because of their lack of means in dealing with the system. For this study we analyze the data collected from in-depth interviews observation documentation followed by constant comparative analysis. The result indicates that most poor students only have the worksheets (LKS) and books as their primary learning resources. The poor students cannot optimally undergo the system due to the financial constraints which lead to the shortage of use of technology. Also, the intensity of parental participation during school hours is low due to their educational background and working hours. The condition is also worsened by the absenteeism of the teacher.","Nanang, Martono; Khansa, Naura Nabilla; Rahma, Isnania; Lisnawati, Lisnawati; Rakhma, Nugraheni",The Journal of Society and Media,162,29

The complex mosaic of changes to brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we demonstrate a functional-based method for cross-species cortical alignment that leverages recent advances in understanding cortical organization and that enables the quantification of homologous regions across species, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, our method establishes that cross-species similarity in cortical organization decreases with geodesic distance from unimodal systems, and culminates in the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, as is seen in humans, is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation. They also highlight functional changes in regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus as key influences on uniquely human features of cognition.","Xu, Ting; Nenning, Karl-Heinz; Schwartz, Ernst; Hong, Seok-Jun; Vogelstein, Joshua T.; Fair, Damien A.; Schroeder, Charles E.; Margulies, Daniel S.; Smallwood, Jonny; Milham, Michael P.; Langs, Georg",bioRxiv,162,25

Here we describe the validation of an improved simple sample preparation method for Direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP, removing the need for RNA extraction, using 559 swabs and 86,760 saliva samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals across multiple healthcare settings. Using this improved method we report a diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 70.35% (95% CI 63.48-76.60%) on swabs and 84.62% (79.50-88.88%) on saliva, with diagnostic specificity (DSp) 100% (98.98-100.00%) on swabs and 100% (99.72-100.00%) on saliva when compared to RT-qPCR. Analysing samples with RT-qPCR ORF1ab CT values of <25 and <33 (high and medium-high viral loads, respectively), we found DSe of 100% (96.34-100%) and 77.78% (70.99-83.62%) for swabs, and 99.01% (94.61-99.97%) and 87.32% (80.71-92.31%) for saliva. We also describe RNA RT-LAMP (on extracted RNA) performed on 12,619 swabs and 12,521 saliva samples to provide updated performance data with DSe and DSp of 95.98% (92.74-98.06%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for swabs, and 80.65% (73.54-86.54%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for saliva, respectively. We also report on daily samples collected from one individual from symptom onset where both Direct and RNA RT-LAMP detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva collected on all six days where symptoms were recorded, with RNA RT-LAMP detecting SARS-CoV-2 for an additional further day. The findings from these studies demonstrate that RT-LAMP testing of swabs and saliva is potentially applicable to a variety of use-cases, including frequent, interval-based testing of saliva from asymptomatic individuals via Direct RT-LAMP that may be missed using symptomatic testing alone.","Kidd, S.

We profile the cases suspected to have acquired the infection in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), focussing on major transmission foci, and also describe and discuss the impact of our outbreak control measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for probable SARS adapted to the local context, we studied all cases documented to have passed through TTSH less than 10 days prior to the onset of fever. Key data were collected in liaison with clinicians and through a team of onsite epidemiologists. RESULTS There were 105 secondary cases in TTSH. Healthcare staff (57.1%) formed the majority, followed by visitors (30.5%) and inpatients (12.4%). The earliest case had onset of fever on 4 March 2003, and the last case, on 5 April 2003. Eighty-nine per cent had exposures to 7 wards which had cases of SARS that were not isolated on admission. In 3 of these wards, major outbreaks resulted, each with more than 20 secondary cases. Attack rates amongst ward-based staff ranged from 0% to 32.5%. Of 13 inpatients infected, only 4 (30.8%) had been in the same room or cubicle as the index case for the ward. CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of SARS at TTSH showed the challenges of dealing with an emerging infectious disease with efficient nosocomial spread. Super-spreading events and initial delays in outbreak response led to widespread dissemination of the outbreak to multiple wards.","Chen, Mark I C; Leo, Yee-Sin; Ang, Brenda S P; Heng, Bee-Hoon; Choo, Philip","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",162,11

It was previously thought that rotavirus exits cells by lysis, but this behavior does not match the local pathogenesis of the virus. In this study, we have investigated the release of the simian rotavirus strain (RRV) from the polarized intestinal Caco-2 cells. We found that RRV is released almost exclusively from the apical pole of Caco-2 cells before any cells lyse. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and drugs that inhibit vesicular transport, we studied the RRV transport route from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the apical side of intestinal cells. We demonstrated that RRV exits from the ER through a carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-sensitive vesicular transport. RRV staining was never found within the Golgi apparatus or lysosomes, suggesting that the RRV intracellular pathway does not involve these organelles. This finding was confirmed by treatment with monensin or NH4Cl, which do not affect release of RRV. Electron microscopic analysis revealed RRV containing small smooth vesicles in the apical area and free virions outside the cell in the brush border, consistent with a vesicular vectorial transport of virus. These results may provide, for the first time, a cellular explanation of the pathogenesis of rotavirus.","Jourdan, N; Maurice, M; Delautier, D; Quero, A M; Servin, A L; Trugnan, G",Journal of virology,162,1

Five of these peptides showed high cross-immunoreactivities (approximately 66.7 to 90.5%) to SARS convalescent patients' sera from the severest epidemic regions of the China mainland. Most interestingly, S(471-503), a peptide located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, could specifically block the binding between the RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV entrance into host cells in vitro.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A postal survey of GPs and PNs in four Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, selected to represent a diverse sample of practices from inner-city, semi-urban and rural areas. The study was undertaken from 1 February to 1 April 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES GPs' and PNs' responses to survey statements assessing their awareness and perceived personal risk, intended behaviour in the event of a pandemic, and expectations surrounding antivirals, vaccine and personal and family protection. RESULTS Of 390 general practice staff who were sent the survey, 139 (36%) completed it. Most respondents felt confident that they possessed the necessary knowledge (71.5%, 98/137) and skills (73.7%, 101/137) to provide patient care during an influenza pandemic. Although 38.7% (53/137) stated that they would visit quarantined symptomatic patients, 41.6% (57/137) were unsure. More than half the respondents (53.2%, 74/139) stated that they would require access to vaccination and antivirals for their family as well as themselves before they would attend symptomatic patients at the general practice. CONCLUSION These findings provide evidence of the need to ensure that general practice staff have access to personal and family protection to encourage an adequate response to a pandemic situation.","Seale, Holly; Ward, Kirsten F; Zwar, Nick; Van, Debbie; Leask, Julie; Macintyre, C Raina",The Medical journal of Australia,162,29

While the use of facemasks has proven to be an effective barrier to curb the aerosol spread of such diseases, its use in the local community is uncommon, resulting in doubts being cast on its effectiveness in preventing airborne infections during epidemics. We thus aimed to conduct a literature review to determine the factors that influence the use of facemasks as a primary preventive health measure in the community. METHODS A search for publications relating to facemask usage was performed on Medline, PubMed, Google, World Health Organization and Singapore government agencies' websites, using search terms such as 'facemask', 'mask', 'influenza', 'respiratory infection', 'personal protective equipment', 'disease prevention', 'compliance' and 'adherence'. Findings were framed under five components of the Health Belief Model: perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived severity, perceived barriers and cues to action. RESULTS We found that individuals are more likely to wear facemasks due to the perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases. Although perceived susceptibility appeared to be the most significant factor determining compliance, perceived benefits of mask-wearing was found to have significant effects on mask-wearing compliance as well. Perceived barriers include experience or perception of personal discomfort and sense of embarrassment. Media blitz and public health promotion activities supported by government agencies provide cues to increase the public's usage of facemasks. CONCLUSION Complex interventions that use multipronged approaches targeting the five components of the Health Belief Model, especially perceived susceptibility, are needed to increase the use of facemasks in the community. Further studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented interventions.","Sim, Shin Wei; Moey, Kirm Seng Peter; Tan, Ngiap Chuan",Singapore medical journal,162,3

Viral capsid assembly recreated in CFPSS reveals a catalyzed biochemical pathway involving transient, energy-dependent action of host proteins and discrete assembly intermediates, rather than the classical notion of self-assembly that was expected for capsid formation. Study of prion protein biogenesis reveals a new conformation critical for disease pathogenesis and advances the paradigm of protein bioconformatics, by which cells may productively regulate the folding of various proteins. In each example, the CFPSS made it easier to analyze biochemical mechanism than is possible in other currently available whole cell systems, illustrating why this approach is likely to be a continuing source of insight into important features of biological regulation.","Lingappa, Vishwanath R; Lingappa, Jaisri R","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",162,12

However, the impact of this reduction on hospital mortality is unknown. We describe temporal trends in the presentation of patients with acute HF and their in-hospital outcomes at two referral centres in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1372 patients hospitalized for HF in two referral centres in South London between 7 January and 14 June 2020 were included in the study and their outcomes compared with those of equivalent patients of the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The number of HF hospitalizations was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 2019 (P < 0.001). Specifically, we observed a temporary reduction in hospitalizations during the COVID-19 peak, followed by a return to 2019 levels. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic had demographic characteristics similar to those admitted during the equivalent period in 2019. However, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (P = 0.015). Hospitalization in 2020 was independently associated with worse in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.34-3.72; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a reduction in HF hospitalization and a higher rate of in-hospital mortality. Hospitalization for HF in 2020 is independently associated with more adverse outcomes. Further studies are required to investigate the predictors of these adverse outcomes to help inform potential changes to the management of HF patients while some constraints to usual care remain.","Cannatà, Antonio; Bromage, Daniel I; Rind, Irfan A; Gregorio, Caterina; Bannister, Clare; Albarjas, Mohammed; Piper, Susan; Shah, Ajay M; McDonagh, Theresa A",Eur. j. heart fail,162,1

We demonstrated that TRACE-seq allowed integrated characterization of full genome information of SARS-CoV-2, putative pathogens causing coinfection, antibiotic resistance, and host response from single throat swabs. We believe that the integrated information will deepen our understanding of pathogenesis and improve diagnostic accuracy for infectious diseases.","Lu, Bo; Yan, Yi; Dong, Liting; Han, Lingling; Liu, Yawei; Yu, Junping; Chen, Jianjun; Yi, Danyang; Zhang, Meiling; Deng, Xin; Wang, Chao; Wang, Runkun; Wang, Dengpeng; Wei, Hongping; Liu, Di; Yi, Chengqi",Cell Discov,162,11

Investigating its geographical disparities has paramount interest in order to gauge its relationships with political decisions, economic indicators, or mental health. This paper focuses on clustering the daily death rates reported in several regions of Europe and the United States over eight months. Several methods have been developed to cluster such functional data. However, these methods are not translation-invariant and thus cannot handle different times of arrivals of the disease, nor can they consider external covariates and so are unable to adjust for the population risk factors of each region. We propose a novel three-step clustering method to circumvent these issues. As a first step, feature extraction is performed by translation-invariant wavelet decomposition which permits to deal with the different onsets. As a second step, single-index regression is used to neutralize disparities caused by population risk factors. As a third step, a nonparametric mixture is fitted on the regression residuals to achieve the region clustering.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 become much clearer than before, there are still further problems with the pathophysiological process and treatments of severe patients. One primary problem is with the paradoxical immune states in severe patients with COVID-19. Studies indicate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can attack the immune system, manifested as a state of immunosuppression with a decrease in lymphocytes, whereas a state of hyperinflammation, presenting as elevated cytokine levels, is also detected in COVID-19. Therefore, discussing the specific status of immunity in COVID-19 will contribute to the understanding of its pathophysiology and the search for appropriate treatments. Here, we review all the available literature concerning the different immune states in COVID-19 and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, the association between immune states and the development and severity of disease as well as the impact on the selection of immunotherapy strategies are discussed in our review.","Liu, Ye; Li, Yiming; Xu, Dongxue; Zhang, Jing; Peng, Zhiyong",Shock (Augusta Ga.),162,25

Some of the most important questions in this context are related to responsibility. First, what is a government's primary responsibility? Second, how should both the government and individuals consider personal moral responsibility in this context? METHOD: This paper uses conceptual and normative analysis to address responsibility in the context of the pandemic. The paper also refers to reports published by the German Ethics Council, the Malaysian Bioethics Community and the Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics. RESULTS: The primary responsibility of governments is to create a balance between individual values and rights, one hand, and the health of the population, on the other. There are good reasons to conceive of individual responsibility as a virtue, having to do with the development of crucial character traits and habits. The responsibility of governments is connected to individual responsibility through the values of trust and solidarity. CONCLUSIONS: Governments need to communicate clearly (a) how they balance conflicts between collective health and individual rights and values and (b) what the chosen strategy entails in terms of collective and individual responsibility. Success requires attention to ethical values from all involved. Individuals will need to develop new character traits to help manage this pandemic and to prevent new ones. Governments must facilitate the development of such character traits by building trust and solidarity with and among citizens.","Nihlén Fahlquist, Jessica",Scand J Public Health,162,24

The debate was dominated by utility-based arguments for saving the most lives or life-years. These arguments were tempered by equity-based concerns that triage based solely on prognosis would exacerbate existing health inequities, leaving disadvantaged patients worse off. Central to this debate was the assumption that ICU admission is a valuable but scarce resource in the pandemic context.In this paper, we argue that the concern about achieving equity in ICU triage is problematic for two reasons. First, ICU can be futile and prolong or exacerbate suffering rather than ameliorate it. This may be especially true in patients with COVID-19 with emerging data showing that most who receive access to a ventilator will still die. There is no value in admitting patients with poor prognostic indicators to ICU to meet an equity target when intensive critical care is contrary to their best interests. Second, the focus on ICU admission shifts focus away from important aspects of COVID-19 care where there is greater opportunity for mitigating suffering and enhancing equitable care.We propose that the focus on equity concerns during the pandemic should broaden to include providing all people who need it with access to the highest possible standard of end-of-life care. This requires attention to culturally safe care in the following interlinked areas: palliative care, communication and decision support and advanced care planning.","Ballantyne, Angela; Rogers, Wendy A; Entwistle, Vikki; Towns, Cindy",J Med Ethics,162,24

Present Findings: COVID-19 vaccine development efforts started in early January 2020 when Chinese scientists shared the Coronavirus genomic sequence in public domain. Approximately 321 research groups initiated the search for a vaccine, out of which 41 have reached phase I/II trails and 11 reached phase-III clinical trials, including approved vaccines for early to limited use. Out of these projects are two labs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still in early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several vaccine attempts are being tested from traditional, attenuated virus methods, to new nucleic acid-based designs. However, no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials and reached public domain.In spite of the challenges faced during previous vaccine trials, researchers have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 is structurally similar to the (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Both SARS strains show identical affinity towards the type-II alveolar pneumocytes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor binding domains and therefore, similar pathogenicity. The race to develop the vaccine is predominantly for individuals at high risk of developing the infection, i.e. population groups who are most susceptible to experiencing fatal symptoms of the coronavirus. These include patients with comorbidities, above the age of 60 years and people at risk of contracting large viral loads, such as healthcare providers caring for critical admissions in in-patient wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Room settings. Summary: Many different vaccine strategies are under development throughout different stages of the research timeline; however, it is estimated that none will show favorable results before end of 2020. For any immunization or interventional prevention/therapy system to reach the public and patients at high risk, it needs to undergo multiple phase trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this scoping review we aim to map the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and provide recommendations related to gaps in research, applicability and expected challenges for implementation of nationwide vaccination in Saudi Arabia.","TofailAhmed Raja, AlAnoud; Alshamsan, Aws; Al-Jedai, Ahmed",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,162,6

We examined SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies in a longitudinal cohort, comparing antibody decay in individuals who received an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We completed a longitudinal cohort of healthcare workers (HWs) between June 2020 and September 2021. HWs were included if they had a serum sample collected after SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or a serum sample collected [≥] 14 days after second dose of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Linear regression models adjusting for vaccine type, age, and sex were used to compare post-vaccination antibody levels between 1) HWs with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2) HWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [≤] 90 days and > 90 days prior to first vaccine. Serum was collected from 98 HWs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and before vaccine, and 1960 HWs [≥] 14 days following second vaccine dose. Serum spike antibody levels were higher after vaccination than after natural infection. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals, those with prior infection maintained higher post-vaccination mean spike IgG values at 1, 3, and 6 months, after adjusting for age, sex, and vaccine type. Individuals with PCR-confirmed infection > 90 days before vaccination had higher post-vaccination antibody levels than individuals infected [≤] 90 days before vaccination. Individuals with three exposures to spike protein maintain the highest antibody levels particularly when first and second exposures were greater than 90 days apart. A booster dose provides a third exposure and may similarly induce a more durable antibody response.","Zhong, Diana; Xiao, Shaoming; Debes, Amanda K; Egbert, Emily R; Caturegli, Patrizio; Colantuoni, Elizabeth; Milstone, Aaron M",,162,16

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread to nearly all countries of the world in only a few months. However, in different countries, the COVID-19 epidemic takes variable shapes and forms in how it affects communities. Until now, the insights gained on COVID-19 have been largely dominated by the COVID-19 epidemics and the lockdowns in China, Europe and the USA. But this variety of global trajectories is little described, analysed or understood. In only a few months, an enormous amount of scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been uncovered (knowns). But important knowledge gaps remain (unknowns). Learning from the variety of ways the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding across the globe can potentially contribute to solving the COVID-19 puzzle. This paper tries to make sense of this variability-by exploring the important role that context plays in these different COVID-19 epidemics; by comparing COVID-19 epidemics with other respiratory diseases, including other coronaviruses that circulate continuously; and by highlighting the critical unknowns and uncertainties that remain. These unknowns and uncertainties require a deeper understanding of the variable trajectories of COVID-19.

We administer the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Civilian Version, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, and Burnout Inventory. We conduct data collection via Google Forms. Results: Health workers working in the front line in the fight against COVID-19 showed higher levels of anxiety and psychological distress when compared to health professionals who do not deal directly with COVID-19 and professionals who are not in the area of health. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health professionals who work on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19 tend to have higher levels of concern and anguish about the future, a high level of stress, mental tiredness, irritation, and fatigue. The findings indicate that these public demands psychological and psychiatric support to face the pandemic’s challenges. © 2021 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.","Salvador, A.

These analyses showed that 19-27% of hospitalized patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 developed acute myocardial injury, defined as an increase in troponin levels. Fifty-sixty percent of these patients died. The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease. Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration. In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels. In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.","Alderighi, Camilla; Rasoini, Raffaele; Ambrosio, Giuseppe; Valente, Serafina; Gensini, Gian Franco",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),162,6

Still, the low-throughput nature of and biosafety concerns related to traditional antiviral assays hinders the discovery of new inhibitors. With the advances of reverse genetics, reporter replicon systems have become an alternative tool for the screening of DAAs. Herein, we review decades of the use of (+) ssRNA viruses replicon systems for the discovery of antiviral agents. We summarize different strategies used to develop those systems, as well as highlight some of the most promising inhibitors identified by the method.

Global health systems, including emergency medical systems, are suffering from a lack of medical resources. Using a method for classifying patients visiting the emergency department (ED), we aimed to investigate trends in emergency medical system usage during the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients who visited emergency medical institutions registered with the National Emergency Department Information System database from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2020. The primary outcome was identification of changes in the distribution of patients visiting the ED according to the type of emergency medical institution. The secondary outcome was a detailed comparison of Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) levels and patient distributions before and during the infectious disaster crisis period. RESULTS: Severe patients visited regional emergency centers (RECs) and local emergency centers (LECs) more frequently during the COVID-19 period, and disposition status warranting admission to the intensive care unit or resulting in death was more common in RECs and LECs during the COVID-19 period [RECs, before COVID-19: 300686 (6.3%), during COVID-19: 33548 (8.0%) (p<0.001); LECs, before COVID-19: 373593 (3.7%), during COVID-19: 38873 (4.5%) (p<0.001)]. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 period, severe patients were shifted to advanced emergency medical institutions, and the KTAS better reflected severe patients. Patient distribution according to the stage of emergency medical institution improved, and validation of the KTAS triage increased more in RECs.","Kim, Sun Ju; Kim, Hyun; Park, Yu Hyun; Kang, Chan Young; Ro, Young Sun; Kim, Oh Hyun",Yonsei Med J,162,16

METHODS: In this retrospective study, consecutive COVID-19 patients over 60 years old in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6 were included. Data of demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, medications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sequential alterations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored. RESULTS: 330 patients were included and classified into two groups with normal (n=234) or elevated ALT (n=96). There were fewer females (40.6% vs 54.7%, P=0.020) and more critical cases (30.2% vs. 19.2%, P=0.026) in patients with elevated ALT compared to the normal group. Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41-100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10-17) days and recovered at 28 (18-35) days from disease onset. For most patients, the elevation of serum ALT levels occurred at 6-20 days after disease onset and reached their peak values within a similar time frame. The recovery of serum ALT levels to normal frequently occurred at 16-20 days or 31-35 days after disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: Liver function abnormalities were observed in 29.1% of the elderly COVID-19 patients, which were slightly and transient in most cases. Liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 may be correlated with bacterial infection.","Yu, Xiaomei; He, Wenbo; Wang, Lang; Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Huafen; Zhou, Jiali; Jiang, Hong",Int J Clin Pract,162,20

One example is Babylon GP at Hand (BGPaH), which offers video consultations to National Health Service patients, 24 hours a day, and has grown rapidly in London over the last 3 years. The development of this type of service has been controversial, particularly in the United Kingdom, but there has been little formal published evaluation of these services in any country. This paper outlines the main controversies about the use of privately provided video consultation services for primary care and shows how they are informed by the limited evaluations that have been conducted, particularly the evaluation of BGPaH. This paper describes the advantages of these services in terms of convenience, speed of access, the ability to consult without traveling or face-to-face patient-doctor contact, and the possibility of recruiting doctors who cannot work in conventional settings or do not live near the patients. It also highlights the concerns and uncertainties about quality and safety, demand, fragmentation of care, impact on other health services, efficiency, and equity. There are questions about whether private primary care services based on video consultations have a sustainable business model and whether they will undermine other health care providers. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the use of video consulting has become more widespread within conventional primary care services, and this is likely to have lasting consequences for the future delivery of primary care. It is important to understand the extent to which lessons from the evaluation of BGPaH and other private services based on a video-first model are relevant to the use of video consulting within conventional general practices, and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these developments, before video consultation-based services in primary care become more widely established.","Salisbury, Chris; Quigley, Anna; Hex, Nick; Aznar, Camille",J Med Internet Res,162,16

To further explore this area, we developed a novel palpation device consisting of a uniquely designed nodule mechanism (based on optimizing nodule top and bottom hemisphere wall thickness and manipulating granular jamming method) that can vary stiffness while maintaining the shape of the same nodule display, for which current devices are not capable of in terms of aping a tumor. Methods: This paper evaluates the manufacturing approach of the nodule, exploring several iterations of the nodule prototype. Experiments were performed on nodule prototypes of varying wall thicknesses in order to evaluate its effect on stiffness and deformation. Results and Conclusions: Experimental results showed that nodule top and bottom wall thickness had a significant effect on the stiffness and deformation of the nodule. The higher the thickness of the top hemisphere and the lower the thickness of the bottom hemisphere, the greater the stiffness the nodule can achieve. Similarly, the display shape of the nodule can be maintained with minimal or no deformation if the nodule top hemisphere thickness is optimally higher than bottom hemisphere thickness.","Biswas, Pradipta",Micromachines,162,15

The ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic has resulted in dramatic reductions in human mobility due to social distancing measures; the effects on vector-borne illnesses are not known. Here we examine the pre and post differences of dengue case counts in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and estimate the effects of social distancing as a treatment effect whilst adjusting for temporal confounders. We found that social distancing is expected to lead to 4.32 additional cases per 100,000 individuals in Thailand per month, which equates to 170 more cases per month in the Bangkok province (95% CI: 100-242) and 2008 cases in the country as a whole (95% CI: 1170-2846). Social distancing policy estimates for Thailand were also found to be robust to model misspecification, and variable addition and omission. Conversely, no significant impact on dengue transmission was found in Singapore or Malaysia. Across country disparities in social distancing policy effects on reported dengue cases are reasoned to be driven by differences in workplace-residence structure, with an increase in transmission risk of arboviruses from social distancing primarily through heightened exposure to vectors in elevated time spent at residences, demonstrating the need to understand the effects of location on dengue transmission risk under novel population mixing conditions such as those under social distancing policies.","Lim, Jue Tao; Dickens, Borame Sue Lee; Chew, Lawrence Zheng Xiong; Choo, Esther Li Wen; Koo, Joel Ruihan; Aik, Joel; Ng, Lee Ching; Cook, Alex R",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,162,17

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, new structural data from many viral proteins have been provided at a very fast pace. This effort includes many cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, together with more traditional ones (X-rays, NMR), using several modeling approaches and complemented with structural predictions. At the same time, a plethora of new genomics and interactomics information (including fragment screening and structure-based virtual screening efforts) have been made available from different servers. In this context we have developed 3DBionotes-COVID-19 as an answer to: (1) The need to explore multi-omics data in a unified context with a special focus on structural information and (2) the drive to incorporate quality measurements, especially in the form of advanced validation metrics for cryogenic Electron Microscopy.

We use networks that link countries where the links themselves, or their weights, are determined by the degree of export trade between the countries. We extend these models to include node-specific time series exogenous variables (GNARX models), using this to incorporate COVID-19 mitigation stringency indices and COVID-19 death rates into our analysis.

This is particularly of importance in view of the rates of failure of seroconversion and re-infection after COVID-19 infection, which could make the vaccine role and response debatable. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have an established immune-modulatory role, but their effects as adjuvants to vaccination have not been explored to date. It is increasingly recognized that PPAR agonists can upregulate the levels of anti-apoptotic factors such as MCL-1. Such effect can improve the results of vaccination by enhancing the longevity of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). The interaction between PPAR agonists and the immune system does not halt here, as T cell memory is also stimulated through enhanced T regulatory cells, antagonizing PD-L1 and switching the metabolism of T cells to fatty acid oxidation, which has a remarkable effect on the persistence of T memory cells. What is even of a more significant value is the effect of PPAR gamma on ensuring a profound secretion of antibodies upon re-exposure to the offending antigen through upregulating lipoxin B4, therefore potentially assisting the vaccine response and deterring re-infection. SHORT CONCLUSION: In view of the above, we suggest the use of PPAR as adjuvants to vaccines in general especially the emerging COVID-19 vaccine due to their role in enhancing immunologic memory through DNA-dependent mechanisms.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Menshawey, Rahma; Ismail, Jumana H; Husseiny, Reem J; Husseiny, Yousef M; Yacoub, Shenoda; Kamel, Aya; Hozaien, Rafeef; Yacoub, Elaria; Menshawey, Esraa; Abdelmalek, Abanoub; Abouelazaem, Ahmed; Elhatw, Ahmed; Aboelmaaty, Ahmed; Shahib, Alaaelrahman; Mansour, Amany; Kamal, Aya; Mohamed, Basant; Atif, Bemen; Ghabreal, Beshoy; Abdelmalak, Catherine; Ibrahim, David; Elsaify, Ebtesam; Magdy, Farah; Hanna, Farid G; Hafez, Hadeer; Dahir, Hafsa; Merhom, Kerlos; Ahmed, Maram; Bishara, Mariam; Tawfik, Mina; Youssef, Mina; El Sharnouby, Mohamed; Hamouda, Mourad; Ammar, Musheera; Ali, Nada; Daniel, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; Abdelraouf, Noha; Abdelhameed, Nuran K; Ahmed, Radwa; Othman, Radwa; Mohamadein, Rahma; Allam, Rana; Elgendy, Rana; Shebl, Rana; Elsherbiney, Saged; Fouad, Sarah; Emel, Sara; Owais, Sara",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,162,16

We formulate this task as a link prediction problem where both compounds and diseases correspond to entities in a knowledge graph. To overcome apparent weaknesses of existing algorithms, we propose a new method, PoLo, that combines policy-guided walks based on reinforcement learning with logical rules. These rules are integrated into the algorithm by using a novel reward function. We apply our method to Hetionet, which integrates biomedical information from 29 prominent bioinformatics databases.

These differences are likely due to gender-specific behaviors, genetic and hormonal factors, and sex differences in biological pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several social, behavioral, and comorbid factors are implicated in the generally worse outcomes in men compared with women. Underlying biological sex differences and their effects on COVID-19 outcomes, however, have received less attention. The present review summarizes the available literature regarding proposed molecular and cellular markers of COVID-19 infection, their associations with health outcomes, and any reported modification by sex. Biological sex differences characterized by such biomarkers exist within healthy populations and also differ with age- and sex-specific conditions, such as pregnancy and menopause. In the context of COVID-19, descriptive biomarker levels are often reported by sex, but data pertaining to the effect of patient sex on the relationship between biomarkers and COVID-19 disease severity/outcomes are scarce. Such biomarkers may offer plausible explanations for the worse COVID-19 outcomes seen in men. There is the need for larger studies with sex-specific reporting and robust analyses to elucidate how sex modifies cellular and molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2.

Although recommended in most guidelines, the uptake of the role of the TAVI programme nurse is uneven across international regions. COVID-19 is further highlighting why a nurse-led central point of coordination and communication is a vital asset for patients and programmes. We propose an alternative streamlined evaluation pathway to minimize patients' pre-procedure exposure to the hospital environment while ensuring appropriate treatment decision and shared decision-making. The competing demands created by COVID-19 require vigilant wait list management, with risk stratification, telephone surveillance and optimized triage and prioritization.

We aimed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from China. METHODS: Data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and the World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) were extracted as the training set and the data from Mar 6 to 9 as the validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death were collected and analyzed. We analyzed the data above through the State Transition Matrix model. RESULTS: The optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of - 3.87%), the cautiously optimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of - 2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of - 1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. The IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6 to 12, Italy Mar 10 to 24, and Iran Mar 10 to 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20 k in South Korea, 209 k in Italy, and 226 k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be earlier than predicted above. CONCLUSION: The end of the pandemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to curb the development of COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Xinyi; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian",BMC Infect Dis,162,16

This review summarizes the different models used to efficiently reproduce certain aspects of BM in vitro; however, they still lack the complexity of this tissue, which is relevant for fundamental aspects such as drug resistance development in multiple myeloma. Extracellular matrix composition, material topography, vascularization, cellular composition or stemness vs. differentiation balance are discussed as variables that could be rationally defined in tissue engineering approaches for achieving more relevant in vitro models. Fully humanized platforms closely resembling natural interactions still remain challenging and the question of to what extent accurate tissue complexity reproduction is essential to reliably predict drug responses is controversial.

Three-dimensional spheroid culture of ADSC improves stem cell proliferation and differentiation, increasing their potential for clinical applications. In this study we aimed to detect if MF levitated culture of ADSC loaded with proprietary MNP maintain the properties of ADSC and improve their performances. Levitated ADSC-MNP formed aggregates with increased volume and reduced number compared to nonlevitated ones. ADSC-MNP from levitated spheroid displayed higher viability, proliferation and mobility compared to nonlevitated and 2D culture. Levitated and nonlevitated ADSC-MNP spheroids underwent three lineage differentiation, demonstrating preserved ADSC stemness. Quantitative osteogenesis showed similar values in MNP-loaded levitated and nonlevitated spheroids. Significant increases in adipogenic conversion was observed for all 3D formulation. Chondrogenic conversion in levitated and nonlevitated spheroids produced comparable ratio glucosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA. Increased chondrogenesis could be observed for ADSC-MNP in both levitated and nonlevitated condition. Taken together, ADSC-MNP levitated spheroids retain stemness and display superior cell viability and migratory capabilities. Furthermore, the method consistently increases spheroid maneuverability, potentially facilitating large scale manufacturing and automation. Levitated spheroid culture of ADSC-MNP can be further tested for various application in regenerative medicine and organ modeling.","Labusca, Luminita; Herea, Dumitru Daniel; Minuti, Anca Emanuela; Stavila, Cristina; Danceanu, Camelia; Grigoras, Marian; Ababei, Gabriel; Chiriac, Horia; Lupu, Nicoleta",,162,16

This fine-tuned Chess Transformer generates plausible strategies and displays game formations identifiable as classic openings, such as English or the Slav Exchange. Finally, in live play, the novel model demonstrates a human-to-transformer interface that correctly filters illegal moves and provides a novel method to challenge the transformer's chess strategies.

We further explain how its spike (S) protein undergoes conformational transition from prefusion to postfusion with the help of proteases like furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins. We then review the ongoing experimental studies and clinical trials of antibodies, peptides, or small-molecule compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and discuss how these antiviral therapies targeting host-pathogen interaction could potentially suppress viral attachment, reduce the exposure of fusion peptide to curtail membrane fusion and block the formation of six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core.

However, until now, the adoption of robotics in formal education has remained relatively scarce. Among other causes, this is due to the difficulty of determining the alignment of educational robotic learning activities with the learning outcomes envisioned by the curriculum, as well as their integration with traditional, non-robotics learning activities that are well established in teachers' practices. This work investigates the integration of ER into formal mathematics education, through a quasi-experimental study employing the Thymio robot and Scratch programming to teach geometry to two classes of 15-year-old students, for a total of 26 participants. Three research questions were addressed: (1) Should an ER-based theoretical lecture precede, succeed or replace a traditional theoretical lecture? (2) What is the students' perception of and engagement in the ER-based lecture and exercises? (3) Do the findings differ according to students' prior appreciation of mathematics? The results suggest that ER activities are as valid as traditional ones in helping students grasp the relevant theoretical concepts. Robotics activities seem particularly beneficial during exercise sessions: students freely chose to do exercises that included the robot, rated them as significantly more interesting and useful than their traditional counterparts, and expressed their interest in introducing ER in other mathematics lectures. Finally, results were generally consistent between the students that like and did not like mathematics, suggesting the use of robotics as a means to broaden the number of students engaged in the discipline.","Brender, J'erome; El-Hamamsy, Laila; Bruno, Barbara; Chessel-Lazzarotto, Fr'ed'erique; Zufferey, Jessica Dehler; Mondada, Francesco",,162,16

The virus was shown to replicate in an immunosuppressed cancer patient for more than 105 days and might be a source of new variants. These patients are asymptomatic and the virus may therefore escape detection and attention and be high-risk. Similarly, HIV-infected individuals may be immunocompromised and support coronavirus replication with increased mutation rates. The patients may promote ""within-host evolution"".

It has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and is a receptor for cyclosporin A (CsA). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases. In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","Tian, Lu; Liu, Wenjun; Sun, Lei",Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,162,5

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether low relative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal intensity can be used as a predictor of good clinical outcome after endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours of the last-known-well time and achieved successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score &#8805;2b). Relative DWI signal intensity was calculated as DWI signal intensity in the infarcted area divided by DWI signal intensity in the contralateral hemisphere. Good prognosis was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days after stroke onset (good prognosis group). RESULTS: 49 patients were included in the analysis. Relative DWI signal intensity was significantly lower in the group with good prognosis than in the those with poor prognosis (median (IQR) 1.32 (1.27-1.44) vs 1.56 (1.43-1.66); p<0.01), and the critical cut-off value for predicting good prognosis was 1.449 (area under the curve 0.78). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed association of good prognosis after endovascular thrombectomy with low relative DWI signal intensity (OR=6.84; 95% CI 1.13 to 41.3; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Low relative DWI signal intensity was associated with good prognosis after endovascular thrombectomy. Its ability to predict good clinical outcome shows potential for determining patient suitability for endovascular thrombectomy.","Kishi, Fumihisa; Nakagawa, Ichiro; Park, HunSoo; Kotsugi, Masashi; Myouchin, Kaoru; Motoyama, Yasushi; Nakase, Hiroyuki",J. neurointerv. surg.

Under combined long-term stresses isoprene emission could contribute to maintenance of the precursor pool for rapid synthesis of essential isoprenoids to repair damaged component of leaf photosynthetic apparatus. We studied changes in foliage isoprene emission rate (I), foliage photosynthetic characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities in two hybrid Populus clones, Nanlin 1388 (higher drought tolerance) and Nanlin 895 (higher thermotolerance), subject to a long-term (30 d) soil water stress (25% vs. 90% field capacity) combined with a natural heat spell (daytime temperature of 35-40 °C). Unexpectedly, isoprene emission of both clones performed similarly and the overall effects of drought on isoprene emission characteristics were initially minor, but the treatment effects and clonal differences increased in time. In particular, I only slightly increased in control plants of Nanlin 895 after 15 d of treatment, and it decreased more than 5-fold in all treatment and clone combinations after 30 d. The reduction in I was associated with decreased isoprene precursor dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size in all cases in 30 d after the start of treatment. Net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, PSII center openness and effective quantum yield decreased, while non-photochemical quenching and catalase activity increased in both control and water-stressed plants. Contrary to expectations, the data collectively indicated that isoprene emission responded more sensitively to sustained stress than foliage photosynthetic characteristics. This primarily reflected the depletion of isoprene precursor pools under long-term severe stress.","Sun, Zhihong; Shen, Yan; Niinemets, Ülo",,162,16

Clinical and laboratory information, including mortality and associated risk factors in relation to hospital settings and available resources, about critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Africa is not available. This study aimed to determine the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) following 60 days after ICU admission, and explore the factors that influence in-ICU mortality rate. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study among COVID-19 critical care patients in 11 ICUs in Libya from May 29th to December 30th 2020. Basic demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory values, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, quick SOFA, and clinical management were analyzed. RESULT: We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5-75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4-10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3-10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1-31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1-2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4-7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission. Several factors were found to be predictive of mortality, which may help to identify patients at risk of mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Abusalama, Abdurraouf; Alkaseek, Akram; Abdeewi, Saedah; Yahya, Mohammed; Mohammed, Alsnosy; Abdelkabir, Mohammed; Huwaysh, Mohammed; Amkhatirah, Emad; Alshorbaji, Kamel; Khel, Samer; Gamra, Marwa; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Abubaker, Taha; Anaiba, Mohamed; Elmugassabi, Mohammed; Binnawara, Muhannud; Khaled, Ala; Zaid, Ahmed; Msherghi, Ahmed",PLoS One,162,24

We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","Xiong, Ying; Sun, Dong; Liu, Yao; Fan, Yanqing; Zhao, Lingyun; Li, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenzhen",Invest Radiol,162,24

Unexpected complications in these patients are increasingly being recognized. We performed liver transplantation on a 51-year-old gentleman with decompensated liver disease 23 days after recovering from a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, despite massive blood loss and a prolonged anhepatic phase, his thromboelastographic (TEG) parameters persistently revealed hypercoagulability. After a brief uneventful early post-operative period, he developed hepatic arterial thrombosis on the 14th post-operative day, and again after 4 days, both of which required surgical intervention. Following discharge, the artery was thrombosed again which was only picked up when he developed a cholangiolar abscess, leading to graft loss necessitating re-transplantation. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to be hypercoagulable. We believe that this hypercoagulability might have played a significant role in the development of hepatic arterial thrombosis and eventual graft loss in this patient. This highlights the importance of revisiting anticoagulation protocols in liver transplant recipients recovered from COVID-19 and base them on TEG rather than routine parameters such as INR and APTT, which are routinely deranged in such patients.","Raj, Anupam Shankar Vijay Singhal Saurabh Goyal Neerav Arunkumar Venuthurimilli Garg Hitendra Kumar Pal Atish",SN comprehensive clinical medicine,162,16

Certain subspecialties like interventional radiology entails a greater risk of acquiring and transmitting infection due to the close patient contact and invasive patient care the service provides. This makes it imperative to develop and set guidelines in place to limit transmission and utilize resources in an optimal fashion. A multi-tiered approach needs to be devised and monitored at the administrative level, taking into account the various staff and patient contact points. Based on these factors, work site and health force rearrangements need to be in place while enforcing segregation and disinfection parameters.

We have developed a brief behavioral intervention that aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalizing the intervention materials, the intervention was delivered digitally to target users (health care staff) for the first time. The adaption for staff's working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with health care staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to pilot the intervention that we have digitalized (for remote delivery and with remote support) and adapted for this target population (health care staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events and improve related symptoms (eg, posttraumatic stress) and participant's perception of their functioning, and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the digitalized intervention and digitalized data collection. METHODS: We worked closely with target users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context (registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work; N=3). We used a mixed method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: After completing the digitalized intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learned to use the intervention independently. All 3 participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome: 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, two or more intrusions in the week were reported preintervention (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (eg, concentration) at follow-up. The digitalized intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (eg, all 3 participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive toward the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing or repeated trauma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention when delivered remotely and adapted for this population during the pandemic was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work and daily life and used preventatively, the intervention may hold promise for health care staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample size, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of a control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting and improving intervention delivery and evaluation, the next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial.","Singh, Laura; Kanstrup, Marie; Depa, Katherine; Falk, Ann-Charlotte; Lindström, Veronica; Dahl, Oili; Göransson, Katarina E; Rudman, Ann; Holmes, Emily A",JMIR Form Res,162,21

However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered. Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.

Key inclusion criteria include BP > 130/80 and a requirement of supplemental oxygen with FiO2 of 25% or higher to maintain SpO2 > 92%. Key exclusion criteria included hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) at the time of enrollment. Prospective cohort consisted of de novo initiation of losartan and continuation for a minimum of 7 days and assessed for adverse events (AKI, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, hypotension) and clinical outcomes (change in SpO2/FiO2 and inflammatory markers, need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation). Retrospective cohort consisted of continuation of losartan (prior-to-hospitalization) and assessment of similar outcomes. In the prospective cohort, a total of 250 hospitalized patients were screened and inclusion/exclusion criteria were met in 16/250 patients and in the retrospective cohort, a total of 317 hospitalized patients were screened and inclusion/exclusion criteria were met in 14/317 patients. Most common adverse event was hypotension, leading to discontinuation in 3/16 (19%) and 2/14 (14%) patients in the prospective and retrospective cohort. No patients developed AKI in the prospective cohort as compared to 1/14 (7%) patients in the retrospective cohort, requiring discontinuation of losartan. Hyperkalemia occurred in 1/16 (6%) and 0/14 patients in the prospective and retrospective cohorts, respectively. In the prospective cohort, 3/16 (19%) and 2/16 (13%) patients required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In comparison, 3/14 (21%) required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation in the retrospective cohort. A majority of patients in both cohorts (14/16 (88%) and 13/14 (93%) patients from the prospective and retrospective cohort) were discharged alive from the hospital. A total of 9/16 (prospective) and 5/14 (retrospective) patients completed a minimum 7 days of losartan. In these 9 patients in the prospective cohort, a significant improvement in SpO2/FiO2 ratio was observed from day 1 to 7. No significant changes in inflammatory markers (initiation, peak, and day 7) were observed in either cohort. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study we demonstrate that losartan was well-tolerated among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. We also demonstrate the feasibility of patient recruitment and the appropriate parameters to assess the outcomes and safety of losartan initiation or continuation, which provides a framework for future randomized clinical trials.","Bolotova, Olena; Yoo, Jeanwoo; Chaudhri, Imran; Marcos, Luis A; Sahib, Haseena; Koraishy, Farrukh M; Skopicki, Hal; Ahmad, Sahar; Mallipattu, Sandeep K",PLoS One,162,16

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence-based medical advice on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self-limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID-19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a ""cytokine storm"" leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID-19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID-19-related topics should be based on more coordinated high-quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology. A total of 150 questions were answered by experts in the field providing a comprehensive and practical overview of COVID-19 and allergic disease.","Riggioni, Carmen; Comberiati, Pasquale; Giovannini, Mattia; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Mübeccel; Alves-Correia, Magna; Antó, Josep M; Arcolaci, Alessandra; Azkur, Ahmet Kursat; Azkur, Dilek; Beken, Burcin; Boccabella, Cristina; Bousquet, Jean; Breiteneder, Heimo; Carvalho, Daniela; De Las Vecillas, Leticia; Diamant, Zuzana; Eguiluz-Gracia, Ibon; Eiwegger, Thomas; Eyerich, Stefanie; Fokkens, Wytske; Gao, Ya-Dong; Hannachi, Farah; Johnston, Sebastian L; Jutel, Marek; Karavelia, Aspasia; Klimek, Ludger; Moya, Beatriz; Nadeau, Kari C; O039,; Hehir, Robyn; Mahony, Liam; Pfaar, Oliver; Sanak, Marek; Schwarze, Jürgen; Sokolowska, Milena; Torres, María J; van de Veen, Willem; van Zelm, Menno C; Wang, De Yun; Zhang, Luo; Jiménez-Saiz, Rodrigo; Akdis, Cezmi A",Allergy,162,33

The aim of this article is to provide a rapid overview of the COVID-19 literature, with a specific focus on older adults. We frame our findings within an overview of the disease and have also evaluated the inclusion of older people within forthcoming clinical trials. METHODS: we searched PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv to identify English language papers describing the testing, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19. PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv searches took place on 20 and 24 March 2020, respectively. RESULTS: screening of over 1,100 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers yielded n = 22 on COVID-19 testing, n = 15 on treatment and n = 13 on prognosis. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology are the mainstays of testing, but a positive diagnosis may be increasingly supported by radiological findings. The current evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral, corticosteroid and immunotherapies is inconclusive, although trial data are largely based on younger people. In addition to age, male gender and comorbidities, specific laboratory and radiology findings are important prognostic factors. Evidence suggests that social distancing policies could have important negative consequences, particularly if in place for an extended period. CONCLUSION: given the established association between increasing age and poor prognosis in COVID-19, we anticipate that this rapid review of the current and emergent evidence might form a basis on which future work can be established. Exclusion of older people, particularly those with comorbidities, from clinical trials is well recognised and is potentially being perpetuated in the field of current COVID-19 research.","Lithander, Fiona E; Neumann, Sandra; Tenison, Emma; Lloyd, Katherine; Welsh, Tomas J; Rodrigues, Jonathan C L; Higgins, Julian P T; Scourfield, Lily; Christensen, Hannah; Haunton, Victoria J; Henderson, Emily J",Age Ageing,162,16

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for digital interventions to improve hygiene practices within the community. METHODS: We reviewed articles published between 01 January 2000 and 26 May 2019 that presented a controlled trial of a digital intervention to improve hygiene behaviours in the community. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure and grey literature. Trials in hospitals were excluded, as were trials aiming at prevention of sexually transmitted infections; only target diseases with transmission mechanisms similar to COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal infections) were included. Trials had to evaluate a uniquely digital component of an intervention. Study designs were limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series analyses. Outcomes could be either incidence of infections or change in hygiene behaviours. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported successfully improving self-reported hygiene behaviour or health outcomes, but only one of these six trials, Germ Defence, confirmed improvements using objective measures (reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions). Settings included kindergartens, workplaces, and service station restrooms. Modes of delivery were diverse: WeChat, website, text messages, audio messages to mobiles, electronic billboards, and electronic personal care records. Four interventions targeted parents of young children with educational materials. Two targeted the general population; these also used behaviour change techniques or theory to inform the intervention. Only one trial had low risk of bias, Germ Defence; the most common concerns were lack of information about the randomisation, possible bias in reporting of behavioural outcomes, and lack of an analysis plan and possible selective reporting of results. CONCLUSION: There was only one trial that was judged to be at low risk of bias, Germ Defence, which reduced incidence and severity of illness, as confirmed by objective measures.

Dental professionals can also contribute to medical care. Major and rapid reorganisation of both clinical and support services is not straightforward. Dental professionals felt a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading COVID-19 among their patients and beyond, but were understandably concerned about the financial consequences.

One approach to improve the efficiency of tests is to mix samples from multiple individuals, only testing individuals when the pooled sample returns a positive. To reflect potential clusters of cases that might queue at a testing site and that might increase the efficiency of batch testing, I simulate 10,000 persons being tested in sequence. I use a prevalence ranging from 1% to 45% and batch sizes ranging from 3 to 25 and assume the increased probability of consecutive infections ranges from 0% to 45%. I find that as the likelihood of clustered infections increases, the efficiency of specimen pooling increases. This analysis suggests that when clusters of infected persons exist at testing sites, specimen pooling can remain efficient even as prevalence increases.

Links between obesity and complications from COVID-19 have been identified, but it is unknown whether weight stigma poses adverse health implications during this pandemic. PURPOSE: We examined longitudinal associations between prepandemic experiences of weight stigma and eating behaviors, psychological distress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a diverse sample of emerging adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 584, 64% female, mean age = 24.6 ± 2.0 years, mean body mass index [BMI] = 28.2) in the COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time (C-EAT) study were cohort members of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018. Weight stigma reported by participants in 2018 was examined as a predictor of binge eating, eating to cope, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and stress during COVID-19. Data were collected via online surveys during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Prepandemic experiences of weight stigma predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms (ß = 0.15, p < .001), stress (ß = 0.15, p = .001), eating as a coping strategy (ß = 0.16, p < .001), and an increased likelihood of binge eating (odds ratio = 2.88, p < .001) among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic but were unrelated to physical activity. Although associations remained after accounting for demographic characteristics and BMI, the magnitude of longitudinal associations was attenuated after adjusting for prior levels of the outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults who have experienced weight stigma may have increased vulnerability to distress and maladaptive eating during this pandemic. Public health messaging could be improved to support people of diverse body sizes and reduce the harmful consequences of weight stigma.","Puhl, Rebecca M; Lessard, Leah M; Larson, Nicole; Eisenberg, Marla E; Neumark-Stzainer, Dianne",Ann Behav Med,162,3

Evidence from a natural experiment in Sweden,15.905066,10.733141,2020,"In this article, we investigate the effect of local financial development on cash holdings of Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Consistent with the hypothesis that local financial development reduces the need to hold precautionary cash because it facilitates access to bank debt, we find that local financial development measured by the density of bank branches in Italian provinces has a negative effect on corporate cash holdings. This effect is driven by SMEs with bank debt. Furthermore, the negative effect of local financial development on cash holdings only exists for younger and smaller SMEs, which are more likely to benefit from increased local financial development. Our work highlights that local financial development is an important driver of policies on holding cash by SMEs and is particularly relevant during crisis periods, such as the recent COVID-19 crisis.","Fasano, Francesco Deloof Marc",International Small Business Journal,162,1

Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations, including P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa, and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10, and 9 changes in the spike, respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site, with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet (E484K, K417N/T, and N501Y), which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced antibody responses than B.1.351, suggesting that changes outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) impact neutralization. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 222 neutralizes all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2-binding site mutations. We explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.","Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Zhou, Daming; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Mentzer, Alexander J; Ginn, Helen M; Zhao, Yuguang; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Tuekprakhon, Aekkachai; Nutalai, Rungtiwa; Wang, Beibei; López-Camacho, César; Slon-Campos, Jose; Walter, Thomas S; Skelly, Donal; Costa Clemens, Sue Ann; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; Nascimento, Fernanda; Fernandes da Costa, Cristiano; Resende, Paola Cristina; Pauvolid-Correa, Alex; Siqueira, Marilda M; Dold, Christina; Levin, Robert; Dong, Tao; Pollard, Andrew J; Knight, Julian C; Crook, Derrick; Lambe, Teresa; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Bibi, Sagida; Flaxman, Amy; Bittaye, Mustapha; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Gilbert, Sarah C; Carroll, Miles W; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Dunachie, Susanna J; Paterson, Neil G; Williams, Mark A; Hall, David R; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Bowden, Thomas A; Fry, Elizabeth E; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin R",Cell,162,22

The BIS (e.g., disgust) is believed to be the first line of defense against pathogens and has been linked to socially conservative values. Ironically, however, the BIS has also been associated with anti-vaccination attitudes. In the current study, American participants (N = 139) completed an online survey with self-report measures of the BIS (e.g., disgust sensitivity and perceived infectability), political ideology, COVID-19 attitudes, and anti-vaccination attitudes. Disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with anti-vaccination attitudes but not significantly correlated with attitudes toward COVID-19. Perceived infectability, however, was negatively correlated with anti-vaccination attitudes and positively correlated with anxiety and knowledge about COVID-19. Right-wing authoritarianism and support for Trump were negatively correlated with knowledge and anxiety about COVID-19 and positively correlated with anti-vaccination attitudes.","Kempthorne, JohnMark C; Terrizzi, John A",Pers Individ Dif,162,33

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of adults admitted with ILI during three influenza seasons (2012-2015). Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza. RESULTS: Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n = 61), RSV (n = 53), coronavirus 229E (n = 48), and human metapneumovirus (n = 40). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P = 0.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P = 0.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P = 0.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1-2.0], P = 0.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4-0.8], P = 0.01) were associated with NIRV detection. CONCLUSIONS: NIRV are common in adults admitted with ILI during influenza seasons.

The pandemic itself has created further cascading economic, financial, and social crises. To date, approximately 114,000 Americans have died and approximately 2,000,000 (as of this writing) have become infected. American emergency planning and response, including for pandemics, begins at the local (city, town, and county) level, close to the individuals and communities most impacted. During crises like COVID-19, natural and other disasters, best practices include “whole of government” and “whole community” approaches, involving all parts of the government, community organizations, institutions, and businesses, with representation from diverse individual community stakeholders. Local emergency management and public health agencies are at the heart of emergency planning and response and thus warrant further examination. While collaboration between the two is recognized as a best practice, in reality there appear to be silos and gaps. This Commentary describes the American emergency planning system and the roles of local emergency management and public health departments. Closer examination illuminates similarities and differences in practitioner demographics, professional competencies, organizational goals, and culture. The Commentary reviews the limited research and observations of collaboration efforts and suggests areas for integrating the two practice areas in future research, education, professional training, and practice. Breaking down the silos will strengthen local emergency and public health preparedness planning and response, ultimately leading to stronger community health, well-being, resilience, and more efficient local administration.","Wolf-Fordham, Susan",Am.

Although such devices are not novel, devising insole devices for gait analysis is still an important issue. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to develop a new portable system for plantar pressure distribution measurement based on a three-axis accelerometer. METHODS: The portable system includes: PJRC Teensy 3.6 microcontroller with 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microprocessor with a clock speed of 180 MHz; HC-11 radio modules (transmitter and receiver); a battery; a fixing band; pressure sensors; MPU-9150 inertial navigation module; and FFC tape. The pressure insole is leather-based and consists of seven layers. It is divided into 16 areas and the outcome of the system is data concerning plantar pressure distribution under foot during gait. The system was tested on 22 healthy volunteer subjects, and the data was compared with a commercially available system: Medilogic. RESULT: The SNR value for the proposed sensor is 28.27 dB. For a range of pressure of 30-100 N, the sensitivity is 0.0066 V/N while the linearity error is 0.05. The difference in plantar pressure from both the portable plantar pressure system and Medilogic is not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The proposed system could be recommended for research applications both inside and outside of a typical gait laboratory.","Ostaszewski, Michal; Pauk, Jolanta; Lesniewski, Kacper",Technol. health care,162,29

This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement. Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization. Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 ± 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ugur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Çörtük, Mustafa; Cinarka, Halit; Tanriverdi, Elif; Turan, Demet; Yildirim, Binnaz Zeynep; Sezen, Celal Bugra; Özgül, Mehmet Akif",Tuberk Toraks,162,30

Using detailed data we find compelling evidence of a positive relationship between air pollution, and particularly P M 2.5 concentrations, and Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths. This relationship persists even after controlling for a wide range of explanatory variables. Our results indicate that, other things being equal, a municipality with 1 µg/m3 more P M 2.5 concentrations will have 9.4 more Covid-19 cases, 3.0 more hospital admissions, and 2.3 more deaths. This relationship between Covid-19 and air pollution withstands a number of sensitivity and robustness exercises including instrumenting pollution to mitigate potential endogeneity in the measurement of pollution and modelling spatial spillovers using spatial econometric techniques.","Cole, Matthew A; Ozgen, Ceren; Strobl, Eric",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),162,32

Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay serves as a surrogate neutralization assay and is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an ELISA for the detection of antibodies against the RBD, enabling a direct comparison. The results obtained with our assay correlate with those of 2 viral-based assays, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that uses live SARS-CoV-2 virus and a spike pseudotyped viral vector-based assay.","Abe, Kento T; Li, Zhijie; Samson, Reuben; Samavarchi-Tehrani, Payman; Valcourt, Emelissa J; Wood, Heidi; Budylowski, Patrick; Dupuis, Alan P; Girardin, Roxie C; Rathod, Bhavisha; Wang, Jenny H; Barrios-Rodiles, Miriam; Colwill, Karen; McGeer, Allison J; Mubareka, Samira; Gommerman, Jennifer L; Durocher, Yves; Ostrowski, Mario; McDonough, Kathleen A; Drebot, Michael A; Drews, Steven J; Rini, James M; Gingras, Anne-Claude",JCI insight,162,10

The circulation of new variants with emerging clinical characteristics requires more studies focusing the impact of preexisting health conditions on outcome of COVID-19 accurately. AIMS: Main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) on disease prognosis and severe health outcomes among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 799 patients with COVID-19 during December 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020 in Bangladesh. Logistic regression analysis was performed for age, sex, diabetes, CVD and symptoms on fatality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to predict the survival rate. RESULTS: Fatality was detected in 40% (318 of 799) patients with COVID-19. Among 318 fatalities, 90.6% were detected in patients with CVD and 74.5% in patients with diabetes. Case fatality rate was highest in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (94, 184 of 195). Fever (91%) and dry cough (71%) were the most frequent symptoms. CVD (42.2%), diabetes (32.7%) and obesity (18%) were prevalent. The highest odds of risk was detected in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (OR: 6.98, 95% CI, 4.21 to 7.34). Female patients had the highest survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 318 fatality was seen in 799 patients with COVID-19. The highest odds of fatality risk was detected in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes. The risk increased many folds when CVD and diabetes coexisted in patients.","Sharif, Nadim; Ahmed, Shamsun Nahar; Opu, Rubayet Rayhan; Tani, Mahmuda Rahman; Dewan, Dolly; Daullah, Muktasid Ud; Shanto, Rakibul Islam; Parvez, Anowar Khasru; Talukder, Ali Azam; Dey, Shuvra Kanti",Diabetes Metab Syndr,162,26

DESIGN: Living systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database, which includes 25 electronic databases and six additional Chinese databases to 20 July 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised clinical trials in which people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 were randomised to drug treatment or to standard care or placebo. Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. METHODS: After duplicate data abstraction, a bayesian random effects network meta-analysis was conducted. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool, and the certainty of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. For each outcome, interventions were classified in groups from the most to the least beneficial or harmful following GRADE guidance. RESULTS: 23 randomised controlled trials were included in the analysis performed on 26 June 2020. The certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was very low because of risk of bias (lack of blinding) and serious imprecision. Glucocorticoids were the only intervention with evidence for a reduction in death compared with standard care (risk difference 37 fewer per 1000 patients, 95% credible interval 63 fewer to 11 fewer, moderate certainty) and mechanical ventilation (31 fewer per 1000 patients, 47 fewer to 9 fewer, moderate certainty). These estimates are based on direct evidence; network estimates for glucocorticoids compared with standard care were less precise because of network heterogeneity. Three drugs might reduce symptom duration compared with standard care: hydroxychloroquine (mean difference -4.5 days, low certainty), remdesivir (-2.6 days, moderate certainty), and lopinavir-ritonavir (-1.2 days, low certainty). Hydroxychloroquine might increase the risk of adverse events compared with the other interventions, and remdesivir probably does not substantially increase the risk of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation. No other interventions included enough patients to meaningfully interpret adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Glucocorticoids probably reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation in patients with covid-19 compared with standard care. The effectiveness of most interventions is uncertain because most of the randomised controlled trials so far have been small and have important study limitations.

The aim of this study is to identify the potential risk factors associated with persistent positive nasopharyngeal swab real-time reverse transcriptionâpolymerase chain reaction tests in a large sample of patients who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: After the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic infection, the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCSS of Rome established a post-acute care service for patients discharged from the hospital and recovered from COVID-19. Between April 21 and May 21, 2020, a total of 137 individuals who officially recovered from COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. All patients were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with nucleic acid RT-PCR tests. Analysis was conducted in June 2020. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients who repeated the nasopharyngeal swab, 22 patients (16.7%) tested positive again. Some symptoms such as fatigue (51%), dyspnea (44%), and coughing (17%) were still present in a significant percentage of the patients, with no difference between patients with a negative test and those who tested positive. The likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly higher among participants with persistent sore throat (prevalence ratio=6.50, 95% CI=1.38, 30.6) and symptoms of rhinitis (prevalence ratio=3.72, 95% CI=1.10, 12.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide a given rate of patients (16.7%) who test positive on RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after recovering from COVID-19. These findings suggest that a significant proportion of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 still could be potential carriers of the virus. In particular, if patients continue to have symptoms related to COVID-19, such as sore throat and rhinitis, it is reasonable to be cautious by avoiding close contact, wearing a face mask, and possibly repeating a nasopharyngeal swab.","Landi, Francesco; Carfì, Angelo; Benvenuto, Francesca; Brandi, Vincenzo; Ciciarello, Francesca; Lo Monaco, Maria Rita; Martone, Anna Maria; Napolitano, Carmen; Pagano, Francesco; Paglionico, Annamaria; Petricca, Luca; Rocchi, Sara; Rota, Elisabetta; Salerno, Andrea; Tritto, Marcello; Gremese, Elisa; Bernabei, Roberto",Am. j. prev. med,162,12

In this study, we described the CAPRI-COVID intervention, evaluated its use, and presented results of the tracking indicators with a focus on the nurse navigators' (NNs) activities and the experience of patients. METHODS: Data of 130 cancer patients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 23 to June 5, 2020, were collected. Six COVID-related symptoms were monitored daily, either by the patient via the CAPRI mobile application (CAPRI App) or by NNs via telemonitoring. In the cases of worsening or new-onset symptoms, an automated alert was sent to the platform, and NNs could immediately consult an emergency physician for future course of action. RESULTS: All 130 patients (median age: 59 years; 59.2% female) were monitored during the study period. There were no deaths or admissions to the intensive care unit attributable to COVID-19; 7.8% of patients were hospitalized (excluding scheduled hospitalization), and 17.1% were admitted to the emergency department at least once during the monitoring period. NNs carried out 1412 regular monitoring calls (average of 10.9 calls per patient), while 55% of the patients downloaded the CAPRI App. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients monitored with CAPRI-COVID were quarantined during the first wave of the pandemic. In addition to the CAPRI App, which helped limit phone calls, NNs played an essential role in patient management.","Ferrua, Marie; Mathivon, Delphine; Duflot-Boukobza, Adeline; Abbas, May; Charles, Cécile; Barrais, Amandine; Legendre, Jennifer; Mendes, Christine; Pons, Magali; Merad, Mansouria; Minvielle, Etienne; Mir, Olivier; Scotté, Florian",Support. care cancer,162,32

Hydroxychloroquine total doses ranged between 2000 and 12,400 mg;treatment durations were from 5 to 16 days and follow up times between 5 and 30 days. Compared to controls, hydroxychloroquine non-significantly increased mortality at 14 days (RR 1.07, 95%CI 0.92–1.25) or 30 days (RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.00–1.16). Hydroxychloroquine did not affect other primary or secondary outcomes, except SAEs that were significantly higher than the control (RR 1.24, 95%CI 1.05–1.46). Eleven RCTs had high or some concerns of bias. Subgroup analyses were consistent with main analyses. Hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients and caused more severe adverse events. Hydroxychloroquine should not be recommended as treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Hernandez, Adrian V.; Phan, Mi T.; Rocco, Jonathon Pasupuleti Vinay Barboza Joshuan J.; Piscoya, Alejandro Roman Yuani M.; White, Charles M.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,162,23

Recent developments in the experimental elicitation and statistical estimation of subjective belief distributions allow inferences about whether these beliefs are biased relative to expert opinion, and the confidence with which they are held. Beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality interact with risk management efforts, so it is important to understand relationships between these beliefs and publicly disseminated statistics, particularly those based on evolving epidemiological models. The pandemic provides a unique setting over which to bracket the range of possible COVID-19 prevalence and mortality outcomes given the proliferation of estimates from epidemiological models. We rely on the epidemiological model produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation together with the set of epidemiological models summarised by FiveThirtyEight to bound prevalence and mortality outcomes for one-month, and December 1, 2020 time horizons. We develop a new method to partition these bounds into intervals, and ask subjects to place bets on these intervals, thereby revealing their beliefs. The intervals are constructed such that if beliefs are consistent with epidemiological models, subjects are best off betting the same amount on every interval. We use an incentivised experiment to elicit beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality from 598 students at Georgia State University, using six temporally-spaced waves between May and November 2020. We find that beliefs differ markedly from epidemiological models, which has implications for public health communication about the risks posed by the virus.","Harrison, Glenn W; Hofmeyr, Andre; Kincaid, Harold; Monroe, Brian; Ross, Don; Schneider, Mark; Swarthout, J Todd",Methods (S.

Otolaryngologists were actively involved in the management of the pandemic. In this work, we analyzed and compared the otolaryngology surgical activity performed during the pandemic in two large public hospitals located in different Italian regions. In northern Italy, otolaryngologists were mainly involved in performing surgical tracheotomies in COVID-19 positive patients and contributed to the management of these patients in intensive care units. In central Italy, where the burden of the infection was significantly lower, otolaryngologists focused on diagnosis and treatment of emergency and oncology patients. This analysis confirms the important role of the otolaryngology specialists during the pandemic, but also highlights specific differences between two large hospitals in different Italian regions.","Minni, Antonio; Pilolli, Francesco; Ralli, Massimo; Mevio, Niccolò; Roncoroni, Luca; Placentino, Angelo; Cialente, Fabrizio; Candelori, Francesca; Milani, Alessandro; de Vincentiis, Marco; Dragonetti, Alberto Giulio",Sci Prog,162,16

Moreover, exosome-mediated non-coding RNA delivery may play a crucial role in ALS, given the relevance of RNA homeostasis in disease pathogenesis. Since EVs can enter the systemic circulation and are easily detectable in patients' biological fluids, they have generated broad interest both as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as valuable tools in understanding disease pathogenesis. Here, after a brief introduction on biogenesis and functions of EVs, we aim to investigate their role in neurodegenerative disorders, especially ALS. Specifically, we focus on the main findings supporting EV-mediated protein and RNA transmission in ALS in vitro and in vivo models. Then, we provide an overview of clinical applications of EVs, summarizing the most relevant studies able to detect EVs in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients, underlying their potential use in aiding diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we explore the therapeutic applications of EVs in ALS, either as targets or as vehicles of proteins, nucleic acids and molecular drugs.","Gagliardi, Delia; Bresolin, Nereo; Comi, Giacomo Pietro; Corti, Stefania",Cell. mol. life sci,162,20

Protein subunit vaccines represent a promising approach but often lack the immunogenicity required for strong immune stimulation. To overcome this challenge, we first demonstrate that advanced biomaterials can be leveraged to boost the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 protein subunit vaccines. Additionally, we report that oxygen is a powerful immunological co-adjuvant and has an ability to further potentiate vaccine potency. In preclinical studies, mice immunized with an oxygen-generating COVID-19 cryogel-based vaccine (O2-CryogelVAX) exhibited a robust Th1 and Th2 immune response, leading to a sustained production of highly effective neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Even with a single immunization, O2-CryogelVAX achieved high antibody titers within 21 days, and both binding and neutralizing antibody levels were further increased after a second dose. Engineering a potent vaccine system that generates sufficient neutralizing antibodies after one dose is a preferred strategy amid vaccine shortage. Our data suggest that this platform is a promising technology to reinforce vaccine-driven immunostimulation and is applicable to current and emerging infectious diseases.

Previous studies have linked cognitive control to electrophysiological fluctuations in the theta band and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) arising from the cingulate and frontal cortices. Yet, to date the behavioral consequences of different forms of theta-gamma CFC remain elusive. Here, we studied the behavioral effects of the theta-gamma CFC via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) designed to stimulate the frontal and cingulate cortices in humans. Using a double-blind, randomized, repeated measures study design, 24 healthy participants were subjected to three active and one control CFC-tACS conditions. In the active conditions, 80 Hz gamma tACS was coupled to 4 Hz theta tACS. Specifically, in two of the active conditions, short gamma bursts were coupled to the delivered theta cycle to coincide with either its peaks or troughs. In the third active condition, the phase of a theta cycle modulated the amplitude of the gamma oscillation. In the fourth, control protocol, 80 Hz tACS was continuously superimposed over the 4 Hz tACS, therefore lacking any phase-specificity in the CFC. During the 20-minute of stimulation, the participants performed a Go/NoGo monetary reward- and punishment-based instrumental learning task. A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that relative to the control, the peak-coupled tACS had no effects on the behavioral performance, whereas the trough-coupled tACS and, to a lesser extent, amplitude-modulated tACS reduced performance in conflicting trials. Our results suggest that cognitive control depends on the phase-specificity of the theta-gamma CFC.Statement of significance This study investigated the behavioral effects of different forms of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in cognitive control. To this aim, we delivered cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation over the cingulate and frontal cortices in humans. We found that when gamma tACS was coupled to the trough of theta tACS, the stimulation worsened the ability of healthy participants to employ cognitive control. Our findings highlight the role of theta-gamma cross frequency coupling in complex goal-directed behavior in humans.","Turi, Zsolt; Mittner, Matthias; Lehr, Albert; Bürger, Hannah; Antal, Andrea; Paulus, Walter",ENeuro,162,1

METHODS: Retrospective cohort that included all population >=50 years with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Tarragona, Spain, during 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Treatment setting (outpatient/hospital/nursing-home), pre-existing comorbidities, signs/symptoms, clinical course, severity and lethality (death from any cause in-hospital or within the first 30-day after the diagnosis) were determined. Chi squared and Fisher's test were used to compare percentages. RESULTS: Of the 536 overall cases (mean age: 74 years;43.8% male), 150 (28%) were outpatient, 179 (33.4%) were hospitalised and 207 (38.6%) happened in nursing-home/social-health centres. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (57.9%), cough (49.8%), dyspnea (41.5%), general discomfort (36.2%), fatigue (24.4%), diarrhea (19.6%), myalgias (17.3%), headache (14.6%), confusion/lethargy (14.6%), thoracic pain (10%), anosmia (9.8%), disgeusia/ageusia (8.1%) and sore throat (7.7%).

RESULTS: A total of 31 participants completed the OLBI; 27 answered the open-ended question. Over 70% of participants qualified as burned out. A thematic analysis was used to analyze stressors. Key themes included impacts of social distancing, changing duties and workload, real and potential impacts of the virus (eg, fear of infection for self or others), and financial concerns (personal and organizational). Less common themes included untrustworthy and constantly changing guidance, feeling abused by persons in power, and positive comments about the experience of working during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Burnout and pandemic-related stress may be very common in the health care risk management and patient safety workforce. Additional research is required to more robustly estimate the prevalence of burnout in this population.

We then frame an optimal control problem with antiviral drugs and second-line drugs as control measures and study their roles in reducing the infected cell count and the viral load. The comparative study done in the optimal control problem suggests that when the first line antiviral drugs shows adverse events, considering these drugs in reduced quantity along with the second line drug would be highly effective in reducing the infected cell and viral load in a COVID infected patients. Later, we formulate a time-optimal control problem with the objective to drive the system from any given initial state to the desired infection-free equilibrium state in minimal time. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is shown to be of bang-bang type with possibility of switches between two extreme values of the optimal controls.

When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra- and inter-assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.","Nie, Jianhui; Li, Qianqian; Wu, Jiajing; Zhao, Chenyan; Hao, Huan; Liu, Huan; Zhang, Li; Nie, Lingling; Qin, Haiyang; Wang, Meng; Lu, Qiong; Li, Xiaoyu; Sun, Qiyu; Liu, Junkai; Fan, Changfa; Huang, Weijin; Xu, Miao; Wang, Youchun",Emerg Microbes Infect,162,26

Since anti-spike mAbs, used individually, might be unable to block the virus entry in the case of resistant mutations, we designed an innovative strategy for the isolation of multiple novel human scFvs specific for the binding domain (RBD) of Spike. By panning a large phage display antibody library on immobilized RBD, we obtained specific binders by eluting with ACE2 in order to identify those scFvs recognizing the epitope of Spike interacting with its receptor. We converted the novel scFvs into full size IgG4, differently from the previously isolated IgG1 mAbs, to avoid unwanted potential side effects of IgG1 potent effector functions on immune system. The novel antibodies specifically bind to RBD in a nanomolar range and interfere in the interaction of Spike with ACE2 receptor, either used as purified protein or when expressed on cells in its native conformation. Furthermore, some of them have neutralizing activity for virus infection in cell cultures by using two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the highly contagious VOC 202012/01 variant and could become useful therapeutic tools to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Passariello, Margherita; Gentile, Chiara; Ferrucci, Veronica; Sasso, Emanuele; Vetrei, Cinzia; Fusco, Giovanna; Viscardi, Maurizio; Brandi, Sergio; Cerino, Pellegrino; Zambrano, Nicola; Zollo, Massimo; De Lorenzo, Claudia",Sci Rep,162,29

In the pandemic background, the country and its institutions have introduced pandemic-related insurance to stabilize the national situation. At this stage, insurance has played an increasingly important role in social life. With the popularization of insurance, the idea of buying insurance to avoid risk has gradually become popular among people. Among them, the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) has been farmers' common choice. The NRCMS, a mutual aid system created by farmers spontaneously in the country, plays a great role in guaranteeing farmers access to basic health services, alleviating poverty caused by disease and returning to poverty due to disease, and promoting poverty alleviation and rural revitalization. Given this backdrop, we study the efficiency of the NRCMS that can effectively promote poverty alleviation and rural revitalization and ensure the people's happy life. Implementing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), we find that technological progress is one of the main factors influencing the efficiency of the NRCMS. Therefore, it is important to improve the technology for providing the efficiency of the NRCMS and promoting the happiness of the society.","Song, K.; Liu, W. B.; Qing, Y.; Tian, M. N.; Pan, W.

This study explored the levels and causes of moral distress and the ethical climate in Dutch ICUs during COVID-19. METHODS: An extended version of the Measurement of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and Ethical Decision Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) were online distributed among all 84 ICUs. Moral distress scores in nurses and intensivists were compared with the historical control group one year before COVID-19. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-five nurses (70.7%), 40 intensivists (8.2%), and 103 supporting staff (21.1%) completed the survey. Moral distress levels were higher for nurses than supporting staff. Moral distress levels in intensivists did not differ significantly from those of nurses and supporting staff. ""Inadequate emotional support for patients and their families"" was the highest-ranked cause of moral distress for all groups of professionals. Of all factors, all professions rated the ethical climate most positively regarding the culture of mutual respect, ethical awareness and support. ""Culture of not avoiding end-of-life-decisions"" and ""Self-reflective and empowering leadership"" received the lowest mean scores. Moral distress scores during COVID-19 were significantly lower for ICU nurses (p < 0.001) and intensivists (p < 0.05) compared to one year prior. CONCLUSION: Levels and causes of moral distress vary between ICU professionals and differ from the historical control group. Targeted interventions that address moral distress during a crisis are desirable to improve the mental health and retention of ICU professionals and the quality of patient care.","Donkers, Moniek A; Gilissen, Vincent J H S; Candel, Math J J M; van Dijk, Nathalie M; Kling, Hans; Heijnen-Panis, Ruth; Pragt, Elien; van der Horst, Iwan; Pronk, Sebastiaan A; van Mook, Walther N K A",BMC Med Ethics,162,1

In many countries worldwide, high-stakes exams happening at the end of the school year determine college admissions. This paper investigates the impact of using historical data of school and high-stakes exams results to train a model to predict high-stakes exams given the available data in the Spring. The most transparent and accurate model turns out to be a linear regression model with high school GPA as the main predictor. Further analysis of the predictions reflect how high-stakes exams relate to GPA in high school for different subgroups in the population. Predicted scores slightly advantage females and low SES individuals, who perform relatively worse in high-stakes exams than in high school. Our preferred model accounts for about 50% of the out-of-sample variation in the high-stakes exam. On average, the student rank using predicted scores differs from the actual rank by almost 17 percentiles. This suggests that either high-stakes exams capture individual skills that are not measured by high school grades or that high-stakes exams are a noisy measure of the same skill.","Arenas, Andreu Calsamiglia Caterina Loviglio Annalisa",Economics of Education Review,162,12

METHODS AND DESIGN: Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services Nursing Home COVID-19 data were linked with other NH- or community-level data (eg, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, Minimum Data Set, Nursing Home Compare, and the American Community Survey). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: NHs with more than 30 occupied beds (N=13,123) with weekly reported NH COVID-19 records between the weeks of June 7, 2020, and August 23, 2020. Measurements and model: Weekly indicators of any new COVID-19 cases and any new deaths (outcome variables) were regressed on the percentage of black and Hispanic residents in an NH, stratified by the percentage of blacks and Hispanics in the community in which the NH was located. A set of linear probability models with NH random effects and robust standard errors were estimated, accounting for other covariates. RESULTS: The racial and ethnic composition of NHs and their communities were both associated with the likelihood of having COVID-19 cases and death in NHs. The racial and ethnic composition of the community played an independent role in the likelihood of COVID-19 cases and death in NHs, even after accounting for the COVID-19 infection rate in the community (ie, daily cases per 1000 people in the county). Moreover, the racial and ethnic composition of a community modified the relationship between NH characteristics (eg, staffing) and the likelihoods of COVID-19 cases and death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: To curb the COVID-19 outbreaks in NHs and protect vulnerable populations, efforts may be especially needed in communities with a higher concentration of racial and ethnic minorities. Efforts may also be needed to reduce structural racism and address social risk factors to improve quality of care and population health in communities of color.","Cai, Shubing; Yan, Di; Intrator, Orna",J Am Med Dir Assoc,162,5

We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy.

Combined search terms included: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"", ""nose"", ""anosmia"", ""hyposmia"", ""olfactory loss"", ""smell loss"", ""taste loss"", and ""hypogeusia"". RESULTS: Our search identified 18 reviewed articles and 6 manuscript preprints, including a large epidemiological study, four observational case series, five case-controlled studies, five cross-sectional studies, five case series of anosmic patients and four electronic surveys. Great methodological differences were noted. A significant prevalence of anosmia is reported in COVID-19 patients. Controlled studies indicate that anosmia is more common in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other viral infections or controls. Most of the studies reported either smell loss or smell plus taste loss. Less severe COVID-19 disease is related to a greater prevalence of anosmia. A quick recovery of the smell loss may be expected in most COVID-19 cases.

Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (É£). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (ß) and R t. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8ß, 1.2É£) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8ß, 1.2É£) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation.

Data on patient demographic characteristics, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes was analyzed. A nomogram was constructed to predict the death probability of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and C-reactive protein obtained on admission were identified as predictors of mortality for COVID-19 patients by LASSO. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.921 and 0.975 for the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. An integrated score (named ANDC) with its corresponding death probability was derived. Using ANDC cut-off values of 59 and 101, COVID-19 patients were classified into three subgroups. The death probability of low risk group (ANDC < 59) was less than 5%, moderate risk group (59 &#8804; ANDC &#8804; 101) was 5% to 50%, and high risk group (ANDC > 101) was more than 50%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prognostic nomogram exhibited good discrimination power in early identification of COVID-19 patients with high mortality risk, and ANDC score may help physicians to optimize patient stratification management.","Weng, Zhihong; Chen, Qiaosen; Li, Sumeng; Li, Huadong; Zhang, Qian; Lu, Sihong; Wu, Li; Xiong, Leiqun; Mi, Bobin; Liu, Di; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Jiang, Hongbo; Zheng, Shaoping; Zheng, Xin",J Transl Med,162,20

Cardiac injury is not uncommon among COVID-19 patients. We sought to describe the electrocardiographic characteristics and to identify the prognostic significance of electrocardiography (ECG) findings of patients with COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: ECG abnormality was associated with higher risk of death. METHODS: Consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and definite in-hospital outcome were retrospectively included. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were extracted from medical record. Initial ECGs at admission or during hospitalization were reviewed. A point-based scoring system of abnormal ECG findings was formed, in which 1 point each was assigned for the presence of axis deviation, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, conduction tissue disease, QTc interval prolongation, pathological Q wave, ST-segment change, and T-wave change. The association between abnormal ECG scores and in-hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients (mean 62.84 ± 14.69 years old, 48.0% male) were included. T-wave change (31.7%), QTc interval prolongation (30.1%), and arrhythmias (16.3%) were three most common found ECG abnormalities. 30 (9.80%) patients died during hospitalization. Abnormal ECG scores were significantly higher among non-survivors (median 2 points vs 1 point, p < 0.001). The risk of in-hospital death increased by a factor of 1.478 (HR 1.478, 95% CI 1.131-1.933, p = 0.004) after adjusted by age, comorbidities, cardiac injury and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: ECG abnormality was common in patients admitted for COVID-19 and was associated with adverse in-hospital outcome. In-hospital mortality risk increased with increasing abnormal ECG scores.","Yang, Deyan; Li, Jing; Gao, Peng; Chen, Taibo; Cheng, Zhongwei; Cheng, Kangan; Deng, Hua; Fang, Quan; Yi, Chunfeng; Fan, Hongru; Wu, Yonghong; Li, Liwei; Fang, Yong; Tian, Guowei; Pan, Wan; Zhang, Fan",Clin Cardiol,162,23

However, there are few studies regarding early childhood-onset cirrhosis. This study aims to explore the causes, clinical findings and prognosis of biopsy-proven LC in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. We enrolled young children with biopsy-proven cirrhosis from January 2010. Till January 2020, the study has been going on for 10 years. A total of 139 cirrhotic children were enrolled, including 87 boys and 52 girls. The median age at initially histological diagnosis of cirrhosis was 2 years old (range: 1 month-6 years). Sixty-two patients reported yellowish discoloration of sclera and/or skin as an initial symptom. Ninety-three patients had definite etiologies while 46 had indeterminate causes. Among the confirmed cases, 31 had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, accounting for 33.3%. Subsequently, glycogen storage disease was diagnosed in 16 cases and Wilson disease in 14 cases. In these patients with HBV infection, 9 finally achieved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss (29.0%) after effective antiviral therapy during the follow-up. Logistic regression revealed that baseline alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio 1.008, P=0.028) was the independent predictor of HBsAg loss. Furthermore, 1 patient who underwent second biopsies showed histological reverse. HBV infection is an important cause of paediatric cirrhosis in our study. The Ppathogenesis of HBV-related cirrhosis in early childhood deserves further studies.","Dong, Yi; Li, Aiqin; Zhu, Shishu; Chen, Weibin; Li, Meina; Zhao, Pan",J. viral hepat,162,27

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, data on the number of hospital admissions due to acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and numbers of reperfusion therapies performed in weeks 1 to 15 of 2020 and 2019 were collected in 4 German academic stroke centers. Poisson regression was used to test for a change in admission rates before and after the implementation of extensive social distancing measures in week 12 of 2020. The analysis of anonymized regional mobility data allowed for correlations between changes in public mobility as measured by the number and length of trips taken and hospital admission for stroke/transient ischemic attack. RESULTS: Only little variation of admission rates was observed before and after week 11 in 2019 and between the weeks 1 and 11 of 2019 and 2020. However, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decrease in the number of admissions for transient ischemic attack was observed (-85%, -46%, -42%) in 3 of 4 centers, while in 2 of 4 centers, stroke admission rates decreased significantly by 40% and 46% after week 12 in 2020. A relevant effect on reperfusion therapies was found for 1 center only (thrombolysis, -60%; thrombectomy, -61%). Positive correlations between number of ischemic events and mobility measures in the corresponding cities were identified for 3 of 4 centers. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate and quantify decreasing hospital admissions due to ischemic cerebrovascular events and suggest that this may be a consequence of social distancing measures, in particular because hospital resources for acute stroke care were not limited during this period. Hence, raising public awareness is necessary to avoid serious healthcare and economic consequences of undiagnosed and untreated strokes and transient ischemic attacks.","Hoyer, Carolin; Ebert, Anne; Huttner, Hagen B; Puetz, Volker; Kallmünzer, Bernd; Barlinn, Kristian; Haverkamp, Christian; Harloff, Andreas; Brich, Jochen; Platten, Michael; Szabo, Kristina",Stroke,162,26

We aimed to delineate the evolution of CT findings and outcome in OP of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 106 COVID-19 patients with OP based on CT findings were retrospectively included and categorized into non-severe (mild/common) and severe (severe/critical) groups. CT features including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, linear opacities and total severity CT score were evaluated at three time intervals from symptom-onset to CT scan (day 0-7, day 8-14, day > 14). Discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU or death), and pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or lesion residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed based on the CT features at different time interval. RESULTS: 79 (74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103 (97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8-50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2-4 weeks after discharge, 20 (29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30-53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P = 0.010), number of involved lobe > 3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P = 0.030), CT score > 4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.010) at day 8-14. CONCLUSION: Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1-2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe > 3, and CT score > 4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT.","Wang, Yan; Jin, Chao; Wu, Carol C; Zhao, Huifang; Liang, Ting; Liu, Zhe; Jian, Zhijie; Li, Runqing; Wang, Zekun; Li, Fen; Zhou, Jie; Cai, Shubo; Liu, Yang; Li, Hao; Liang, Yukun; Tian, Cong; Yang, Jian",PLoS One,162,30

Immune dysregulation with altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to disease severity. Here, we characterized in depth host cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelia (HAE) and immortalized cell lines. Our results demonstrate that primary HAE and model cells elicit a robust induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs). Importantly, we show for the first time that melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5 is the main sensor of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells. IFN exposure strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. However, despite high levels of IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication in lung cells, contrary to what was previously reported in intestinal epithelial cells. Altogether, these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and the timing of IFN responses.IMPORTANCE Mammalian cells express sensors able to detect specific features of pathogens and induce the interferon response, which is one of the first line of defenses against viruses and help controlling viral replication. The mechanisms and impact of SARS-CoV-2 sensing in lung epithelial cells remained to be deciphered. In this study, we report that despite a high production of type I and III interferons specifically induced by MDA-5-mediated sensing of SARS-CoV-2, primary and immortalized lung epithelial cells are unable to control viral replication. However, exogenous interferons potently inhibited replication, if provided early upon viral exposure. A better understanding of the ambiguous interplay between the interferon response and SARS-CoV-2 replication is essential to guide future therapeutical interventions.","Rebendenne, Antoine; Valadão, Ana Luiza Chaves; Tauziet, Marine; Maarifi, Ghizlane; Bonaventure, Boris; McKellar, Joe; Planès, Rémi; Nisole, Sébastien; Arnaud-Arnould, Mary; Moncorgé, Olivier; Goujon, Caroline",J. virol,162,6

It is thus essential to understand how the virus interacts with the host immune system to bring about these varied outcomes and to inform vaccine development. We now know that both antibody and T cell responses are induced in the majority of infected individuals, and that cross-reactive responses from other coronaviruses also exist in the uninfected population. Innate immune responses are a key focus of research and may influence the course of disease and the character of subsequent adaptive responses. Finally, baseline immune profiles and changes during early acute infection may be key to predicting the course of disease. Understanding all these aspects can help to create better immune monitoring tools for COVID-19, including tools for predicting disease severity or specific sequelae, perhaps even prior to infection.","Maecker, Holden T",J. immunotherap. cancer,162,28

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for diagnostic, development of antibodies, entry inhibitors, and vaccines. COVID-19 also recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor binding to viral S protein. Several antiviral drugs and vaccines have been evaluated for the treatment and prevention of the infection by the virus. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, the problems associated with antiviral drugs and vaccines development for containing the spread of COVID-19 are discussed. There is an urgent need to study deeply on the structure, mutations, and function of COVID-19 as well as its pathophysiology from a large population.

Debilitating and even deadly complications have occurred to the millions. A recent study reported 31% of right ventricular dilation in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which is significantly associated with the mortality. Therefore, we sought to search for the lines of evidence in the literature that COVID-19 may contribute to right heart dysfunction. The relevant literature and data from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and Web of Science were searched using the MeSH terms including 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus pneumonia', 'novel coronavirus', 'right heart failure', 'right heart dysfunction', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'pulmonary embolism', and various combinations. The collected literature and data were sorted and summarized. Literature reports that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor mediating the cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that loss of function of ACE2 aggravates pulmonary hypertension and gain of function of ACE2 exerts protection on cardiopulmonary circulation. Moreover, the patients with COVID-19 are more susceptible to pulmonary embolism and severe pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, COVID-19 may cause right heart dysfunction by inducing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Particular attention should be paid to the function of the right heart, the overlooked chamber in COVID-19. Blood gas analysis, laboratory test of cardiac injury markers, physical examination, and echocardiography should be performed to identify right heart failure as early as possible. Once the right heart failure is confirmed, the therapeutic modalities following the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology should be employed to reduce mortality.","Cao, Yunshan; Zhang, Min; Guo, Yanqing; Zhang, Yan",ESC Heart Fail,162,24

This is relevant not only for these patients but also the general population, as studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host defense. OBJECTIVE: Describe the presentation, manifestations and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. RESULTS: We gathered information on 94 IEI patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median age was 25-34 years. 53 patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) auto-inflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required non-invasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 requiring invasive ventilation, and 3 extra corporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (seven adults, two children) died. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that (1) >30% of IEI patients had mild COVID19, and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect IEI patients, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are non-redundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Meyts, Isabelle; Bucciol, Giorgia; Quinti, Isabella; Neven, Bénédicte; Fischer, Alain; Seoane, Elena; Lopez-Granados, Eduardo; Gianelli, Carla; Robles-Marhuenda, Angel; Jeandel, Pierre-Yves; Paillard, Catherine; Sankaran, Vijay G; Demirdag, Yesim Yilmaz; Lougaris, Vassilios; Aiuti, Alessandro; Plebani, Alessandro; Milito, Cinzia; Dalm, Virgil Ash; Guevara-Hoyer, Kissy; Sánchez-Ramón, Silvia; Bezrodnik, Liliana; Barzaghi, Federica; Gonzalez-Granado, Luis Ignacio; Hayman, Grant R; Uzel, Gulbu; Mendonça, Leonardo Oliveira; Agostini, Carlo; Spadaro, Giuseppe; Badolato, Raffaele; Soresina, Annarosa; Vermeulen, François; Bosteels, Cedric; Lambrecht, Bart N; Keller, Michael; Mustillo, Peter J; Abraham, Roshini S; Gupta, Sudhir; Ozen, Ahmet; Karakoc-Aydiner, Elif; Baris, Safa; Freeman, Alexandra; Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco; Scheffler-Mendoza, Selma; Espinosa-Padilla, Sara; Gennery, Andrew R; Jolles, Stephen; Espinoza, Yasmin; Poli, M Cecilia; Fieschi, Claire; Hauck, Fabian",J. allergy clin. immunol,162,5

However, patients with cancer treated with these drugs might experience severe, life-threatening toxicity because of germline genetic variation in the DPYD gene. This is a genetic predisposition with an established mechanistic basis that links genetic variation in the DPYD gene to an increase in systemic drug exposure, resulting in an increased risk of toxicity. Pharmacology guidelines provide recommendations on avoiding treatment with fluoropyrimidines or reducing their dose in patients carrying DPYD genetic variants conferring an increased risk of toxicity. However, oncology societies in the United States do not recommend systematic testing. Instead, on April 30, 2020, the European Society for Medical Oncology issued a document recommending genetic testing. In this scenario of contradicting information, practicing oncologists struggle with reaching an informed decision on whether genetic testing should be applied before treatment. This is mostly due to uncertainty about the clinical relevance of genetic testing from the perspective of a practicing oncologist. To reach an informed decision, practicing oncologists need access to concise information on the genetic variants to be tested and a practitioner-friendly interpretation of the test results. We believe this information is currently lacking. To our knowledge, for the first time, we provide a single guide for health care professionals to make an evidence-based decision about DPYD testing for patients with cancer. This article provides the essential knowledge base for oncologists to have an informed discussion with their patients about the genetic testing for DPYD. This document assists practitioners in quickly evaluating whether, when, where, and how to order a DPYD genetic test.","Innocenti, Federico; Mills, Sarah C; Sanoff, Hanna; Ciccolini, Joseph; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Milano, Gerard",JCO Oncol Pract,162,1

One such barrier, the Medicaid Title XIX sterilization policy, requires publicly insured patients to complete a sterilization consent form at least 30â¯days prior to their scheduled procedure. While this policy was set in place in the 1970s to address the practice of coerced sterilization among marginalized women, it has served as a significant barrier to obtaining the procedure in the contemporary period. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted specific complexities surrounding postpartum sterilization and created additional barriers for women desiring this contraceptive method. Despite the time constraints to perform postpartum sterilization, some hospital administrators, elective officials, and state Medicaid offices deemed sterilization as ""elective."" Additionally, as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has revised telemedicine reimbursement and encouraged its increased use, it has provided no guidance for the sterilization consent form, use of oral consents, and change to the sterilization consent form expiration date. This leaves individual states to create policies and recommended procedures that may not be accepted or recognized by CMS. These barriers put significant strain on patients attempting to obtain postpartum sterilization, specifically for patients with lower incomes and women of color. CMS can support reproductive health for vulnerable populations by providing clear guidance to state Medicaid offices, extending the 180-day expiration of a sterilization consent form signed prior to the pandemic, and allowing for telemedicine oral consents with witnesses or electronic signatures.","Evans, Megan L; Qasba, Neena; Shah Arora, Kavita",Contraception,162,10

These challenges can be mitigated by extensive testing. We study testing policies that optimize a fixed budget of tests within a single institution (e.g., business, school, nursing home, etc.) by varying the number of batches that the tests are split into. We prove that, in an exponential spread model and for reasonable parameter values, the expected size of an outbreak at initial detection is smaller when random subgroups of the population are tested frequently, as opposed to periodic testing of the entire population. We also simulate the effect of different policies in a network SEIR model taking into account factors such as variable connectivity between individuals, incubation period, and inaccurate testing results. We show that under a broad set of early-outbreak scenarios, given a certain budget of tests, increasing testing frequency of random samples of the population will reduce the societal risk, defined as the number of infection opportunities until first detection. For example, testing a quarter of the institution members every week is generally better than testing the entire institution every month. In fact, in many settings, sufficiently frequent testing (combined with mitigation once an outbreak is detected) can decrease the risk even compared to the baseline when the institution is closed and testing is not conducted. The bottom-line is a simple policy prescription for institutions: distribute the total tests over several batches instead of using them all at once.","Barak, Boaz; Nitzan, Mor; Tannenbaum, Neta Ravid; Yuval, Janni",,162,24

METHODS: A retrospective, single center review of 21 patients younger than 19 years of age who underwent CF-LVAD implantation between June 2014 and September 2018 was performed. Patients on biventricular support and extracorporeal device were excluded. Cerebrovascular accidents-ischemic or hemorrhagic-were investigated. CVE was confirmed by brain computed tomographic scan. RESULTS: Of twenty-one pediatric patients, 11 was male. Mean BSA was 1.05±0.41 m2 and mean age was 11.05±4.07 years. Dilated cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure.

Thus, finding a way to identify these two types of user is significant because their attitudes can change the analysis of user reviews of businesses and products. Due to the complexity of natural language processing, pure text mining methods may lead to misunderstandings about the exact nature of the sentiments expressed in review text. In this study, we propose a neural network classifier to predict the presence of biased users on the basis of users' psychological behaviors. The identification of the psychological behaviors of users allows us to find overly positive and overly negative users and to categorize these users' attitudes regardless of the content of their review texts.

In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of ""future"" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain.

We find that the discrete steps of gradient descent implicitly regularize models by penalizing gradient descent trajectories that have large loss gradients. We call this Implicit Gradient Regularization (IGR) and we use backward error analysis to calculate the size of this regularization. We confirm empirically that implicit gradient regularization biases gradient descent toward flat minima, where test errors are small and solutions are robust to noisy parameter perturbations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implicit gradient regularization term can be used as an explicit regularizer, allowing us to control this gradient regularization directly. More broadly, our work indicates that backward error analysis is a useful theoretical approach to the perennial question of how learning rate, model size, and parameter regularization interact to determine the properties of overparameterized models optimized with gradient descent.","Barrett, David G.T.; Dherin, Benoit",,162,16

Dessa forma, objetivou-se avaliar a viabilidade do uso do extrato da castanha-do-brasil (Bertholletia excelsa) na elaboração do meio crioprotetor em substituição à gema de ovo na criopreservação de sêmen bovino. Os tratamentos experimentais consistiram em 0, 25, 50, 75 e 100% de substituição da gema de ovo pelo extrato da castanha-do-brasil em meio crioprotetor, estabelecendo-se a mesma concentração de água destilada e Tryladil em todas as diluições. Foram utilizados cinco touros da raça Nelore com idades entre 24 e 36 meses, sendo o método para obtenção do material a eletroejaculação. O delineamento utilizado foi em blocos casualizados, considerando-se bloco cada animal, sendo assim definido por cinco blocos, cinco tratamentos e cinco repetições, sendo essa última os ejaculados. Os espermatozoides foram contabilizados em câmara de Neubauer para continuamente serem realizadas as diluições nos tratamentos experimentais e envase. Em seguida, as palhetas foram seladas, resfriadas, congeladas e armazenadas à -196°C. Após a descongelação, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto à morfologia, cinética (teste de termorresistência e análise computadorizada CASA), integridade de membranas (teste hiposmótico e epifluorescência), e posteriormente Fertilização in vitro (FIV). Utilizou-se o teste contraste de regressão para os dados paramétricos e para os não paramétricos o Kruskal Wallis, ambos à 5% de significância. Foi utilizado o teste correlação de Pearson simples entre células íntegras ou lesadas com o potencial de membrana mitocondrial. Na análise morfológica, os defeitos menores e totais apresentaram efeito linear crescente em função da substituição, mostrando que à medida que aumentou-se a concentração do extrato, maior foi a quantidade de células que apresentaram defeitos; no teste hiposmótico observou-se efeito linear decrescente resultando em maior número de células com membranas lesadas à medida que foi substituindo a gema pelo extrato de castanha. Comportamento semelhante foi observado na análise de integridade de membranas por meio da epifluorescência, verificando-se maior número de células sem potencial de membrana mitocondrial e que apresentaram lesões quando substituiu-se 100% a gema de ovo pelo extrato. O teste de termorresistência apresentou efeito quadrático para motilidade nas horas zero e uma e efeito linear na segunda hora do teste; entretanto, o vigor apresentou diferença apenas na segunda hora, em função da substituição da gema de ovo pelo extrato de castanha-do-brasil. Também foi observado efeito quadrático para as motilidades total e progressiva avaliadas pelo CASA e taxa de clivagem na FIV, sendo todos os resultados influenciados negativamente com a substituição da gema de ovo pelo extrato da castanha-do-brasil. Dessa forma, a substituição da gema de ovo pelo extrato de castanha-do-brasil demonstrou não ser eficiente na criopreservação do sêmen, indicando que a fração de LDL da gema é imprescindível.

However, persons exist within contexts, and personality coherence emerges from persons in contexts. But persons and environments bidirectionally influence each other, with persons selecting into and modifying their contexts, which also have lasting influences on personality. Thus, environmental change should produce changes in personality. Alternatively, environmental changes may produce few changes. This paradoxical viewpoint is based on the idea that novel environments have no predefined appropriate way to behave, which allows preexisting personality systems to stay coherent. We test these two perspectives by examining longitudinal consistency idiographic personality coherence using a quasi-experimental design (N?=?50;total assessments?=?5093). Personality coherence was assessed up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic and again during lockdown. We also test antecedents and consequences of consistency, examining both what prospectively predicts consistency and what consistency prospectively predicts. Overall, consistency was modest but there were strong individual differences, indicating some people were quite consistent despite environmental upheaval. Moreover, there were relatively few antecedents and consequences of consistency, with the exception of some goals and domains of satisfaction predicting consistency, leaving open the question of why changes in coherence occur.","Beck, Emorie D.; Jackson, Joshua J.",European Journal of Personality,162,33

This paper is based on a systematic review of TTS and stress cardiomyopathy using a PubMed literature search. Typically, an episode of severe emotional or physical stress precipitates regions of left ventricular hypokinesis or akinesis, which are not aligned with a coronary artery distribution and are out of proportion to the modest troponin leak. A classic patient with TTS is described; one who had chest pain and dyspnea while watching an anxiety-provoking evening news program on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An increase in the incidence of TTS appears to be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the TTS incidence rising 4.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic even in individuals without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Takotsubo syndrome is often mistaken for acute coronary syndrome because they both typically present with chest pain, electrocardiographic changes suggesting myocardial injury/ischemia, and troponin elevations.

This has led to guidelines advising against elective procedures, which includes elective arthroplasty. Despite arthroplasty being an elective procedure, some arthroplasties are arguably essential, as pain or functional impairment maybe devastating for patients, especially during this difficult period. We describe our experience as the Division of Arthroplasty in the hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.Patients and methods - The number of COVID-19 cases reported both nationwide and at our institution from February 2020 to date were reviewed. We then collated the number of arthroplasties that we were able to cope with on a weekly basis and charted it against the number of new COVID-19 cases admitted to our institution and the prevalence of COVID-19 within the Singapore population.Results - During the COVID-19 pandemic period, a significant decrease in the volume of arthroplasties was seen. 47 arthroplasties were performed during the pandemic period from February to April, with a weekly average of 5 cases. This was a 74% reduction compared with our institutional baseline. The least number of surgeries were performed during early periods of the pandemic. This eventually rose to a maximum of 47% of our baseline numbers. Throughout this period, no cases of COVID-19 infection were reported amongst the orthopedic inpatients at our institution.Interpretation - During the early periods of the pandemic, careful planning was required to evaluate the pandemic situation and gauge our resources and manpower. Our study illustrates the number of arthroplasties that can potentially be done relative to the disease curve. This could serve as a guide to reinstating arthroplasty as the pandemic dies down. However, it is prudent to note that these situations are widely dynamic and frequent re-evaluation is required to secure patient and healthcare personnel safety, while ensuring appropriate care is delivered.","Decruz, Joshua; Prabhakar, Sumanth; Ding, Benjamin Tze Kiong; Kunnasegaran, Remesh",Acta Orthop,162,3

The behavior of this virus is extraordinarily peculiar and mutates frequently. So, the scientific community faces the problems to analyze and forecast the virus's growth and transmission capability. The combined effort of powerful Artificial intelligence and Image processing techniques to predict the initial pattern of COVID-19 disease identifies the most affected areas in each country through social networking information and predicts drug-protein interactions for making new drugs vaccines. However, AI-empowered X-Ray and computed tomography image acquisition and segmentation techniques help us identify and diagnose the COVID-19 affected patients with minimal contact. In this chapter, our primary motivation is to sum up the essential roles of some AI-driven techniques (Machine learning, Deep learning, etc.) and AI-empowered imaging techniques to analyze, predict, and diagnose against COVID-19 disease. An essential set of open challenges and future research issues on AI-empowered procedures for handling COVID-19 are also discussed in this chapter. Summary This paper mainly deals with the design of Machine Learning model for the analysis of transmission dynamics of Covid 19. The entire globe is affected because of Corona virus. Ventilator dependent, Severe Acute respiratory and quarantine care ICU patients frequently face difficulties for their most basic human interactions, namely communication due to either respiratory illness, language problem or intubated. ICU patients have serious implications with respect to physical and psychological due to non communication problems. Researchers have developed different types of services like Speech language Pathologist so that Augmentative and alternative communication assistance can be given to all health professionals and caretakers. A probabilistic model is designed to analyse the new cases and death cases. Using machine learning approach Regression model is designed and future predications are displayed. The adequacy of the model is discussed along with the residuals of new cased and death cases. PCF and APCAF are obtained. This paper mainly deals with a probabilistic model to analyse and predict the new cases and deaths of covid 19. A new transformation of analyzing stationarity is carried out and based on this forecasting is executed. Summary This research express an impression of automated decision-making techniques that have been suggested for scrutiny of data from IoT based healthcare systems. IoT data analytics plays a vital role in this modern era since data from connected devices reveal meaningful results with better insights for the future. The chapter involves the design of a decision-making system that collects data from IoT based healthcare systems, preprocess and analyzes data, and generates detailed information reports for better diagnosis. Data preprocessing methods such as data cleaning, munging, normalization, reduction, and removing noisy data are applied. The blend of IoT data with analytics technique results to be beneficial in healthcare systems. The collected IoT information like pulse rate, temperature, oxygen level and heart rate from connected devices can be used to analyze the need and severity in the preliminary stage itself using appropriate machine learning techniques. Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques such as SMART, WPM, and TOPSIS are also applied for conclusion production procedure to generate detailed informative diagnostic reports. Being healthcare data, the overall objective is to aid business organizations with better decision making processes through data analytics thereby deploying the right IoT strategy. The result of the next-generation expert systems can utilize the results for further analysis in diagnosis and treatment. Summary The proposed work deals with the design and development of touch and native voice-assisted prototype to enable the intuitive communication & interaction between health professionals and patients who are affected with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), Ventilator-dependent and admitted in Quarantine care. It also ensures the development of the multilingual capability to communicate effectively in most speaking ten Indian languages, so that the patients will be relieved from pains etc., as their queries are being addressed by health professionals. In this prototype, touch based gesture patterns can be effectively used as an interactive module and helps the doctors to monitor and answer to the queries of ICU patients regularly by updating it to the caretakers such that the patients are at ease to express their emotions or pains. The proposed prototype will be made available and accessible in an open software repository. As per the existing methods patients express their needs through non-verbal communication methods and they could be missed out or misinterpreted resulting in symptoms that are poorly understood and the clinicians overestimate their ability to understand their communication feelings. These situations are eradicated by employing the use of ?Touch Voice of SARI? Application. Hence this can be considered as an assistive communication tool which replaces the nonverbal communication to a meaningful communication for ventilator patients and healthcare professionals.","Chakraborty, Sanjay Dey Lopamudra Vijayalakshmi C.; Devi, S.

The corona pandemic once again demonstrates the importance of adequate hygiene measures in avoiding infections. Objectives: Compilation of common basic hygiene measures for clinical obstetrics. Methods: Discussion of relevant German guidelines relating to the work in the delivery room. Development of recommendations for hygienically correct childbirth care. Results: Recommendations for surface disinfection refer to predefined risk-categories in the delivery unit. In cooperation with hospital hygiene, the frequency of cleaning and disinfection must be specified in the facility's internal hygiene plans. To avoid a selection of disinfectant-tolerant germs, it is essential to observe the spectrum of activity and exposure time of each disinfectant. Hand disinfection is the single most effective measure to prevent nosocomial infections. The challenge here is the consistent implementation of the generally known indications for hand disinfection in everyday life. For the hygienically correct management of water birth and maintenance of the bathtub, standards should be developed in every delivery room, the effectiveness of which must be regularly monitored. In a pandemic, there are additional hygiene rules, tailored to the particular pathogen. Conclusions: Although there is no lack of knowledge in the form of guidelines and recommendations, the implementation of basic hygiene measures in everyday life in the delivery room requires perseverance and commitment.","Niederle, Bernhard",Gynakologe,162,13

Effectively stimulating consumption has become a momentous mission in responding to the impact of the epidemic. The popularity of mobile shopping makes shopping behavior no longer limited by time and space, so impulse purchase is more commonly seen nowadays; it can effectively promote residents' consumption. However, consensus has not been reached regarding how impulse purchase emerges as a phenomenon, thus making it difficult to promote consumers' purchase behavior. This article aims to explore the generation process of consumers' impulsive purchase intention during the COVID-19 outbreak from the perspective of system users. For this purpose, the research proposes three mobile situation factors: personalized recommendation, visual appeal, and system usability. They have a positive impact on impulse purchase intention by influencing perceived arousal and perceived enjoyment. The experimental method is used for data collection and hypothesis testing. All the hypotheses are supported. And the theoretical value of the model of ""mobile environment stimulation-consumer emotion-impulse purchase intention"" is confirmed. Based on the conclusion, management suggestions are proposed for mobile shopping merchants from the perspective of improving consumers' shopping experience and expanding marketing.","Zhang, Wei; Leng, Xuemei; Liu, Siyu",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,162,17

The current study aimed to understand the biomechanics of the local flap designs along with the effect of wound closures on the respective genders. Two Asian head templates from opposite genders were obtained to use as base models. A third-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was adapted to characterize as skin material properties. A single layer composed of combined epidermis and dermis was considered and the models were thickened according to respective anatomical positions. Each model gender was excised with a fixed defect size which was consequently covered by three different local flap designs namely advancement, rotation, and rhomboid flaps. Post-operative simulation presented various scenarios of skin flap closures. Rotation and rhomboid flaps demonstrated maximal tension at the apex of the flap for both genders as well as advancement flap in the female face model. However, advancement flap closure in the male face model presented otherwise. Yet, the deformation patterns and the peak tension of the discussed flaps were consistent with conventional local flap surgery. Moreover, male face models generated higher stresses compared to the female face models with a 70.34% mean difference. Overall, the skin flap operations were executed manually and the designed surgery model met the objectives successfully while acknowledging the study limitations.

Because of its authoritarian political system and state-owned media system, how Chinese individuals engaged in protective actions against COVID-19 might be different compared to other countries. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine how the source of information about COVID-19, Chinese individuals' risk perception of COVID-19 (ie, perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), and their efficacy appraisal in controlling COVID-19 (ie, response efficacy and self-efficacy) affected their engagement in protective actions. Additionally, this study aims to investigate whether there is any difference in these relationships throughout the duration of this pandemic. METHODS: A six-wave repeated cross-sectional survey (N=1942) was conducted in six major cities in China between February 7 and April 23, 2020. Participants' reliance on expert versus inexpert sources for information about COVID-19, their perceived severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19, their response efficacy and self-efficacy, and their engagement in protective actions (staying at home, wearing a face mask, and washing hands) were measured. Demographic variables (sex, age, income, education, and city of residence), knowledge of COVID-19, and self-rated health condition were controlled. RESULTS: Reliance on expert sources did not become the major factor that motivated these actions until wave 3, and the negative effect of inexpert sources on these actions was limited to wave 2. Perceived severity encouraged some protective behaviors but its effect varied depending on the specific behavior. In addition, perceived severity exhibited a stronger effect on these behaviors compared to perceived susceptibility. The positive effect of response efficacy was only significant at waves 1 and 2, and limited to certain behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese individuals' engagement in protective behaviors might not entirely be their autonomous decision but a result of compliance with executive orders. After the early outbreak, expert sources started to facilitate protective behaviors, suggesting that it might take time to develop trust in these sources. The facilitating effect of perceived severity lasted throughout the duration of the pandemic, but that of response efficacy was limited to the early stage.","Rui, Jian Raymond; Yang, Keqing; Chen, Juan",JMIR Hum Factors,162,16

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an emerging therapeutic option for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC's therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19. In this review, we shed light on the mechanistic view of MSC therapeutic role based on preclinical and clinical studies on acute lung injury and ARDS; therefore, offering a unique correlation and applicability in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Observational cohort study based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide registry that collects sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain. Patients aged 20-65 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: As of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.024 and 0.7% vs. 4.8%; p<0.001 respectively).

Such a counter-intuitive approach can be considered when more conventional interventions fail. The development of targeted cancer therapies has enabled the selective inhibition of activated oncogenic signaling pathways. However, in advanced cancers, such therapies, on average, deliver modest benefits due to the development of resistance. Here, we review the perspective of a ""paradoxical intervention"" in cancer therapy: rather than attempting to inhibit oncogenic signaling, the proposed therapy would further activate mitogenic signaling to disrupt the labile homeostasis of cancer cells and overload stress response pathways. Such overactivation can potentially be combined with stress-targeted drugs to kill overstressed cancer cells. Although counter-intuitive, such an approach exploits intrinsic and ubiquitous differences between normal and cancer cells. We discuss the background underlying this unconventional approach and how such intervention might address some current challenges in cancer therapy.","Dias, Matheus Henrique; Bernards, René",Molecular oncology (Online),162,24

In this study, we report a quartz filter-based thermal desorption aerosol comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (2D-Q-TAG). It combines a solid-state thermal modulator with a quartz filter-based thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The solid-state thermal modulator conducts modulation independently from the chromatographic oven without using cryogens or compressed air, which makes the system readily adaptive for field measurement. The 2D-Q-TAG was evaluated using C7-C40 n-alkanes and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It has low limits of detection from 0.001 to 0.104 ng. The instrument was then deployed to measure atmospheric PM2.5 (particulate matter with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter &#8804; 2.5 µm) in urban Beijing. It allows in-situ detection of speciated organics in atmospheric aerosols with hourly time resolution. Organic classes including alkanes, furanones, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, PAHs, oxy-PAHs, and alkyl-naphthalenes were well separated and detected. The total mass concentration of n-alkanes ranged from 122.1 to 629.9 ng/m3. Diurnal variation of n-alkanes was captured due to the high time resolution of the instrument.","An, Zhaojin; Ren, Haixia; Xue, Mo; Guan, Xiaosheng; Jiang, Jingkun",J Chromatogr A,162,5

Cranial sensory neurons develop in close proximity to blood vessels; however, whether vasculature is an integral component of their niches is yet unknown. Here, two separate roles for vasculature in cranial sensory neurogenesis in zebrafish are uncovered. The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts. Altogether, we demonstrate that the cranial vasculature constitutes a niche component of the sensory ganglia that regulates the pace of their growth and differentiation dynamics.","Taberner, Laura; Bañón, Aitor; Alsina, Berta",Cell Rep,162,26

The high specificity of aptamers with small-molecule targets (metal ions, dyes and theophylline; ATP) is within 1 pM and 1 µM range, whereas with the proteins (thrombin, CD4 and antibodies) it is in the nanomolar range (which is equivalent to monoclonal antibodies). The recently identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) genome encodes for various proteins, such as envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike protein. Among these, the protein necessary for the virus to enter inside the host cell is spike protein. The work focuses on designing peptide aptamer targeting the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide aptamer has been designed by using bacterial Thioredoxin A as the scaffold protein and an 18-residue-long peptide. The tertiary structure of the peptide aptamer is modeled and docked to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS CoV2. Molecular dynamic simulation has been done to check the stability of the aptamer and receptor-binding domain complex. It was observed that the aptamer binds to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in a similar pattern as that of ACE2. The aptamer-receptor-binding domain complex was found to be stable in a 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation. The aptamer is also predicted to be non-antigenic, non-allergenic, non-hemolytic, non-inflammatory, water-soluble with high affinity toward ACE2 than serum albumin. Thus, peptide aptamer can be a novel approach for the therapeutic treatment for SARS-CoV-2.","Devi, Arpita; Chaitanya, Nyshadham S N",Mol. divers,162,20

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has vastly expanded telehealth use, no studies to our knowledge have analyzed the implementation and success of telehealth for orthopaedic trauma. This population is unique in that patients who have experienced orthopaedic trauma range in age from early childhood to late adulthood, they vary across the socioeconomic spectrum, may need to undergo emergent or urgent surgery, often have impaired mobility, and, historically, do not always follow-up consistently with healthcare providers. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) To what extent did telehealth usage increase for an outpatient orthopaedic trauma clinic at a Level 1 trauma center from the month before the COVID-19 stay-at-home order compared with the month immediately following the order? (2) What is the proportion of no-show visits before and after the implementation of telehealth? METHODS: After nonurgent clinic visits were postponed, telehealth visits were offered to all patients due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Patients with internet access who had the ability to download the MyChart application on their mobile device and agreed to a telehealth visit were seen virtually between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 (COVID-19) by three attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons at a large, urban, Level 1 trauma center. Clinic schedules and patient charts were reviewed to determine clinical volumes and no-show proportions. The COVID-19 period was compared with the 4 weeks before March 16, 2020 (pre-COVID-19), when all visits were conducted in-person. The overall clinic volume decreased from 340 to 233 (31%) between the two periods. The median (range) age of telehealth patients was 46 years (20 to 89). Eighty-four percent (72 of 86) of telehealth visits were postoperative and established nonoperative patient visits, and 16% (14 of 86) were new-patient visits. To avoid in-person suture or staple removal, patients seen for their 2-week postoperative visit had either absorbable closures, staples, or nonabsorbable sutures removed by a home health registered nurse or skilled nursing facility registered nurse. If radiographs were indicated, they were obtained at outside facilities or our institution before patients returned home for their telehealth visit. RESULTS: There was an increase in the percentage of office visits conducted via telehealth between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (0% [0 of 340] versus 37% [86 of 233]; p < 0.001), and by the third week of implementation, telehealth comprised approximately half of all clinic visits (57%; [30 of 53]). There was no difference in the no-show proportion between the two periods (13% [53 of 393] for the pre-COVID-19 period and 14% [37 of 270] for the COVID-19 period; p = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider implementing telehealth strategies to provide high-quality care for patients and protect the workforce during a pandemic. In a previously telehealth-naïve clinic, we show successful implementation of telehealth for a diverse orthopaedic trauma population that historically has issues with mobility and follow-up. Our strategies include postponing long-term follow-up visits, having sutures or staples removed by a home health or skilled nursing facility registered nurse, having patients obtain pertinent imaging before the visit, and ensuring that patients have access to mobile devices and internet connectivity. Future studies should evaluate the incidence of missed infections or stiffness as a result of telehealth, analyze the subset of patients who may be more vulnerable to no-shows or technological failures, and conduct patient surveys to determine the factors that contribute to patient preferences for or against the use of telehealth.

Oxygen isotope exchange experiments were conducted in the temperature range 573 &#8804; T / K &#8804; 673 at an oxygen activity of aO2 = 0.2. Subsequently, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were performed on the thin-film samples to obtain 18O isotope depth profiles. All 18O isotope profiles showed two features, suggesting spatially non-uniform oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients in the samples. A numerical solution to the diffusion equation was able to describe the experimental profiles and yielded oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients D&#8727;, and oxygen surface exchange coefficients k&#8727;. Values of D&#8727; obtained were found, surprisingly, to be different for the two orientations and also orders of magnitude lower than values for ceramic samples in this temperature range. As possible explanations, we examine quantitatively the effect of halide anion impurities and the effect of ultra-small columnar grains on oxygen tracer diffusion. Surface exchange coefficients for the (111) oriented surface were found to be roughly one order of magnitude higher than those for (110). We discuss two possible explanations for the observed behaviour: the enrichment of anion impurities at the surface and the interaction between the surface and vapour water in the gas phase.","Waldow, Stephan P; Statham, Benjamin James; Wardenga, Hans F; Weirich, Thomas E; Klein, Andreas; De Souza, Roger A",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),162,26
406321,406321,406321,Ventricular tachycardia with epicardial and pericardial fibrosis 6 months after resolution of subclinical COVID-19: a case report,15.807376,10.906682,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type­1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. A number of studies, mainly in animals and not involving the lungs, have indicated that these drugs can increase expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the cell entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is currently battering the globe. This has led to the hypothesis that use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19. In this point of view paper, possible scenarios regarding the impact of ACEI/ARB pharmacotherapy on COVID-19 are discussed in relation to the currently available evidence. Although further research on the influence of blood-pressure-lowering drugs, including those not targeting the renin-angiotensin system, is warranted, there are presently no compelling clinical data showing that ACEIs and ARBs increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 or worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV­2 infections. Thus, unless contraindicated, use of ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 patients should be continued in line with the recent recommendations of medical societies.","de Vries, A A F",Neth Heart J,162,30

This review aims to summarize the literature around human milk (lactoferrin, milk fat globule membrane, osteopontin, glycerol monolaurate and human milk oligosaccharides) and infant nutrition (polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics and postbiotics) inspired ingredients for support against viral infections and the immune system more broadly. We believe that the application of these ingredients can span across all life stages and thus apply to both pediatric and adult nutrition.

The current study aimed to evaluate the responses of Th17 and Treg cells in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Forty COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients were compared with 40 healthy controls. The frequency of cells, gene expression of related factors, as well as the secretion levels of cytokines, were measured by flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques, respectively. The findings revealed a significant increase in the number of Th17 cells, the expression levels of related factors (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [RORÎ³t], IL-17, and IL-23), and the secretion levels of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines in COVID-19 patients compared with controls. In contrast, patients had a remarkable reduction in the frequency of Treg cells, the expression levels of correlated factors (Forkhead box protein P3 [FoxP3], transforming growth factor-ß [TGF-ß], and IL-10), and cytokine secretion levels (TGF-ß and IL-10). The ratio of Th17/Treg cells, RORÎ³t/FoxP3, and IL-17/IL-10 had a considerable enhancement in patients compared with the controls and also in dead patients compared with the improved cases. The findings showed that enhanced responses of Th17 cells and decreased responses of Treg cells in 2019-n-CoV patients compared with controls had a strong relationship with hyperinflammation, lung damage, and disease pathogenesis. Also, the high ratio of Th17/Treg cells and their associated factors in COVID-19-dead patients compared with improved cases indicates the critical role of inflammation in the mortality of patients.","Sadeghi, Armin; Tahmasebi, Safa; Mahmood, Arshad; Kuznetsova, Maria; Valizadeh, Hamed; Taghizadieh, Ali; Nazemiyeh, Masoud; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad; Abbaspour-Aghdam, Sanaz; Roshangar, Leila; Mikaeili, Haleh; Ahmadi, Majid",J. cell. physiol,162,16

To facilitate undergraduate student research remotely, due to COVID-19, our lab switched from a traditional to a pedagogical approach of research. Case studies are excellent tools to introduce undergraduate students to a normal scientific process and allow us to capture reality, highlight various research methodologies, and improve critical thinking skills through process-oriented inquiries. Our case study is focused on the most relevant topic in the news, COVID-19 vaccine types and their efficacy. To-date, this has been the largest vaccination campaign with over 15.9 million doses administered in 37 countries thus far, of which 5.48 million vaccinations were given in the United States alone (Jan 6, 2021). With the arrival of the vaccine in the new year, health professionals are now confident in the world's ability to curb the virus. However, there is a growing concern on the differences between the various vaccines that are being offered around the world and their efficacies. The goal of this pedagogical research is to use an inquiry-based approach while developing a case study that sheds light on these concerns. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature search, spanning the past year, using the PubMed Central search engine with ?COVID AND SARS-CoV-2 AND vaccine? as descriptors. The search initially yielded 2,127 journal articles which was narrowed to identify articles on vaccine efficacy (1,122). We then examined the statistics of potential vaccines in the pipeline in various countries. Of the ~200 publications thus identified, 5 were clinical trials, 4 randomized controlled trials, 151 reviews with 9 systematic reviews. These articles were screened for the most accurate, peer-reviewed information regarding each vaccine which was then used to construct this case study. Our case study follows a group of fictitious characters - 3 friends living in the United States with family members abroad. One of the subjects who is living in Illinois is immunocompromised;the other has elderly family members living in India and the third with family members living in the United Kingdom, where there is a new variant of SARS-CoV2. The case study discusses a) types of COVID-19 vaccines available globally, b) efficacy, c) distribution, and d) vaccine campaign. This case study is geared towards undergraduate students in immunology, and allied health programs, graduate students in physiology, nursing and public health, and other professional programs using case-based collaborative learning. With this case, we offer a novel strategy to circumvent COVID-related barriers and move undergraduate research forward, with the caveat that students are not working on their original research hypotheses. The case study research model provides an alternate way to train students in the scientific process to evaluate and identify high-quality research. Further, by addressing the science behind the COVID vaccines, we hope to provide timely information to assist with critical analysis, interpretation and to help navigate the quagmire of information available to the community.","Mehmood, Daniyal Simkeviciute Gerda Poch Mark Perez Morales Tiara Sarathy Jayashree",The FASEB Journal,162,5

We analyze how COVID-19 would likely deepen an existing malaises in the global economy, and what could be done to address these problems while managing the economic recovery. We argue that three fundamental factors that could lead to a solid recovery in the post pandemic era are structural reform, new technology and re-integration. They could be managed by instituting a new “global social contract.” Supported by strong public policies at all levels, especially at national level, these three factors could bring about the salvation of the global economy as it recovers or re-emerges from the pandemic crisis.","Song, Ligang; Zhou, Yixiao",China World Econ.,162,26

Corticosteroids constitute a group of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used in the treatment of COVID-19. Comprehensive reviews investigating the comparative proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of research articles, including observational studies and clinical trials, by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and China Academic Journal Network Publishing databases. Patients treated between December 1, 2019, and January 1, 2021, were included. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients treated with corticosteroids, viral clearance and mortality. The effect size with the associated 95% confidence interval is reported as the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes and the odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-two trials involving 15710 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids (35.19% vs. 64.49%). In addition, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the proportions of severe and nonsevere cases treated with corticosteroids (27.91% vs. 20.91%). We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by whether patients stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and found that the proportion of patients who received corticosteroids was significantly higher among those who stayed in the ICU than among those who did not. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that corticosteroid treatment significantly delayed the viral clearance time. Finally, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 between patients who died and those who survived. This result indicates that mortality is not correlated with corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use in subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections delayed viral clearance and did not convincingly improve survival; therefore, corticosteroids should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Junning; Yang, Weixia; Chen, Puwen; Guo, Jianbin; Liu, Rui; Wen, Pengfei; Li, Kun; Lu, Yao; Ma, Tao; Li, Xiaoli; Qin, Siqing; Zhang, Yumin; Wang, Yakang",PLoS One,162,16

We characterised 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalisation with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza. METHODS: A multinational network cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (United States [US]), Optum [US], Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (US), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain), and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea). All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalised with influenza in 2017-2018 were included. Outcomes were death and complications within 30 days of hospitalisation. RESULTS: We studied 133 589 patients diagnosed and 48 418 hospitalised with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. Most patients were female, aged &#8805;50 years with previous comorbidities. The prevalence of hypertension (45.5-93.2%), chronic kidney disease (14.0-52.7%) and heart disease (29.0-83.8%) was higher in hospitalised vs diagnosed patients with COVID-19.

For the past months, the strategy was to mitigate infection risk for the healthcare team while still providing essential service to patients. A prolonged suspension of the outpatient clinics and endoscopy practice, however, is deemed unsustainable and could even be detrimental. It can compromise patient care and result in poor outcomes, hence a well-crafted plan is needed for the gradual resumption of clinic operations and endoscopic procedures. SUMMARY: As the world begins to transition to the ""new normal"", there are new health and safety issues to consider. Adaptive measures like telemedicine and electronic health records should be utilized to facilitate patient care while minimizing exposure. Careful patient screening, adequate supply of personal protective equipment, effective infection control policies, as well as appropriate administrative modifications, are needed for a safe return of gastroenterology practice. Key Messages: Ensuring the safety of patients, caregivers and healthcare workers should remain as the top priority. To help ease the transition as we move forward from this pandemic, we present a review of recommendations to guide gastroenterologists and endoscopy unit administrators in the gradual return to gastroenterology practice.","Francisco, Carlos Paolo; Cua, Ian Homer; Aguila, Enrik John; Cabral-Prodigalidad, Patricia Anne; Sy-Janairo, Marianne Linley; Dumagpi, Joseph Erwin; Raymundo, Nikko Theodore; Gopez-Cervantes, Juliet; Co, Jonard",Dig. dis,162,1

With a pandemic on the scale of COVID-19, antimicrobial resistance has the potential to become a double-edged sword with the overuse of antibiotics having the potential of taking us back to the pre-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial resistance is majorly attributed to widespread and unnecessary use of antibiotics, among other causes, which has facilitated the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens. Our study aimed to conduct a rapid review of national treatment guidelines for COVID-19 in 10 African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Liberia, Ethiopia, and Rwanda) and examined its implication for antimicrobial resistance response on the continent. Our findings revealed that various antibiotics, such as azithromycin, doxycycline, clarithromycin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin, benzylpenicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, vancomycin, meropenem, and cefuroxime among others, were recommended for use in the management of COVID-19. This is worrisome in that COVID-19 is a viral disease and only a few COVID-19 patients would have bacterial co-infection. Our study highlighted the need to emphasize prudent and judicious use of antibiotics in the management of COVID-19 in Africa.","Yusuff Adebayo, Adebisi Jimoh Nafisat Dasola Ogunkola Isaac Olushola Uwizeyimana Theogene Alaka Hassan Olayemi Nelson Ashinedu Ukor Lucero-Prisno Don Eliseo III",Tropical Medicine and Health,162,1

This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Questionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces. The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and behavior. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration of sleep and sleep quality. RESULTS There were 939 study participants, aged 18-24 years (35.89%) and 25-39 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students. During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not. Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious. The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive attitude regarding their risk of infection and the chances of surviving the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS During a two-week period, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine.

In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases.

METHODS: Case report. A 2-month-old baby arrived at the emergency department for fever, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, he was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe dengue. A week later, he started with respiratory symptoms and fever, he was positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR. Two weeks later, persistent fever, C-Reactive protein and D-dimer elevation, lymphocytopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia integrated diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) treated with intravenous immune globulin, systemic glucocorticoid and anticoagulation therapy in the intensive care unit. Nevertheless, he had persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and high serum IL-6 levels;bone marrow aspiration revealed an hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), so treatment with steroid, cyclosporine and cytarabine was administrated. Antibiotic therapy was added because of clinical symptoms for septic shock. Multiple transfusions because of refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia, vasopressor management and mechanical ventilation were needed. However, because of his insidious clinical course and history of infection with SARS-CoV-2, management with inhibitor of JAK signalling was added. Physical examination revealed silver hair, suggestive for a familial HLH secondary to Griscelli syndrome type 2. RESULTS: In the end, multiple organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, hematologic, respiratory, renal, neurologic). CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C was secondary to an immunemediated injury triggered by viral infections with an overall mortality greater than 50% in previously healthy children, however additional HLH resulted in fatal outcome.","Luna Santiago, L.

Our primary objective was to identify valid seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare their estimates with the reported, and imputed, COVID-19 case rates within the same population at the same time point. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1%-10%, with 5 studies under 1%, and 4 over 10%-from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden. For seropositive cases who were not previously identified as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. The estimated seroprevalences ranged from 0.56-717 times greater than the number of reported cumulative cases-half of the studies reported greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections than the cumulative number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is well below ""herd immunity"" in all countries studied. The estimated number of infections, however, were much greater than the number of reported cases and deaths in almost all locations. The majority of seropositive people reported prior COVID-like symptoms, suggesting that undertesting of symptomatic people may be causing a substantial under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Byambasuren, Oyungerel; Dobler, Claudia C; Bell, Katy; Rojas, Diana Patricia; Clark, Justin; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Glasziou, Paul",PLoS One,162,20

To answer this question, we analyze a nationwide random sampling survey (n = 2053 respondents) coinciding with the period from the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 to its peak. This scale and timing enable us to trace a shift in public opinion. We find that the levels of public support for big government had increased before the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the results show that with the sudden growth of patients, people predicted a future economic crisis and thus demanded the government to implement economic stimulus measures to reduce damage. Our findings imply that public opinion is formed earlier than crises actually materialize.

Patients diagnosed with EVALI have used vape products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and vitamin E acetate (VEA). Hypothesis We hypothesized that inhalation of these EVALI vape cartridges and their constituents induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury, and alters SARS-CoV-2 related proteins. Methods Vaping products were recovered from hospitalized patients at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Cartridge constituents were characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Comparative toxicity of exposure to common vape cartridge components such as medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, VEA, and patient-derived cartridge aerosols was assessed by in vitro and in vivo models. Lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and monocytes (Mono-Mac-6). Cells were exposed to MCT, VEA, and cartridge aerosols and the elicited inflammatory response, barrier function, and lipid-laden index were determined. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MCT, VEA, and vape cartridge aerosols for three days (1 hr/day). The immune response was determined by differential cell counts, cytokine milieu, and lipidomics analysis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lung surfactant protein (SP-A), SARS-CoV-2 proteins (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) were quantified in the lung homogenates. Results Constituents identified patient-derived vaping products included reactive hydrocarbons and various forms of cannabinoids. VEA and cartridge aerosols induced significantly increased IL-6 and IL-8 responses in lung epithelial cells and monocytes. MCT, VEA, and cartridge aerosols induced barrier dysfunction. Increased lipid-laden indices were observed in MM6 cells. In mice, acute exposure to cartridge aerosols caused a significant infiltration of leukocytes in BALF and increased IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the BALF. Lipidomics analysis showed significantly increased eicosanoid inflammatory mediators and leukotrienes. Reduced levels of SP-A levels were seen in lung homogenates. Exposure to cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. SARS-CoV-2 related proteins were not affected. Conclusion Acute exposure to vape cartridges induces cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and elicit an inflammatory response in lung cells and mice, which are potential predictive toxicological markers of EVALI. Toxicity of vape cartridges was independent of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This study provides important identification of potential chemical constituents, toxicological responses, and potential biomarkers of EVALI.","Muthumalage, Thivanka McGraw Matthew Friedman Alan Friedman Michelle Rahman Irfan",The FASEB Journal,162,1

Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (Torbit â¼ 90 min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50 keV to 5 MeV electrons with &#916; E/E < 40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a â¼72 cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5 Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3 nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1 Hz. The spinning satellites (Tspin â¼ 3 s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250 keV - 5 MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN's already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN's integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN's data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1 MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.","Angelopoulos, V; Tsai, E; Bingley, L; Shaffer, C; Turner, D L; Runov, A; Li, W; Liu, J; Artemyev, A V; Zhang, X-J; Strangeway, R J; Wirz, R E; Shprits, Y Y; Sergeev, V A; Caron, R P; Chung, M; Cruce, P; Greer, W; Grimes, E; Hector, K; Lawson, M J; Leneman, D; Masongsong, E V; Russell, C L; Wilkins, C; Hinkley, D; Blake, J B; Adair, N; Allen, M; Anderson, M; Arreola-Zamora, M; Artinger, J; Asher, J; Branchevsky, D; Capitelli, M R; Castro, R; Chao, G; Chung, N; Cliffe, M; Colton, K; Costello, C; Depe, D; Domae, B W; Eldin, S; Fitzgibbon, L; Flemming, A; Fox, I; Frederick, D M; Gilbert, A; Gildemeister, A",Space Sci Rev,162,30

Both syndromes are caused by a critical stenosis or a total occlusion of coronary arteries (mostly due to thrombosis on atherosclerotic plaque), and manifest with a similar clinical presentation. Recent epidemiologic studies show that the relative incidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) moves in an opposite fashion (decreasing and increasing respectively), with a prognosis that is worse at short-term follow-up for STEMI but comparable at long-term. Current management differs, as for STEMIs an immediate reperfusion is recommended, while for NSTEMIs risk stratification is mandatory in order to stratify patients' risk, and then decide the timing for coronary angiography. Periprocedural and technical aspects of the interventional management as well antithrombotic medications are for the most similarly implemented in the two types of MI, with routine radial access, DES implant, and novel P2Y12 inhibitors representing the standard of care in both cases. The following review article aims to compare the two types of MI, with and without persistent ST-segment elevation. The main purpose is to explore their similarities and differences and address areas of uncertainty with regards to clinical presentation, therapeutic management, and prognosis. The identification of high-risk NSTEMI patients is important as they may require an individualised approach that can substantially overlap with current STEMI recommendations and their mortality remains high if their management is delayed.","Mitsis, Andreas; Gragnano, Felice",Current cardiology reviews (Online),162,26

438285,438285,438285,Cause of Chest Pain - Sars-cov-2,15.762087,10.454255,2021,"Poor medication adherence is a global phenomenon that has received a significant amount of research attention yet remains largely unsolved. Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods of measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a new technique for predicting the factors that are likely to cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment, illustrated in the context of potential non-adherence to COVID-19 antiviral medication. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose a new technique called Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. NATA is dynamic and able to learn from emerging datasets to improve the accuracy of future predictions. It produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. Novel terminologies and mathematical expressions have been developed and applied to real-world scenarios. The results of the application of NATA using data from six previous studies in relation to antiviral medication demonstrate a predictive model which suggests that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 antiviral treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). From the results, it appears that side effects, asymptomatic factors and forgetfulness contribute 32.44%, 22.67% and 18.22% respectively to discontinuation of medication treatment of COVID-19 antiviral medication treatment. With this information, clinicians can implement relevant interventions and measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","Edifor, Ernest Edem; Brown, Regina; Smith, Paul; Kossik, Rick",PLoS One,162,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between 1 April and 30 June 2020 at a single Belgian hospital. Healthcare workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included. Participants underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and analysis of blood samples for antibody response at different timepoints (day 0, 7, 14 and day 30 or 60). Patient exposures, symptoms, and disease progression were collected. RESULTS: Of a total of 150 healthcare workers with symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31% (47) tested positive for the virus by NP swab. Of the 47 participants with positive NP swabs, 66% also had positive IgG serology. Of the 99 participants with negative NP swabs who underwent blood sample collection, 5% had positive IgG serology results. Of the 29 participants who presented with at least 3 major symptoms, 15 (52%) had positive NP swabs and 14 (48%) had positive serology. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that evidence of symptoms, even when major, is a poor predictor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in health care workers and raises the question of the best way to efficiently screen this population especially during the upcoming flu period.","Datlibagi, Azine; Tran, Ngoc Anh Phuong; Dugauquier, Artemise; Hoornaert, Mathilde; Mabchour, Ayman; Mayamba, Anthony-Rostane; Fayad, Georges; Wautier, Magali; Van Den Wijngaert, Sigi; Debaisieux, Laurent; De Wilde, Virginie",Acta Clin Belg,162,1

Although the bases of such changes are not fully understood, ultrastructural alterations in key brain areas are likely contributing factors. Recently we reported that aging-related anxiety in male Wistar rats is associated with ultrastructural changes in the central nucleus of amygdala, an area that plays important role in emotional regulation. In this study we evaluated the cognitive performance of adolescent, adult and aged male Wistar rats in multi-branch maze (MBM) as well as in Morris water maze (MWM). We also performed ultrastructural analysis of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an area intimately involved in cognitive function. The behavioral data indicate significant impairments in few indices of cognitive functions in both tests in aged rats compared to other two age groups. Concomitantly, total number of presynaptic vesicles as well as total number of vesicles in the resting pool were significantly lower, whereas postsynaptic mitochondrial area was significantly higher in aged rats compared to other age groups. No significant differences in presynaptic terminal area or postsynaptic mitochondrial number were detected between the 3 age groups. These results indicate that selective ultrastructural changes in specific hippocampal region may accompany cognitive decline in aging rats. This article is protected by copyright.

MethodsThis study was conducted within a cohort of prospectively included patients admitted for COVID-19 in our tertiary medical centres between 1-3-2020 and 1-6-2020. A multidisciplinary study team developed a diagnostic protocol to retrospectively categorize patients as unlikely, possible or probable bacterial co-infection based on clinical, radiological and microbiological parameters in the first 72 hours of admission. Within the three categories, we summarized patient characteristics and antibiotic consumption. ResultsAmong 281 included COVID-19 patients, bacterial co-infection was classified as unlikely in 233 patients (82.9%), possible in 35 patients (12.4%) and probable in 3 patients (1.1%). Ten patients (3.6%) could not be classified due to inconclusive data. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, 81% of the total study population and 78% of patients classified as unlikely bacterial co-infection received antibiotics.

METHODS: A multicenter questionnaire survey about prenatal SARS-CoV-2 screening testing was conducted among pregnant women, midwives and nurses (M&Ns), and obstetricians at all delivery facilities in Fukui Prefecture between June 30, 2020 and July 22, 2020. RESULTS: Of 297 pregnant women, 150 (50.5%) underwent prenatal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and 107 of them (71.3%) answered that because of prenatal PCR tests, they could give birth with relief. One hundred forty-five (48.8%) were concerned about the disadvantages of receiving positive prenatal PCR results. Of 287 M&Ns, 151 (52.6%) answered that prenatal PCR screening testing could reduce anxiety about infection to themselves; this belief was more common among M&Ns working at the nonreception facility than among those at COVID-19 reception facilities (60.7% vs. 47.1%, P = 0.02). Of 57 obstetricians, 31 (54.4%) agreed to prenatal SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening testing, the rate of which was significantly higher among obstetricians at nonreception facilities than those at reception facilities (70.3% vs. 25.0%, P < 0.01). Fourteen obstetricians (24.6%) were concerned about excessive medical treatment for asymptomatic pregnant women with false-positive PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women experience anxieties during the COVID-19 pandemic, and prenatal SARS-CoV-2 screening may reduce their anxiety to some extent. However, obstetrics staff at COVID-19 reception facilities are aware of the limits of prenatal screening and are concerned about excessive medical intervention due to false-positive results.","Kawamura, Hiroshi; Orisaka, Makoto; Yoshida, Yoshio",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,162,30

The purpose of this feature is to address some frequently asked questions about teaching physical education remotely. Specifically, this article addresses meeting the needs of low-income students, at-home equipment strategies, teaching elementary physical education remotely, parent/guardian engagement, and building and maintaining relationships online. The social connectedness between teacher-student and student-student, which is inherently lacking in distance learning, is an important consideration for teachers. It is essential that teachers address the social needs for themselves and their students during remote teaching and learning.

Furthermore, estimated disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages.

METHODS: This study actively followed a cohort of social security workers from March to December 2020 to determine the number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, asymptomatic associated contacts and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths. Workers were classified into those providing direct care to infected patients (COVID teams), other active healthcare workers (OAHCW), and workers under home protection (HPW). The number of cases and rates were also estimated by job category. RESULTS: Among a total of 542 381 workers, 41 461 were granted stay-at-home protection due to advanced age or comorbidities. Among the 500 920 total active workers, 85 477 and 283 884 were classified into COVID teams and OAHCW, respectively. Infection rates for COVID teams, OAHCW, and HPW were 20.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-20.4], 13.7% (95% CI 15.0-15.3), and 12.2% (95% CI 11.8-12.5), respectively. The risk of hospitalization was higher among HPW. COVID teams had lower mortality rate per 10 000 workers compared to HPW (5.0, 95% CI 4.0-7.0 versus 18.1, 95% CI 14.0-23.0). Compared to administrative workers, ambulance personnel (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.32), social workers (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08-1.24), patient transporters (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22) and nurses (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.10-1.15) had a higher risk of infection after adjusting for age and gender. Crude differences in mortality rates were observed according to job category, which could be explained by differences in age, sex, and comorbidity distribution. Diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV were associated with increased fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: COVID team workers had higher infection rates compared to the total population of active workers and HPW. Doctors had lower risk of infection than respiratory therapists, nurses, and patient transporters, among whom interventions should be reconsidered to reduce risks. The presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV, increased the likelihood of complications caused by COVID-19, culminating in a poor prognosis.","Robles-Pérez, Eduardo; González-Díaz, Belinda; Miranda-García, Maximino; Borja-Aburto, Victor Hugo",Scand J Work Environ Health,162,0

For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the knowledge and the different actions in the management of thromboprophylaxis in work environments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study with data collection through a Google® form with 19 questions for professionals involved in the care of COVID-19. 414 surveys were received. The quantitative variables were represented with means and standard deviation and the qualitative variables with percentages and confidence intervals. RESULTS: 414 surveys analyzed. 58.2% were women. The most participatory age group was 56-65 years. 95.2% stated that COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis. 93.6% considered that outpatient COVID-19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis. 60.5% of the physicians did not know any protocol for the evaluation of thrombotic risk in these patients. Low molecular weight heparin was considered the main treatment for thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of doctors consider that COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of suffering VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis than the general population, however more than a third do not assess the thrombotic risk and a significant percentage claim not to know protocols to evaluate said risk.

Recommendations for implant dentistry include the following: (1) what constitutes a dental implant related emergency, (2) how patients should be screened and triaged, (3) what personal protective equipment is necessary, (4) how operatories should be equipped, (5) what equipment should be used, and (6) what, when, and how procedures can be performed. This paper is intended to provide guidance for the dental implant practice so patients and dental health care providers can be safe, and offices can remain open and viable during the pandemic.","Rutkowski, James L; Camm, Daniel P; El Chaar, Edgard",J Oral Implantol,162,24

Prisons may be breeding grounds for infectious diseases because these places limit the health of prisoners in prisons or public health. The research aimed to investigate the management of prisons in communicable disease control situations where conventional management laws cannot be applied. To alleviate the congestion, the prisoners were released categorically affecting the effectiveness of the remedial action of prisoners. The location problem is quite problematic due to the large number of prisoners making them unable to distinguish from the general prisoners. Prisoners undergoing rehabilitation must live with infected prisoners. In addition, the confined space problem made it impossible to allocate space for specific remediation programs. The issue of activity change affects the continuity of remedial activities due to the need for venues for activities to take care of prisoners infected with COVID-19. The transfer of some prisoners to isolate and treat contagious diseases may affect the purpose of remedial punishment for criminal offenders. © 2021.

Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 x 109/L and 1.04 x 109/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.

The incidence and prevalence of myopia have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the impact of the home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic on the progression of myopia among children and adolescents in Chongqing, China. Methods: The survey was conducted by using stratified samplings. Samples were randomly selected from the 2019 National Student Physique and Health Survey database, and their visual function and refractive data were compared with those in 2020. Vision-related behavior questionnaire including digital screen exposure was applied to investigate the correlation between eye parameter and eye health-related behavior. Results: A total of 1,733 and 1,728 students were enrolled in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The percentage of myopia students was 55.02% in 2020, which was higher than that in 2019 (44.62%). The mean uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA, LogMAR, 0.35 ± 0.42) in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 (0.27 ± 0.36, P < 0.001). The mean spherical equivalent (SE) refraction (-1.94 ± 2.13 D) in 2020 was lower than that in 2019 (-1.64 ± 5.49 D, P < 0.001). For students who used digital devices for online courses, the mean SE in the television group (-1.10 ± 1.49 D) was better than that in the computer group (-2.03 ± 2.37 D, P = 0.0017) and in the cell phone group (-2.02 ± 2.09 D, P = 0.0028). The average duration of online classes (r = -0.27, P < 0.0001), the number of online classes per day (r = -0.33, P < 0.0001), as well as digital screen exposure time (r = -0.20, P < 0.0001) were negatively correlated with SE, and the average time of outdoor activity (r = 0.20, P < 0.0001) was positively correlated with SE. Conclusions: Increased digital screen exposure contributes to myopic progression in children and adolescents of Chongqing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suitable digital devices should be provided for online classes and outdoor activity should be advocated to prevent myopic pandemic.","Wang, Wujiao; Zhu, Lu; Zheng, Shijie; Ji, Yan; Xiang, Yongguo; Lv, Bingjing; Xiong, Liang; Li, Zhuoyu; Yi, Shenglan; Huang, Hongyun; Zhang, Li; Liu, Fangli; Wan, Wenjuan; Hu, Ke",Front Public Health,162,20

Reports on cognitive assessment of patients with COVID-19 are often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem to create an inappropriate burden for patients with acute COVID-19, which is characterized by fatigue and confusion, and may also compromise examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess cognition in patients with COVID-19 as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, while observing safety precautions, and to establish a clear face value of the external validity of the assessment. METHODS: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of 6 COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the use of this 5-minute assessment in the diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: The age of the patients varied over four decades, and none of them were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up examination 6 to 10 days later, 4 of the 6 patients had recovered working memory, and only 1 had recovered calculation ability. Of the 6 patients, 2 were capable of complex judgment responses, while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive assessment in patients with COVID-19 using this remote examination reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing of specific temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions may characterize the effects of COVID-19 on the brain. Used widely and serially, this examination method can potentially inform our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on the brain and of healing from the virus.","Beresford, Thomas; Ronan, Patrick J; Hipp, Daniel",JMIR Form Res,162,18

Identifying characteristics of “possible super spreaders”, suggested as a dominant cause of rapid spreading transmission, will help us to design proper prevention strategies. Methods: We conducted a nation-wide online survey to investigate the relationship of perception and anxiety levels about COVID-19 to the possible risk behaviors for spread of the virus in Japan. We recruited a total of 4,000 citizens, who responded to the questionnaire including several questions regarding the level of fear and anxiety about COVID-19, infection preventive behaviors and access to media with trust level about the virus as well as some demographic and socioeconomic data during March 27th and 28th, 2020. Findings: Thirteen-point-three percent of the participants rated “1” on a nine-point Likert with respect to the knowledge about COVID-19. Ten-point-one percent and 11.7% presented no anxiety of being infected and transmission to others. Ten-point-eight percent showed no worry about symptomatic aggravation. Eight-point-one percent had no serious concern about expanding infection. The distribution of these items was highly correlated with each other. Participants with the low level of knowledge about COVID-19 were likely to less frequently access any information sources and neither trust them. They were less anxious about their health status, and less likely to put precautionary behaviors such as washing hands and avoiding crowded spaces, suggested by statistical analyses. Interpretation: The present study suggests that it is greatly important to enlighten those have no concerns about this crisis of COVID-19 and modify their risk behavior via various ways, in order to prevent and control this viral pandemic.

As a result of progressive muscle weakness, pulmonary function decreases during the second decade of life and lung disease contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for patients with DMD, despite known adverse effects such as obesity and immunosuppression. Over the past year (2020), the novel coronavirus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV2) outbreak has caused a global pandemic. Restrictive lung disease due to low lung volumes, chronic immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids, and obesity are potential risk factors that may contribute to a more severe course of the disease. Out of 116 Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy patients treated in our tertiary neuromuscular center, six patients with DMD and one with advanced Becker muscular dystrophy were found to be positive for COVID-19 infection. Two of the DMD patients were admitted for hospitalization, of whom one was dependent on daily nocturnal non-invasive ventilation.

This study examined the prevalence of COVID testing and diagnosis and assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a large sample of SGM. Participants were recruited as part of an online cross-sectional study focused on an HIV biomedical prevention technology willingness in the United States at increased risk for HIV sero-conversion. Multivariate linear analysis was conducted to examine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The study sample included 1350 predominately gay (61.6%), Black (57.9%), cis-gender (95.7%) males with a mean age of 32.9 years. Medical mistrust and social concern regarding COVID-19 vaccine stigma were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and altruism was significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Black participants were significantly less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and Asian participants were significantly more likely to accept a vaccine, compared to White peers. As the planning of COVID-19 vaccine rollout efforts is conceptualized and designed, these data may inform equitable implementation strategies and prevent worsening health inequities among SGM populations.","Teixeira da Silva, Daniel; Biello, Katie; Lin, Willey Y; Valente, Pablo K; Mayer, Kenneth H; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa; Bauermeister, José A",,162,1

While transcriptional dysregulation is observed in many cell types in the form of increased cell-to-cell variability, its generality to all cell types remains doubted. Here, we propose a new approach for analysing transcriptional regulation in single-cell RNA sequencing data by focusing on the global coordination between the genes rather than the variability of individual genes or correlations between pairs of genes. Consistently, across very different organisms and cell types, we find a decrease in the gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination in ageing cells. In addition, we find that loss of gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination is associated with high mutational load of a specific, age-related signature and with radiation-induced DNA damage. These observations suggest a general, potentially universal, stochastic attribute of transcriptional dysregulation in ageing.","Levy, Orr; Amit, Guy; Vaknin, Dana; Snir, Tom; Efroni, Sol; Castaldi, Peter; Liu, Yang-Yu; Cohen, Haim Y; Bashan, Amir",Nat Metab,162,29

The activation of inflammasome in the host infected by SARS-CoV-2 is highly related to cytokine storm and hypercoagulopathy, which significantly contribute to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even though many studies have shown the host defense mechanism induced by inflammasome against various viral infections, mechanistic interactions leading to downstream cellular responses and pathogenesis in COVID-19 remain unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with numerous cardiovascular disorders including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The inflammatory response triggered by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome under certain cardiovascular conditions resulted in hyperinflammation or the modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways. Perturbations of several target cells and tissues have been described in inflammasome activation, including pneumocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. The interplay between inflammasome activation and hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is an emerging area to be further addressed. Targeted therapeutics to suppress inflammasome activation may have a positive effect on the reduction of hyperinflammation-induced hypercoagulopathy and cardiovascular disorders occurring as COVID-19 complications.","Gedefaw, Lealem; Ullah, Sami; Leung, Polly H M; Cai, Yin; Yip, Shea-Ping; Huang, Chien-Ling",,162,26

Telemedicine enables provision of care when in-person visits are not possible. Sheba Medical Center made a rapid transition of outpatient clinics to video consultations (VC) during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. OBJECTIVE: Results of a survey of patient and clinician user experience with VC are reported. METHODS: Satisfaction surveys were sent by text messages to patients, clinicians who practice VC (users) and clinicians who do not practice VC (non-users). Questions referred to general satisfaction, ease of use, technical issues and medical and communication quality. Questions and scales were based on surveys used regularly in outpatient clinics of Sheba Medical Center. RESULTS: More than 1200 clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, social workers, dietitians, speech therapists, genetic consultants and others) provided VC during the study period. Five hundred and forty patients, 162 clinicians who were users and 50 clinicians who were non-users completed the survey. High level of satisfaction was reported by 89.8% of patients and 37.7% of clinician users. Technical problems were experienced by 21% of patients and 80% of clinician users. Almost 70% of patients but only 23.5% of clinicians found the platform very simple to use. Over 90% of patients were very satisfied with clinician's courtesy, expressed a high sense of trust, thought that clinician's explanations and recommendations were clear and estimated that the clinician understood their problems and 86.5% of them would recommend VC to family and friends. Eighty-seven percent of clinician users recognize the benefit of VC for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic but only 68% supported continuation of the service after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study reports high levels of patient satisfaction from outpatient clinics VC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower levels of clinician satisfaction can mostly be attributed to technical and administrative challenges related to the newly implemented telemedicine platform. Our findings support the continued future use of VC as a means of providing patient-centered care. Future steps need to be taken to continuously improve the clinical and administrative application of telemedicine services.","Barkai, Galia; Gadot, Moran; Amir, Hadar; Menashe, Michal; Shvimer-Rothschild, Lilach; Zimlichman, Eyal",Int. j. qual. health care,162,24

In this work, the three-dimensional arrangements of amino acid side chains in known drug binding sites (substructures) were used to search for similarly arranged sites in SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank for the potential repositioning of approved compounds. We were able to identify 22 target sites for the repositioning of 16 approved drug compounds as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Using the same approach, we were also able to investigate the potentially promiscuous binding of the 16 compounds to off-target sites that could be implicated in toxicity and side effects that had not been provided by any previous studies. The investigations of binding properties in disease-related proteins derived from the comparison of amino acid substructure arrangements allows for effective mechanism driven decision making to rank and select only the compounds with the highest potential for success and safety to be prioritized for clinical trials or treatments. The intention of this work is not to explicitly identify candidate compounds but to present how an integrated drug repositioning and potential toxicity pipeline using side chain similarity searching algorithms are of great utility in epidemic scenarios involving novel pathogens. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrate that the pipeline can identify candidate compounds quickly and sustainably in combination with associated risk factors derived from the analysis of potential off-target site binding by the compounds to be repurposed.","Syatila Ab Ghani, Nur; Emrizal, Reeki; Makmur, Haslina; Firdaus-Raih, Mohd",,162,29

This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23®. These data indicate that short-to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","May, Meghan; Slitzky, Matthew; Rostama, Bahman; Barlow, Deborah; Houseknecht, Karen L.","Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health",162,7

With this purpose, several aspects have been deepened: i) viruses in soil ecosystems; ii) direct and indirect impact on the soil before and after the pandemic, and iii) methods for quantification of viruses and SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in soil. Viruses are present in soil (i.e. up to 417 × 107 viruses per g TS-1 in wetlands) and can affect the behavior and ecology of other life forms (e.g. bacteria), which are remarkably important for maintaining environmental equilibrium. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil (i.e. up to 550 copies·g-1). Considering that the SARS-CoV-2 is very recent, poor knowledge is available in the literature on persistence in the soil and reference has been made to coronaviruses and other families of viruses. For instance, the survival of enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) can reach 90 days in soils with 10% of moisture content at ambient. In such a context, the possible spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in the soil was evaluated by analyzing the possible contamination routes.","Anand, Uttpal; Bianco, Francesco; Suresh, S; Tripathi, Vijay; Núñez-Delgado, Avelino; Race, Marco",Environ Res,162,1

METHODS: Seventy-four COVID-19 patients admitted between March 16th and June 3rd 2020 to the Asklepios Lung Clinic Munich-Gauting, Germany, were included in the study. Patients were categorized in a non-severe group including patients hospitalized on general wards only and in a severe group including patients requiring intensive care treatment. Fully automated quantification of CT scans was performed via IMBIO CT Lung Texture analysis&#8482; software. Predictive biomarkers were assessed with receiver-operator-curve and likelihood analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (44% female) presented with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 patients (32% female) with severe disease. Five fatalities were reported in the severe group. Accurate automated CT analysis was possible with 61 CTs (82%). Disease severity was linked to lower residual normal lung (72.5% vs 87%, p = 0.003), increased ground glass opacities (GGO) (8% vs 5%, p = 0.031) and increased reticular pattern (8% vs 2%, p = 0.025). Disease severity was associated with advanced age (76 vs 59 years, p = 0.001) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 92.2 vs 36.3 mg/L, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 485 vs 268 IU/L, p < 0.001) and oxygen supplementation (p < 0.001) upon admission. Predictive risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were oxygen supplementation, LDH >313 IU/L, CRP >71 mg/L, <70% normal lung texture, >12.5% GGO and >4.5% reticular pattern. CONCLUSION: Automated low dose CT analysis upon admission might be a useful tool to predict COVID-19 severity in patients.","Stoleriu, Mircea Gabriel; Gerckens, Michael; Obereisenbuchner, Florian; Zaimova, Iva; Hetrodt, Justin; Mavi, Sarah-Christin; Schmidt, Felicitas; Schoenlebe, Anna Auguste; Heinig-Menhard, Katharina; Koch, Ina; Jörres, Rudolf A; Spiro, Judith; Nowak, Lorenz; Hatz, Rudolf; Behr, Jürgen; Gesierich, Wolfgang; Heiß-Neumann, Marion; Dinkel, Julien",Clin Imaging,162,1

We generated micro particle PLPs loaded with TLR4 (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, GLA) or TLR9 (CpG) agonists, and formulated them with and without a mucosal delivery enhancing carbomer-based nanoemulsion adjuvant (ADJ). These adjuvants delivered intranasally to mice elicited high numbers of influenza nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8+ and CD4+ effector and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in lungs and airways. PLPs delivering TLR4 versus TLR9 agonists drove phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of effector and memory T cells. While PLPs loaded with CpG or GLA provided immunity, combining the adjuvanticity of PLP-GLA and ADJ markedly enhanced the development of airway and lung TRMs and CD4 and CD8 T cell-dependent immunity to influenza virus. Further, balanced CD8 (Tc1/Tc17) and CD4 (Th1/Th17) recall responses were linked to effective influenza virus control.

Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), which is used effectively for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections, was applied for COVID-19 treatment given similarities in the molecular structures of these viruses. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral treatment in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. After registration with INPLASY, a search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Library, WanFang Data, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and other databases for all relevant literature on lopinavir/ritonavir treatment of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. The Cochrane Collaboration's bias risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to evaluate the quality of the literature, and RevMan 5.3 software was used to evaluate the relevant outcome indicators of the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. A total of 18 eligible studies (including randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies) were retrieved and included with a total of 2273 patients. The lopinavir/ritonavir group exhibited an increased nucleic acid conversion rate (P=0.004), higher virus clearance rate (P<0.0001), lower mortality rate (P=0.002), and reduced incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P=0.02) compared with the control group. No significant benefit in the improvement rate of chest CT (P=0.08) or incidence of adverse events (P=0.45) was noted. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had a lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (P=0.02). According to the clinical prognostic results, the incidence of adverse events between the two groups was not statistically significant (P<0.0001). The efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with SARS, MERS and COVID-19 was significantly better than that of the control. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events did not significantly increase. Lopinavir/ritonavir is effective in the treatment of COVID-19, and this combination should be further assessed in RCT studies. In addition, when we analyzed the differences in age and sex, we found that the differences were statistically significant in the safety and effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, and both of these factors played a significant role in the trial.","Wu, Liusheng; Zheng, Yuzhen; Liu, Jixian; Luo, Ruixing; Wu, Dingwang; Xu, Pengcheng; Wu, Da; Li, Xiaoqiang",Aging (Albany NY),162,10

Das mortes por intoxicação natural acompanhadas na propriedade, observou-se 22 casos de quadro agudo de diátese hemorrágica e seis de quadro crônico de carcinomas do trato digestório superior. Em cinco bovinos jovens com diátese hemorrágica, além de hemorragias disseminadas e infartos, observou-se acentuado edema laríngeo, que cursava, clinicamente, com dispneia e estertores respiratórios característicos. Os carcinomas do trato digestório superior, apesar de menos frequentes, causaram perdas expressivas, devido à mortalidade anual de reprodutoras. Notou-se que a introdução de bovinos jovens em áreas recentemente roçadas pode resultar no consumo de grandes quantidades de samambaia e na ocorrência de surtos da enfermidade aguda. O controle das populações de samambaia pelo pastejo por ovinos não foi eficiente, devido ao baixo consumo observado com a lotação de quatro ovinos por hectare, embora mortalidade de ovinos por consumo da planta não tenha sido registrada. Após a retirada do potreiro infestado por samambaia, ao final do experimento, oito dos ovinos foram acompanhados, clinicamente, por três anos e não apresentaram nenhuma alteração. A utilização dos herbicidas resultou em uma redução da cobertura de P. arachnoideum. No entanto, essa prática necessita de estudos adicionais, já que algumas áreas não tiveram recuperação satisfatória da pastagem e o seu uso pode causar impactos ambientais e aquisição de resistência de P. arachnoideum aos herbicidas.(AU)","Boabaid, Fabiana M; Oliveira, Luiz G.

Recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of vitamin B3 in a number of pivotal functions which ensure that homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the intriguing nature of its synthesis and the underlying mechanism of action of vitamin B3 have encouraged further studies aimed at deepening our understanding of the close link between the exogenous supply of B3 and how it activates dependent enzymes. This crucial role can be attributed to the gut microflora and its ability to shape human behavior and development by mediating the bioavailability of metabolites. Recent studies have indicated a possible interconnection between the novel coronavirus and commensal bacteria. As such, we have attempted to explain how the gastrointestinal deficiencies displayed by SARS-CoV-2-infected patients arise. It seems that the stimulation of a proinflammatory cascade and the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species culminates in the subsequent loss of host eubiosis. Studies of the relationhip between ROS, SARS-CoV-2, and gut flora are sparse in the current literature. As an integrated component, oxidative stress (OS) has been found to negatively influence host eubiosis, in vitro fertilization outcomes, and oocyte quality, but to act as a sentinel against infections. In conclusion, research suggests that in the future, a healthy diet may be considered a reliable tool for maintaining and optimizing our key internal parameters.","Doroftei, Bogdan; Ilie, Ovidiu-Dumitru; Cojocariu, Roxana-Oana; Ciobica, Alin; Maftei, Radu; Grab, Delia; Anton, Emil; McKenna, Jack; Dhunna, Nitasha; Simionescu, Gabriela",Molecules (Basel),162,26

Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have been variably associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to optimize the human intestinal organoids and hypothesize that these optimized intestinal organoids can recapitulate enteric infections of enterovirus and coronavirus. We demonstrate that the optimized human intestinal organoids enable better simulation of the native human intestinal epithelium, and that they are significantly more susceptible to EV-A71 than CVA16. Higher replication of EV-A71 than CVA16 in the intestinal organoids triggers a more vigorous cellular response. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit distinct dynamics of virus-host interaction; more robust propagation of SARS-CoV triggers minimal cellular response, whereas, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits lower replication capacity but elicits a moderate cellular response. Taken together, the disparate profile of the virus-host interaction of enteroviruses and coronaviruses in human intestinal organoids may unravel the cellular basis of the distinct pathogenicity of these viral pathogens.","Zhao, Xiaoyu; Li, Cun; Liu, Xiaojuan; Chiu, Man Chun; Wang, Dong; Wei, Yuxuan; Chu, Hin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Hau-Yee Chan, Ivy; Kak-Yuen Wong, Kenneth; Fuk-Woo Chan, Jasper; Kai-Wang To, Kelvin; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Zhou, Jie",Stem Cell Reports,162,1

Our goal was to report our initial experience with combined transcatheter Inovare bioprosthesis implants for severe valve dysfunction. METHODS: Among 300 transcatheter procedures, a total of 6 patients had concurrent simultaneous transcatheter bioprosthesis implants for severe mitral bioprosthesis failure (valve-in-valve), with a second valve procedure that included native aortic (n = 2) or degenerated bioprostheses in the aortic position (n = 4). During the procedures, all patients were treated with a balloon-expandable Inovare transcatheter valve, using the transapical approach. RESULTS: Patients were highly symptomatic [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV: 100%], with a mean age of 62 ± 5 years, yielding a mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk II (EuroSCORE II) of 24.0 ± 10.1%. There was a mean of 1.6 ± 0.4 prior valve operations/patient, with a median time from prior mitral bioprosthesis surgery of 13.0 (9.2-20.0) years. Device success was 100% according to the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium and the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. During the hospital stay, only 1 patient required dialysis, and the median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 5.0 (3.2-6.7) days and 16.0 (12.2-21.2) days, respectively. No deaths occurred at 30 days; at a median follow-up of 287 (194-437) days, 1 patient died of a non-cardiac cause and the rest of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, with normofunctioning bioprostheses. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter double valve interventions using the Inovare bioprosthesis in this initial series were shown to be a reasonable alternative to redo surgical operations. The short- and mid-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes demonstrate promising results, although future studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are warranted.","Bastos Filho, João Bosco Breckenfeld; Sampaio, Roney Orismar; Cividanes, Felipe Reale; Rosa, Vitor Emer Egypto; da Costa, Leonardo Paim Nicolau; Vieira, Marcelo Luiz Campos; Jatene, Fabio Biscegli; Tarasoutchi, Flavio; Palma, José Honório; Ribeiro, Henrique Barbosa",Interact. cardiovasc. thorac. surg,162,16

This pattern is well-known, but unexplained, and remains an outstanding problem in our understanding of porphyry ore deposit formation. We approach this problem by investigating the oxidation state of magmatic sulfur, which controls the behavior of ore-forming metals during magma differentiation and magmatic-hydrothermal transition. We use sulfur in apatite to reconstruct the sulfur oxidation state in the Gangdese batholith, southern Tibet. We find that magma sulfate content increased abruptly after India-Eurasia collision. Apatite sulfur content and the calculated magma S6+/&#931;S ratio correlate with whole-rock dysprosium/ytterbium ratio, suggesting that residual garnet, favored in thickened crust, exerts a first-order control on sulfur oxidation in magmatic orogens. Our findings link sulfur oxidation to internal petrogenic processes and imply an intrinsic relationship of magma oxidation with synmagmatic crustal thickening.","Tang, Ming; Lee, Cin-Ty A; Ji, Wei-Qiang; Wang, Rui; Costin, Gelu",Sci Adv,162,21

We find that the irradiated samples were not fully amorphized even for the lowest oblique incidence of 30°. Sputtering at off-normal incidences induces depth controllable surface amorphization in Si(111). Annealing at temperature of 1,073 K is characterized by formation of depth-varying buried amorphous layer due to defect recrystallization and damage recovery. Some remnant tensile stress has been observed for recrystallized samples even for lowest oblique incidence. The correlation of amorphization and stress due to sputtering induced by oblique incidence has been discussed systematically. The possible mechanism of recrystallization is discussed in terms of vacancies produced in sputtering dominated regime and their migration during annealing treatment. Our results reveal that with appropriate selection of oblique ion beam sputtering parameters, depth controllable surface amorphization and recrystallization may be fine-tuned to achieve co-existing amorphous and crystalline phases, playing a crucial role in fabrication of substrates for IC industry.","Gupta, Divya; Umapathy, G R; Singhal, Rahul; Ojha, Sunil; Aggarwal, Sanjeev",Sci Rep,162,1

The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) once again retained its supermajority by capturing 83 out of the 93 seats, controlling 89.2 percent of parliamentary seats. In spite of a changing social, political and economic landscape, Singapore is still very much identified as an illiberal democracy that has somehow thrived over the years. As the general elections was held during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were expectations that Singaporeans would overwhelmingly vote for the PAP government as the country was facing a serious crisis of a generation. The 'flight-to-safety' mode that some had expected in an election during a crisis, however, did not materialise. In the end, Singaporean voters decided to send a strong warning to the PAP that not all was well, with the opposition achieving its strongest gains since 1965, capturing 10 seats and an additional two Non-constituency Member of Parliament seats. The PAP's total votes dropped from 69.9 percent in 2015 to 61.2 percent in 2020. The rise of a credible opposition has also further strengthened Singaporeans' resolve to ensure that a fair-playing field exists in the political realm. With the highest voter turnout since independence, many have made it known that their voices mattered. The PAP also saw some cracks in its ranks, with some former cadre members and supporters being critical of the new fourth-generation team. Against this backdrop, this book hopes to address the following questions. What were the key issues in the general elections? Who were the main contenders in the polls? What accounted for the PAP's continued hold on power in Singapore? Why did the opposition perform much better than in the previous general elections? What are the main implications of the 2020 general elections results for the PAP, opposition and the broader society at large? How far have electoral issues shifted from 'bread and butter' concerns to much broader topics of social injustices and diversity of voices in parliament? What were some of the crucial talking points during this election?

RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).","Li, Hongjin; Patil, Crystal L; Molokie, Robert E; Njoku, Franklin; Steffen, Alana D; Doorenbos, Ardith Z; Schlaeger, Judith M",Acupunct Med,162,30

SETTING: Aerosol and droplet quantification laboratory. DESIGN: Laboratory study. METHODS: In an experimental set-up, phacoemulsification was performed on enucleated goat eyes and cadaveric human corneoscleral rims mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were performed using titanium straight tips (2.2 mm and 2.8 mm in diameter). The main wound incisions were titrated equal to and larger than the sleeve size. High-speed shadowgraphy technique was used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. The visualization and quantification of size of the aerosols and droplets along with calculation of their spread were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: In longitudinal phacoemulsification using a peristaltic pump device with a straight tip, no aerosol generation was seen in a closed chamber. In larger wounds, there was a slow leak at the main wound. The atomization of balanced salt solution was observed only when the phacoemulsification tip was completely exposed next to the ocular surface. Under this condition, the nominal size of the droplet was approximately 50 µm, and the maximum calculated spread was 1.3 m. CONCLUSIONS: There was no visible aerosol generation during microincision or standard phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification is safe to perform in the COVID-19 era by taking adequate precautions against other modes of transmission.","Shetty, Naren; Kaweri, Luci; Khamar, Pooja; Balakrishnan, Nikhil; Rasheed, Abdur; Kabi, Prasenjit; Basu, Saptarshi; Shetty, Rohit; Nuijts, Rudy M M A; Sinha Roy, Abhijit",J Cataract Refract Surg,162,6

We examined review articles published in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase between 2000 and 2020. Data extracted from the included reviews were analyzed using a narrative synthesis. The search yielded 1524 unique citations, of which 31 were included. Included studies were focused on health care workers and the risk of infection to COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, mental health outcomes, and health care workers' willingness to respond during a public health event. Reviews identified a variety of individual, social, and organizational factors associated with these work and health outcomes as well as risk mitigation strategies that addressed study outcomes. Only a few reviews examined intervention strategies in the workplace such as physical distancing and quarantine, and none included long-term outcomes of exposure or work during an epidemic/pandemic. Findings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.","Fan, Jonathan; Senthanar, Sonja; Macpherson, Robert A; Sharpe, Kimberly; Peters, Cheryl E; Koehoorn, Mieke; McLeod, Christopher B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),162,5

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether CRS is associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. METHODS: Altogether, 219,959 adult patients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral) were identified in this nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Data on SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19 worsened outcomes (ie, the need for oxygen therapy, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation, and death) were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea. RESULTS: In this matched cohort, 380 of 12,217 patients with CRS (3.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with 310 patients without CRS (2.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42). Moreover, 60 of 286 COVID-19 patients with CRS (21.0%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes, compared with 38 without CRS (13.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.71). Subgroup analysis identified that CRS patients with an absence of nasal polyps, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, or nonatopic type had a greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRS, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, the absence of nasal polyps, or nonatopic type was associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in the Korean nationwide cohort. Clinicians should be cautious in determining prognosis and care for patients with CRS amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Seung Won; Kim, So Young; Moon, Sung Yong; Yang, Jee Myung; Ha, Eun Kyo; Jee, Hye Mi; Shin, Jae Il; Cho, Seong Ho; Yon, Dong Keon; Suh, Dong In",J.

Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (&#8805; 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS: At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3 ± 1.4 and - 4.8 ± 2.1; P < 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients. The percentage of patients with a neuropathic component decreased similarly in young and elderly patients (from 38 to 0% and from 19 to 3%; P < 0.01). Quality of life and sleep improved. The performances in global cognition and sustained attention tasks remained stable or improved across all age group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that tapentadol extended release maintains efficacy and good tolerability in CLBP patients with advancing age.","Freo, Ulderico; Furnari, Maurizio; Ambrosio, Francesco; Navalesi, Paolo",Aging clin. exp. res,162,28

In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists' intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together.","Zhu, Hui; Deng, Fumin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),162,20

Despite growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in virology as well as many molecular studies, except remdesivir, no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug has been officially approved. METHODS: In the present study molecular docking technique was applied to test binding affinity of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin-two commercially available fluoroquinolones, to SARS-CoV-2 S-, E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO). Chloroquine and dexamethasone were used as reference positive controls. RESULTS: When analyzing the molecular docking data it was noticed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin possess lower binding energy with S protein as compared to the references. In the case of TMPRSS2 protein and PLPRO protease the best docked ligand was levofloxacin and in the case of E proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase the best docked ligands were levofloxacin and dexamethasone. Moreover, a molecular dynamics study also reveals that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin form a stable complex with E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO). CONCLUSIONS: The revealed data indicate that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin could interact and potentially inhibit crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","Marciniec, Krzysztof; Beberok, Artur; Boryczka, Stanislaw; Wrzesniok, Dorota",Pharmacol. rep,162,20

He had a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 and a 3-week history of upper respiratory tract infection. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed an occlusion of the 2 common femoral arteries. CT angiography detected an intracardiac thrombus in the left ventricle.

Severe Covid-19 fulfills the diagnostic criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, it is unclear whether there is any relationship between ventilatory management and AKI development in Covid-19 ICU patients. PURPOSE: To describe the clinical course and outcomes of Covid-19 ICU patients, focusing on ventilatory management and factors associated with AKI development. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective observational study, which assessed AKI incidence in Covid-19 ICU patients divided by positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) tertiles, with median levels of 9.6 (low), 12.0 (medium), and 14.7 cmH2O (high-PEEP). RESULTS: Overall mortality was 51.5%. AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) occurred in 38% of 101 patients. Among the AKI patients, 19 (53%) required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). In AKI patients, mortality was significantly higher versus non-AKI (81% vs. 33%, p < 0.0001). The incidence of AKI in low-, medium-, or high-PEEP patients were 16%, 38%, and 59%, respectively (p = 0.002). In a multivariate analysis, high-PEEP patients showed a higher risk of developing AKI than low-PEEP patients (OR = 4.96 [1.1-21.9] 95% CI p < 0.05). ICU mortality rate was higher in high-PEEP patients, compared to medium-PEEP or low-PEEP patients (69% vs. 44% and 42%, respectively; p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: The use of high PEEP in Covid-19 ICU patients is associated with a fivefold higher risk of AKI, leading to higher mortality. The cause and effect relationship needs further analysis.","Ottolina, Davide; Zazzeron, Luca; Trevisi, Letizia; Agarossi, Andrea; Colombo, Riccardo; Fossali, Tommaso; Passeri, Mattia; Borghi, Beatrice; Ballone, Elisabetta; Rech, Roberto; Castelli, Antonio; Catena, Emanuele; Nebuloni, Manuela; Gallieni, Maurizio",J. nephrol,162,16

METHODS: All Spanish centers with a catheterization laboratory were invited to participate. Data were introduced online and analyzed by an external company together with the Steering Committee of the ACI-SEC. RESULTS: A total of 119 centers participated (83 public, 36 private). In all, there were 165124 diagnostic studies (4.7% more than in 2018). The use of pressure wire and intravascular ultrasound increased by 20% and that of optical coherence tomography by 8.4%. The number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) rose by 4.5% (75 819 procedures). Of these, 22529 were performed in the acute myocardial infarction setting, with 91.8% being primary PCI (6.3% increase). The mean number of primary PCIs per million inhabitants increased to 439. Among PCIs, access was radial in 88.3%. There were 4281 transcatheter aortic valve implantations (21.0% increase), with an average of 90.9 per million inhabitants.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted from October 19 to 30, 2020. The estimates were calculated based on clustering, stratification, and non-response. A three-stage sampling was adopted, considering stratum, census tracts, and domicile. After systematic analysis, thirty sectors were selected in each stratum, totaling 150 sectors. Each sector contained a fixed number of 34 households, thus totaling 5,100 households. One individual within each household (resident for at least six months and aged one year or more) was selected by a simple random sampling. We questioned participants about their vaccination intention. Univariate association between independent variables and the outcome were verified using descriptive analysis (weighted frequencies) and Pearson's chi-square test (p &lt; 0.05). Robust multivariate analysis was performed using a three-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found 17.5% (95%CI 16.1-19.1%) of the 4,630 individuals interviewed to report hesitancy to be vaccinated against covid-19. After final model adjustment, vaccination hesitancy was statistically higher among residents of the cities of Imperatriz (24.0%;RP = 1.48;IC95% 1.09-2.02) and municipalities of the Grande Ilha de São Luís (20.7%;RP = 1.34;95%CI 1.02-1.76), female individuals (19.8%;RP = 1.44;95%CI 1.20-1.75), older adults (22.8%;RP = 1.79;IC95% 1.30-2.46), evangelicals (24.1%;RP = 1.49;95%CI 1.24-1.79), and those without reported symptoms (18.6%;RP = 1.24;95%CI 1.02-1.51). We found no statistical differences for other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as variables related to the labor market, behaviors, and health conditions of the interviewees. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Maranhão and its association with individual, contextual, and clinical factors enable us to identify the groups and contexts of greatest resistance, requiring special attention from public strategies to ensure wide vaccination.","Oliveira, Blca Campos M.

An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already. First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it. Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research. Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks. On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product. This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.","Monrad, Joshua Teperowski",J. med. ethics,162,24

However, its large variability hampers its usefulness in modelling transport processes as well as its accuracy in representing soil-radionuclide interactions. For the specific case of radiocaesium, the analyses of a Cs Kd soil dataset (769 entries) showed that values varied over a five order of magnitude range, and the resulting Cs Kd best estimate (calculated as a geometric mean = 2.5 × 103 L kg-1) lacked reliability and representativity. Grouping data and creation of partial datasets based on the experimental approach (short-term (< ~1 yr) vs. long-term experiments (> ~1 yr)) and soil factors affecting Cs interaction (i.e., the ratio of the radiocaesium interception potential (RIP) to the potassium content in soil solution (Kss); organic matter content (OM) and soil texture) succeeded in reducing variability a few orders of magnitude, with Cs Kd best estimates also differing by one-two orders of magnitude depending on the type of soil and experimental approach. The statistical comparison of the Cs Kd best estimates and related cumulative distribution functions of the partial datasets revealed a relevant effect of the sorption dynamics on Cs Kd values (with long-term values systematically higher than short-term ones), and that the RIP/Kss ratio was an excellent predictor of Cs Kd for short-term scenarios, whereas the RIP parameter could be predicted on the basis of texture information. The OM threshold to distinguish between OM threshold to distinguish between Mineral and Organic soils subclasses, regarding Cs interaction was determined to be 50% and 90% OM for short- and long-term scenarios, respectively. It was then recommended to select the Cs Kd input data depending on the soils and scenarios to be assessed (e.g., short- vs. long-term; OM %) to improve the reliability and decrease the uncertainty of the radioecological models.","Ramírez-Guinart, Oriol; Kaplan, Daniel; Rigol, Anna; Vidal, Miquel",J Environ Radioact,162,1

Based on comprehensive institutional records for this entire student population across multiple years, we build machine learning models to predict student dropout after one academic year of study, and compare the overall performance and fairness of model predictions with or without four protected attributes (gender, URM, first-generation student, and high financial need). We find that including protected attributes does not impact the overall prediction performance and it only marginally improves algorithmic fairness of predictions. While these findings suggest that including protected attributes is preferred, our analysis also offers guidance on how to evaluate the impact in a local context, where institutional stakeholders seek to leverage predictive analytics to support student success.","Yu, Renzhe; Lee, Hansol; Kizilcec, Ren'e F.",,162,16

Non-invasive mechanical ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula can reduce the rate of endotracheal intubation in adult respiratory distress syndrome, although failure rate is high. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of endotracheal intubation, the effectiveness of treatment, complications and mortality in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in a first-level hospital in Madrid. Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit with tachypnea, use of accessory musculature or SpO2 <92% despite FiO2> 0.5 were included. Intubation rate, medical complications, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Statistical analysis through association studies, logistic and Cox regression models and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included. 37.1% required endotracheal intubation, 58.6% suffered medical complications and 24.3% died. Prone positioning was independently associated with lower need for endotracheal intubation (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.005 to 0.54, p = 0.001). The adjusted HR for death at 28 days in the group of patients requiring endotracheal intubation was 5.4 (95% CI 1.51 to 19.5; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of endotracheal intubation in patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 was 37.1%. Complications and mortality were lower in patients in whom endotracheal intubation could be avoided.

Methods: A single-site, prospective cohort study was conducted among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who received rivaroxaban therapy from July 2019 to December 2019. Patients in the pharmacist-led education and follow-up service (PEFS) group were managed remotely by a pharmacist. In contrast, those in the usual care (UC) group were managed by other providers. Data of routine blood tests, coagulation function tests, which also included cardiac function parameters were collected. The number and type of provider encounters, interventions related to rivaroxaban therapy, the occurrence of thromboembolism or bleeding, and the time of the first outpatient visit after discharge were recorded. Results: A total of 600 patients were recruited, and results of 381 patients were analyzed in the end, of which 179 patients were from the PEFS group and 202 were from the UC group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the occurrence ratio of systemic thrombosis, heart failure (LVEF &lt; 40%), and left atrial dilation, which was defined as enlargement of left atrial diameter (LAD) &gt; 40 mm. The cumulative incidences of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal tract and skin ecchymosis, were significantly higher in the UC group (12.4% vs. 6.1%, P=0.038; 4.5% vs. 0.6%, P=0.018). There was no significant difference after pharmacist intervention in terms of thrombosis occurrence ratio between the two groups (P = 0.338, HR: 0.722, 95% CI: 0.372-1.405).

The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulphate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade, B.1.I82T, defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. These M mutations are associated with younger patient age (4.6 to 6.3 years). The rapid emergence of this B.1.I82T clade, recently named Pangolin B.1.575 lineage, suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.","Shen, Lishuang; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Triche, Timothy J; Judkins, Alexander R; Biegel, Jaclyn A; Gai, Xiaowu",Emerg Microbes Infect,162,20

LKT binding induces activation, and subsequent cytolysis, of these cells. It is well known that active viral infection greatly increases the susceptibility of cattle to pasteurellosis. To better understand the mechanism by which this occurs, we investigated the effects of experimental in vivo infection of cattle with bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) on the ex vivo interaction of bovine leukocytes with the M. haemolytica LKT. In this study, we demonstrated that active BHV-1 infection increased the expression of the β(2)-integrin CD11a/CD18 (as defined by the mAb BAT75) on bovine peripheral blood neutrophils, enhanced the binding of LKT to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocytes and peripheral blood neutrophils, and increased the killing of BAL leukocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes by LKT. In addition, BHV-1 greatly increased the number of BAL, resulting in many more LKT-responsive cells being present in the lungs. These findings might explain in part the increased susceptibility of BHV-1 infected cattle to pneumonic pasteurellosis.","Leite, F.; Sylte, M.J.; O’Brien, S.; Schultz, R.; Peek, S.; van Reeth, K.; Czuprynski, C.J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,162,19

Intense research produced many controversial results, but also helped some clues to be traced. Thus, it became rather obvious that the disease is caused by environmental factors (though it may be, to some extent, genetically controlled). Among live agents, slow viruses are the only (and theoretically very attractive) possible cause of both BN and urothelial tumours, which occur frequently in BN endemic areas. Apart from occasional visualization of virus-like particles, other evidence supporting this hypothesis has been lacking. The role of biological products, particularly fungal toxins, needs to be further defined. An excess of any heavy metal or radioactive substance as a cause of BN is very unlikely indeed; however, a deficiency of a bio-essential element could not be ruled out. Many epidemiological data indicate that water might be a transmitter of the agent(s). A wide range of ions and minerals have been incriminated, but up to now most of the studies have provided negative or inconclusive results.

To characterize the potential risk associated with different Ad5 vector delivery modes, we used immunocompetent and immunodeficient Rag2 (−/−) animals to establish mouse and rat models that could be monitored with bioluminescent imaging following intramuscular or intravascular infection with an engineered replication-incompetent Ad5 virus carrying the firefly luciferase gene (Ad5-Fluc). The Ad5 vector was less well-tolerated by Rag2 (−/−) animals than by wildtype ones, with delayed residence time, wider virus dissemination, less weight gain, and relatively severe pathological changes. In intravascularly Ad5-Fluc-infected Rag2 (−/−) mice, systemic virus dissemination extended from the abdomen to the limbs and head on day 9 post-infection. Additionally, significant increases in plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ, which may be important factors in the heightened immunopathology in the liver and brain, were detected in the Rag2 (−/−) mice 30 days after intravascular delivery. The Ad5 vector was better tolerated after intramuscular delivery than after intravascular delivery.

To better understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates, in this study, the complete spike (S) and ORF3 genes of 17 PEDV variants in Zhejiang, China during 2014 to 2017, were characterized and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene and ORF3 gene of these 17 novel PEDV strains and PEDV reference strains indicated that all the PEDV strains fell into two groups designated G1 and G2. Notably, the strains identified in 2014–2015 were in G2, while the other five strains identified from 2016 to 2017 were in G1. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that recently prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains shared higher identities with United States strains than with South Korean strains. Compared with classical vaccine strains, a series of deletions and frequently occurring mutations were observed in the receptor binding domains of our PEDV strains. Besides, we successfully isolated and reported the genetic characterization two novel PEDV strains, PEDV-LA1 and PEDV-LY4-98, found on the Chinese mainland, which had significant variations in the S gene. Meanwhile, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed, the PEDV-LY4-98 strain, which has multiple mutations in the signal peptide-encoding fragment of the S gene showed delayed cytopathic effects and smaller plaque size compared with strain PEDV-LA1, which lacks these mutations. Three unique amino acid substitutions (L7, G8, and V9) were identified in the SP-encoding fragment of the S1 N-terminal domain of the PEDV-LY4-98 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the previous PEDV strains. The animal experiment revealed that these two novel strains were high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Whether these amino acids substitutions and the N-glycosylation site substitutions influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of PEDV remains to be investigated. Meanwhile, amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes may have conferred the capacity for immune evasion in these PEDV field strains. This study improves our understanding of ongoing PEDV outbreaks in China, and it will guide further efforts to develop effective measures to control this virus.","Sun, Jing; Li, Qunjing; Shao, Chunyan; Ma, Yuanmei; He, Haijian; Jiang, Sheng; Zhou, Yingshan; Wu, Yuan; Ba, Shaobo; Shi, Lin; Fang, Weihuan; Wang, Xiaodu; Song, Houhui",Vet Microbiol,162,20

However, the contribution between peripheral and CNS activation remains unclear. During gliatropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis, accumulation of protective antibody secreting cells is preceded by infiltration of B cells with a naïve and early differentiation phenotype (Phares et al., 2014). Investigation of the temporal dynamics of B cell activation in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and the CNS revealed that peak CNS infiltration of early activated, unswitched IgD(+) and IgM(+) B cells coincided with polyclonal activation in CLN. By contrast, isotype-switched IgG(+) B cells did not accumulate until peripheral germinal center formation. In the CNS, unswitched B cells were confined to the perivascular space and meninges, with only rare B cell clusters, while isotype-switched B cells localized to parenchymal areas. Although ectopic follicle formation was not observed, more differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS expressed the germinal center marker GL7, albeit at lower levels than CLN counterparts. During chronic infection, CNS IgD(int) and IgD(−) B cell subsets further displayed sustained markers of proliferation and CD4 T cell help, which were only transiently expressed in the CLN. A contribution of local CD4 T cell help to sustain B cell activation was supported by occasional B cells adjacent to T cells. The results suggest that accumulation of differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS is largely dictated by peripheral activation, but that local events contribute to their sustained activation independent of ectopic follicle formation.","DiSano, Krista D.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","Brain, Behavior, and Immunity",162,32

The main outcome was death as a binary variable (yes/no). It also investigated the main factors related to mortality and survival of the disease. Time since the beginning of symptoms until death/end of the survey (14 April 2020) was the time variable of this study. Mortality was analysed by robust Poisson regression, and survival by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression. From the 2070 people that tested positive to COVID-19, 131 (6.3%) died and 1939 (93.7%) survived, the overall survival probability was 87.7% from the 24th day of infection. Mortality was enhanced by the variables: elderly (HR 3.6; 95% CI 2.3–5.8; P < 0.001), neurological diseases (HR 3.9; 95% CI 1.9–7.8; P < 0.001), pneumopathies (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.4–4.7; P < 0.001) and cardiovascular diseases (HR 8.9; 95% CI 5.4–14.5; P < 0.001).

We investigated this “Moses illusion” in a multiple-choice format and tested the influence of monetary incentives on the illusion’s strength. Thereby, we addressed the role of a cooperative communication context for the illusion’s emergence, as well as the role of participants’ motivation. In four experiments (total N = 914), we found that the Moses illusion persists in a multiple-choice format. As the multiple-choice format realizes a cooperative context in which the correct answer is always available, we exclude a cooperative context explanation for the illusion. Monetary incentives reduced the strength of the illusion. However, the reduction was numerically and statistically small. We thereby show that the illusion is not due to violations of cooperative communications, and not due to a lack of motivation. The multiple-choice approach will facilitate further research on the Moses illusion and the data provide additional evidence for the Moses illusion’s empirical robustness and constrain its theoretical explanations.","Speckmann, Felix; Unkelbach, Christian",Mem Cognit,162,1

Our primary objective was to determine whether lung ultrasound (LUS) B-lines, when excluding patients with alternative etiologies for B-lines, are more sensitive for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a single, academic emergency department in the United States between March 20 and April 6, 2020, and received LUS, CXR, and viral testing for COVID-19 as part of their diagnostic evaluation. The primary objective was to estimate the test characteristics of both LUS B-lines and CXR for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 that have secondary LUS findings of pleural abnormalities and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: We identified 43 patients who underwent both LUS and CXR and were tested for COVID-19. Of these, 27/43 (63%) tested positive. LUS was more sensitive (88.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1–97.0) for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR (51.9%, 95% CI, 34.0–69.3; p = 0.013). LUS and CXR specificity were 56.3% (95% CI, 33.2–76.9) and 75.0% (95% CI, 50.0–90.3), respectively (p = 0.453). Secondary LUS findings of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated 21/27 (77.8%) had pleural abnormalities and 10/27 (37%) had subpleural consolidations. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent LUS and CXR, LUS was found to have a higher sensitivity than CXR for the evaluation of COVID-19. This data could have important implications as an aid in the diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19, particularly where viral testing is not available or restricted. If generalizable, future directions would include defining how to incorporate LUS into clinical management and its role in screening lower-risk populations.","Pare, Joseph R.; Camelo, Ingrid; Mayo, Kelly C.; Leo, Megan M.; Dugas, Julianne N.; Nelson, Kerrie P.; Baker, William E.; Shareef, Faizah; Mitchell, Patricia M.; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M.",West J Emerg Med,162,1

In the most convincing demonstrations, highly predictable nouns exert an influence on processing even before they appear to a reader or listener, as indicated by the brain’s neural response to a prenominal adjective or article when it mismatches the expectations about the upcoming noun. However, recent studies suggest that some well-known demonstrations of prediction may be hard to replicate. This could signal the use of data-contingent analysis, but might also mean that readers and listeners do not always use prediction-relevant information in the way that psycholinguistic theories typically suggest. To shed light on this issue, we performed a close replication of one of the best-cited ERP studies on word anticipation (Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman & Hagoort, 2005; Experiment 1), in which participants listened to Dutch spoken mini-stories. In the original study, the marking of grammatical gender on pre-nominal adjectives (‘groot/grote’) elicited an early positivity when mismatching the gender of an unseen, highly predictable noun, compared to matching gender. The current pre-registered study involved that same manipulation, but used a novel set of materials twice the size of the original set, an increased sample size (N=187), and Bayesian mixed-effects model analyses that better accounted for known sources of variance than the original. In our study, mismatching gender elicited more negative voltage than matching gender at posterior electrodes. However, this N400-like effect was small in size and lacked support from Bayes Factors. In contrast, we successfully replicated the original’s noun effects. While our results yielded some support for prediction, they do not support the Van Berkum et al. effect and highlight the risks associated with commonly employed data-contingent analyses and small sample sizes. Our results also raise the question whether Dutch listeners reliably or consistently use adjectival inflection information to inform their noun predictions.","Nieuwland, Mante S.; Arkhipova, Yana; Rodríguez-Gómez, Pablo",Cortex,162,1

We embed the integral conservation laws that govern the cloud’s motion into the model of an expanding vortex to determine the velocity field inside and outside the cloud. We then apply a Lagrangian particle-tracking model to calculate the trajectories of the mucosalivary droplets suspended within the cloud. Our results show very good agreement with the available experimental data. The vortex is shown to have a significant effect on suspending the droplets present in the cloud, increasing the time they remain airborne and extending their range further than predicted by the existing models. We also study the role that initial conditions have on the maximum streamwise range of the droplets, finding that decreasing the angle of projection can reduce the spread of the droplets by an order of meters.

RESULTS: A total of 193 articles were included. Most publications used in this review were single case reports, small case series, and observational small-sized studies or literature reviews. The meta-analysis of 16 studies with size > 10 patients and with complete data about cardiovascular involvement in children with PMIS showed that PMIS affects mostly previously healthy school-aged children and adolescents presenting with Kawasaki disease-like features and multiple organ failure with a focus on the heart, accounting for most cases of pediatric COVID-19 mortality. They frequently presented cardiogenic shock (53%), ECG alterations (27%), myocardial dysfunction (52%), and coronary artery dilation (15%). Most cases required PICU admission (75%) and inotropic support (57%), with the rare need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4%). Almost all of these children wholly recovered in a few days, although rare deaths have been reported (2%). Out of PMIS cases we identified 10 articles reporting sporadic cases of myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrythmias in previously healthy children. We also found another 10 studies reporting patients with pre-existing heart diseases. Most cases consisted in children with severe COVID-19 infection with full recovery after intensive care support, but cases of death were also identified. The management of different cardiac conditions are provided based on current guidelines and expert panel recommendations. CONCLUSION: There is still scarce data about the role of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 in children. Based on our review, children (previously healthy or with pre-existing heart disease) with acute COVID-19 requiring hospital admission should undergo a cardiac workup and close cardiovascular monitoring to identify and treat timely life-threatening cardiac complications.","Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Moises; Castellano-Martinez, Ana; Cascales-Poyatos, Helena Maria; Perez-Reviriego, Alvaro Antonio",World J Clin Cases,162,5

As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to a feedback loop between policy development, public emotional responses, and local mobility, as well as provide new insights for integrating online and offline data for crisis management.","Feng, Shihui; Kirkley, Alec",Sci Rep,162,28

METHODS We analyzed the change in the influenza-positive proportions (IPP) between 2010-2019 and 2020 in Southern hemisphere countries with ≤40% missing IPP data from FluNet to assess the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relates to influenza activity. Our analysis considered the COVID-19 incidence reported by the World Health Organization and the implementation date of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reported by the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker. RESULTS In each of the seven included countries, in 2020, the average IPP was lower than before (p < 0.01), with the largest difference in IPP being 31.1% (95% confidence interval, 28.4%-33.7%). In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and South Africa, higher IPPs were observed during the epidemiological weeks 4-16 of 2020 compared to those in 2010-2019. The IPPs increased after NPIs were implemented in Argentina and South Africa but started to decline in Bolivia, Chile, Madagascar, and Paraguay before NPI implementation. CONCLUSIONS Influenza burden and activity decreased during 2020 in the Southern hemisphere. The temporal declines in influenza activity varied among countries.","Kim, Jeehyun; Gómez, Raquel Elizabeth Gómez; Hong, Kwan; Yum, Sujin; Jang, Jieun; Chun, Byung Chul",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,162,24

A case series and literature review,15.860095,10.730547,2021-08-10,"INTRODUCTION: effective and safe means of sample collection is a crucial component of testing for Covid-19. Uptake of testing is key to containing and controlling the spread of the virus. Scientists have been working on various strategies that will increase the uptake of testing for COVID-19. One such method involves the use of the drive-through sampling strategy. METHODS: data was collected by both qualitative and quantitative methods. An eligibility form was filled online. While in-depth interviews were conducted for the qualitative aspect of the study. RESULTS: 2,600 visits were recorded at the website, 2300 (88.46%) participants successfully registered for the test. 57.4% were found eligible of which 78.0% presented for the test. This Consisted of 78.0% drive-through and 22.0% walk-in. The average time for transiting through the drive-through site was 19.2 ± 4.6minutes while that of the walk-in was 28 ± 9.2min. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the qualitative component, respondents opined that maximum safety measures were deployed to protect both participants and health workers. Most said that the turnaround time for the sampling process was short. CONCLUSION: the sampling strategy although largely successful, is largely dependent on Internet penetrability, thus this sampling modality will be best utilized as an adjunct to established models of sample collection.","Amoo, Olufemi Samuel; Ohihoin, Aigbe Gregory; Musa, Adesola Zaidat; Idighe, Ifeoma; Ige, Fehintola; Giwa-Tubosun, Temie; Oloko, Sodiq; Abiola, Aisha; Ohihoin, Esther Ngozi; David, Agatha Ngozi; Salako, Abideen; Oladele, David; Gab-Okafor, Chidinma Muoghalu; Bamidele, Tajudeen Akanji; Aina, Oluwagbemiga Olanrewaju; Chukwu, Emelda; Odunukwe, Nkiruka Nnonyelum; Ezechi, Oliver Chukwujekwu; Audu, Rosemary Ajuma; Salako, Babatunde Lawal",Pan Afr Med J,162,24

Here, we address how virus communities might be impacted by the age of the hosts they infect, using total RNA sequencing to reveal the RNA viromes of different age groups of Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres). From oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs we identified 14 viruses likely infecting birds, 11 of which were novel, including members of the Reoviridae, Astroviridae, and Picornaviridae. Strikingly, 12 viruses identified were from juvenile birds sampled in the first year of their life, compared to only two viruses in adult birds. Both viral abundance and alpha diversity were marginally higher in juvenile than adult birds. As well as informing studies of virus ecology, that host age might be associated with viral composition is an important consideration for the future surveillance of novel and emerging viruses.","Wille, Michelle; Shi, Mang; Hurt, Aeron C; Klaassen, Marcel; Holmes, Edward C",Virology,162,32

However, previous studies mostly concentrated on the relation between passive WM (e.g., WM span) components and specific writing tasks (e.g., dictation). Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between different writing skills and the performance on a WM updating task measuring the more active components of WM. From a pool of 160 Italian pupils (grades 3–5), we selected 46 children divided in two groups based on their WM updating performance. The first group consisted of 21 children with low WM updating performance (≤10th percentile), the second group consisted of 25 children with high WM updating performance (≥90th percentile). All children were tested on a battery of writing tasks to assess writing speed, orthographic skills, and competences in expressive writing. MANOVAs and a discriminant analysis were computed to assess group differences and the contribution of the different writing tests in correctly predicting group membership. The results revealed that children with high WM updating performance scored significantly higher than children with low WM updating performance on most of the writing tasks. These results highlight the relevant role of the active components of WM on writing processes. In addition, they suggest that the improvement of writing skills should rely not only on the training of the specific processes implied in this complex task, but also on the training of the cognitive processes that support them, such as active WM processes.","De Vita, Francesca; Schmidt, Susanna; Tinti, Carla; Re, Anna Maria",Front Psychol,162,3

Older adults are considered more vulnerable during public health emergency crises. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological response of older adults during the acute phase of the pandemic in Greece. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger three-day online survey. A total of 103 participants over the age of 60 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions and six psychometric scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (JGLS). RESULTS: A significant proportion of the participants reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (81.6%), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (84.5%), as well as disrupted sleep (37.9%). Women reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19–related fear, more severe depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Participants living alone showed higher levels of loneliness. Intolerance of uncertainty was shown to modulate levels of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: During the quarantine, attention was promptly drawn upon the risks related with older people’s loneliness. Studies identifying factors that may contribute to loneliness during a public health emergency facilitate the implementation of supportive interventions. Preparedness to address and manage older people’s loneliness may limit this deleterious emotional response during the pandemic, as well as at the post-COVID-19 phase.","Parlapani, Eleni; Holeva, Vasiliki; Nikopoulou, Vasiliki A.; Sereslis, Konstantinos; Athanasiadou, Maria; Godosidis, Athanasios; Stephanou, Theano; Diakogiannis, Ioannis",Front Psychiatry,162,20

Our aim is to describe sociodemographic and transmission profile of COVID-19 cases that were transmitted before and after the introduction of the decree in the Bologna Local Health Authority. METHODS: Cases were classified as transmitted before or after the decree according to the date of last contact with a COVID-19 case or, if this date was unavailable, we used the date of onset of symptoms considering the incubation period. Sociodemographic, clinical and epidemiological information was collected by using the infectious disease monitoring database, hospital discharge, deprivation index and long term care facility databases. RESULTS: In the period after the publication of the decree, there were more elderly, females, strangers, retired, residents in nursing homes and deprived people than in the first period. There were also more health care personnel and less professionals/managers, sales or office workers. In both phases, family is mentioned as the first community attended although less frequently in the second group.

They have high risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To assess the estimated clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness associated with strategies for COVID-19 management among adults experiencing sheltered homelessness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytic model used a simulated cohort of 2258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston, Massachusetts. Cohort characteristics and costs were adapted from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were taken from published literature and national databases. Surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [R(e)], 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9, respectively) were examined. Costs were from a health care sector perspective, and the time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. EXPOSURES: Daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of individuals with positive symptom screening results, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternative care sites (ACSs) for mild or moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing were each compared with no intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case of COVID-19 prevented. RESULTS: The simulated population of 2258 sheltered homeless adults had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (9.04) years. Compared with no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild or moderate disease was associated with 37% fewer infections (1954 vs 1239) and 46% lower costs ($6.10 million vs $3.27 million) at an R(e) of 2.6, 75% fewer infections (538 vs 137) and 72% lower costs ($1.46 million vs $0.41 million) at an R(e) of 1.3, and 51% fewer infections (174 vs 85) and 51% lower costs ($0.54 million vs $0.26 million) at an R(e) of 0.9. Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with a further decrease in infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1000 at an R(e )of 2.6, $27 000 at an R(e) of 1.3, and $71 000 at an R(e) of 0.9. Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more expensive than other options. Compared with no intervention, temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was associated with 81% fewer infections (376) and 542% higher costs ($39.12 million) at an R(e) of 2.6, 82% fewer infections (95) and 2568% higher costs ($38.97 million) at an R(e) of 1.3, and 59% fewer infections (71) and 7114% higher costs ($38.94 million) at an R(e) of 0.9. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this modeling study of simulated adults living in homeless shelters, daily symptom screening and ACSs were associated with fewer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and decreased costs compared with no intervention. In a modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with further decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infections at modest incremental cost and should be considered during future surges.","Baggett, Travis P.; Scott, Justine A.; Le, Mylinh H.; Shebl, Fatma M.; Panella, Christopher; Losina, Elena; Flanagan, Clare; Gaeta, Jessie M.; Neilan, Anne; Hyle, Emily P.; Mohareb, Amir; Reddy, Krishna P.; Siedner, Mark J.; Harling, Guy; Weinstein, Milton C.; Ciaranello, Andrea; Kazemian, Pooyan; Freedberg, Kenneth A.",JAMA Netw Open,162,2

However, this ‘dualistic’ approach has been challenged, with some arguing that it is impossible to disentangle the effects of the two domains, and that wellbeing should be considered as part of a network of mutually reinforcing relationships between individual, community and place characteristics. We used network analysis to explore these complex associations. METHODS: Data were from a large sample of adults from a socioeconomically disadvantaged region of the United Kingdom (N = 4319). Wellbeing was assessed using the 7-item version of the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). Mixed graphical networks were estimated including wellbeing, place and individual-characteristic variables as nodes. RESULTS: We found a densely connected network in which wellbeing was associated, both directly and indirectly, with all of the individual, community and place characteristics assessed. Wellbeing was most strongly connected with individual characteristics, in particular financial difficulty and subjective physical health. However, controlling for all other variables in the network model, wellbeing was positively associated with local greenspace usage, civic agency, and neighbourhood cohesion, and negatively associated with housing disrepair. Greater specificity in these associations was observed when the wellbeing construct was broken down into its constituent parts. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complex relationships that exist between individual, community and place characteristics in the context of subjective wellbeing, and that all domains need to be considered when developing population-level strategies to improve wellbeing. Further consideration needs to be given to how this might happen in practice, for example through a combination of consistent use of community engagement methodologies alongside Health in All Policy (HiAP) approaches.

However, little is known about cardiac injury in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients. This study is to investigate the incidence and characteristics of myocardial injury in COVID‐19 patients admitted in hospital. METHODS: Fifty‐four COVID‐19 patients were enrolled in one ward in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, and 5 were excluded caused by missing cardiac troponin I levels. Forty‐nine participants were included in the final analysis. The clinical manifestations of hospitalised patients were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups, cardiac injury group and non‐cardiac injury group, based on whether cardiac troponin I was elevated. Epidemic characteristics and laboratory test results were analysed in these two group. RESULTS: The average age of patients in the cardiac injury group was older (68.0 years old) than that in the non‐cardiac injury group (61.5 years old). The percentages of patients with diabetes and critically severe pneumonia in the cardiac injury group were 38.5% and 38.5% respectively. Lymphocytes were decreased in 53.1% of all enrolled patients, but this decrease was more prominent (76.9%) in the cardiac injury group than the non‐cardiac injury group (44.4%). Patients in the cardiac injury group also had lower platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 can cause cardiac injury in many patients. It is more common in older patients and patients with diabetes and is associated with a significant decrease in lymphocytes.","Zhu, Huolan; Zhang, Yanfei; Pei, Zuowei; Guo, Ying; Yang, Chenguang; Song, Yan; Guo, Xiaomei; Wang, Fang",Int J Clin Pract,162,17

In an online survey, N = 932 participants recruited at a Chinese University (237 males and 695 females) completed self-reports on fear of COVID-19, neuroticism (and other personality traits from the Big Five Inventory-44), the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (assessing tendencies toward SNUD), and the Smartphone Addiction Scale short version—assessing individual differences in tendencies toward SmUD. Our findings showed that all variables of main interest were positively correlated with each other. A mediation model suggested that SNUD (in parts) mediated the association between fear of COVID-19 and SmUD. Although neuroticism was robustly correlated with all mentioned variables, no moderation effect could be observed on the investigated fear-of-COVID-19-SNUD-link. The findings of this work provide further evidence that the smartphone itself is only a device giving individuals access to software applications, which might be excessively used. Beyond that, the present data indicate neuroticism to be a risk factor with respect to fear of COVID-19, SNUD, and SmUD, although the study is limited by its cross-sectional study design.","Montag, Christian; Sindermann, Cornelia; Rozgonjuk, Dmitri; Yang, Shixin; Elhai, Jon D.; Yang, Haibo",Front Psychol,162,21

Objective: To determine whether public health interventions that culminated in a stay-at-home lockdown instituted during the first wave of the pandemic in March/April 2020 were effective at mitigating the association of any of these factors with the risk of infection. Design: Population-based cohort study Setting: Ontario, Canada Patients: All adults that underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 1 and June 12, 2020. Measurements: The outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were determined for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors before and after the peak of the pandemic to assess for changes in effect sizes. Results: Among 578,263 community-dwelling individuals, 20,524 (3.5%) people tested positive. The association between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among tested community-dwelling individuals varied over time (P-interaction <0.0001). Prior to the first-wave peak of the pandemic, the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased progressively with age compared with individuals aged 18-45 years (P<0.0001). This association subsequently reversed, with all age groups younger than 85 years at progressively higher risk of infection (P<0.0001) after the peak. Otherwise, risk factors that persisted throughout included male sex, residing in lower income neighborhoods, residing in more racially/ethnically diverse communities, immigration to Canada, and history of hypertension and diabetes. While there was a reduction in infection rates across Ontario after mid-April, there was less impact in regions with higher degrees of racial/ethnic diversity. When considered in an additive risk model, following the initial peak of the pandemic, individuals living in the most racially/ethnically diverse communities with 2, 3, or [≥]4 risk factors had ORs of 1.89, 3.07, and 4.73-fold higher for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to lower risk individuals in their community (all P<0.0001). In contrast, in the least racially/ethnically diverse communities, there was little to no gradient in infection rates across risk strata. Conclusion: After public health interventions in March/April 2020, people with multiple risk factors residing in the most racially diverse communities of Ontario continued to have the highest likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection while risk was mitigated for people with multiple risk factors residing in less racially/ethnically diverse communities.

Given the absence of data for specific interventions in the rheumatic disease population, we reviewed the evidence available for the general population. The risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases is a potential concern given the immunosuppression associated with these conditions and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy, as well as advancing age, and many of the comorbidities present in such patients. Infection prevention is key, for both individual patients and their community.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID‐19. METHODS: This review was carried out in accordance with Cochrane methodology including risk of bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Only prospective clinical trials randomly assigning COVID‐19 patients to convalescent plasma plus standard of care therapy (test arm) versus placebo/standard of care (control arm) were included. Two reviewers independently read each preprint/publication and extracted relevant data from individual studies. Data were pooled using the random‐effects model and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 13 206 patients from 12 randomised controlled trials were included. There was no significant difference in clinical improvement rate (RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98–1.02, p = 0.96) or time to clinical improvement (median difference of 1.08 days with 95% CI ranging from −0.15 to +2.30 days) between convalescent plasma versus placebo/standard of care therapy. The use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significantly reduced risk of death (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.02, p = 0.08). Reassuringly, overall incidence of infusion‐related serious adverse events was low (3.25%) and not significantly different (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.93–1.40, p = 0.22) for convalescent plasma transfusion compared to placebo/standard of care therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate certainty evidence that the addition of convalescent plasma to current standard of care therapy is generally safe but, does not result in any significant clinical benefit or reduction of mortality in COVID‐19.","Gupta, Tejpal; Kannan, Sadhana; Kalra, Babusha; Thakkar, Prafulla",Transfus Med,162,26

METHODS: Refractory patients were defined as cases showing clinical and radiological deterioration despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7 days or more. We identified 6 such children (male/female: 3/3) aged 3–9 years who were treated between 1998 and 2006. During the same period, 190 children with MP were admitted to our institution. RESULTS: Common laboratory findings of the patients included cytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and elevated urine β(2)-microglobulin levels, suggesting complication of hypercytokinemic condition. We initiated intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg on 10.2 ± 2.8 clinical days and administered it once daily for 3 consecutive days. Fever subsided 4–14 h after initiation of steroid pulse therapy in all patients. This dramatic effect was accompanied by rapid improvement of radiological abnormalities including infiltrates and pleural effusion, followed by improvement of laboratory abnormalities. There were no adverse events of steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case-series study showing an effect of 3-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy on refractory MP in children. This therapy is apparently an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for refractory MP.","Tamura, Akihiro; Matsubara, Kousaku; Tanaka, Takayuki; Nigami, Hiroyuki; Yura, Kazuo; Fukaya, Takashi",J Infect,162,29

Many works have been published on the “linguistic profile” of various clinical populations, but very few papers have been devoted to linguistic changes in patients with eating disorders. Patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) share similar psychological features such as disturbances in self-perceived body image, inflexible and obsessive thinking and anxious or depressive traits. We hypothesize that these characteristics can result in altered linguistic patterns and be detected using the Natural Language Processing tools. METHODS: We enrolled 51 young participants from December 2019 to February 2020 (age range: 14–18): 17 girls with a clinical diagnosis of AN, and 34 normal-weighted peers, matched by gender, age and educational level. Participants in each group were asked to produce three written texts (around 10–15 lines long). A rich set of linguistic features was extracted from the text samples and the statistical significance in pinpointing the pathological process was measured. RESULTS: Comparison between the two groups showed several linguistics indexes as statistically significant, with syntactic reduction as the most relevant trait of AN productions. In particular, the following features emerge as statistically significant in distinguishing AN girls and their normal-weighted peers: the length of the sentences, the complexity of the noun phrase, and the global syntactic complexity. This peculiar pattern of linguistic erosion may be due to the severe metabolic impairment also affecting the central nervous system in AN. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data showed the existence of linguistic parameters as probable linguistic markers of AN. However, the analysis of a bigger cohort, still ongoing, is needed to consolidate this assumption. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: Evidence obtained from case–control analytic studies.

The aim of this study, a sub-study of the COVID-19-CVD international study of the impact of the pandemic on the cardiovascular system, was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among Coptic priests and to identify predictors of clinical adverse events. Methods: Participants were geographically divided into three groups: Group-I: Europe and USA, Group II: Northern Egypt, and Group III: Southern Egypt. Participants’ demographic indices, cardiovascular risk factors, possible source of infection, number of liturgies, infection management, and major adverse events (MAEs), comprising death, or mechanical ventilation, were assessed. Results: Out of the 1570 clergy serving in 25 dioceses, 255 (16.2%) were infected. Their mean age was 49.5 ± 12 years and mean weekly number of liturgies was 3.44 ± 1.0. The overall prevalence rate was 16.2% and did not differ between Egypt as a whole and overseas (p = 0.23). Disease prevalence was higher in Northern Egypt clergy compared with Europe and USA combined (18.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.03) and tended to be higher than in Southern Egypt (18.4% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.09). Ten priests (3.92%) died of COVID-19-related complications, and 26 (10.2) suffered a MAE. The clergy from Southern Egypt were more obese, but the remaining risk factors were less prevalent compared with those in Europe and USA (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, obesity (OR = 4.180; 2.479 to 12.15; p = 0.01), age (OR = 1.055; 0.024 to 1.141; p = 0.02), and systemic hypertension (OR = 1.931; 1.169 to 2.004; p = 0.007) predicted MAEs. Obesity was the most powerful independent predictor of MAE in Southern Egypt and systemic hypertension in Northern Egypt (p < 0.05 for both). Conclusion: Obesity is very prevalent among Coptic clergy and seems to be the most powerful independent predictor of major COVID-19-related adverse events. Coptic clergy should be encouraged to follow the WHO recommendations for cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 prevention.","Henein, Michael Y.; Bytyçi, Ibadete; Nicoll, Rachel; Shenouda, Rafik; Ayad, Sherif; Vancheri, Federico; Cameli, Matteo",J Clin Med,162,20

Since ehealth is considered here broadly, as an umbrella term, it also covers subsets like telehealth and mhealth. This study aimed to review the literature to identify and classify subdomains of eHealth solutions that have been utilized, developed, or suggested for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane library databases in April 2020, with no time limitation. The search strategy was built based on 2 concept domains of eHealth solutions and covid-19. For each concept domain, the search query comprised a combination of free text keywords identified from reference papers and controlled vocabulary terms. Obtained results were classified, graphically presented, and discussed. Results: Of the 423 studies identified initially, 35 were included in this study. From related papers, general characteristics, study objective, eHealth-related outcomes, target populations, eHealth interventions, health service category, eHealth solution, and eHealth domain were extracted, classified, and tabulated. Most publication types were ideas, editorials, or opinions (46%). The most targeted populations were people of the community and medical staff (80%). The most implemented or suggested eHealth solution was telehealth (63%), followed by mhealth, health information technology, and health data analytics. Most of the COVID-19 ehealth interventions designed or suggested for improving prevention (48%) and diagnosis (48%). Most of the studies applied or proposed eHealth solutions for general practice or epidemiological purposes (48%). Conclusion: eHealth solutions have the potential to provide useful services to help in COVID-19 pandemics in terms of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, screening, surveillance, resource allocation, education, management, and control. The obtained results from this review might be used for a better understanding of current ehealth solutions provided or recommended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Eslami, Parisa; Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh R.; Taheriyan, Moloud",Med J Islam Repub Iran,162,13

This has been facilitated by its high transmissibility within the human population and its ability to remain viable on inanimate surfaces for an extended period. To address the latter, we examined the effect of simulated sunlight on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 spiked into tissue culture medium or mucus. The study revealed that inactivation took 37 minutes in medium and 107 minutes in mucus. These times-to-inactivation were unexpected since they are longer than have been observed in other studies. From this work, we demonstrate that sunlight represents an effective decontamination method but the speed of decontamination is variable based on the underlying matrix.

Once infected, HSV-1 can remain latent in the host for a lifetime and be reactivated in patients with a compromised immune system. Reactivation of latent HSV-1 can also be achieved by other stimuli. Though acyclovir (ACV) is a classic drug for HSV-1 infection, ACV-resistant strains have been found in immune-compromised patients and drug toxicity has also been commonly reported. Therefore, there is an urge to search for new anti-HSV-1 agents. Natural products with potential anti-HSV-1 activity have the advantages of minimal side effects, reduced toxicity, and they exert their effect by various mechanisms. This paper will not only provide a reference for the safe dose of these agents if they are to be used in humans, referring to the interrelated data obtained from in vitro experiments, but also introduce the main pharmacodynamic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) against HSV-1. Taken together, TCM functions as a potential source for HSV-1 therapy by direct (blocking viral attachment/absorption/penetration/replication) or indirect (reducing the susceptibility to HSV-1 or regulating autophagy) antiviral activities. The potential of these active components in the development of anti-HSV-1 drugs will also be described.","Li, Wen; Wang, Xiao-Hua; Luo, Zhuo; Liu, Li-Fang; Yan, Chang; Yan, Chang-Yu; Chen, Guo-Dong; Gao, Hao; Duan, Wen-Jun; Kurihara, Hiroshi; Li, Yi-Fang; He, Rong-Rong",Int J Mol Sci,162,1

Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan, may mitigate these effects, though induction of ACE2 could increase viral entry, replication, and worsen disease. METHODS: This study represents a placebo-controlled blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of losartan on outpatients with COVID-19 across three hospital systems with numerous community sites in Minnesota, U.S. Participants included symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 not already taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Patients were randomized to 1:1 losartan (25 mg orally twice daily unless estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR, was reduced, when dosing was reduced to once daily) versus placebo for 10 days, and all patients and outcome assesors were blinded. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization within 15 days. Secondary outcomes included functional status, dyspnea, temperature, and viral load. (clinicatrials.gov, NCT04311177, closed to new participants) FINDINGS: From April to November 2020, 117 participants were randomized 58 to losartan and 59 to placebo, and all were analyzed under intent to treat principles. The primary outcome did not differ significantly between the two arms based on Barnard's test [losartan arm: 3 events (5.2% 95% CI 1.1, 14.4%) versus placebo arm: 1 event (1.7%; 95% CI 0.0, 9.1%)]; proportion difference -3.5% (95% CI -13.2, 4.8%); p = 0.32]. Viral loads were not statistically different between treatment groups at any time point. Adverse events per 10 patient days did not differ signifcantly [0.33 (95% CI 0.22–0.49) for losartan vs. 0.37 (95% CI 0.25–0.55) for placebo]. Due to a lower than expected hospitalization rate and low likelihood of a clinically important treatment effect, the trial was terminated early. INTERPRETATION: In this multicenter blinded RCT for outpatients with mild symptomatic COVID-19 disease, losartan did not reduce hospitalizations, though assessment was limited by low event rate. Importantly, viral load was not statistically affected by treatment. This study does not support initiation of losartan for low-risk outpatients.","Puskarich, Michael A.; Cummins, Nathan W.; Ingraham, Nicholas E.; Wacker, David A.; Reilkoff, Ronald A.; Driver, Brian E; Biros, Michelle H.; Bellolio, Fernanda; Chipman, Jeffrey G.; Nelson, Andrew C.; Beckman, Kenneth; Langlois, Ryan; Bold, Tyler; Aliota, Matthew T.; Schacker, Timothy W.; Voelker, Helen T.; Murray, Thomas A; Koopmeiners, Joseph S.; Tignanelli, Christopher J.",EClinicalMedicine,162,16

Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE’s detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.

These schemes have routinely been used to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in countries across the world. The number of positive tests in a given region can provide local insights into important epidemiological parameters, such as prevalence and effective reproduction number. Moreover, targeted testing data has been used inform the deployment of localised non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, surveillance schemes typically suffer from ascertainment bias; the individuals who are tested are not necessarily representative of the wider population of interest. Here, we show that data from randomised testing schemes, such as the REACT study in the UK, can be used to debias fine-scale targeted testing data in order to provide accurate localised estimates of the number of infectious individuals. We develop a novel, integrative causal framework that explicitly models the process underlying the selection of individuals for targeted testing. The output from our model can readily be incorporated into longitudinal analyses to provide local estimates of the reproduction number. We apply our model to characterise the size of the infectious population in England between June 2020 and January 2021. Our local estimates of the effective reproduction number are predictive of future changes in positive case numbers. We also capture local increases in both prevalence and effective reproductive number in the South East from November 2020 to December 2020, reflecting the spread of the Kent variant. Preparations for future epidemics should ensure the rapid deployment of both types of schemes to accurately monitor the spread of emerging and ongoing infectious diseases.","Nicholson, G.; Lehmann, B.

Lymphocyte proliferation assay was used to detect the cellular immune response.- The results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously evoke specific antibody against G2 glycoprotein and IL-2. And the immunized mice of every group elicited neutralizing antibodies with different titers. Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of chimeric gene to G2 and IL-2 were significantly higher than that of other groups.

METHODS: We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. RESULTS: Infected ALO monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2→AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both. CONCLUSIONS: Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19, which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.

RECENT FINDINGS: Orthopedic surgery is the surgical specialty that has seen the highest proportion of its procedures cancelled due to the pandemic. In this context and onward, telemedicine seems to be a reasonable option for the orthopedic surgeon. Multiple studies have described its safety and a similar patient satisfaction compared to in-person consultations. It has a potential to increase productivity and decrease wait times by providing easier access to the clinician and by decreasing travel-associated limitations and costs. Authors have described the possibility to conduct a reliable virtual assessment of the patient range of motion. Some of the limitations to the use of this technology are technological literacy and access to virtual consultation platforms, the inability to conduct a complete physical examination, potential reduction in identification of intimate and child abuse victims, and limited knowledge about the legal implications of this technology. SUMMARY: Telemedicine in orthopedic surgery has a potential to increase productivity, reduce costs, and increase the access to healthcare. Identified limitations include risk of misdiagnosis, required technologic literacy, unknown legal implications, and failure to identify victims of abuse. In order to use this technology judiciously, the clinician must take into consideration the patient’s condition and his technological literacy and be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.","Moisan, Philippe; Barimani, Bardia; Antoniou, John",Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med,162,0

Previous analyses have evaluated residency and fellowship websites; however, an in-depth analysis of medical school websites is lacking. Methods We evaluated 192 United States (US) medical school websites for presence or absence of 39 items relevant to medical school applicants. Items fell into seven general categories: curriculum, research, demographics of incoming class, admissions information, faculty, financial aid, and social. Results Of the 192 websites evaluated (152 allopathic and 40 osteopathic schools), websites contained a mean of 23 items (59%) with a standard deviation of 4.2 items. Conclusion Our study examining US medical school websites revealed a lack of online information for medical school applicants. As medical school interviews transition to being online during the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of the medical school website to applicants becomes increasingly crucial. The information contained in our study could be used to improve the functionality and quality of information on medical school websites, which could help both applicants and the medical schools themselves.","Pollock, Jordan R; Moore, Michael L; Smith, Jacob F; Woolstenhulme, Jonny B; Markham, Dane J; Rhees, Joshua R; Poole, Kenneth; Pollock, Nathan T; Patel, Naresh P",Cureus,162,1

The number of kidney transplants has declined during the pandemic. We describe our deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) experience during the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safety of DDKT during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Multiple preventive measures were implemented. Adult patients that underwent DDKT from 3/1/20 to 4/30/20 were included. COVID‐19 clinical manifestations from donors and recipients, and post‐transplant outcomes (COVID‐19 infections, readmissions, allograft rejection, and mortality) were obtained. The kidney transplant (KT) recipients were followed until 5/31/20. RESULTS: Seventy‐six patients received kidneys from 57 donors. Fever, dyspnea, and cough were reported in 1, 2, and 1 donor, respectively. Thirty‐eight (66.6%) donors were tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2) prior to donation (mainly by nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and 36 (47.3%) KT recipients were tested at the time of DDKT by nasopharyngeal PCR; all of these were negative. Our recipients were followed for a median of 63 (range: 33‐91) days. A total of 42 (55.3%) recipients were tested post‐transplant for SARS‐CoV2 by nasopharyngeal PCR including 12 patients that became symptomatic; all tests were negative except for one that was inconclusive, but it was repeated and came back negative. Forty (52.6%) KT recipients were readmitted, and 7 (9.2%) had biopsy‐proven rejection during the follow‐up. None of the KT recipients transplanted during this period died. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort demonstrated that DDKT can be safely performed during the COVID‐19 pandemic when preventive measures are implemented.","Chandorkar, Aditya; Coro, Ana; Natori, Yoichiro; Anjan, Shweta; Abbo, Lilian M.; Guerra, Giselle; Mattiazzi, Adela D.; Mendez‐Castaner, Lumen A.; Morris, Michele I.; Camargo, Jose F.; Vianna, Rodrigo; Simkins, Jacques",Transpl Infect Dis,162,16

CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient is 45 years-old who has been exposed to SARS CoV-2. Upon admission due to acute abdomen evidence surgery is performed in which an intestinal resection with an adequate post-surgical evolution takes place so the patient is discharged after 4 days with a prescription for oral anticoagulants. The second one is 42 years-old and has comorbidities. The patient is admitted upon evidence of COVID-19, after showing signs of vein mesenteric ischemia in a CT scan surgery is performed, however the patient dies 24 h after the intervention. DISCUSSION: Within severe cases of patients with COVID-19 the incidence of a symptomatology or gastrointestinal complications is high (39–73.8%). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended to all patients admitted for COVID-19, starting with heparin of low molecular weight as prophylaxis, as well as continuing with oral anticoagulants after being discharged. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that knowledge of the disease is rapidly advancing, all available treatments are still nonspecific to SARS-CoV-2 and the optimal management of COVID-19 remains unclear. An unexplained clinical picture should raise the suspicion for rare conditions such as mesenteric thrombosis. Adequate prophylactic measures should be implemented both during hospitalization and after discharge.","Rodriguez-Nakamura, Reiko M.; Gonzalez-Calatayud, Mariel; Martinez Martinez, Antonio Ramiro",Int J Surg Case Rep,162,5

Treatment approaches and follow-up plans have been modified to prevent the risk of infection for patients and healthcare workers. Patients prefer to delay or cancel their treatments during the peak period of infection. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the characteristics of patients with breast cancer who were consulted at our outpatient clinic right after early COVID-19 peak in May and June 2020 and compared them with the same period in 2017 to 2019. Results: The number of patients who consulted at our outpatient medical oncology clinic declined in May and June 2020. This decline was regardless of stage and was larger in May than in June 2020. In general, the distribution of tumor subtypes [luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive, and triple negative] was not different from 2017 to 2020. Less than half of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy following early COVID-19 peak in May and June 2020. Few patients received chemotherapy for metastatic disease, whereas many metastatic patients received endocrine therapy. None of the consulted new patients had a non-invasive disease. More patients received endocrine therapy than chemotherapy. Conclusion: The presentation patterns of patients with breast cancer after early COVID-19 peak differed from those during the same period in the last 3 years. The pandemic affected the number of new patients consulted and the way medical oncologists treat their patients.","Dauti Isiklar, A.; Deniz, C.; Soyder, A.; Guldogan, N.; Yilmaz, E.; Basaran, G.",European Journal of Breast Health,162,8

However, longitudinal studies on sociodemographic risk factors are lacking. AIMS: To quantify longitudinal changes in depression symptoms during the pandemic compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, in middle-aged and older adults, and identify the risk factors contributing to this. METHOD: A total of 5331 participants aged ≥50 years were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Self-reported depression symptoms in June/July 2020 were compared with baseline data from 2–3 years prior. Regression models investigated sociodemographic and lifestyle variables that could explain variance in change in depression. RESULTS: Within-participant depression scores increased significantly from pre-pandemic levels: 14% met the criteria for clinical depression at baseline, compared with 26% during the pandemic. Younger age, female gender, higher depression scores at baseline, living alone and having a long-standing illness were significant risk factors. Gender-stratified regression models indicated that older age was protective for women only, whereas urban living increased risk among women only. Being an alcohol consumer was a protective factor among men only. CONCLUSIONS: Depression in UK adults aged ≥50 years increased significantly during the pandemic. Being female, living alone and having a long-standing illness were prominent risk factors. Younger women living in urban areas were at particularly high risk, suggesting such individuals should be prioritised for support. Findings are also informative for future risk stratification and intervention strategies, particularly if social restrictions are reimposed as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold.","Rutland-Lawes, Jamie; Wallinheimo, Anna-Stiina; Evans, Simon L.",BJPsych Open,162,0

Transmucosal diamorphine is administered by buccal, sublingual or intranasal routes, and rapidly absorbed. AIM: To explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals in the UK caring for children with life-limiting conditions concerning the assessment and management of breakthrough pain; prescribing and administration of transmucosal diamorphine compared with oral morphine; and the feasibility of a comparative clinical trial. DESIGN/ PARTICIPANTS: Three focus groups, analysed using a Framework approach. Doctors, nurses and pharmacists (n = 28), caring for children with life-limiting illnesses receiving palliative care, participated. RESULTS: Oral morphine is frequently used for breakthrough pain across all settings; with transmucosal diamorphine largely limited to use in hospices or given by community nurses, predominantly buccally. Perceived advantages of oral morphine included confidence in its use with no requirement for specific training; disadvantages included tolerability issues, slow onset, unpredictable response and unsuitability for patients with gastrointestinal failure. Perceived advantages of transmucosal diamorphine were quick onset and easy administration; barriers included lack of licensed preparations and prescribing guidance with fears over accountability of prescribers, and potential issues with availability, preparation and palatability. Factors potentially affecting recruitment to a trial were patient suitability and onerousness for families, trial design and logistics, staff time and clinician engagement. CONCLUSIONS: There were perceived advantages to transmucosal diamorphine, but there is a need for access to a safe preparation. A clinical trial would be feasible provided barriers were overcome.","Jamieson, Liz; Harrop, Emily; Johnson, Margaret; Liossi, Christina; Mott, Christine; Oulton, Kate; Skene, Simon S.; Wong, Ian CK; Howard, Richard F",Palliat Med,162,26

We adapted the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) for diagnosing respiratory infections. FA-RP is an in vitro mPCR assay that simultaneously and rapidly (in about 1 h) detects 20 pathogens directly from respiratory specimens. Here, we studied the clinical efficacy of FA-RP in children who underwent testing for respiratory pathogens at Yeungnam University Hospital from November 2015 to August 2018. From November 2015 to June 2016, routine mPCR testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the routine mPCR kit. From November 2016 to July 2018, mPCR testing was performed using FA-RP. A total of 321 tests by routine mPCR and 594 tests by FA-RP were included. The positive detection rates for routine mPCR and FA-RP were 71.3% and 83.3%, respectively.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at provincial level in mainland China. METHODS: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran’s I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). RESULTS: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher overall incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China; the highest RR = 135.08, 95% CI: 128.36–142.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China; the highest RR = 423.51, 95% CI: 240.96–722.32) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the “Wuhan lockdown”. The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks exhibited distinct spatiotemporal clustering patterns at the provincial levels in mainland China, which may be attributable to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms.

To figure out an estimation of asymptomatic patients and seropositive SARS-COV-2 blood donors in Iran, a national survey was conducted to find the prevalence of asymptomatic blood donors with positive SARS-COV-2 IgM/IgG test results at the end of May 2020. Material and methods: From all 31 provinces, 1339 blood donors were included. At first, data was collected with an interview containing demographic data, risk factors and possible signs and symptoms held for each donor by a trained medical expert. Then, SARS-COV-2 serologic rapid tests were conducted. Subsequently, the test results were observed and recorded; all of their photos were checked by one single expert. We corrected the prevalence rates for sensitivity and weighted them by the last year rate of blood donation of each province. Results: The corrected prevalence rates of positive serological test results for sensitivity in provinces were between zero and 38.24%. The national prevalence was calculated 14.45% after weighting. Out of 161 positive donors, only 43 cases reported related signs or symptoms during the defined period of time, while 118 (73.29%) seropositive cases had not reported any related signs or symptoms. Some signs or symptoms were reported more frequent in the SARS-COV-2 serologic rapid test positives. The highest OR (10.19) was linked to ageusia. Conclusions: This study has shown the prevalence of seropositive results to be around 14% in target population in which around ¾ had not reported any signs or symptoms.","Arabkhazaeli, Ali; Maghsudlu, Mahtab; Mohammadi, Saeed; Eshghi, Peyman",Transfus Clin Biol,162,21

Therefore, it is necessary to find out potential therapeutic pharmaceuticals for this disease. This study investigates the inhibitory effect of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (3CL(pro)) using pharmaceuticals containing α-ketoamide group and pyridone ring based on molecular docking. Of these, eight pharmaceuticals approved by US-Food and Drug Administration have shown good contact with the catalytic residues of 3CL(pro). They are telaprevir, temsirolimus, pimecrolimus, aminoglutethimide, apixaban, buspirone, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide. Their binding affinity score ranged from -5.6 to -7.4 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonds were observed and reported. To the knowledge, this study report for the first time a compound that could be binding to ALA(285), the new residue resulting from genetic modification of 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 that has increased its catalytic activity 3.6-fold compared with its predecessor 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV.

Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity.

While both countries have achieved impressive vaccination rates, cases increased to unprecedented levels in one country, while decreasing steadily in the other. Although this could be attributed to a number of factors, we argue here that the heavy reliance on alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines may have contributed to these discrepant outcomes. We then expand the analysis to compare the top 10 vaccinated countries, and compare their outcomes based on their reliance on inactivated virus vaccines. The results remarkably align with the initial findings seen in Bahrain and Qatar. Countries that did not use inactivated virus vaccines achieved steady declines in daily Covid-19 deaths, while other countries did not.

Community pharmacists are expected and required to possess a broad spectrum of knowledge and skills. Self-assessment of these competencies is needed for their self-improvement. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess pharmacists’ clinical knowledge and practice in the safe use of contraceptives, and to compare the scores obtained by external observation with pharmacists’ self-assessment of their knowledge as well as investigate the significance of preceptorship experiences. Contraceptives was chosen as the subject area in view of high rates of abortions as a means of contraception in Bosnia and Herzegovina. METHODS: A questionnaire approach was used. The questionnaire included the following: the first domain contained two case scenarios (safe use of contraceptives), which evaluated clinical knowledge, a second domain in which pharmacists self-assessed their knowledge to resolve cases from the first domain and a third domain that measured the demographics of pharmacists (including experience in preceptorship). Dispensing practice was evaluated in the second domain. The questionnaires were distributed to a convenient sample of 100 pharmacists at the Annual Meeting of Bosnia and Herzegovina Pharmacists. The results were presented as counts (%). The groups (preceptors and non-preceptors) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test, paired assessments were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the correlation between variables. RESULTS: Of the 100 pharmacists invited to participate, 84 completed the questionnaire (84 % response rate). There was no agreement between pharmacists’ real knowledge (average score - case 1: 2.71, case 2: 3.3) and their self-assessment (average score - case 1: 3.77, case 2: 3.91). There was no statistically significant difference in the actual knowledge of pharmacists (experienced/non-experienced in precepting), while the difference in the self-assessment was significant between these two groups. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists appear to overrate themselves, which leads to self-enhancement bias, in which the experience in precepting has some influence. Pharmacists’ capability in performing an objective self-assessment of their clinical knowledge needs to be carefully studied in the future to fully benefit patients.

The patterns associated with skipping breakfast may be related to the nutrition transition. This study aimed at exploring the composition of breakfast consumed by Palestinian school children and their perceptions toward this meal. It also aimed at exploring skipping breakfast prevalence, reasons, and its association with selected schoolchildren’s sociodemographic variables and behavioral patterns. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 12- to 14-year-old schoolchildren from 4 governmental schools in urban and rural areas of the Jenin district in Palestine. The questionnaire included information about children and parents sociodemographic and behaviours, breakfast patterns and composition, reasons for skipping breakfast, and items on schoolchildren’s perception toward breakfast. Statistical analysis of the relevant factors was undertaken using SPSS software. RESULTS: In a sample of 193 schoolchildren, only 32% reported consuming breakfast all year round. The main reasons reported for skipping breakfast were not feeling hungry, not having the time, and lack of appetite. The vast majority (79%) believed breakfast was beneficial for general health. Sleeping before 10 pm, regular exercise (p value < 0.05). and shorter screen time were all significantly associated with a higher level of breakfast consumption (p value < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Understanding the reasons for missing or skipping breakfast factors which make skipping it more likely, should inform public health strategies to promote breakfast consumption. For example, our findings suggest that awareness of the importance of breakfast was not a significant contributor to skipping breakfast, compared to other structural and cultural factors.","Badrasawi, Manal; Anabtawi, Ola; Al-Zain, Yaqout",BMC Nutr,162,16

Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries. Methods: We examine HFP activities before and since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n=600) of residents of Vermont, United States. Results: We find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and more prevalence among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Forty-two percent of respondents engaged in HFP activities; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic. HFP was more common among food insecure households, who were more likely to fish, forage, hunt and have backyard livestock. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color and/or Hispanic, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP since COVID-19. HFP were significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially if gardening and canning, while respondents hunting or having backyard livestock were significantly more likely to have higher red meat intake. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households, and provide diet quality impacts. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates multiple opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.","Niles, M. T.; Wirkkala, K. B.; Belarmino, E.

A quasi-experimental design was used to conduct group interventions among college students. A total of 22 and 26 participants were included in the experimental and control groups, respectively. The experimental group received six sessions of a logo-autobiography for college students (LAC). The effects of the LAC interventions were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and four weeks after the program’s end to determine their retention rate. The effects of group, time, and the group-by-time interaction were verified using generalized estimating equations with an autoregressive correlation structure. The experimental group exhibited significantly lower levels of stress and depression and higher levels concerning the meaning of life than the control group. However, only the effects on stress and the meaning of life continued four weeks after the intervention’s end. Based on this study’s results, LAC can be considered a useful method for reducing stress and depression in college students who have just started their adult life, as well as for aiding them in their pursuit for the meaning of life.","Cho, Sunhee; Jang, Sun Joo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,162,16

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor. The cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed virus can spread to other organs and infect ACE2-expressing cells at local sites, causing multi-organ injury.

About 19 million of the 463 million persons living with DM (PLWD) globally are found in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The dual burden of DM and poverty in SSA, coupled with the rising number of cases of COVID-19 in this region, predisposes PLWD to inadequate care and poor glycemic controls due to the disruption to the economy and the healthcare system. The risk of acquisition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among PLWD is the same as those in the general population. Therefore, the standard preventive measures outlined by the World Health Organization must be strictly adhered to. In addition, maintaining adequate glycemic control is associated with better outcomes in DM patients with COVID-19. In SSA, adequate supply of DM medication while patients stay at home is crucial to minimize routine hospital visits since DM clinics are usually overcrowded and have longer waiting times, which may maximize risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to PLWD across the region. Psychosocial support to improve adherence to anti-hyperglycemic medications may improve COVID-19 outcomes. Trained healthcare professionals should diagnose and evaluate severity comprehensively as well as evaluate the need for in-patient care for PLWD with COVID-19 irrespective of disease severity. Due to the increased risk of severe disease, a multi-disciplinary approach to the management of COVID-19 in PLWD should preferably be in a setting where close monitoring is available, typically a health facility, even for mild disease that may require home management according to local guidelines. In conclusion, DM complicates COVID-19 outcomes and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects DM care at individual and global public health levels. PLWD should be prioritized as COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out.","Kyazze, Andrew Peter; Bongomin, Felix; Ninsiima, Sandra; Nattabi, Gloria; Nabakka, Winnie; Kukunda, Rebecca; Odanga, Henry; Ssekamatte, Phillip; Baluku, Joseph Baruch; Kibirige, Davis; Andia-Biraro, Irene",Ther Adv Infect Dis,162,26

Keeping food-production workers safe is essential. During the COVID-19 pandemic, safety has meant added workplace protections. Guidance about protections came early from the Federal Government. Absent from such guidance were strategies to screen workers for the causative virus. Without viral screening, some food companies had outbreaks; some facilities had to close. Companies interested in worker screenings had to devise their own strategies. One company devised a strategy having three main goals: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, before opportunity for spread; (2) identifying workplace clusters, to indicate potential protection breakdowns; (3) comparing company results to community rates. The company decided on pilot screenings at two U.S. production plants. Screenings involved mandatory viral testing (through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) and optional antibody testing (both immunoglobulins G and M). Pilot screenings showed benefits along with limitations: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, but at questionably relevant time points; (2) identifying infection clusters, but with uncertain sites of transmission; (3) showing relatively low rates of infection, but absent details for meaningful community comparisons. Establishing a worker screening process was an enormous undertaking. Company employees had to stretch job roles and were distracted form usual responsibilities. Whether other companies would find sufficient benefits to justify screening costs is unclear. Moving forward, new Federal leadership could provide greater support for, and assistance with, worker screenings. Additionally, new technologies could make future screenings more feasible, and valuable. The worker-screening experience from this pandemic offers learnings the next.","Lucan, Sean C.; Goodwin, Stephanie K.; Lozano, Mariano; Pak, Serina; Freitas, Miguel",Public Health,162,17

This study found that a “Traditional” dietary pattern predicted greater muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet predicted greater muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years. These findings reinforce the importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing. INTRODUCTION: Research investigating the roles of individual nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic relationships between foods and nutrients. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary patterns for muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in 522 men from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with complete dietary and muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and 15-year follow-up assessments. Dietary exposures were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and included the Australian Recommended Food Score, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and three a posteriori dietary patterns: Plant-focused, Western, and Traditional (Anglo-Australian). Outcome variables included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry–derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle function measured with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. RESULTS: An anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a Traditional dietary pattern both predicted greater SMI ((B: −0.04 (95%CI −0.08, −0.00) kg/m(2)) and (B: 0.12 (95%CI 0.04, 0.20) kg/m(2)), respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted slower TUG (B: 0.11 (95%CI 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year follow-up period. These associations remained significant following adjustment for confounding variables. There were no associations observed for other dietary exposures. CONCLUSION: A Traditional dietary pattern higher in vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and animal protein was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet, also rich in vegetables, fruit, and wholegrain cereals, was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years.

A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via FcγRII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.","Mannar, Dhiraj; Leopold, Karoline; Subramaniam, Sriram",Sci Rep,162,6

However, the inevitable risk of mismatched priming cannot be avoided in the currently used primer system, even though considerable time and effort are devoted to primer design and optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5′-segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3′-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.","Chun, Jong-Yoon; Kim, Kyoung-Joong; Hwang, In-Taek; Kim, Yun-Jee; Lee, Dae-Hoon; Lee, In-Kyoung; Kim, Jong-Kee",Nucleic Acids Res,162,5

The assay was optimized by selecting the best batch and concentration of fetal bovine serum, β-mercaptoethanol concentration, cell density, BrdU incubation time and antigen presenting cell type. Cats were vaccinated with the attenuated Nobivac vaccine Tricat and the peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation responses were quantified upon in vitro restimulation with inactivated and infectious feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and felid herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1). Proliferation signals were detected with inactivated FeHV-1 in the CD8(+) but not in the CD8(−) T lymphocyte population, with inactivated FCV and FPV in both CD8(−) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte populations. Restimulation with infectious FCV caused significant proliferation in the CD8(−) T lymphocyte population only while infectious FPV and FeHV-1 seemed to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in both T cell populations. Additional IFN-γ quantification in the culture supernatant revealed a large correlation between the proliferation signals and IFN-γ production, indicating that BrdU labeling is a very reliable technique to assess and characterize feline lymphoproliferative responses to viral antigens in vitro.","Vermeulen, Ben L.; Gleich, Sabine E.; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Olyslaegers, Dominique A.; Desmarets, Lowiese M.; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,162,24

In most cases, olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by reduced sense of taste, is partial (microsmia) and seems to normalize after several weeks, however, especially in cases of virus-induced complete smell loss (anosmia), there are indications of persisting deficits even 2 months after recovery from the acute disease, pointing towards the possibility of chronic or even permanent smell reduction for a significant part of the patient population. To date, we have no knowledge on the specificity of anosmia towards specific odorants or chemicals and about the longer-term timeline of its persistence or reversal. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 70 participants from a community in Lower Austria that had been tested positive for either IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 titers in June 2020 and a healthy control cohort (N = 348) underwent smell testing with a 12-item Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), based upon items from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The test was performed in October 2020, i.e. 4 months after initial diagnosis via antibody testing. Results were analyzed using statistical tests for contingency for each smell individually in order to detect whether reacquisition of smell is dependent on specific odorant types. RESULTS: For all odorants tested, except the odor “smoke”, even 4 months or more after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants with a positive antibody titer had a reduced sense of smell when compared to the control group. On average, while the control cohort detected a set of 12 different smells with 88.0% accuracy, the antibody-positive group detected 80.0% of tested odorants. A reduction of accuracy of detection by 9.1% in the antibody-positive cohort was detected. Recovery of the ability to smell was particularly delayed for three odorants: strawberry (encoded by the aldehyde ethylmethylphenylglycidate), lemon (encoded by citronellal, a monoterpenoid aldehyde), and soap (alkali metal salts of the fatty acids plus odorous additives) exhibit a sensitivity of detection of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 of 31.0%, 41.0% and 40.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Four months or more after acute infection, smell performance of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with mild or no symptoms is not fully recovered, whereby the ability to detect certain odors (strawberry, lemon and soap) is particularly affected, suggesting the possibility that these sensitivity to these smells may not only be lagging behind but may be more permanently affected.","Rebholz, H.; Pfaffeneder-Mantai, F.; Knoll, W.; Hassel, A.W.; Frank, W.; Kleber, C.",Am J Otolaryngol,162,1

Here, we provide a narrative review of potential factors influencing vitamin C status globally. The in vivo status of vitamin C is primarily affected by dietary intake and supplement use, with those who supplement having a higher mean status and a lower prevalence of deficiency. Dietary intake can be influenced by cultural aspects such as traditional cooking practices and staple foods, with many staple foods, such as grains, contributing negligible vitamin C to the diet. Environmental factors can also affect vitamin C intake and status; these include geographic region, season, and climate, as well as pollution, the latter partly due to enhanced oxidative stress. Demographic factors such as sex, age, and race are known to affect vitamin C status, as do socioeconomic factors such as deprivation, education and social class, and institutionalization. Various health aspects can affect vitamin C status; these include body weight, pregnancy and lactation, genetic variants, smoking, and disease states, including severe infections as well as various noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Some of these factors have changed over time; therefore, we also explore if vitamin C status has shown temporal changes. Overall, there are numerous factors that can affect vitamin C status to different extents in various regions of the world. Many of these factors are not taken into consideration during the setting of global dietary intake recommendations for vitamin C.","Carr, Anitra C.; Rowe, Sam",Nutrients,162,16

Research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between inequality at the societal level and the overall health and wellbeing of individuals within those societies. We believe that school health and physical education (HPE) has a significant role to play in addressing and acting on social inequities that impact on the wellbeing of both students and society as a whole. Based on the findings of an international research project called EDUHEALTH which explored pedagogies for social justice in school health and physical education (HPE) across Sweden, Norway and New Zealand, this paper aims to highlight the addressing of (in)equality and student wellbeing through HPE practice. In particular, the paper presents nine different but complementary pedagogies for social justice that we believe can improve individual, collective, and societal wellbeing. We conclude by proposing that, if adopted across a whole school curriculum, these nine pedagogies for social justice could form the basis of a holistic school-wide community approach aimed at improving both student and societal wellbeing.","Gerdin, Göran; Philpot, Rod; Smith, Wayne; Schenker, Katarina; Mordal Moen, Kjersti; Larsson, Lena; Linnér, Susanne; Westlie, Knut",Front Sports Act Living,162,33

Adenovirus transcription and splicing is especially complex. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to study adenovirus transcription and splicing during infection. This revealed a previously unappreciated complexity of alternative splicing and potential for secondary initiating codon usage. Moreover, we find that most viral transcripts tend to shorten polyadenylation lengths as infection progresses. Development of an open reading frame centric bioinformatics analysis pipeline provided a deeper quantitative and qualitative understanding of adenovirus’s genetic potential. Across the viral genome adenovirus makes multiple distinctly spliced transcripts that code for the same protein. Over 11,000 different splicing patterns were recorded across the viral genome, most occurring at low levels. This low-level use of alternative splicing patterns potentially enables the virus to maximise its coding potential over evolutionary timescales.","Donovan-Banfield, I’ah; Turnell, Andrew S.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Leppard, Keith N.; Matthews, David A.",Commun Biol,162,33

Also, drugs currently used to treat the COVID-19 may prolong the QT interval and may have a proarrhythmic propensity. The study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 infection with asymptomatic and mild symptoms on trans-myocardial repolarization parameters in children without treatment. A total of 105 COVID-19 patients were compared with 40 healthy children. The patient and control group data were compared by calculating the QT interval, corrected QT (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), QTc dispersion (QTcd), Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio on the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. The mean age was determined as 11.2 ± 0.3 years in the patient group, and 10.8 ± 2.1 years in the control group. In the COVID-19 group, QTd, QTcd, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were statistically higher than the control group.

Final-year medical students are one of the resources potentially available to expand the workforce. There is a need to explore the willingness of final-year medical students to meet this demand, examine their perceived competence, and determine how their overall perceived competence correlates with their willingness. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire was used. The questionnaire included demographic data, students’ self-perceived competence derived from the patient care theme of the Saudi Medical Education Directives (SaudiMED) framework, and their willingness to be measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The study targeted final-year medical students at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The number of participants was 134 (56.1% response rate), of whom 47 students (34.3%) were willing to work, while 31 (23.1%) were somewhat willing. The mean total self-perceived-competence score was 58.36/88 (66.3%). Demonstration of essential clinical skills had the highest mean score 11.48/16 (71.8%) among learning outcomes. There was a positive moderate correlation between willingness and mean perceived-competence score (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.45, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Fifty-seven percent of medical students were willing to work as part of the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Better overall self-perceived competence appeared to correlate with more willingness. Students perceive themselves to be more competent in essential clinical skills. Appropriate training and supervision are suggested in all tasks assigned to them, with additional care required in areas with a lower perceived competence, such as prescription writing and essential clinical procedures.","AlSaif, Haytham I; AlDhayan, Abdullah Z; Alosaimi, Majed M; Alanazi, Abdulrahman Z; Alamri, Mohammad N; Alshehri, Bader A; Alosaimi, Saif M",Int J Gen Med,162,8

The provision and supply of contraceptives, and a wide variety of sexual health, new-born, and maternal health services have been seriously affected. Thus, this scoping review mapped the available evidence on the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on sexual and reproductive health. Methods: Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework guided this scoping review. A search was conducted from the following databases: Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, WOS, and AJOL. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) chart and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist were used to document the review process. The McMaster critical review checklist was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Thematic analyses were conducted using NVivo version 12. Results: Three studies showed evidence on the impact of COVID-19 and family planning services, six studies reported on maternal and child services and eleven studies reported on sexual health (sexual behavior). Limited access to family planning use, reduction in multiple sexual partnership, decreased transactional sex, and maternal and child services disruption were some impacts reported in the included studies. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on family planning access, multiple sexual partnership, transactional sex, and disruption of maternal and child health services. Interventions that will consider the immediate availability of and access to all sexual and reproductive health services should be prioritized.","Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Ameyaw, Edward Kwabena; Saeed, Balsam Qubais; Hagan, John Elvis; Nwagbara, Ugochinyere Ijeoma",Healthcare (Basel),162,23

Neuro-oncological surgery units have peculiar features that make them highly relevant in the strategic reaction to the pandemic. In this Chinese Society of Neuro-Oncology (CSNO) initiated survey, we appraise the changes implemented in neuro-oncological surgery hospitals across different Asian countries and provide expert recommendations for responses at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a 42-question survey of the early experience of neuro-oncological surgery practice in hospitals across different Asian countries on April 1, 2020, with responses closed on April 18, 2020. RESULTS: 144 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Most were in WHO post-peak phase of the pandemic and reported a median reduction in neuro-oncological surgery volume of 25–50%. Most (67.4%) resumed elective surgery in only COVID-19 negative patients;11.1% performed only emergency cases irrespective of COVID-19 status;2.1% suspended all surgical activity. Ninety-one (63.2%) relocated personnel from neurosurgery to other departments. Fifty-two (36.1%) hospitals suspended post-operative adjuvant therapy and 94 (65.2%) instituted different measures to administer post-operative adjuvant therapy. Majority (59.0%) of the hospitals suspended research activity. Most (70%) respondents anticipate that current neurosurgery restrictions will continue to remain for > 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the respondents to our survey reported reduced neuro-oncological surgery activity, policy modification, personnel reallocation, and curtailment of educational/research activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistent widespread interruption of surgical neuro-oncology in even post-peak phases of the pandemic raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on neuro-oncological patients and highlights the essence of timely measures for pandemic preparedness, patient triage, and workforce protection.","Hameed, N.

These disruptions are expected to be of a large scale, such as the disaster of September 11, only 5% of the time; more often than not, disruptions are minor and on a much smaller scale. These smaller disruptions may be due to short-term power outages, fires, disk drive failures, or computer viruses. Regardless, the firm must make a plan based on a thorough analysis of all scenarios that may affect its normal working, and create and test contingency and recovery measures for such situations. This chapter discusses the salient parts of a BCP, which constitutes a strategy for recovering from sudden and unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities. Business continuity and disaster recovery became more important after the occurrence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, which led to widespread failure in financial systems. Developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan requires setting aside resources and treating the development of the plan as a project for the firm. Once the analysis has been conducted and strategies have been formulated, the plan must be tested using simulated emergency scenarios. These scenarios are also important when it comes to industry-wide testing, which has become more of a focus recently as firms in financial sectors across the world become more deeply interlinked. While it is crucial for each firm to have its own business continuity plan, it is just as important for the industry as a whole to protect its infrastructure, since systems of each firm are intricately linked together in an STP environment.","Khanna, Ayesha",Straight Through Processing for Financial Services,162,1

Thus, the world needs the fast recognition of appropriate drugs to restrict the spread of this disease. The global effort started to identify the best drug compounds to treat COVID-19, but going through a series of clinical trials and our lack of information about the details of the virus’s performance has slowed down the time to reach this goal. In this work, we try to select the subset of human proteins as candidate sets that can bind to approved drugs. Our method is based on the information on human-virus protein interaction and their effect on the biological processes of the host cells. We also define some informative topological and statistical features for proteins in the protein-protein interaction network. We evaluate our selected sets with two groups of drugs. The first group contains the experimental unapproved treatments for COVID-19, and we show that from 17 drugs in this group, 15 drugs are approved by our selected sets. The second group contains the external clinical trials for COVID-19, and we show that 85% of drugs in this group, target at least one protein of our selected sets.

We analyzed the geographical pattern of COVID-19 prevalence and mortality by the phase of national lockdown in India. Method: Using publicly available compiled data on COVID-19, we estimated the trends in new cases, period-prevalence rate (PPR), case recovery rate (CRR), and case fatality ratio (CFR) at national, state and district level. Findings: The age and sex are missing for more than 60 percent of the COVID-19 patients. There is an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases both at national and sub-national levels. The COVID-19 infected has jumped about 235 times ( from 567 cases in the pre-lockdown period to 1,33,669 in the fourth lockdown); the average daily new cases have increased from 57 in the first lockdown to 6,482 in the fourth lockdown; the average daily recovered persons from 4 to 3,819; the average daily death from 1 to 163. From first to the third lockdown, PPR (0.04 to 5.94), CRR (7.05 to 30.35) and CFR (1.76 to 1.89) have consistently escalated. At state-level, the maximum number of COVID-19 cases is found in the states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Gujarat contributing 66.75 percent of total cases. Whereas no cases found in some states, Kerela is the only state flattening the COVID-19 curve. The PPR is found to be highest in Delhi, followed by Maharastra. The highest recovery rate is observed in Kerala, till second lockdown; and in Andhra Pradesh in third lockdown. The highest case fatality ratio in the fourth lockdown is observed in Gujarat and Telangana. A few districts viz. like Mumbai (96.7); Chennai (63.66) and Ahmedabad (62.04) have the highest infection rate per 100 thousand population. Spatial analysis shows that clusters in Konkan coast especially in Maharashtra (Palghar, Mumbai, Thane and Pune); southern part from Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur), and the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir (Anantnag, Kulgam) are hot-spots for COVID-19 infection while central, northern and north-eastern regions of India are the cold-spots. Conclusion: India has been experiencing a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases since the second lockdown phase. There is huge geographical variation in COVID-19 pandemic with a concentration in some major cities and states while disaggregated data at local levels allows understanding the geographical disparity of the pandemic, the lack of age-sex information of the COVID-19 patients forbids to investigate the individual pattern of COVID-19 burden.

To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts a grave scenario of decreasing survival rates in various regions of India and shows variability in these rates by age and sex. In essence, we can safely conclude that the critical appraisal of the survival rate and thorough analysis of patient data in this study equipped us to identify risk groups and perform comparative studies of various segments in India.

Saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swabs can be collected safely without trained staff. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and SN swabs compared to NP swabs in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore. Methods We recruited 200 male adult subjects: 45 with acute respiratory infection, 104 asymptomatic close contacts, and 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each subject underwent NP swab, SN swab and saliva collection for RT-PCR testing at 1 to 3 timepoints. We additionally used a direct-from-sample amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow to establish phylogeny. Results Of 200 subjects, 91 and 46 completed second and third rounds of testing, respectively. Of 337 sets of tests, there were 150 (44.5%) positive NP swabs, 127 (37.7%) positive SN swabs, and 209 (62.0%) positive saliva. Test concordance between different sample sites was good, with a kappa statistic of 0.616 for NP and SN swabs, and 0.537 for NP and saliva. In confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, the likelihood of a positive test from any sample fell beyond 14 days of symptom onset. NGS was conducted on 18 SN and saliva samples, with phylogenetic analyses demonstrating lineages for all samples tested were Clade O (GISAID nomenclature) and lineage B.6 (PANGOLIN nomenclature). Conclusion This study supports saliva as a sensitive and less intrusive sample for COVID-19 diagnosis and further delineates the role of oropharyngeal secretions in increasing the sensitivity of testing. However, SN swabs were inferior as an alternate sample type. Our study also provides evidence that a straightforward next-generation sequencing workflow can provide direct-from-sample phylogenetic analysis for public health decision-making.","Teo, Alvin Kuo Jing; Choudhury, Yukti; Tan, Iain Beehuat; Cher, Chae Yin; Chew, Shi Hao; Wan, Zi Yi; Cheng, Lionel Tim Ee; Oon, Lynette Lin Ean; Tan, Min Han; Chan, Kian Sing; Hsu, Li Yang",,162,28

DESIGN: Prospective national population based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). SETTING: All 194 obstetric units in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of maternal hospital admission and infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, fetal loss, caesarean birth, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, and neonatal unit admission. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of admission to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 4.5 to 5.4) per 1000 maternities. 233 (56%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups, 281 (69%) were overweight or obese, 175 (41%) were aged 35 or over, and 145 (34%) had pre-existing comorbidities. 266 (62%) women gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 196 (73%) gave birth at term. Forty one (10%) women admitted to hospital needed respiratory support, and five (1%) women died. Twelve (5%) of 265 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of them within the first 12 hours after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The high proportion of women from black or minority ethnic groups admitted with infection needs urgent investigation and explanation.

This virus primarily affects the respiratory tract and causes lung injury characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not yet clear, the most widely accepted mechanism is systemic inflammation. A clinically significant effect of the inflammation is coagulopathy. As a result of this effect, patients are found to have a high risk of venous thromboembolism. Studies have reported a high incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the most updated evidence on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the coagulopathy of COVID-19. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for all in-patients with COVID-19. Those with a higher risk of developing thromboembolic events or who have already developed venous thromboembolism should be treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. We also discuss post-discharge prophylaxis for high-risk patients and some newly proposed treatments for the hypercoagulability that could improve the outcomes of the affected patients.","Hajra, Adrija; Mathai, Sheetal Vasundara; Ball, Somedeb; Bandyopadhyay, Dhrubajyoti; Veyseh, Maedeh; Chakraborty, Sandipan; Lavie, Carl J.; Aronow, Wilbert S.",Drugs,162,17

Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database for Covid-19 using the terms viral culture or viral replication and associated synonyms up to 10 September 2020. We carried out citation matching and included studies reporting attempts to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 matching with cutoffs for RT-PCR positivity. One reviewer extracted data for each study and a second reviewer checked end edited the extraction and summarised the narratively by sample: fecal, respiratory, environment, blood or mixed. Where necessary we wrote to corresponding authors of the included or background papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. This is the fourth version of this review that was first published on the 4th of August and updated on the 21t of August, on the 3rd and 10th of September. Results We included 29 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in samples producing live virus culture. Five studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT > 24 for no growth to Ct > 34 or more. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct > 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.","Jefferson, Tom; Spencer, Elizabeth; Brassey, Jon; Heneghan, Carl",,162,1

It is well known that Rac1 is a cytoskeleton regulation protein that regulates cell adhesion, morphology, and movement. Rac1 is highly expressed in different types of tumors, which is related to poor prognosis. Studies have shown that Rac1 not only participates in the tumor cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis, but also participates in the regulation of tumor stem cell, thus promoting the occurrence of tumors. Rac1 also plays a key role in anti-tumor therapy and participates in immune escape mediated by the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the good prospects of Rac1 inhibitors in cancer prevention and treatment are exciting. Therefore, Rac1 is considered as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

A growing need to provide effective and accessible services, with maximal population reach has stimulated demand for flexible and efficient service models. The implementation of evidence-based practice has been slow, leaving many services ill equipped to respond to requests for non-face-to-face delivery. To address this translation gap, and provide empirically derived evidence to support large-scale practice change, our study aimed to explore practitioners’ perspectives of the factors that enhance the delivery of a NICE-recommended psychological intervention, i.e. guided self-help by telephone (GSH-T), in routine care. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to analyse our data, identify essential behaviour change processes and encourage the successful implementation of remote working in clinical practice. METHOD: Thirty-four psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) from the UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services were interviewed. Data were first analysed inductively, with codes cross-matched deductively to the TDF. RESULTS: Analysis identified barriers to the delivery, engagement and implementation of GSH-T, within eight domains from the TDF: (i) Deficits in practitioner knowledge, (ii) Sub-optimal practitioner telephone skills, (iii) Practitioners’ lack of beliefs in telephone capabilities and self-confidence, (iv) Practitioners’ negative beliefs about consequences, (v) Negative emotions, (vi) Professional role expectations (vii) Negative social influences, and (viii) Challenges in the environmental context and resources. A degree of interdependence was observed between the TDF domains, such that improvements in one domain were often reported to confer secondary advantages in another. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple TDF domains emerge as relevant to improve delivery of GSH-T; and these domains are theoretically and practically interlinked. A multicomponent approach is recommended to facilitate the shift from in-person to telephone-based service delivery models, and prompt behaviour change at practitioner, patient and service levels. At a minimum, the development of practitioners’ telephone skills, an increase in clients’ awareness of telephone-based treatment, dilution of negative preconceptions about telephone treatment, and robust service level guidance and standards for implementation are required. This is the first study that provides clear direction on how to improve telephone delivery and optimise implementation, aligning with current mental health policy and service improvement.","Faija, Cintia L.; Connell, Janice; Welsh, Charlotte; Ardern, Kerry; Hopkin, Elinor; Gellatly, Judith; Rushton, Kelly; Fraser, Claire; Irvine, Annie; Armitage, Christopher J.; Wilson, Paul; Bower, Peter; Lovell, Karina; Bee, Penny",BMC Psychiatry,162,28

Wastewater based epidemiology is a powerful tool identifying disease spread from pooled community sewer networks or at influent to wastewater treatment plants. However, this approach is often not applied at a granular level that permits detection of local hot spots. This study examines the spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage through a spatial sampling strategy across neighborhood-scale sewershed catchments. Sampling was conducted across the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area from November to mid-December of 2020. This research utilized local spatial autocorrelation tests to identify the evolution of statistically significant neighborhood hot spots in sewershed sub-catchments that were identified to lead waves of infection, with adjacent neighborhoods observed to lag with increasing viral RNA concentrations over subsequent dates. The correlations between the sub-catchments over the sampling period were also characterized using principal component analysis. Results identified distinct time series patterns, with sewersheds in the urban center, outlying suburban areas, and outlying urbanized districts generally following unique trends over the sampling period. Several demographic parameters were identified as having important gradients across these areas, namely population density, poverty levels, household income, and age. These results provide a more strategic approach to identify disease outbreaks at the neighborhood level and characterized how sampling site selection could be designed based on the spatial and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods.","Haak, Laura; Delic, Blaga; Li, Lin; Guarin, Tatiana; Mazurowski, Lauren; Dastjerdi, Niloufar Gharoon; Dewan, Aimee; Pagilla, Krishna",Sci Total Environ,162,9

Nevertheless, the precise role of E1 in viral entry remains elusive. METHODS: To understand the involvement of the fusion peptide-like domain positioned at residues 264 to 290 within envelope glycoprotein E1 in HCV infection, mutants with Ala and Asn substitutions for residues conserved between HCV and E proteins of flaviviruses or the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and their effects on membrane fusion and viral infectivity were examined. RESULTS: None of these mutations affected the synthesis or cell surface expression of envelope proteins, nor did they alter the formation of a non-covalent E1-E2 heterodimer or E2 binding to the large extracellular loop of CD81. The Cys residues located at positions 272 and 281 were unlikely involved in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond formation. With the exception of the G267A mutant, which showed increased cell fusion, other mutants displayed reduced or marginally inhibited cell fusion capacities compared to the wild-type (WT) E1E2. The G267A mutant was also an exception in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/HCV E1E2 pseudotyping analyses, in that it showed higher one-cycle infectivity; all other mutants exhibited greatly or partially reduced viral entry versus the WT pseudotype. All but the G278A and D279N mutants showed a WT-like profile of E1E2 incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Since C272A, C281A, G282A, and G288A pseudotypes bound to Huh7 cells as effectively as did the WT pseudotype, the reduced infectivity of these pseudotypes was due to their ability to inhibit cell fusion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that specific residues, but not the structure, of this fusion peptide-like domain are required for mediating cell fusion and viral entry.","Li, Hsiao-Fen; Huang, Chia-Hsuan; Ai, Li-Shuang; Chuang, Chin-Kai; Chen, Steve SL",J Biomed Sci,162,1

However, the risk of nosocomial infection is unknown. METHODS: We examined exhaled air dispersion during NIV using a human patient simulator reclined at 45° in a negative pressure room with 12 air changes/h by two different helmets via a ventilator and a total facemask via a bilevel positive airway pressure device. Exhaled air was marked by intrapulmonary smoke particles, illuminated by laser light sheet, and captured by a video camera for data analysis. Significant exposure was defined as where there was ≥ 20% of normalized smoke concentration. RESULTS: During NIV via a helmet with the simulator programmed in mild lung injury, exhaled air leaked through the neck-helmet interface with a radial distance of 150 to 230 mm when inspiratory positive airway pressure was increased from 12 to 20 cm H(2)O, respectively, while keeping the expiratory pressure at 10 cm H(2)O. During NIV via a helmet with air cushion around the neck, there was negligible air leakage. During NIV via a total facemask for mild lung injury, air leaked through the exhalation port to 618 and 812 mm when inspiratory pressure was increased from 10 to 18 cm H(2)O, respectively, with the expiratory pressure at 5 cm H(2)O.

The study is based on mathematical model which is a modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The model takes death and recovery into consideration which in convenience is called the susceptible-infected-recovered-death (SIRD) model. The criterion for the recovered patients is assumed by COVID-19 nucleic acid testing negative. The mathematical model is constructed by retrospective study. Determination of the parameters in the model is based on the epidemic bulletin supplied by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) from Jan 16 2020 to Mar 5 2020. The data cover the date when the epidemic situation is reported and the data showed that the epidemic situation is almost under control in China. The mathematical model mainly simulates the active cases and the deaths during the outbreak of COVID-19. Then apply the mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situations in Italy and Spain, which are suffering the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. The determination of the parameters for the 2 European countries is based on the data supplied by Worldometers. By comparing the difference of the parameters based on the same mathematical model, it is possible to evaluate the different policies in different countries.

STUDY DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. A total of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or older were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. RESULTS: A total of 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature/fever) in the last 7 days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 h (defined as non-adherent). Men were more likely to be non-adherent, as were people who were less worried about COVID-19, and who perceived a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of government ‘lockdown’ measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19 and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.","Smith, L.E.; Amlȏt, R.; Lambert, H.; Oliver, I.; Robin, C.; Yardley, L.; Rubin, G.J.",Public Health,162,16

Among various foot pressure measurement techniques, in-shoe sensors are flexible and can measure the pressure distribution accurately. In this paper, we describe the design and characterization of flexible and low-cost multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)/Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based pressure sensors for foot pressure monitoring. The sensors have excellent electrical and mechanical properties an show a stable response at constant pressure loadings for over 5000 cycles. They have a high sensitivity of 4.4 kΩ/kPa and the hysteresis effect corresponds to an energy loss of less than 1.7%. The measurement deviation is of maximally 0.13% relative to the maximal relative resistance. The sensors have a measurement range of up to 330 kPa. The experimental investigations show that the sensors have repeatable responses at different pressure loading rates (5 N/s to 50 N/s). In this paper, we focus on the demonstration of the functionality of an in-sole based on MWCNT/PDMS nanocomposite pressure sensors, weighing approx. 9.46 g, by investigating the foot pressure distribution while walking and standing. The foot pressure distribution was investigated by measuring the resistance changes of the pressure sensors for a person while walking and standing. The results show that pressure distribution is higher in the forefoot and the heel while standing in a normal position. The foot pressure distribution is transferred from the heel to the entire foot and further transferred to the forefoot during the first instance of the gait cycle.","Rajendran, Dhivakar; Ramalingame, Rajarajan; Palaniyappan, Saravanan; Wagner, Guntram; Kanoun, Olfa",Sensors,162,26

METHOD: One hundred twelve parents of children diagnosed with cancer who received treatment at the Mother and Child Hospital of Málaga (Spain) were recruited. Data were gathered through self-reporting measures. The instrument used includes a questionnaire about socio-demographic variables, a questionnaire about parents' adjustment to the situation and a questionnaire about social support received and provided based on the different sources and types of support. RESULTS: There is a negative and significant relation between satisfaction with support received and provided and the magnitude of disruptions in parents' lives. CONCLUSION: Satisfaction with emotional support received from the partner and family, and support provided to these sources, relate to lower disruption in different areas of parents' lives. These results can have significant practical implications for the psychosocial care provided to parents of children with cancer.","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel; Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel; José Martos-Méndez, Mª; Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván",Integr Cancer Ther,162,30

One feature of this malaise is reduced alertness and this has been confirmed using subjective reports and objective measures of performance. Such effects have been obtained with both experimentally induced infections and in studies of naturally occurring illnesses. The mechanisms underlying the effects are unclear but possibly reflect effects of cytokines on the CNS which result in changes in neurotransmitter functioning that lead to reduced alertness. The malaise induced by these illnesses has many real-life consequences and activities such as driving and safety at work may be at risk.

The SafeCare programme aims to address this gap in quality of care, using a standards-based approach adapted to low-resource settings, involving assessments, mentoring, training, and access to loans, to improve clinical quality and facility business performance. We assessed the effect of the SafeCare programme on quality of patient care in faith-based and private for-profit facilities in Tanzania. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, health facilities were eligible if they were dispensaries, health centres, or hospitals in the faith-based or private for-profit sectors in Tanzania. We randomly assigned facilities (1:1) using computer-generated stratified randomisation to receive the full SafeCare package (intervention) or an assessment only (control). Implementing staff and participants were masked to outcome measurement and the primary outcomes were measured by fieldworkers who had no knowledge of the study group allocation. The primary outcomes were health worker compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) practices as measured by observation of provider–patient interactions, and correct case management of undercover standardised patients at endline (after a minimum of 18 months). Analyses were by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN93644888. FINDINGS: Between March 7 and Nov 30, 2016, we enrolled and randomly assigned 237 health facilities to the intervention (n=118) or control (n=119). Nine facilities (seven intervention facilities and two control facilities) closed during the trial and were not included in the analysis. We observed 29 608 IPC indications in 5425 provider–patient interactions between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018. Health facilities received visits from 909 standardised patients between May 3 and June 12, 2018. Intervention facilities had a 4·4 percentage point (95% CI 0·9–7·7; p=0.015) higher mean SafeCare standards assessment score at endline than control facilities. However, there was no evidence of a difference in clinical quality between intervention and control groups at endline. Compliance with IPC practices was observed in 8181 (56·9%) of 14 366 indications in intervention facilities and 8336 (54·7%) of 15 242 indications in control facilities (absolute difference 2·2 percentage points, 95% CI −0·2 to −4·7; p=0·071). Correct management occurred in 120 (27·0%) of 444 standardised patients in the intervention group and in 136 (29·2%) of 465 in the control group (absolute difference −2·8 percentage points, 95% CI −8·6 to −3·1; p=0·36). INTERPRETATION: SafeCare did not improve clinical quality as assessed by compliance with IPC practices and correct case management. The absence of effect on clinical quality could reflect a combination of insufficient intervention intensity, insufficient links between structural quality and care processes, scarcity of resources for quality improvement, and inadequate financial and regulatory incentives for improvement.

In this note, the primary structure of a new lectin KSL from this alga was elucidated by the rapid amplification method of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends, which consists of 267 amino acid residues distributed in four tandem-repeated domains of about 67 amino acids and sharing 43% of identity. The calculated molecular mass from the deduced sequence was consistent with that of natural KSL (27,826 Da) determined by electron spray ionization–mass spectrometry. The primary structure of KSL showed high similarity to those of the high mannose N-glycan specific lectins from marine red algae, ESA-2 from Eucheuma serra, EDA-2 from Eucheuma denticulatum, KSA-2 from Kappaphycus striatum, KAAs from Kappaphycus alvarezii and SfLs from Solieria filiformis, and from microorganisms, BOA from Burkholderia oklahomensis, MBHA from Myxococcus xanthus, OAA from Oscillatoria agardhii and PFL from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Furthermore, KSL showed anticancer effects against five carcinoma cell lines, HT29, Hela, MCF-7, SK-LU-1 and AGS, in a dose-dependent manner with the IC(50) values of 0.80–1.94 µM, whereas its inhibition activities on cancer cells were not detected in the presence of yeast mannan, an inhibitor against lectin KSL. The cultivated red alga K. striatus could also be a good source of functional lectin(s) for application as anticancer agents.

Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5′ direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.","Jacks, Tyler; Madhani, Hiten D.; Masiarz, Frank R.; Varmus, Harold E.",Cell,162,2

Setting and Patients. This study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure hospitalized in a tertiary Intensive Care Unit at Surrey Memorial Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measurements and Results. We did not find prior reports of PEPP following prolonged intubation in the literature. Four patients underwent a total of 13 PEPP sessions following liberation from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Each patient underwent a median of 3 prone sessions (IQR: 2, 4.25) lasting a median of 1.5 hours (IQR: 1.2, 2.1). PEPP sessions were associated with a reduction in median oxygen requirements, patient respiratory rate, and reintubation rate. The sessions were well tolerated by patients, nursing, and the allied health team. CONCLUSIONS: The novel practice of PEPP after liberation from prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is feasible and well tolerated, and may be associated with favourable clinical outcomes including improvement in oxygenation and respiratory rate and a low rate of reintubation.

Transplantation is fortunate to have large data sets upon which machine learning algorithms can be constructed. AI are now available to improve pretransplant management, donor selection, and post-operative management of transplant patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Changes in patient and donor characteristics warrant new approaches to listing and organ acceptance practices. Machine learning has been employed to optimize donor selection to identify patients likely to benefit from transplantation of higher risk organs, increasing organ discard and reducing waitlist mortality. These models have greater precisions and predictive ability than currently employed metrics including the Kidney Donor Profile Index and the expected posttransplant survival models. After transplant, AI tools have been developed to optimize immunosuppression management, track patients adherence, and assess graft survival. SUMMARY: AI and technology-enabled management tools are now available throughout the transplant journey. Unfortunately, those are frequently not available at the point of decision (patient listing, organ acceptance, posttransplant clinic), limiting utilization. Incorporation of these tools into the EMR, the Donor Net® organ offer system, and mobile devices is vital to ensure widespread adoption.","Schwantes, Issac R.; Axelrod, David A.",Curr Transplant Rep,162,24

After early reports of myocarditis during adverse events monitoring, the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated active surveillance. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data obtained from December 20, 2020, to May 31, 2021, regarding all cases of myocarditis and categorized the information using the Brighton Collaboration definition. We analyzed the occurrence of myocarditis by computing the risk difference for the comparison of the incidence after the first and second vaccine doses (21 days apart); by calculating the standardized incidence ratio of the observed-to-expected incidence within 21 days after the first dose and 30 days after the second dose, independent of certainty of diagnosis; and by calculating the rate ratio 30 days after the second dose as compared with unvaccinated persons. RESULTS: Among 304 persons with symptoms of myocarditis, 21 had received an alternative diagnosis. Of the remaining 283 cases, 142 occurred after receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine; of these cases, 136 diagnoses were definitive or probable. The clinical presentation was judged to be mild in 129 recipients (95%); one fulminant case was fatal. The overall risk difference between the first and second doses was 1.76 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 2.19), with the largest difference among male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (difference, 13.73 per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.11 to 19.46). As compared with the expected incidence based on historical data, the standardized incidence ratio was 5.34 (95% CI, 4.48 to 6.40) and was highest after the second dose in male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (13.60; 95% CI, 9.30 to 19.20). The rate ratio 30 days after the second vaccine dose in fully vaccinated recipients, as compared with unvaccinated persons, was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 5.02); the rate ratio was again highest in male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (8.96; 95% CI, 4.50 to 17.83), with a ratio of 1 in 6637. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of myocarditis, although low, increased after the receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine, particularly after the second dose among young male recipients. The clinical presentation of myocarditis after vaccination was usually mild.","Mevorach, Dror; Anis, Emilia; Cedar, Noa; Bromberg, Michal; Haas, Eric J; Nadir, Eyal; Olsha-Castell, Sharon; Arad, Dana; Hasin, Tal; Levi, Nir; Asleh, Rabea; Amir, Offer; Meir, Karen; Cohen, Dotan; Dichtiar, Rita; Novick, Deborah; Hershkovitz, Yael; Dagan, Ron; Leitersdorf, Iris; Ben-Ami, Ronen; Miskin, Ian; Saliba, Walid; Muhsen, Khitam; Levi, Yehezkel; Green, Manfred S; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Alroy-Preis, Sharon",N.

The safety of CQ and HCQ has been studied for over 50 years. In the current race against time triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the search for new antivirals is very important. However, consideration should be given to old drugs with known anti-coronavirus activity, such as CQ and HCQ; these could be integrated into current treatment strategies while novel treatments are awaited, also in light of the fact that they display an anticoagulant effect that facilitates the activity of low MW heparin, aimed at preventing ARDS-associated thrombotic events.

We compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years.

The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate. These findings would help authorities review the direction and efforts of the vector control strategy.","Ong, Song-Quan; Ahmad, Hamdan; Ngesom, Ahmad Mohiddin Mohd",bioRxiv,162,21

To identify risk factors associated with a worse outcome of COVID-19, a nationwide registry was developed for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort study has been designed as a quality of care registry and is executed by the Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium (DOCC), a nationwide collaboration of oncology physicians in the Netherlands. A questionnaire has been developed to collect pseudonymised patient data on patients’ characteristics, cancer diagnosis, and treatment. All patients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis or treatment in the past 5 years are eligible. RESULTS: Between March 27(th) and May 4(th), 442 patients were registered. For this first analysis, 351 patients were included of whom 114 patients died. In multivariable analyses, age ≥65 years (p<0.001), male gender (p=0.035), prior or other malignancy (p=0.045), and active diagnosis of haematological malignancy (p=0.046) or lung cancer (p=0.003) were independent risk factors for a fatal outcome of COVID-19. In a subgroup analysis of patients with active malignancy, the risk for a fatal outcome was mainly determined by tumour type (haematological malignancy or lung cancer) and age (≥65 years). CONCLUSION: The findings in this registry indicate that patients with a haematological malignancy or lung cancer have an increased risk of a worse outcome of COVID-19. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these vulnerable patients should avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2, whereas treatment adjustments and prioritizing vaccination, when available, should also be considered.","de Joode, K.; Dumoulin, D.W.; Tol, J.; Westgeest, H.M.; Beerepoot, L.V.; van den Berkmortel, F.W.P.J.; Mutsaers, P.G.N.J.; van Diemen, N.G.J.; Visser, O.J.; Oomen - de Hoop, E.; Bloemendal, H.J.; van Laarhoven, H.W.M.; Hendriks, L.E.L.; Haanen, J.B.A.G.; de Vries, E.G.E.; Dingemans, A.C.; van der Veldt, A.A.M.",Eur J Cancer,162,16

Such associations can be harnessed on behalf of the symbolic and economic value recently recognized as national cultural wealth. Further, the cultivation of impression management strategies about geographical origins is requisite for specialty food firms: terroir is a foundational convention of the gourmet food industry, and its potential value is significant. For entrepreneurial firms in the specialty food market, the process of strategically connecting to cultural wealth would seem to depend upon their particular geographic location. But while some national origins add both symbolic and economic value to cultural products within the global marketplace, others potentially threaten that value. In this paper, I read closely the discursive data contained on a nearly complete collection of two case study firms’ food packages (N = 100) to illustrate the firms’ unexpectedly divergent perceptions of cultural wealth, despite their identical national location. I further analyze interview data to describe the vital (and potentially valuable) interaction between producer perception, imagination, and cultural production.

There have been no published studies attempting to reduce DNA rates in breast clinics. We aimed to assess the impact of contacting patients prior to clinic attendance and Short Message Service (SMS) reminder on DNA rates in rapid access new patient breast clinics, evaluate ‘Could Not Attend’ (CNA) rate, and explore any correlation between age, sex, clinic days and sessions. METHODS: Initially, DNAs at the rapid access new patient breast clinic between 01/04/2018 and 31/03/2019 at a district general hospital in the North-West of England was assessed (Cycle 1). Changes were introduced in terms of contacting patients prior to offering appointments, followed by SMS reminders nearer the clinic dates. Subsequently, DNA was reassessed between 01/10/2019 and 31/03/2020 (Cycle 2). RESULTS: Following implementation of changes, DNA rate reduced from 8.2 to 4.1% (p < 0.00001). CNA rates were 0.9% (Cycle 1) and 1.1% (Cycle 2) [p = 0.36]. Evening clinics had the lowest DNA rates throughout. DNA patients in cycle 2 were significantly older than those in cycle 1 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Contacting patients prior to clinic appointments and sending SMS reminders helped reduce DNA rates significantly in rapid access new patient breast clinics. Scheduling clinic sessions with least DNA rates, such as evening clinics, should be contemplated. One should be cautious of mobile phone technology that conveys SMS, which can potentially disadvantage the older age group. This model could be considered across the board to improve DNA rates.","Kiruparan, Pasupathy; Kiruparan, Nanthesh; Debnath, Debasish",BMC Health Serv Res,162,32

As a result, it was possible to investigate the characteristics of healthy blood donors who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. We report the findings from all blood donations collected by the American Red Cross, representing 40% of the national blood supply covering 44 States, in order to characterize the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection among blood donors in the United States, prior to authorized vaccine availability. We performed an observational cohort study from June 15(th) to November 30(th), 2020 on a population of 1.531 million blood donors tested for antibodies to the S1 spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 by person, place, time, ABO group and dynamics of test reactivity, with additional information from a survey of a subset of those with reactive test results. The overall seroreactivity was 4.22% increasing from 1.18 to 9.67% (June-Nov 2020); estimated incidence was 11.6 per hundred person-years, 1.86-times higher than that based upon reported cases in the general population over the same period. In multivariable analyses, seroreactivity was highest in the Midwest (5.21%), followed by the South (4.43%), West (3.43%) and Northeast (2.90%). Seroreactivity was highest among donors aged 18-24 (Odds Ratio 3.02 [95% Confidence Interval 2.80-3.26] vs age >55), African-Americans and Hispanics (1.50 [1.24-1.80] and 2.12 [1.89-2.36], respectively, vs Caucasian).

Signal levels of antibody tests were stable over 120 days or more and there was little evidence of reinfection. Evaluation of a large population of healthy, voluntary blood donors provided evidence of widespread and increasing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and demonstrated that at least 45% of those previously infected were asymptomatic.

The recent global spread of COVID-19 has fostered diverse initiatives such as the ‘Safe Hands’ challenge led by the World Health Organization. Individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40–60 s under running water with soap. This call for ‘Safe Hands’ comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in Africa is heightened. In this article, Chitungwiza city in Zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the ‘Safe Hands’ challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face. To do so, interviews were conducted at water points/boreholes used by residents during Zimbabwe's COVID-19 national lockdown. The calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water-stressed regions to effectively implement ‘Safe Hands’. On average, it was established that one person consumes an extra 4.5 L per day of water when they practice WHO ‘Safe Hands’ in the context of COVID-19. This increases domestic water demand in Chitungwiza by 9%. Due to water scarcity, people in Chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing ‘Safe Hands’. With their ‘dry taps’ woes, they might not be able to meet the standards of this WHO challenge. Lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the ‘Safe Hands’ challenge. This paper proposes short- and long-term measures that would allow effective implementation of the ‘Safe Hands’ by means of sustainable potable water supply. These measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior. Municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships (PPPs) to create immediate and long-term water investments. Structural and transformational reforms would enhance, through flexible planning, investments for both water infrastructure and governance. This narrative has the potential to improve the urban water systems resiliency against future pandemics.","Zvobgo, Luckson; Do, Pierre",Water Res X,162,24

Interviews also identified enablers (e.g., social support) and barriers (e.g., health conditions) to achieving food security. Acknowledging the need for a multi-faceted approach that also addresses upstream determinants, interventions like NEST may play a role in promoting food security and food literacy.","West, Elisha G.; Lindberg, Rebecca; Ball, Kylie; McNaughton, Sarah A.",Nutrients,162,21

As a critical component of a subunit vaccine, the adjuvant is responsible for strengthening the antigen-induced immune responses. Here, we present a new nanovaccine that comprising the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of spike protein and the manganese nanoadjuvant (MnARK), which induces humoral and cellular responses. Notably, even at a 5-fold lower antigen dose and with fewer injections, mice immunized with the MnARK vaccine immunized mice showed stronger neutralizing abilities against the infection of the pseudovirus (~270-fold) and live coronavirus (>8-fold) in vitro than that of Alum-adsorbed RBD vaccine (Alu-RBD). Furthermore, we found that the effective co-delivery of RBD antigen and MnARK to lymph nodes (LNs) elicited an increased cellular internalization and the activation of immune cells, including DC cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Our findings highlight the importance of MnARK adjuvant in the design of novel coronavirus vaccines and provide a rationale strategy to design protective vaccines through promoting cellular internalization and the activation of immune-related pathways.","Wang, Yaling; Xie, Yuping; Luo, Jia; Guo, Mengyu; Hu, Xuhao; Chen, Xi; Chen, Ziwei; Lu, Xinyi; Mao, Lichun; Zhang, Kai; Wei, Liangnian; Ma, Yunfei; Wang, Ruixin; Zhou, Jia; He, Chunyan; Zhang, Yufang; Zhang, Ye; Chen, Sisi; Shen, Lijuan; Chen, Yun; Qiu, Nasha; Liu, Ying; Cui, Yanyan; Liao, Guoyang; Liu, Ye; Chen, Chunying",Nano Today,162,29

In the present study, we showed a suppression of PEDV infection in porcine jejunum intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) by an increase in autophagy. Autophagy was activated by rapamycin at a dose that does not affect cell viability and tight junction permeability. The induction of autophagy was examined by LC3I/LC3II conversion. To confirm the autophagic-flux (entire autophagy pathway), autophagolysosomes were examined by an immunofluorescence assay. Pre-treatment with rapamycin significantly restricted not only a 1 h infection but also a longer infection (24 h) with PEDV, while this effect disappeared when autophagy was blocked. Co-localization of PEDV and autophagosomes suggests that PEDV could be a target of autophagy. Moreover, alleviation of PEDV-induced cell death in IPEC-J2 cells pretreated with rapamycin demonstrates a protective effect of rapamycin against PEDV-induced epithelial cell death. Collectively, the present study suggests an early prevention against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells via autophagy that might be an effective strategy for the restriction of PEDV, and opens up the possibility of the use of rapamycin in vivo as an effective prophylactic and prevention treatment.","Ko, Seongyeol; Gu, Min Jeong; Kim, Cheol Gyun; Kye, Yoon Chul; Lim, Younggap; Lee, Ji Eun; Park, Byung-Chul; Chu, Hyuk; Han, Seung Hyun; Yun, Cheol-Heui",Antiviral Res,162,27

Shed β(2)-m is measurable in circulation, and various disorders are accompanied by increases in β(2)-m levels, including several viral infections. Therefore, we explored whether β(2)-m levels could also be elevated in Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and whether they predict disease severity. Serum β(2)-m levels were measured in a cohort of 34 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as in an approximately age-sex matched group of 34 uninfected controls. Mean β(2)-m level was 3.25±1.68 mg/l (reference range 0.8–2.2 mg/l) in patients (mean age 48.2±21.6) and 1.98±0.61 mg/l in controls (mean age 48.2±21.6). 17 patients (mean age 36.9± 18.0) with mean β(2)-m levels of 2.27±0.64 mg/l had mild disease by WHO severity categorization, 12 patients (mean age 53.3±18.1) with mean β(2)-m levels of 3.57±1.39 mg/l had moderate disease, and five patients (of whom 2 died; mean age 74.4±13.8) with mean β(2)-m levels of 5.85±1.85 mg/l had severe disease (P < = 0.001, by ANOVA test for linear trend). In multivariate ordinal regression β(2)-m levels were the only significant predictor of disease severity. Our findings suggest that higher β(2)-m levels could be an early indicator of severity of disease and predict outcome of Covid-19. As the main limitations of the study are a single-center study, sample size and ethnicity, these results need confirmation in larger cohorts outside the Arabian Peninsula in order to delineate the value of β(2)-m measurements. The role of β(2)-m in the etiology and pathogenesis of severe Covid-19 remains to be elucidated.","Conca, Walter; Alabdely, Mayyadah; Albaiz, Faisal; Foster, Michael Warren; Alamri, Maha; Alkaff, Morad; Al-Mohanna, Futwan; Nagelkerke, Nicolaas; Almaghrabi, Reem Saad",PLoS One,162,1

To give the answer, a simple numerical epidemic model is prepared to simulate an entire trend of various infection related variables considering vaccination campaign and simultaneous lockdown. The model is an extension of the deterministic physical model ATLM previously published by the authors that aims to predict an entire trend of variables in a single epidemic. The time series data of both vaccine dose ratio and lockdown period are employed in the model. Predictions have been compared with observed data in terms of daily new cases, isolated people, infectious at large and effective reproductive number and the model is verified. Moreover, parameter survey calculations for several scenarios have clarified a synergy effect of vaccination and lockdown have existed. In particular, it is suggested the key element of Israel success lies in a high dose rate of vaccination that avoids the onset of the rebound of daily new cases on the rescission of the lockdown.","Utamura, M.; Koizumi, M.; Kirikami, S.",,162,24

Of these, persons with subsequent visits were defined as re-engaged in care (RIC). Factors associated with becoming LTC and RIC were investigated. The risk of disease progression was estimated by comparing RIC with patients continuously followed. Over 11,285 individuals included, 3962 became LTC, and of these, 1062 were RIC. Older age, presentation with AIDS and with higher HIV-RNA were associated with a reduced risk of LTC. In contrast, lower education level, irregular job, being an immigrant and injecting-drug user were associated with an increased LTC probability.

Needle-free delivery of DNA using a CO(2)-powered Biojector® device was compared to delivery by needle and syringe and evaluated for safety and immunogenicity. METHODS: Forty adults, 18–50 years, were randomly assigned to intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, (weeks 0, 4, 8) by Biojector® 2000™ or needle and syringe (N/S) and boosted IM at week 24 with VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5) with N/S at 10(10) or 10(11) particle units (PU). Equal numbers per assigned schedule had low (≤500) or high (>500) reciprocal titers of preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: 120 DNA and 39 rAd5 injections were given; 36 subjects completed follow-up research sample collections. IFN-γ ELISpot response rates were 17/19 (89%) for Biojector® and 13/17 (76%) for N/S delivery at Week 28 (4 weeks post rAd5 boost). The magnitude of ELISpot response was about 3-fold higher in Biojector® compared to N/S groups. Similar effects on response rates and magnitude were observed for CD8+, but not CD4+ T-cell responses by ICS. Env-specific antibody responses were about 10-fold higher in Biojector-primed subjects. CONCLUSIONS: DNA vaccination by Biojector® was well-tolerated and compared to needle injection, primed for greater IFN-γ ELISpot, CD8+ T-cell, and antibody responses after rAd5 boosting.

The importance of each repetitive DNA type depends on many factors: structural and functional roles, positions, lengths and numbers of these repetitions are clear examples. Conserving such DNA sequences or not in different locations in the chromosome remains a challenge for researchers in biology. Detecting their location despite their great variability and finding novel repetitive sequences remains a challenging task. To side-step this problem, we developed a new method based on signal and image processing tools. In fact, using this method we could find repetitive patterns in DNA images regardless of the repetition length. This new technique seems to be more efficient in detecting new repetitive sequences than bioinformatics tools. In fact, the classical tools present limited performances especially in case of mutations (insertion or deletion). However, modifying one or a few numbers of pixels in the image doesn’t affect the global form of the repetitive pattern. As a consequence, we generated a new repetitive patterns database which contains tandem and dispersed repeated sequences. The highly repetitive sequences, we have identified in X and Y chromosomes, are shown to be located in other human chromosomes or in other genomes. The data we have generated is then taken as input to a Convolutional neural network classifier in order to classify them. The system we have constructed is efficient and gives an average of 94.4% as recognition score.","Touati, Rabeb; Tajouri, Asma; Mesaoudi, Imen; Oueslati, Afef Elloumi; Lachiri, Zied; Kharrat, Maher",Biomed Signal Process Control,162,16

Antibody testing is useful for diagnosing historic infections of a disease in a population. These tests are also a helpful epidemiological tool for predicting how the virus spreads in a community, relating antibody levels to immunity and for assessing herd immunity. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were recombinantly produced and used to analyse serum from individuals previously exposed, or not, to SARS-CoV-2. The nucleocapsid (Npro) and spike subunit 2 (S2Frag) proteins were identified as highly immunogenic, although responses to the former were generally greater. These two proteins were used to develop two quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that when used in combination resulted in a highly reliable diagnostic test. Npro and S2Frag-ELISAs could detect at least 10% more true positive coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases than the commercially available ARCHITECT test (Abbott). Moreover, our quantitative ELISAs also show that specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins tend to wane rapidly even in patients who had developed severe disease.

As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services. RESULTS: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded “understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition.” CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.","Horrell, Lindsey Nicole; Hayes, Sara; Herbert, Leslie Beth; MacTurk, Katie; Lawhon, Lauren; Valle, Carmina G; Bhowmick, Amrita",J Med Internet Res,162,1

METHODS Twenty abortion providers from independent abortion clinics throughout the US South and Midwest participated in semi-structured interviews in June and July 2020. Interviews explored the challenges of providing abortion care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought to identify how clinics strategized and amended their clinical practices to continue providing abortion care during this time. RESULTS All providers we spoke to noted significant challenges to providing abortion care in the early days of COVID-19. In addition to experiencing the same concerns as other health care institutions, abortion clinics also faced additional, unique burdens that can only be attributed to the politics of abortion exceptionalism. Examples of this abortion exceptionalism include abrupt orders to close clinics, the need to rely on traveling physicians, legislature-imposed limits on telemedicine, heightened activities of protesters, and non-evidence-based regulation of medication abortion.

Whereas ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients has been well described, data on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and August 14, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify eligible studies. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies describing ICH in 148 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5–0.9), with low levels of inter-study heterogeneity observed (I(2) = 33.6%, Cochran’s Q = 12.05, p = 0.149). Most of the patients were elderly male patients (65.8%) with comorbidities, the most common being systemic hypertension (54%). Hemorrhage involving multiple cranial compartments was reported in 9.5% of cases. Single compartments were involved in the rest, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) being the most common variety (62.6%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) the least common (1.4%). Half of these patients were on some form of anticoagulation. Overall, the mortality rate in the COVID-19 patients with ICH was about 48.6%. CONCLUSION: Although relatively uncommon among COVID-19 patients, ICH is associated with a high mortality rate. Early identification of patients at risk of developing ICH, particularly with comorbid conditions and on anticoagulant therapy, may be important to improve outcomes.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Sehmi, Prabjot; Ominde, Beryl; Bundi, Paul; Mislani, Musa; Ngure, Brian; Olabu, Beda; Ogeng’o, Julius A.",Neurol Sci,162,1

Fellows from responding programs were subsequently invited to share their perceptions about the impact of the pandemic on their training. RESULTS From 176 programs, 40 PDs responded (22.7%). From these 40 programs, fellows from 26 completed surveys (65.0% response). There was a reduction in EEG and epilepsy monitoring unit volumes post-COVID-19, with a trend of change for EMG, whereas continuous EEG volumes were mostly unchanged. The impact of the pandemic on training was rated as moderate to severe (≥50%) by 30.0% of PDs and 49.0% of trainees. In remarkable agreement, 20.0% of PDs and 20.4% of fellows believed that additional fellowship training was needed before graduation. Lack of fellow satisfaction was correlated with the perceived impact of the pandemic on education (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS This survey revealed a considerable impact on EEG/EMG clinical volume because of COVID-19, although continuous EEG was not as impacted. More fellows than PDs believed that training was considerably impacted by COVID-19, but a similar number thought that additional training was needed. It was unclear from this study whether the fellows' perception of educational impact was solely because of the pandemic or in addition to preexisting training deficiencies in the training programs.","Nakhleh, Lauren; Gavvala, Jay R; Haneef, Zulfi",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,162,22

METHODS: We searched all of the studies published between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020, on the cluster infections of COVID-19 in the English electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus. All included studies were independently screened and evaluated by two authors, and information of each study was extracted using a standard form. RESULTS: A total of 65 studies were included in this study which involved 108 cluster infections from 13 countries, areas or territories. Out of the cluster infections, 72(66.7%) were reported in China. The major types of cluster infections include family cluster, community transmission, nosocomial infection, transmission in gathering activities, on transportations, in shopping malls, on conference, among tourists, in religious organizations, among workers, in prisons, office, and in nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in various circumstances, and cluster infection plays important roles in the rapid evolution of COVID-19 transmission. Prevention and control measures such as social distance must be strictly implemented to contain the cluster infections.","Liu, Tao; Gong, Dexin; Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; He, Guanhao; Rong, Zuhua; Ma, Wenjun",Int J Infect Dis,162,1

However, when COVID-19 was first detected in Singapore in January 2020, the 12-h shift was introduced for better team segregation and deployment to meet the service needs of the Emergency Department. The 12-h shift consisted of the day (9am-9pm) and night (9pm-9am) shifts. While the 12-h shift is common to nursing practices, it is new to the radiography profession within the study centre. This study explores the radiographers' perspectives of the new shift and the impact of shift patterns on radiographers' wellness and work performance compared to the original three shift patterns. METHODS: A mixed-methods design study was adopted for this single-centre evaluation. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to radiographers who had experienced both shift types. Additionally, the number of radiographers who had taken sick leave, and images rejected and accepted from the X-ray consoles were retrospectively collected to measure the impact of the new shift. RESULTS: Radiographers experienced fatigue and appreciated the longer rest days associated with the 12-h shift. Additionally, the sick leave rates and image reject counts were more favourable with the 12-h shift pattern. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the extended shift hours are effective during a pandemic but may result in radiographer burnout during a prolonged outbreak. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Studying these variables will provide an effective starting point in understanding the efficacy and applicability of a 12-h shift system during pandemic periods.","Ooi, J.W.L.; Er, A.T.W.; Lee, W.C.; Chee, H.C.",Radiography (Lond),162,20

METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective, interventional study including 65 COVID-19 unit personnel. On a total of 196 serum samples (at least 2 serum samples for each HW), LFA and ELISA tests for SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM were performed. Also, 32 serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients at least 21 days before sampling, and 30 serum samples of patients obtained up to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak in China, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. FINDINGS: Of the 65 HWs enrolled, 6 were positive in LFA; overall, of the 196 serum samples, 20 were positive in LFA. All ELISA tests performed on serum samples collected from HWs were negative. The specificity of LFAs was 90.77% considering the 65 HWs and 89.80% considering all the 196 health workers serum samples analyzed. Considering the data on HWs, ELISA test for SARS-COV-2 antibodies showed a specificity of 100%, including all the 196 serum samples collected, and 100% including the 65 HWs. The ELISA and LFAs performed after 21 days last COVID-19 patient was discharged were all negative. CONCLUSION: LFAs compared to ELISA tests result in less specificity, considering COVID-19 negative personnel and patients. Thus, LFAs seem to be not adequate in the active surveillance of HWs.","Russo, Antonio; Calò, Federica; Di Fraia, Alessandra; Starace, Mario; Minichini, Carmine; Gentile, Valeria; Angelillo, Italo Francesco; Coppola, Nicola",Infect Drug Resist,162,17

However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems, and no empirical study has tested the mechanisms between them. METHODS: We conducted a survey in 31 provinces of China during 3–13 March 2020 to test the effect of the exposure level on mental health problems. Our sample comprised 2987 participants who reported their perceived threat, coping efficacy, mental health problems and other demographic variables. Multiple mediators path analysis was used in the data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the level of exposure to COVID-19 in China was negatively associated with mental health problems, which confirmed the “Psychological Typhoon Eye” effect. Further analyses indicated that both perceived threat and coping efficacy partially mediated the relationship between them. However, coping efficacy explained the “Psychological Typhoon Eye” effect. Perceived threat mediated the positive relationship between exposure level and mental health problems. CONCLUSION: This study detected the psychological typhoon eye effect and demonstrated the mediating role of coping efficacy and perceived threat between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems. Our findings suggest that policy makers and psychological workers should provide enough psychological services to low-risk areas as the high-risk areas. An important means of alleviating mental health problems is to improve coping efficacy.","Zhang, Li; Ma, Min; Li, Danfeng; Xin, Ziqiang",Global Health,162,28

However, other under-studied important biases are likely to impact clinical care as well. The goal of this study was to explore the presence of bias against people with physical disability among a heterogeneous group of healthcare workers and trainees and to evaluate the effect of implicit association testing and an educational module on this bias. METHOD: The study was composed of a one-hour web-based survey and educational module. The survey included an explicit disability bias assessment, disability Implicit Association Tests (IATs), demographic collection, and pre- and post- module clinical vignettes of prenatal patient scenarios. In addition to providing counseling to hypothetical patients, participants also indicated their personal preferences on genetic testing and termination. The educational module focused on the principles of patient-centered counseling. RESULTS: The collected data reflects responses from 335 participants. Within this sample, there were both explicit and implicit biases towards individuals with physical disabilities. Prior to the IAT and educational module, when respondents were tasked with providing genetic testing recommendations, implicit biases and personal preferences for genetic testing and termination influenced respondents’ clinical recommendations. Importantly, having previous professional experience with individuals with disabilities diminished biased clinical recommendations prior to the intervention. In response to the IAT and educational intervention, the effect of implicit bias and personal preferences on clinical recommendations decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates how bias against a marginalized group exists within the medical community and that personal opinions can impact clinical counseling. Importantly, our findings suggest that there are strategies that can be easily implemented into curricula to address disability bias, including formal educational interventions and the addition of professional experiences into healthcare professional training programs.","Vaimberg, Emma; Demers, Lindsay; Ford, Eric; Sabatello, Maya; Stevens, Blair; Dasgupta, Shoumita",PLoS One,162,16

Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5’UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3’UTR. Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3’UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. This analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cis-regulatory RNA structures or sequences, as rapidly emerging variations in these regions could lead to drug resistance.","Ryder, Sean P.; Morgan, Brittany R.; Massi, Francesca",bioRxiv,162,12

Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic.

In this study, we report a case of a 64-year-old Thai woman who presented with a lump in her left breast that was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. At the same time, a small nodule was found in her right breast, via imaging study, without any abnormal symptoms. A core needle biopsy of the right breast nodule revealed a filarial-like nematode compatible with the adult stage of Brugia sp. A molecular identification of the nematode partial mt 12rRNA gene and ITS1 suggested the causative species as closely related to Brugia pahangi, a zoonotic lymphatic filaria of animals such as cats and dogs. The sequence of the partial mt 12rRNA and ITS1 gene in this patient was 94% and 99% identical to the previously reported sequence of mt 12rRNA and ITS1 genes of B. pahangi. The sequence of ITS1 gene is 99% similar to B. pahangi microfilaria from infected dogs in Bangkok, which was highly suspected of having a zoonotic origin. As far as we know, this is the first case report of B. pahangi filariasis presented with a breast mass concomitantly found in a patient with invasive ductal carcinoma. This raised serious concern regarding the zoonotic transmission of filariasis from natural animal reservoirs.","Thongpiya, Jerapas; Sa-nguanraksa, Doonyapat; Samarnthai, Norasate; Sarasombath, Patsharaporn T.",Parasitol Int,162,16

The trauma and orthopaedic service has been compelled to alter working practices to respond proactively and definitively to the crisis. The aim of this study is to summarise the impact of this outbreak on the trauma and orthopaedic workload and outline the response of the department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data comparing patient numbers pre-COVID-19, and prospectively during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We have collected the numbers and nature of outpatient orthopaedic attendances to fracture clinics and elective services, inpatient admissions and the number of fracture neck of femur operations performed. RESULTS: The number of outpatient attendances for a musculoskeletal complaint to Accident and Emergency and the number of virtual fracture clinic reviews reduced by almost 50% during COVID-19. The number of face-to-face fracture clinic follow-ups decreased by around 67%, with a five-fold increase in telephone consultations. Inpatient admissions decreased by 33%, but the average number of fracture neck of femur operations performed has increased by 20% during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. CONCLUSION: We have noted a decrease in some aspects of the trauma and orthopaedic outpatient workload, such as leisure and occupational-related injuries but an increase in others, such as fracture neck of femurs. Many injuries have significantly reduced in numbers and we consider that a model could be developed for treating these injuries away from the acute hospital site entirely, thereby allowing the acute team to focus more appropriate major trauma injuries.","Faria, G; Virani, S; Tadros, BJ; Dhinsa, BS; Reddy, G; Relwani, J",Malays Orthop J,162,11

With very few success stories, the therapeutic targeting of this epidemic has been mainly attributed to main protease (Mpro), whilst Papain-like proteases (PLpro) also plays a vital role in the processing of replicase polyprotein. Multifunctional roles of PLpro such as viral polypeptide cleavage, de-ISGlyation and immune suppression have made it a promising drug target for therapeutic interventions. Whilst there have been a number of studies and others are on-going on repurposing and new-small molecule screening, albeit previously FDA approved drugs viz. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have only been found effective against this pandemic. Inspired by this fact, we have carried out molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies of FDA approved CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The end aim is to characterise the binding mode of CQ and HCQ and identify the key amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of action. Further, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were carried out with the docked complex to search for the conformational space and for understanding the integrity of binding mode. We showed that the CQ and HCQ can bind with better binding affinity with PLpro as compared to reference known PLpro inhibitor. Based on the presented findings, it can be anticipated that the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro may act as molecular target of CQ and HCQ, and can be projected for further exploration to design potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in the near future.","Patel, Dhaval; Athar, Mohd; Jha, P.

METHODOLOGY: Nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples were collected from vaccinated individuals through passive and voluntary reporting to various healthcare facilities of Odisha state to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection, quantitative antibody titers and was correlated with demographic and clinical presentation and requirement of hospitalization post infection. RESULT: A total of 274 samples were found to be positive after 14 days of receiving complete doses of the vaccines. More than 83.2% of the individuals were found to be symptomatic with 9.9% of those required hospitalization. The seropositivity in individuals receiving Covishield (96.7%) was significantly higher than in Covaxin (77.1%). Hospitalised patients were having less median antibody titers than individual in home isolation. The median age for breakthrough infection among the referred cases was 47.0 years (IQR: 28.0) with a significantly older age group among Covishield recipients.

While research interest on blended PT has greatly increased in the past years, the implementation of blended PT has lagged behind in German speaking countries. Also, due to the global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), blended PT and other online approaches seem to be more relevant than ever before. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to give an overview on the various forms of blended PT. Furthermore, the efficacy, the perspectives of patients and therapists as well as the topic of implementation are discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative review of the literature on the topic of blended PT. Important considerations and findings are classified and described based on a comprehensive search. RESULTS: Blended psychotherapy is a concept in need of definition. By taking inspiration from blended learning concepts, we propose that a definition of blended psychotherapy should consider different levels of blends and may also consider the transforming effect on face to face psychotherapy. In transforming blends face to face PT is fundamentally changed. For some forms of blended PT the effectiveness has already been confirmed but for others there is an urgent need for research. Compared to face to face PT and purely online therapy, blended psychotherapy could provide several advantages. CONCLUSION: The interest in blended PT is increasing among patients and therapists.

Human metapneumovirus is usually associated with mild upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children. Nevertheless, clinicians should recognize that this virus has recently emerged as a significant pathogen, particularly in adult patients with underlying conditions and the elderly population.","Rodriguez-Nava, Guillermo; Shrestha, Ekta; Upadhyay, Binayak; Morante, Aldo; Joseph, Deepa; Suhail, Aimen; Trelles-Garcia, Daniela Patricia; Yanez-Bello, Maria Adriana",IDCases,162,33
675756,675756,675756,COVID-19 progression in kidney transplant recipients: a single-center case series,15.946693,10.395584,2021-03-26,"Introduction: Vaccine inequality inflames the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring equitable immunization, vaccine empathy is needed to boost vaccine donations among capable countries. However, damaging narratives built around vaccine donations such as “vaccine diplomacy” could undermine nations’ willingness to donate their vaccines, which, in turn, further exacerbate global vaccine inequality. However, while discussions on vaccine diplomacy are on the rise, there is limited research related to vaccine diplomacy, especially in terms of its characteristics and effects on vaccine distribution vis-à-vis vaccine empathy. Thus, to bridge the research gap, this study aims to examine the defining attributes of vaccine diplomacy and its potential effects on COVID-19 immunization, particularly in light of vaccine empathy. Methods: A narrative review was conducted to shed light on vaccine diplomacy’s defining attributes and effects in the context of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and dissemination. Databases such as PubMed and Medline were utilized for literature search. Additionally, to ensure up-to-date insights are included in the review, validated reports and reverse tracing of eligible articles’ reference lists in Google Scholar have also been conducted to locate relevant records. Results: Vaccine empathy is an individual or a nation’s capability to sympathize with other individuals or nations’ vaccine wants and needs, whereas vaccine diplomacy is a nation’s vaccine efforts that aim to build mutually beneficial relationships with other nations ultimately. Our findings show that while both vaccine empathy and vaccine diplomacy have their strengths and weaknesses, they all have great potential to improve vaccine equality, particularly amid fast-developing and ever-evolving global health crises such as COVID-19. Furthermore, analyses show that, compared to vaccine empathy, vaccine diplomacy might be a more sustainable solution to improve vaccine donations mainly because of its deeper and stronger roots in multilateral collaboration and cooperation. Conclusion: Similar to penicillin, automated external defibrillators, or safety belts amid a roaring global health disaster, COVID-19 vaccines are, essentially, life-saving consumer health products that should be available to those who need them. Though man-made and complicated, vaccine inequality is nonetheless a solvable issue—gaps in vaccine distribution and dissemination can be effectively addressed by timely vaccine donations. Overall, our study underscores the instrumental and indispensable role of vaccine diplomacy in addressing the vaccine inequality issue amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its potentials for making even greater contributions in forging global solidarity amid international health emergencies. Future research could investigate approaches that could further inspire and improve vaccine donations among capable nations at a global scale to advance vaccine equity further.","Su, Zhaohui; McDonnell, Dean; Li, Xiaoshan; Bennett, Bindi; Šegalo, Sabina; Abbas, Jaffar; Cheshmehzangi, Ali; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Vaccines (Basel),162,22

While questions of vaccine allocation strategies have received significant attention, important questions remain regarding the potential impact of the vaccine given uncertainties regarding efficacy against transmission, availability, timing, and durability. METHODS: We adapted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the potential impact on hospitalization and mortality assuming increasing rates of vaccine efficacy, coverage, and administration. We also evaluated the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as the impact on outcomes based on the timing of distribution and the potential effects of waning immunity. FINDINGS: Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19; however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. In addition, earlier and accelerated implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. INTERPRETATION: Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission or distributed slower. In addition, the stage of the local outbreak greatly impacts the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in a region and should be considered when allocating vaccines.

This article points out that they are non-significantly negatively associated in other regression models, once omitted confounders (such as latitude and longitude) are included. More importantly, positive regression coefficients can and do arise when (generalized) linear regression models are applied to data with strong nonlinearities, including data on PM2.5, population density, and COVID-19 mortality rates, due to model specification errors. In general, statistical modeling accompanied by judgments about causal interpretations of statistical associations and regression coefficients – the current weight-of-evidence (WoE) approach favored in much current regulatory risk analysis for air pollutants – is not a valid basis for determining whether or to what extent risk of harm to human health would be reduced by reducing exposure.

This study aimed to examine risk factors for mental health problems among Israeli adults during this crisis. METHODS: A total of 204 participants took part in the study. They completed self‐report questionnaires assessing perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and various questions related to quarantine, pre‐existing health issues, and worries related to the virus. The study took place during the last two weeks of March 2020. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported relatively high levels of perceived stress and corona‐related worries, but low levels of anxiety. Female gender, younger age, corona‐related loneliness, and pre‐existing chronic illness were all related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: While considering the preliminary nature of these results, the current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the corona pandemic. Attention should be given to sociodemographic variables that were identified as related to psychological distress, as well as to the important role of loneliness, when screening and treating people during this crisis.

The act of intentionally causing one’s own death is often associated with lack of social support, thwarted belongingness, or chronic interpersonal difficulties. Therefore, suicide has a significant interpersonal dimension that can influence those left behind. However, studies that have investigated the impact of older adults’ suicide on their family are scarce. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of a qualitative research on the psychosocial experience of adults bereaved by the suicide of an elderly relative. This research could recruit three participants (daughter, grand-son, and grand-niece) who had lost to suicide a close family member aged between 75 and 90. The analysis of the content of the semi-structured interviews revealed seven main themes: (1) finding an explanation to the suicide, (2) give meaning to the loss, (3) the emotional processes of mourning, (4) the repercussions of the suicide on the individual and the family, (5) looking for support, (6) the taboo and secrecy of suicide, and (7) perceptions of aging and the end of life. To explain the suicide of their loved one, the bereaved mentioned various factors related to aging, such as loss of autonomy, illness, and fear of placement. Although the older relative was perceived to be approaching death because of his/her age, the suicide was still unexpected and shocking and led to various emotions (shock, anger, and guilt) and to family conflicts. Suicide remains a taboo subject, but the newly legalized medical assistance in dying is seen as a potential solution to suffering in old age. Further investigation is clearly needed on this topic and this pilot study indicates that the main difficulties will lie in the choice of selection criteria for participants and in the recruitment process.","Michaud-Dumont, Gabrielle; Lapierre, Sylvie; Viau-Quesnel, Charles",Front Psychol,162,8

However, the specific IFN regulated proteins responsible for the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 mutation are unknown. We show that the cell-lethal phenotype of ADAR1 deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells is rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the RNASEL gene or by expression of the RNase L antagonist, murine coronavirus NS2 accessory protein.

Amidst the growing number of infections and deaths, there has been an emphasis of patients with non-communicable diseases as they are particularly susceptible to the virus. The objective of this literature review is to systematize the available evidence on the link between non-communicable diseases and Covid-19. METHODS: We have conducted a systematic review of the literature on Covid-19 and non-communicable diseases from December, 2019 until 15th of November, 2020. The search was done in PubMed and in doing so we used a variety of searching terms in order to isolate the final set of papers. At the end of the selection process, 45 papers were selected for inclusion in the literature review. RESULTS: The results from the review indicate that patients with certain chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension (and other cardiovascular diseases), chronic respiratory illnesses, chronic kidney and liver conditions are more likely to be affected by Covid-19. More importantly, once they do get infected by the virus, patients with chronic illnesses have a much higher likelihood of having worse clinical outcomes (developing a more severe form of the disease or dying) than an average patient. There are two hypothesized channels that explain this strong link between the chronic illnesses enumerated above and Covid 19: (i) increased ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor expressions, which facilitates the entry of the virus into the host body; and (ii) hyperinflammatory response, referred to as “cytokine storm”. Finally, the literature review does not find any evidence that diabetes or hypertension related medications exacerbate the overall Covid-19 condition in chronic illness patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the evidence points out to ‘business as usual’ disease management model, although with greater supervision. However, given the ongoing Covid-19 vulnerabilities among people with NCDs, prioritizing them for the vaccination process should also figure high on the agenda on health authorities.

This study compared local outcomes of appendicitis during this period with a pre-COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: An observational study was conducted in a district general hospital. All episodes of appendicitis were prospectively studied from 25(th) March 2020 until 26(th) May 2020 and compared with a retrospective pre-COVID cohort from 27(th) November 2019 until 29(th) January 2020. Primary outcome was 30-day treatment failure of simple appendicitis for conservatively managed cases during COVID-19 compared to surgically managed cases pre-pandemic. Treatment failure was defined as any unplanned radiological or surgical intervention. RESULTS: Over nine weeks, there were 39 cases of appendicitis during COVID-19 and 50 cases pre-COVID-19. Twenty-six and 50 cases underwent appendicectomy during and pre-COVID-19 respectively. There was no difference in 30-day postoperative complication rates and nor were there any peri-operative COVID-19 infections.

Early detection, isolation, and treatment can significantly diminish time lost. Until recently, there has been a paucity of standardized guidelines outlining feasible, preventable measures to protect both athletes and staff from contagious illnesses. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative was to highlight optimal prevention practices for transmission mitigation, with a particular focus on hygiene activity and travel considerations in professional sporting organizations. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and peer-reviewed journals. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Communicable illness prevention strategies begin at the level of sufficient personal hygiene practices. Common area surface cleaning recommendations, including shared equipment sanitization between usage as well as designated equipment use to specific athletes, should be considered to minimize cross-contamination, in particular, for liked-position players. Intelligent design for shared areas can include redistributing the layout of communal spaces, most feasibly, spreading locker designation a minimum distance of 6 ft from one another. Travel considerations can include placing most susceptible passengers closest to window seating, boarding last and exiting first. Team physicians should have knowledge of essential personnel medical histories in an effort to risk stratify staff members and players in the setting of communicable disease. CONCLUSION: Providing a framework for illness management and prevention is important when considering the effects on player health, missed time, performance, and overall cost. Containment of commonly observed communicable illnesses can be optimized with sufficient personal hygiene practices, common area surface cleaning recommendations, intelligent design for shared areas, travel and hotel considerations, as well as appropriate screening tools and isolation techniques.

Nosocomial transmission needs to be prevented through the implementation of stringent screening and infection control measures. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome– coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs) post quarantine period. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational study conducted at a teaching University hospital in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia, during the period between May 1 and June 15, 2020. All (HCWs) joining work back from the quarantine areas had a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. The demographic and clinical data from the staff were collected. RESULTS: Of the 301 HCWs screened, 18 (6%) had positive PCR. The age means of the positive cases was 32.9 Y ± 8.7 compared to 33.8 Y ± 7.0 in the negatively tested group (p value = 0.90). Of the 18 PCR-positive HCWs, 7 (38.9%) were male. Majority of those who tested positive were trainees (8.2%) followed by nurses (5.1%). In PCR-positive group, a clear epidemiological exposure was found in 4/18 cases (22.2%). Male gender and residency in specific districts were observed more in the positive cases (p value = 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively). In regards to symptoms, most of the positive PCR tested HCWs (n=12, 66.7%) remained asymptomatic. Most prevalent initial symptoms were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) in six HCWs representing 33.3%. No significant difference was noted in co-morbidities reported by both groups. CONCLUSION: Health care workers tested post-quarantine period were found to be at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection despite very minimal or no known risks of exposure, where most of them were asymptomatic. This potentially carries risk of nosocomial transmission inside healthcare facilities. Implanting policies for routine post-quarantine screening for HCWs is recommended.","Alshahrani, Mohammed S; Alnimr, Amani; Alnassri, Samia; Alfarag, Sukyana; Aljehani, Yasser; Alabdali, Majed",J Multidiscip Healthc,162,16

The virus infects the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy, resulting in diarrhea and dehydration. Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein − through its S1 subunit − with the host cell receptor is the first step in infection and the main determinant for virus tropism. As for several other alphacoronaviruses including the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein was reported to be a functional receptor for PEDV. In this study we examined the role of APN as a receptor. We show that overexpression of porcine APN renders MDCK cells susceptible to TGEV, but not to PEDV. Consistently, unlike TGEV-S1, PEDV-S1 exhibited no binding to cell-surface expressed APN or to a soluble version of APN. Moreover, preincubation of these viruses with soluble APN or pretreatment of APN expressing ST cells with soluble TGEV-S1 blocked TGEV infection, but had no effect on infection by PEDV. The combined observations indicated that APN is not required for PEDV infection. To definitively prove this conclusion, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to knock out APN expression in PEDV-susceptible porcine (ST) and human cell lines (Huh7 and HeLa). As a consequence these cells no longer bound TGEV-S1 and HCoV-229E-S1 at their surface and were resistant to infection by the corresponding viruses. However, genetic ablation of APN expression had no effect on their infectability by PEDV, demonstrating that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry.","Li, Wentao; Luo, Rui; He, Qigai; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Bosch, Berend-Jan",Virus Res,162,9

Qualitative analysis showed that the teaching beliefs of the PSTs had shifted from the traditional view that SSI should not be covered in science education to embracing SSI teaching. Three illustrative cases were used to capture key learning experiences and explore how these had led to a change in beliefs over time. These cases explained how PSTs’ reflection on the why, what and how of teaching SSI to students can shape their beliefs about teaching SSI.

This paper’s main contribution to the literature concerns the theoretical foundation of MMT. A simple macroeconomic model shows that MMT is indistinguishable from the Keynesian cross model, as well as a neoclassical macroeconomic model, even when taking account of money in the sense of MMT. This result is in stark contrast to the claims of MMT proponents. Accordingly, it is asserted that MMT is a fundamentally new theory of money and monetary economics. However, MMT is admittedly based on the functional finance concept of the 1940s and money is modelled as an accounting identity. In addition, the fundamental connection between government expenditures for goods and services and the steady state equilibrium value of the national income, the so-called fiscal stance, is a well-known result that is not only consistent with MMT. The interpretation of the fiscal stance, in combination with the accounting identity for money, is a major issue because an equilibrium condition should have a certain causal direction of effects. Based on this reading of the equilibrium condition, policy recommendations encompass the fiscal dominance of monetary policy via monetization of public debt, a job guarantee by the state, along with a so-called Green New Deal. According to the results of this paper, these policy recommendations cannot be justified with MMT.

Here, we demonstrated that, among five accessory proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) tested, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 were capable of activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and significantly enhanced interleukin 8 (IL-8) promoter activity. Furthermore, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 expression in A549 cells enhanced production of inflammatory chemokines that were known to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest potential involvement of 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 proteins in the pathological inflammatory responses in SARS.","Kanzawa, Noriyuki; Nishigaki, Kazuo; Hayashi, Takaya; Ishii, Yuichi; Furukawa, Souichi; Niiro, Ayako; Yasui, Fumihiko; Kohara, Michinori; Morita, Kouichi; Matsushima, Kouji; Le, Mai Quynh; Masuda, Takao; Kannagi, Mari",FEBS Lett,162,10

An online questionnaire was utilised to gather data from 109 students enrolled in one of the universities in Indonesia. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the primary framework employed for analysis, in which system quality and e-learning experience were included as external constructs to seek out a much better model to improve the understanding of students’ intention to adopt e-learning. An extended TAM model was developed and tested in this study. The model consists of six constructs: system quality, e-learning experience, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward use, and behavioural intention. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and SMART PLS 3.0 software were applied for data analysis. The findings informed that the proposed model has been succefully explained factors university students use of e-learning during the pandemic in Indonesia. It suggested that attitude toward e-learning use was the most prominent construct to predict university students’ behavioural intention to use e-learning during the pandemic. Finally, this study offers recommendations for future research and practices.","Mailizar, Mailizar; Burg, Damon; Maulina, Suci",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),162,16

During organizational changes, employees may use job crafting to adjust to the changes in their work and protect their well-being and motivation, i.e., work engagement. However, research shows that although the effects of job crafting strategies that expand the design of work (approach job crafting) have been positive on work engagement, the effects of job crafting strategies that diminish the scope of work (avoidance job crafting) have often been negative. This study investigated the effects of the interactions between different job crafting strategies on work engagement, an aspect that has not thus far been studied. Specifically, we hypothesized that avoidance job crafting is not harmful for work engagement when it is conducted in combination with approach job crafting, particularly during times of organizational change. A two-wave, 18-month follow-up study was conducted among public sector workers who either experienced (n = 479) or did not experience (n = 412) changes in their work. Latent moderated structural equation modeling revealed that avoidance job crafting did not reduce work engagement when combined with approach job crafting behaviors. Moreover, job crafting best benefited work engagement when it was combined with these opposing strategies. However, job crafting was beneficial for work engagement only among employees who were affected by organizational changes, that is, among employees whose job design had changed. Practically, organizations implementing changes could encourage proactive job redesign approaches among their employees—particularly both approach and avoidance types of job crafting strategies.","Seppälä, Piia; Harju, Lotta; Hakanen, Jari J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,162,20

The elimination of this virus from our society needs proper attentions to follows the rule suggested by World Health Organization (WHO). A vast literature on the modeling of this infection in various perspective is available. In the present work, we design a new mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing the real infected cases reported from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initially, we formulate the model with the help of classical integer order nonlinear differential equations. The treatment class is considered the model to analyze the impact of treatment on the disease dynamics. The Caputo-Fabrizio derivative with the non-singular exponential kernel is applied in order to reformulate the proposed COVID-19 transmission model with a fractional order. The biologically important parameter called the basic reproductive number is investigated both theoretically and numerically. The estimated values of R 0 for the selected period are approximated to be 1.63 . Further, by making use of the Picard Lindelöf theorem we provide the existence and uniqueness of the COVID-19 fractional epidemic model. Moreover, the fractional model is solved numerically and a number of simulation results are depicted using the real estimated parameters. The impact of various model parameters and memory index are shown graphically. We conclude that the fractional order epidemic models are more appropriate and provide deep insights into the disease dynamics.","Alzahrani, Ebraheem; El-Dessoky, M. M.; Baleanu, Dumitru",,162,22

However, it needs nasopharyngeal swabs, expensive instruments and expertise. It even causes PCR errors. Methods We validated the antibody assay (Roche) in 36 followed patients and 1,879 controls (medical staffs). Results Of 1,879 medical staffs, only two (0.11%) were positive by Cut off Index (COI;1.0) (mean±SD, 0.094±0.047). Thirty six patients were composed of three groups; Group A,4 from Diamond Princess cruise ship, Group B, 2 infected in Africa, and Group C, 30 infected in Japan. PCR assays were conducted at outside laboratories before and repeated in house after hospitalized. Of 36 at admission, positive antibody was seen in 4/4 from the ship, 0/2 from Africa, and 5/30 from Japan. Two from Africa showed the increase of COI and became positive on days 8 and 13. Thirty Japanese was divided in two groups, e.g., 23 showed dynamic increase of COI up to 84.4 within 3 days while active virus replication present (Group C). In remaining 7 (7/30, 23%) (Group C’), no rise of antibody nor positive in house PCR assays, indicative of false positive results of PCR at the beginning. Conclusion This antibody testing has a wide dynamic ranges of COI and, thus, could be utilized in the early infection phase. This may also compliment and even help to avoid possible PCR errors. Therefore, this can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool, needed in the frontline of the clinic and hospitals.","Omata, Masao; Hirotsu, Yosuke; Sugiura, Hiroki; Maejima, Makoto; Nagakubo, Yuki; Amemiya, Kenji; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Miyashita, Yoshihiro",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,162,16

The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to ascertain FCV-19S effects on assessment of Japanese people's coping behavior. After back-translation of the scale, 450 Japanese participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing platform. These participants responded to the Japanese FCV-19S, the Japanese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the Japanese versions of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD), which assesses coping behaviors such as stockpiling and health monitoring, reasons for coping behaviors, and socio-demographic variables. Results indicated the factor structure of the Japanese FCV-19S as including seven items and one factor that were equivalent to those of the original FCV-19S. The scale showed adequate internal reliability (α = .87; ω = .92) and concurrent validity, as indicated by significantly positive correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety, r = .56; depression, r = .29) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD; perceived infectability, r = .32; germ aversion, r = .29). Additionally, the FCV-19S not only directly increased all coping behaviors (β = .21 - .36); it also indirectly increased stockpiling through conformity reason (indirect effect, β = .04; total effect, β = .31). These results suggest that the Japanese FCV-19S psychometric scale has equal reliability and validity to those of the original FCV-19S. These findings will contribute further to the investigation of various difficulties arising from fear about COVID-19 in Japan.","Wakashima, Koubun; Asai, Keigo; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Koiwa, Kohei; Kamoshida, Saeko; Sakuraba, Mayumi",PLoS One,162,1

The etiology of KD remains an enigma despite extensive research. Infections are considered to be one of the triggers for KD, especially in genetically susceptible hosts. KD occurring within a short time interval among siblings is an important clinical observation supporting this hypothesis. In addition, siblings of children with KD are at a higher risk of developing the disease as compared with other children. Screening for KD in febrile siblings, therefore, seems prudent. This would help initiate timely therapy and prevent complications. We briefly review 16 English language reports of KD in siblings diagnosed within 1 month of each other to highlight its etiological and therapeutic implications.","Banday, Aaqib Zaffar; Bhattacharya, Deepanjan; Pandiarajan, Vignesh; Singh, Surjit",Clin Rheumatol,162,21

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has been listed as an international public health emergency. Clinical first‐line nurses are at a high risk of infection, and they face a lack of experience and inadequate preparation for COVID‐19, leading to physical and psychological disorders. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from January to February, 2020 at a COVID‐19‐designated hospital in Wuhan, China. Thirty nurses were selected for the study using a purposive sampling method. Data were collected by semi‐structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Two main categories were defined in the study from the perspective of nurses: negative experiences during clinical first‐line work and positive impacts of clinical first‐line work. Under the first category, two subcategories were included: psychological experiences of clinical first‐line work and difficulties faced during clinical first‐line work. The analysis further yielded two subcategories for the second category: the needs of clinical first‐line work and the impact of clinical first‐line work on professional attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that success depends upon strengthening emergency training and knowledge of infectious diseases for nurses, providing adequate protective equipment, and improving the emergency response plans of hospitals for public health emergencies. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: It is believed that our findings will guide hospital managers to make improvements in personal, administrative, and institutional areas, and that they will provide a reference and inspiration for nurses with regard to public health emergencies in the future.","Tan, Rong; Yu, Ting; Luo, Kaiyan; Teng, Fen; Liu, Yilan; Luo, Jian; Hu, Deying",J Nurs Manag,162,14

This has led to a growing interest in disaster medicine. In this review, we report current evidence related to disasters and coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, such as cardiovascular diseases during disasters, management of disaster hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID‐19. This review summarizes the time course and mechanisms of disaster‐related diseases. It also discusses the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as a cardiovascular risk management strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. During the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, we used the “Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention” system that was employed for blood pressure (BP) monitoring and risk management using ICT. We introduced an ICT‐based BP monitoring device at evacuation centers and shared patients’ BP values in the database to support BP management by remote monitoring, which led to improved BP control. Effective use of telemedicine using ICT is important for risk management of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics in the future.","Narita, Keisuke; Hoshide, Satoshi; Tsoi, Kelvin; Siddique, Saulat; Shin, Jinho; Chia, Yook‐Chin; Tay, Jam Chin; Teo, Boon Wee; Turana, Yuda; Chen, Chen‐Huan; Cheng, Hao‐Min; Sogunuru, Guru Prasad; Wang, Tzung‐Dau; Wang, Ji‐Guang; Kario, Kazuomi",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),162,1

Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36; 95% CI: 1.63–33.14, p = 0.021). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of death related to COVID-19 and is triggered by a cytokine storm that damages the respiratory epithelium. Interleukins that cause the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, and, in particular, IL-17A and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), also play very important roles in lung damage in ARDS. Therefore, obesity is associated with an immune state favourable to a cytokine storm. Our hypothesis is that serum concentrations of TNF-α and IL-17A are more elevated in patients with obesity and COVID-19, and consequently, they have a greater probability of developing ARDS and death. The immunobiology of IL-17A and TNF-α opens a new fascinating field of research for COVID-19.","Leija-Martínez, José J.; Huang, Fengyang; Del-Río-Navarro, Blanca E.; Sanchéz-Muñoz, Fausto; Muñoz-Hernández, Onofre; Giacoman-Martínez, Abraham; Hall-Mondragon, Margareth S.; Espinosa-Velazquez, Dario",Med Hypotheses,162,1

Minimizing the spread of coronavirus and its economic consequences, and creating a new and safe lifestyle has now become the common goals of governments all over the world. Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. ‘Government’, ‘Foreign Governments’, ‘Organizations’, and ‘General Public’, as well as the interactions with ‘W.H.O’. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed. In total 1440 causal factors of the UCAs were identified, and 2880 requirements were proposed to avoid such unsafe interactions.","Chen, Shufeng; Khastgir, Siddartha; Jennings, Paul",Saf Sci,162,20

We searched, reviewed, and extracted online available reports on DENV in Sudan. Among 168 identified records, 19 were selected. Dengue infections were documented in 11/18 states. The overall seroprevalence of DENV in Sudan was estimated to be 27%, while the prevalence of dengue IgM was 22% and IgG was 38%. The prevalence of dengue estimated from community and hospital-based cross-sectional studies were 26% and 30% respectively. Additionally, one cohort study and a single PCR-based study reported a prevalence of 1% and 4%, respectively. Regional analysis revealed that the variation in seroprevalence in East, North, West, and Central Sudan was 23%, 24%, 36% and 43%, respectively. Interestingly, we found that DENV is circulating countrywide with a significant spatiotemporal variation in the disease seroprevalence. Furthermore, publications on dengue prevalence are temporally and geographically fragmented, perhaps due to limited resources. However, this gap in data and knowledge highlights the urgent need for a country-wide surveillance system and continued study of dengue burden in Sudan to accurately estimate the disease prevalence and determine the associated risk factors.","Elduma, Adel Hussein; LaBeaud, A.

The protocols to prevent the spread of this disease proved to be less effective than anticipated. In these circumstances, improvement of the existing triage system was felt and an AUDIO-VISUAL TRIAGE (AVT) system was introduced to enhance confidence as well as increase the safety of frontline healthcare professionals. The current analysis was performed from March 21, 2020, to April 28, 2020, until the completion of sixty response forms, at Bahria Town International Hospital, Lahore. Thirty participants (Group A) deployed on visual triage and other thirty (Group B) on AVT for screening suspected cases of COVID-19 infection. Anxiety levels were measured by using the GAD-7 scoring system and the participants of both groups were periodically tested for COVID-19 infection by PCR. Independent t-test was used to evaluate the significance of different variables at a confidence level of 95%. The result of the current study revealed the effectiveness of AVT for the screening of COVID-19 patients. There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in group A as compared to group B. Almost all participants in group A wanted to shift their place of work or ready to quit the job if they were forced to perform their duties at the same visual triage. AVT system for COVID-19 screening is proved to be better than visual triage.
