Every day, we, scientists, listen to the latest news with its promises and announcements. Across the world, a surge of clinical trials trying to cure or slow down the coronavirus pandemic has been launched to bring hope instead of fear and despair. One first proposed clinical trial has drawn worldwide hype to the benefit of chloroquine (CQ), in the treatment of patients infected by the recently emerged deadly coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We should consider this information in light of the long-standing anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties of CQ-related drugs. Yet, none of the articles promoting the use of CQ in the current pandemic evoked a possible molecular or cellular mechanism of action that could account for any efficacy. Here, given the interaction of viruses with macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a CQ-sensitive anti-viral safeguard pathway, we would like to discuss the pros, but also the cons concerning the current therapeutic options targeting this process.","Brest, Patrick; Benzaquen, Jonathan; Klionsky, Daniel J; Hofman, Paul; Mograbi, Baharia",Autophagy,969,16

369634,369634,369634,Deep vein thrombosis more than two weeks after vaccination against COVID-19,17.826283,13.729312,2021,"The growing quantity of public and private data sets focused on small molecules screened against biological targets or whole organisms provides a wealth of drug discovery relevant data. This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches. This study illustrates the steps needed in order to be ""quantum computer ready"" in order to apply quantum computing to drug discovery and to provide the foundation on which to build this field.","Batra, Kushal; Zorn, Kimberley M; Foil, Daniel H; Minerali, Eni; Gawriljuk, Victor O; Lane, Thomas R; Ekins, Sean",J. chem. inf. model,969,1

In spite of popular declarations that the virus is ‘the great equalizer’, there is considerable evidence that Covid-19 devastates along established systems of power, rights and values that organize the cultural practices of the everyday. This is especially visible in those who seek self-care from the anxieties of the pandemic, and how and why they seek such care. Driven by a combination of guilt and privilege, along with a deliberate misreading of Audre Lorde's notion of self-care as an act of political warfare, these words and their corresponding practices animate a hubristic right to the good life even at the end of capitalism. Given this, I ask how in the midst of mutating pathological social and political conditions and their corresponding discomforts, self-care and the search for joy have become imbricated in narratives of progressive politics.","Silva, Kumarini",Cultural Studies,969,23

A randomized controlled trial: The Ageing in a Networked Society-Social Experiment Study (ANS-SE),17.790277,2.3055475,2020,"BACKGROUND: The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is on the way. To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. RESULTS: A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD±79.2) [US$30.66 ± 18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP.","Wong, Li Ping; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Pooi-Fong; Lee, Hai Yen; AbuBakar, Sazaly",Hum Vaccin Immunother,969,24
