1968,1968,1968,Lack of Association between Toxocara Exposure and Suicide Attempts in Psychiatric Patients,16.319967,5.85832,2015-09-21,"Infection with Toxocara may affect the central nervous system. A high seroprevalence of Toxocara infection has been reported in psychiatric patients. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report about an association of Toxocara infection with suicide attempts. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Toxocara exposure is associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric patients. We studied 282 psychiatric outpatients (156 with suicide attempts and 126 without suicide attempts). Sera of patients were analyzed for the presence of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. One of the 156 (0.6%) suicide attempters and 1 (0.8%) of the 126 controls were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.04–13.02; P = 1.00). Toxocara seropositivity was significantly higher (P = 0.01) in male patients with consumption of raw dried goat meat than male patients without this consumption. Results suggest that Toxocara exposure is not associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric outpatients in Durango City, Mexico. However, further studies with larger samples sizes to confirm our results should be conducted. Too few patients were seropositive to assess further associations of Toxocara exposure with sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of the psychiatric patients.","Alvarado-Esquivel, Cosme; Hernández-Tinoco, Jesús; Sánchez-Anguiano, Luis Francisco",J Parasitol Res,330,1

Recent studies indicated that Cxc chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), an inflammatory chemokine, was associated with tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the role of the CXCL5/Cxc chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) bio-axis in ARDS, and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL/METHODS: The pathological morphology of lung tissue and degree of pulmonary edema were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and pulmonary edema score, respectively. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression levels of CXCL5, CXCR2, Matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2), and Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) in lung tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the expression levels of CXCL5 and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10) in serum. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema appeared in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS and were positively correlated with the severity of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 and its receptor CXCR2 were overexpressed by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 neutralizing antibody effectively alleviated inflammatory response, diffuse alveolar damage, and pulmonary edema, and decreased the expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 compared to LPS-induced ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CXCL5/CXCR2 accelerated the progression of ARDS, partly by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues with the release of inflammatory factors.","Wang, Chang-yong; Shang, Min; Zhou, Chen-liang; Feng, Li-zhi; Zhou, Qing-shan; Hu, Ke",Med Sci Monit,330,22
4526,4526,4526,Latest updates on COVID-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,16.336557,5.8737674,2020-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Novel methods are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients suffering from infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Being the most common infectious species of the Pseudomonas genus, P. aeruginosa is the primary Gram-negative etiology responsible for nosocomial infections. Due to the ubiquity and high adaptability of this species, an effective universal treatment method for P. aeruginosa infection still eludes investigators, despite the extensive research in this area. RESULTS: We report bacterial inhibition by iron-oxide (nominally magnetite) nanoparticles (NPs) alone, having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 16 nm, as well as alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs. Alginate capping increased the average hydrodynamic diameter to ~ 230 nm. We also investigated alginate-capped iron-oxide NP-drug conjugates, with a practically unchanged hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 232 nm. Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NPs, NP-tobramycin conjugates, and tobramycin alone were determined in the PAO1 bacterial colonies. Investigations into susceptibility using the disk diffusion method were done after 3 days of biofilm growth and after 60 days of growth. MIC of all compounds of interest was determined after 60-days of growth, to ensure thorough establishment of biofilm colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inhibition is reported for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs are presented. We report zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of cystic-fibrosis respiratory infections. We demonstrate that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetite–tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times. However, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought.","Armijo, Leisha M.; Wawrzyniec, Stephen J.; Kopciuch, Michael; Brandt, Yekaterina I.; Rivera, Antonio C.; Withers, Nathan J.; Cook, Nathaniel C.; Huber, Dale L.; Monson, Todd C.; Smyth, Hugh D.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute of North India, from June 2012 through March 2014, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. All enrolled children were assessed daily for development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) using the case definition given by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chest radiograph and microbiologic samplings were performed in children suspected to have VAP. Risk factors associated with VAP were calculated by doing bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were screened and 86 were enrolled (median age 30 mo 95% CI 4.0–84.0; 72% boys). The most common admitting diagnosis was sepsis (16%) followed by acyanotic congenital heart disease with pneumonia (14%) and the most common indication for ventilation was respiratory failure (45.3%). The incidence of VAP according to CDC criteria was 38.4%, while the incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 24.4%. The incidence of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was found to be 11.6%. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated organism (47%) followed by Pseudomonas (28%), Klebsiella (15%), E. coli (5%) and Enterobacter (5%). Risk factors for VAP on bivariate analysis were use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (p = 0.027, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1–24.3), enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1–19.4) and re-intubation (p = 0.024, OR 3.3 and 95% CI 1.1–9.6). On multivariate analysis, use of PPI (p = 0.03, OR 8.47, 95% CI 1.19–60.33) and enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.58–57.78) were identified as independent risk factors for VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator associated pneumonia is an important complication in children receiving mechanical ventilation in PICU and Gram negative bacilli (Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) being the important causative agents. Ventilator associated tracheobronchitis is an emerging entity; recognition and treatment of same might prevent the development of VAP.

Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 μl ml(−1)) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization. The immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation may play an important role in tick survival or in the transmission of tick-borne diseases in the field.","Inokuma, H.; Kerlin, R.L.; Kemp, D.H.; Willadsen, P.",Vet Parasitol,330,1

DESIGN: Prospective, observational pilot study. Forty-three infants <32 weeks gestation underwent echocardiography when routinely indicated. Study group included infants with hsPDA requiring treatment. Comparison groups included infants with nonsignificant PDA and infants without PDA. RESULTS: The study group (n = 13), compared with the comparison groups with nonsignificant PDA (n = 12) and without PDA (n = 18) had higher troponin levels (p = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). In infants with hsPDA compared with infants with no PDA there was a significant increase in myocardial oxygen demand and decrease in left main coronary artery flow, with nonsignificant increase in cardiac output. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease in coronary artery flows and higher troponin values may suggest a “steal effect,” not allowing to meet the elevated myocardial oxygen demand in infants with hsPDA.","Vaisbourd, Yulia; Sharif, Dawod; Riskin, Arieh; Yaniv, Liat; Dinur, Gil; Amen, Khalil; Bader, David; Kugelman, Amir",J Perinatol,330,31

However, individual cells from fibroblast cell lines have heterogeneous rhythms, oscillating independently and with different period lengths. Here we showed that heterogeneity in circadian period is heritable and used a multi-omics approach to investigate underlying mechanisms. By examining large-scale phenotype-associated gene expression profiles in hundreds of mouse clonal cell lines, we identified and validated multiple novel candidate genes involved in circadian period determination in the absence of significant genomic variants. We also discovered differentially co-expressed gene networks that were functionally associated with period length. We further demonstrated that global differential DNA methylation bidirectionally regulated these same gene networks. Interestingly, we found that depletion of DNMT1 and DNMT3A had opposite effects on circadian period, suggesting non-redundant roles in circadian gene regulation. Together, our findings identify novel gene candidates involved in periodicity, and reveal DNA methylation as an important regulator of circadian periodicity.","Li, Yan; Shan, Yongli; Kilaru, Gokhul Krishna; Berto, Stefano; Wang, Guang-Zhong; Cox, Kimberly H; Yoo, Seung-Hee; Yang, Shuzhang; Konopka, Genevieve; Takahashi, Joseph S",,330,22

However, most present filters are bulky, opaque, and show low‐efficiency PM(0.3)/pathogen interception and inevitable trade‐off between PM removal and air permeability. Here, a unique electrospraying–netting technique is used to create spider‐web‐inspired network generator (SWING) air filters. Manipulation of the dynamic of the Taylor cone and phase separation of its ejected droplets enable the generation of 2D self‐charging nanostructured networks on a large scale. The resultant SWING filters show exceptional long‐range electrostatic property driven by aeolian vibration, enabling self‐sustained PM adhesion. Combined with their Steiner‐tree‐structured pores (size 200–300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters exhibit high efficiency (>99.995% PM(0.3) removal), low air resistance (<0.09% atmosphere pressure), high transparency (>82%), and remarkable bioprotective activity for biohazard pathogens.

Moreover, the emerging global threat of antimicrobial resistance and lack of novel antimicrobials justify the implementation of judicious antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) in the ICU. However, even though the importance of ASP is generally accepted, its implementation in the ICU is far from optimal and current evidence regarding strategies such as de-escalation remains controversial. The limitations of clinical guidance for antimicrobial therapy initiation and discontinuation have led to multiple studies for the evaluation of more objective tools, such as biomarkers as adjuncts for ASP. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin can be adequate for clinical use in acute infectious diseases, the latter being the most studied for ASP purposes. Although promising, current evidence highlights challenges in biomarker application and interpretation. Furthermore, the physiological alterations in the critically ill render pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics crucial parameters for adequate antimicrobial therapy use.

Further, pEGFP-N1-EtSAG4-16-22 multiple gene plasmid carrying EtSAG4, 16 and 22 were designed as cocktail vaccines to study integral immunoprotective effects. Western blot and RT-PCR (reverse transcription) assay were performed to verify expressions of EtSAG16 and 22 genes. Immunoprotective effects of recombinant protein or DNA vaccine were evaluated using different doses (50 or 100 μg) in vivo. All chickens in the vaccination group showed higher cytokine concentration (IFN-γ and IL-17), raised IgY antibody level, increased weight gain, lower caecum lesion score and reduced oocyst shedding compared with infection control groups (p < 0.05). The highest anticoccidial index (ACI) value 173.11 was from the pEGFP-N1-EtSAG4-16-22 plasmid (50 μg) group.

16308,16308,16308,Invited Commentary,15.92826,5.7611766,2021-03-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Inflammation has been acknowledged as one of the causes of increased cancer risk. Among the pro-inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) has been identified as an important player in cancer progression and metastasis. On the other hand, TNFα has a central role in promoting innate and adaptive immune responses. These apparently controversial effects are now starting to be uncovered through different studies on TNFɑ isoforms and distinct mechanisms of action of TNFα receptors. The use of immunotherapies for cancer treatment such as monoclonal antibodies against cancer cells or immune checkpoints and adoptive cell therapy, are beginning to broaden our understanding of TNFα’s actions and its potential therapeutic role. This work describes TNFα participation as a source of treatment resistance and its implication in side effects to immunotherapy, as well as its participation in different cancer types, where TNFα can be a suitable target to improve therapy outcome. ABSTRACT: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a pleiotropic cytokine known to have contradictory roles in oncoimmunology. Indeed, TNFα has a central role in the onset of the immune response, inducing both activation and the effector function of macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and B and T lymphocytes. Within the tumor microenvironment, however, TNFα is one of the main mediators of cancer-related inflammation. It is involved in the recruitment and differentiation of immune suppressor cells, leading to evasion of tumor immune surveillance. These characteristics turn TNFα into an attractive target to overcome therapy resistance and tackle cancer. This review focuses on the diverse molecular mechanisms that place TNFα as a source of resistance to immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibodies against cancer cells or immune checkpoints and adoptive cell therapy. We also expose the benefits of TNFα blocking strategies in combination with immunotherapy to improve the antitumor effect and prevent or treat adverse immune-related effects.","Mercogliano, María Florencia; Bruni, Sofía; Mauro, Florencia; Elizalde, Patricia Virginia; Schillaci, Roxana",Cancers (Basel),330,1

Research is inconclusive about their association with rates of self-harm and assault. Existing studies have not considered variations in cannabis commercialization across states over time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of state medical and recreational cannabis laws with self-harm and assault, overall and by age and sex, while considering varying degrees of commercialization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a cohort design with panel fixed-effects analysis, within-state changes in claims for self-harm and assault injuries before and after changes in cannabis laws were quantified in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Comprehensive claims data on commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan beneficiaries from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2017, grouped by state and month, were evaluated. Data analysis was conducted from January 31, 2020, to January 21, 2021. EXPOSURES: Categorical variable that indexed the degree of cannabis legalization in each state and month based on law type (medical or recreational) and operational status of dispensaries (commercialization). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Claims for self-harm and assault injuries based on International Classification of Diseases codes. RESULTS: The analysis included 75 395 344 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 47 [22] years; 50% female; and median follow-up, 17 months [interquartile range, 8-36 months]). During the study period, 29 states permitted use of medical cannabis and 11 permitted recreational cannabis. Point estimates for populationwide rates of self-harm and assault injuries were higher in states legalizing recreational cannabis compared with states with no cannabis laws, but these results were not statistically significant (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] assault, recreational dispensaries: 1.27; 95% CI, 0.79-2.03;self-harm, recreational dispensaries aRR: 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Results varied by age and sex with no associations found except for states with recreational policies and self-harm among males younger than 40 years (aRR <21 years, recreational without dispensaries: 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11-2.61; aRR aged 21-39 years, recreational dispensaries: 1.46; 95% CI, 1.01-2.12). Medical cannabis was generally not associated with self-harm or assault injuries populationwide or among age and sex subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recreational cannabis legalization appears to be associated with relative increases in rates of claims for self-harm among male health plan beneficiaries younger than 40 years. There was no association between cannabis legalization and self-harm or assault, for any other age and sex group or for medical cannabis. States that legalize but still constrain commercialization may be better positioned to protect younger male populations from unintended harms.","Matthay, Ellicott C.; Kiang, Mathew V.; Elser, Holly; Schmidt, Laura; Humphreys, Keith",JAMA Netw Open,330,16

Limited adherence to long-term exercise given during physical therapy (PT) visits reduces the capacity of exercise to manage or improve symptoms related to chronic disease. In addition, a lower socioeconomic status negatively impacts exercise adherence. To mitigate this, apps that motivate people to exercise could be a viable option. Using an app through telehealth may help adults with chronic diseases to achieve long-term HEP adherence. However, because apps for rehabilitation are an emerging field, the feasibility of the app needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To address HEP adherence in participants with chronic diseases who are experiencing financial distress, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of and satisfaction with the Hudl Technique app and telehealth and satisfaction with PT care and to monitor HEP adherence and compliance (ie, percentage of participant-recorded videos sent) in participants using the app with telehealth compared with those using standard HEPs on paper. METHODS: We recruited patients scheduled for outpatient PT. We performed a randomized controlled trial in which the experimental group received weekly HEP demonstrations through app videos on a tablet with feedback on their self-recorded HEP video performance from the telehealth physical therapist. The control group received HEPs on paper without feedback, as is customary in PT practice. Demographic, clinical, and health coverage information was collected for screening and baseline measurements. Adherence and compliance were evaluated. Both groups completed surveys at 8 and 24 weeks on their satisfaction with PT care, and the experimental group also completed a survey on their satisfaction with the app with telehealth use. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics were used for within-group and between-group comparisons and analyzed with JMP, version 13. RESULTS: Overall, 45 adults with chronic diseases who were experiencing financial distress were randomized into experimental (23/45, 51%) and control (22/45, 49%) groups, with 74% (17/23) and 86% (19/22) participants completing the 24-week HEP, respectively. The experimental group had an HEP adherence frequency of 4 (SD 2) to 5 (SD 2) times per week at 8 and 24 weeks (P=.14), whereas HEP adherence decreased in the control group from 4 (SD 2) to 3 (SD 2) times per week (P=.07), with a significant difference (P=.01) between groups at 24 weeks. Of the total participants, 68% (15/22) sent videos. They sent 68% (16/24) of the requested number of videos on average. The average score for PT care satisfaction was maintained at 87% in the experimental group (P=.99), whereas it decreased from 89% at 8 weeks to 74% at 24 weeks (P=.008) in the control group. App-related adverse events were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Hudl app/telehealth platform is feasible for delivering HEPs and maintaining HEP adherence in participants with chronic diseases who are experiencing financial distress.

Current treatment modalities have limitations and either fail to solve the underlying pathophysiology or are highly invasive. To address these limitations, attention has focused on the use of biologics. The efficacy of these devices is attributed to presence of growth factors (GFs), cytokines (CKs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). With this in mind, we formulated a novel cell-free stem cell-derived extract (CCM) from human progenitor endothelial stem cells (hPESCs). A preliminary study demonstrated the presence of essential components of regenerative medicine, namely GFs, CKs, and EVs, including exosomes, in CCM. The proposed study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of the novel cell-free stem cell-derived extract (CCM) for the treatment of knee OA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, prospective study in which the safety and efficacy of intraarticular CCM in patients suffering from grade II/III knee OA will be evaluated. Up to 20 patients with grade II/III OA who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and screened to recruit 12 patients to receive treatment. The study will be conducted at up to 2 sites within the USA, and the 12 participants will be followed for 24 months. The study participants will be monitored for adverse reactions and assessed using Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Jr. (KOOS Jr.), 36-ietm short form survey (SF-36), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), physical exams, plain radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score for improvements in pain, function, satisfaction, and cartilage regeneration. DISCUSSION: This prospective study will provide valuable information into the safety and efficacy of intraarticular administration of cell-free stem cell-derived extract (CCM) in patients suffering with grade II/III knee OA. The outcomes from this initial study of novel CCM will lay the foundation for a larger randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial of intraarticular CCM for symptomatic knee OA.

This situation causes various problems, mainly while receiving health-care services. In planning the migrant health-care services, for the policy makers of host countries, health literacy level of migrants is an important measure. Determination of health literacy level of Syrian refugees in Turkey would be supportive for planning some interventions to increase health-care service utilization, as well as health education and health communication programs. An “original health literacy scale” for 18–60 years of age Turkish literate adults (Hacettepe University Health Literacy Scale-HLS) was developed to be used as a reference scale in 2018. Since it would be useful to compare the health literacy levels of Turkish adults with Syrian adult refugees living in Turkey with an originally developed scale, in this study, it was aimed to adapt the HLS-Short Form for Syrian refugees. METHODS: This methodological study was carried out between the years 2019–2020 in three provinces of Turkey where the majority of Syrians reside. The data was collected by pre-trained, Arabic speaking 12 interviewers and three supervisors via a questionnaire on household basis. At first, the original Scale and questionnaire were translated into Arabic and back translated into the original language. The questionnaire and the Scale were pre-tested among 30 Syrian refugees in Ankara province. A total of 1254 refugees were participated into the main part of the study; 47 health-worker participants were excluded from the validity-reliability analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. Cronbach’s alpha and Spearman–Brown coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: Of the participants, 52.9% was male; 26.1% had secondary education level or less; almost half of them had moderate economic level; 27.5% could not speak Turkish. The Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.75, Spearman–Brown Coefficient was 0.76; RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92 and GFI = 0.95 for the Scale. The Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.76, Spearman–Brown Coefficient was 0.77; RMSEA = 0.085, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91 and GFI = 0.95 for self-efficacy part. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the adapted HLS would be a reliable instrument to evaluate the health-literacy level of Syrian refugees living in Turkey and could allow for a comparison of the host country’s health literacy level to that of the refugees using the same scale.","Bahar Özvarış, Şevkat; Güçiz Doğan, Bahar; Konşuk Ünlü, Hande; Aktuna, Gamze; İnandı, Tacettin; Kurt, A.

Numerous methods have been developed to calculate YLL. OBJECTIVE: Prototypical methods for calculating YLL are presented and critically appraised. An improved method is proposed that is based on cause-elimination life tables (CELTs). METHODS: The different methods are applied to deaths in Germany in 2018. Changes in comparison to 1998 are presented using the modified method. RESULTS: While in 2018 cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death by number of cases, cancer was responsible for most YLL. Different methods of calculating YLL lead to divergent ranks for less frequent causes of death. YLL on the basis of general life tables underestimate CELT-based YLL by up to 18.4% (cardiovascular diseases). Measured by CELT-based YLL, cardiovascular diseases were the most important cause of death in 1998. CONCLUSION: The calculation of YLL on the basis of CELTs avoids inconsistencies of established methods and leads to relevantly different results. Characteristics of the proposed method (violation of the egalitarian principle, lack of additivity) do not affect its usefulness as a tool for health planning.","Hübner, Joachim; Mattutat, Johann; Katalinic, Alexander",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,330,3

In contrast to the cases when we know the distributions and can thus use Monte-Carlo simulations, processing such interval uncertainty is difficult – crudely speaking, because we need to try all possible distributions on this interval. Sometimes, the problem can be simplified: namely, for estimating the range of values of some characteristics of the distribution, it is possible to select a single distribution (or a small family of distributions) whose analysis provides a good understanding of the situation. The most known case is when we are estimating the largest possible value of Shannon’s entropy: in this case, it is sufficient to consider the uniform distribution on the interval. Interesting, estimating other characteristics leads to the selection of the same uniform distribution: e.g., estimating the largest possible values of generalized entropy or of some sensitivity-related characteristics. In this paper, we provide a general explanation of why uniform distribution appears in different situations – namely, it appears every time we have a permutation-invariant optimization problem with the unique optimum. We also discuss what happens if we have an optimization problem that attains its optimum at several different distributions – this happens, e.g., when we are estimating the smallest possible value of Shannon’s entropy (or of its generalizations).","Beer, Michael; Urenda, Julio; Kosheleva, Olga; Kreinovich, Vladik",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,330,16

The aim of this study was to demonstrate efficacy of prophylactic terlipressin infusion for prevention of vasoplegic syndrome in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blocker undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients on angiotensin II receptor antagonist [losartan] scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled into this prospective randomized controlled study. Anesthetic technique, surgical technique, and cardiopulmonary bypass management were standardized for all patients. With the start of rewarming, patients were randomized to receive either terlipressin infusion 1.3 μg.kg(−1).hour(−1), or normal saline infusion. Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome score was used as primary outcome. Hemodynamic parameters, inotropic score, and vasopressor dependency index were used as secondary outcome. RESULTS: Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome was significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group. Norepinephrine was required in 2 patients of terlipressin versus 15 patients of placebo group. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (81.7 ± 18.5 versus 69.3 ± 20.2 at 60 min after weaning from CBP). Cardiac index was significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (2.52 ± 1.48 versus 3.2 ± 1.55). Systemic vascular resistance was significantly higher in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (2438.09 ± 735.13 versus 1575.05 ± 753.54). Inotropic score and vasopressor dependency index were significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic terlipressin infusion could prevent development of vasoplegic syndrome in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonist undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Online public repositories have been one of the most popular ways for end users to obtain software, but there is a lack of systematic security evaluation of popular public repositories. In this paper, we bridge this gap by analyzing five popular software repositories. We focus on their software updating dynamics, as well as the presence of traces of vulnerable and/or trojanized applications among the top-100 most downloaded Windows programs on each of the evaluated repositories. We analyzed 2,935 unique programs collected in a period of 144 consecutive days. Our results show that: (i) the repositories frequently exhibit rank changes due to applications fast climbing toward the first positions; (ii) the repositories often update their payloads, which may cause the distribution of distinct binaries for the same intended application (binaries for the same applications may also be different in each repository); (iii) the installers are composed by multiple components and often download payloads from the Internet to complete their installation steps, posing new risks for users (we demonstrate that some installers are vulnerable to content tampering through man-in-the-middle attacks); (iv) the ever-changing nature of repositories and installers makes them prone to abuse, as we observed that 30% of all applications were reported malicious by at least one AV.","Botacin, Marcus; Bertão, Giovanni; de Geus, Paulo; Grégio, André; Kruegel, Christopher; Vigna, Giovanni","Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",330,1

Currently, commercially available base or sugar modified NTPs are mainly synthesized chemically. Since the chemical production of NTPs is time-consuming and generally inefficient, alternative approaches are under development. Here we present a simple, efficient and generalizable enzymatic synthesis method for the conversion of nucleosides to NTPs. Our one-pot method is modular, applicable to a wide range of natural and modified nucleotide products and accesses NTPs directly from cheap nucleoside precursors. Nucleoside kinases, nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases and a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase were applied as biocatalysts. Enzymes with different substrate specificities were combined to produce derivatives of adenosine and cytidine triphosphate with conversions of 4 to 26%. The implementation of a (deoxy)ATP recycling system resulted in a significant increase in the conversion to all NTP products, furnishing 4 different NTPs in quantitative conversion. Natural (deoxy)NTPs were synthesized with 60 to >99% conversion and sugar- and base-modified NTPs were produced with 69 to >99% and 27 to 75% conversion, respectively. The presented method is suitable for the efficient synthesis of a wide range of natural and modified NTPs in a sustainable one-pot process.","Fehlau, Maryke; Kaspar, Felix; Hellendahl, Katja F.; Schollmeyer, Julia; Neubauer, Peter; Wagner, Anke",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,330,17

The fact that the medical applications are numerous exposes the ozonetherapist to medical derision because superficial observers or sarcastic sceptics consider ozonetherapy as the modern panacea. This seems so because ozone, like oxygen, is a molecule able to act simultaneously on several blood components with different functions but, as we shall discuss, ozonetherapy is not a panacea. The ozone messengers ROS and LOPs can act either locally or systemically in practically all cells of an organism. In contrast to the dogma that “ozone is always toxic”, three decades of clinical experience, although mostly acquired in private clinics in millions of patients, have shown that ozone can act as a disinfectant, an oxygen donor, an immunomodulator, a paradoxical inducer of antioxidant enzymes, a metabolic enhancer, an inducer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and possibly an activator of stem cells with consequent neovascularization and tissue reconstruction.","Bocci, Velio",OZONE,330,1

The objective of this systematic review was to establish reference parameters of ventilator therapy used in the various levels of severity of adult patients affected by COVID-19 to assist health professionals and hospital managers who will purchase this equipment. METHODS: It used four databases: Medline, Cochrane Central, Scielo, and Pubmed. Restrictions applied as to the language, restricted to English, and to the patient’s profile, only adults affected by SARS-CoV-2. The review process was carried out by three independent reviewers using the PRISMA-P method. RESULTS: Nineteen articles were included, in addition to the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine (Brazil), Federal Commission for Protection against Health Risks (Mexico), Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK), Pan American Health Organization, and World Health Organization. The types of ventilatory therapies found in the articles eligible for this study were continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). For each ventilatory therapy, the parameters presented in the article and the recommendations of regulatory agencies and relevant institutions were compared and analyzed. CONCLUSION: It was possible to suggest a relationship between the respiratory support strategy adopted by the clinical team and the clinical conditions of the patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. The included studies used ventilation modes and parameters within the specifications and recommendations of relevant regulatory agencies and institutions. However, some minor differences were observed in the instruction presented among the agencies more related to the recommended ventilation modes.

However, little is known about the factors related to this impairment: no study focused on the role of gender-based effects of attachment styles and contamination symptoms. The Dual Control Model assumes three processes driving sexual arousal: sexual excitation (SE), sexual inhibition (SI) due to threat of performance failure, and SI due to threat of performance consequences (e.g., getting contaminated with sexually transmitted diseases). In a group of OCD patients, we hypothesized that (a) women report lower SE and higher SI than men; (b) patients with insecure (both anxious and avoidant) attachment styles show lower SE and higher SI; (c) attachment styles moderate the relation between gender and sexual arousal (respectively, for women, higher attachment anxiety, and for men higher attachment avoidance were related to impaired sexual arousal (higher SE and SI) controlling for OCD severity); and (d) contamination symptoms moderate the relation between gender and sexual impairment (women with contamination symptoms show impaired sexual arousal). Seventy-two OCD patients (37.50% women) completed the Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Attachment Styles Questionnaire and Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Excitation Scales. In contrast with our hypotheses, women reported higher SE and lower SI due to threat of performance consequences than men. Patients with higher attachment avoidance (discomfort with intimacy) but also confidence in self and others had higher SE. Women with attachment avoidance (i.e., discomfort with intimacy) had lower SE, while women with attachment anxiety (i.e., preoccupations with relationships) had higher SI due to negative performance consequences. Women with contamination symptoms had higher SI due to performance failure but lower SI due to performance consequences. The present preliminary findings suggest that sexual arousal impairment should be evaluated during the assessment of OCD patients, and gender-based effects of attachment styles and contamination symptoms should be considered during personalized treatment planning.","Dèttore, Davide; Angelo, Nicole Loren; Marazziti, Donatella; Mucci, Federico; Prestia, Davide; Pozza, Andrea",Front Psychiatry,330,10

To investigate the interactions of curcumin with one unit of the polymeric chain of surfactant F127, ethyl butyrate, and sodium octanoate, as well as the interaction between ethyl butyrate and one unit of the F127 polymer chain, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the M06-2X level of theory, were performed in water solution. The MTT assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of free and encapsulated curcumin on non-malignant and malignant cell lines. Combination effects were calculated according to Chou-Talalay’s principles. Results of in vitro studies indicated that MCF7 and HepG2 cells were more sensitive to curcumin microemulsions. Moreover, a synergistic relationship was observed between curcumin microemulsions and cisplatin in all affected fractions of MCF7 and HepG2 cells (CI < 0.9). For in vivo investigation, thioacetamide-intoxicated rats received thioacetamide (100 mg/kg Sc) followed by curcumin microemulsions (30 mg/kg Ip). Thioacetamide-intoxicated rats showed elevated serum liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, and a significant reduction in liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities (p < 0.05). Curcumin microemulsions reduced liver enzymes and serum creatinine and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes in thioacetamide-treated rats in comparison to the untreated thioacetamide-intoxicated group. Histopathological investigations confirmed the biochemical findings. Overall, the current results showed the desirable hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and anti-cancer effects of curcumin microemulsions.","Rahdar, Abbas; Hajinezhad, Mohammad Reza; Sargazi, Saman; Zaboli, Maryam; Barani, Mahmood; Baino, Francesco; Bilal, Muhammad; Sanchooli, Esmael",Nanomaterials (Basel),330,1

There is increasing evidence of a relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid disease possibly due SARS-COV-2 use of ACE2 and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which are highly expressed in the thyroid gland, to infect host cells.(1) Clinical Case: Patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism after presenting to PCP with tremor, palpitations, and weight loss with a TSH <0.02 mIU/L and FT4 6.86 ng/dL on day 0. No treatment was initiated and he was referred to outpatient endocrinology clinic. On day 2, he developed mild URI symptoms which improved by day 4. On day 5, he developed acute worsening of tremor, palpitations, and weakness and presented to the ED where he was febrile to 38.4 C, tachycardic to 161 BPM, and hypertensive to 139/91 mmHg. Initial laboratory evaluation was significant for TSH <0.02 mIU/L, FT4 6.64 ng/dL and COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test positivity. FT3 was >20.0 pg/mL and TRAB was 20.68 IU/L consistent with Graves’ disease. He met diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm with a score of 45 points using the Burch and Wartofsky scoring system based on the presence of thermoregulatory dysfunction (10 points), cardiovascular dysfunction (25 points) and precipitant history (10 points). Patient was admitted to a pediatric ICU and started on methimazole 20 mg every 8 hours, potassium iodide 250 mg every 8 hours, propranolol 40 mg every 8 hours, and hydrocortisone 50 mg every 8 hours with resolution of fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. He was noted to have left ventricular hypertrophy with progressive, asymptomatic ST elevation/nonspecific repolarization changes on electrocardiogram (ECG). Echocardiogram was normal. B-natriuretic peptide and serial troponin were normal. On day 6, inflammatory markers and coagulation studies were reassuring against concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

Additionally, the study analyzed the influence of gender on pharyngeal airway volume. (2) Methods: 80 CBCT scans of 40 male and 40 female patients (mean age: 15.38 + 1.10 years) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included. CBCT scans were evaluated for pharyngeal airway volume using the In Vivo Dental 5.1 software. Additionally, CBCT-derived lateral cephalograms were used to assess various craniofacial morphology parameters. To examine the influences of gender on airway volume, T-test was carried out. Correlation between airway volume and craniofacial parameters were measured using Pearson correlation followed by regression analysis. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean airway volume was significantly greater in males than in females. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between maxillary plane inclination and pharyngeal airway volume. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between mandibular length and lower molar inclination with oropharyngeal and total pharyngeal airway volume. Females showed a statistically significant positive correlation between the pharyngeal airway volume and sagittal position of maxilla and mandible; they also showed a negative correlation between oropharyngeal airway volume and the mandibular plane angle. Conclusions: Overall, the pharyngeal airway space differs significantly between males and females. Craniofacial morphology does have a significant effect on the pharyngeal airway, especially on the oropharyngeal airway volume.","Diwakar, Rohan; Kochhar, Anuraj Singh; Gupta, Harshita; Kaur, Harneet; Sidhu, Maninder Singh; Skountrianos, Helen; Singh, Gurkeerat; Tepedino, Michele",Int J Environ Res Public Health,330,10

Blunt eye injuries often destroy the tissue structure in the anterior part of the eye. Often there is detachment of the iris root, separation of the ciliary body, the angle of retraction of the chamber, and complete dislocation or subluxation of the lens. Ordinary ocular ultrasound can penetrate into opaque tissue, but because of its low resolution, it can only show its outline, which is still very small for doctors in assisting diagnosis. Ultrasonic biomicroscopy is a very real-time analysis, will not be affected by the refraction space, and has great application value for ocular trauma. Based on this, this article proposes the ultrasound biomicroscope diagnosis analysis and fine nursing research of traumatic anterior chamber injury based on intelligent virtual reality technology. This article describes literature methods, experimental analysis methods, and other methods, in-depth study of the causes of traumatic anterior injuries, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and other theoretical knowledge, ultrasound biomicroscopy and microcontrol experiments for traumatic anterior injury design, and finally the causes of eye damage. This study compares the pairing results of ultrasound biomicroscopy biological measurements, analyzes the relationship between anterior bleeding level and anterior ocular injury, and analyzes the outcome and extent of service ophthalmology. The angle retreat accounted for 52.17% in grade I, 72.22% in grade II, and 60% in grade III. Anterior bleeding can cause single or complex iris root detachment, iris root detachment, ciliary body detachment, and angular leakage. The more the bleeding, the more serious the eye damage.","Li, Xiaoli",J Healthc Eng,330,24

The bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes (DM) is already established. The associations of DM with a variety of virus infections have been reported previously. COVID-19 infection could be causally linked to new-onset of DM. We report 13 cases of new type of COVID-19 induced DM. While working in noncovid endocrine clinic we could notice 5 patients presented with fever and URI or osmotic symptoms or post URI cramps in legs. All 5 cases was having hyperglycemia with ketonuria and HbA1c more than 11% with fasting or premeal C peptide levels more than 10 ng/ml. All five patients have new onset DM and they are neither obese nor having family history of DM. Presentation includes fever with cough and/OR osmotic symptoms with hyperglycemia, weight loss in weeks. Out of five, in four patients either RT PCR OR Rapid Antigen Test was positive. One patient presented with cramps in legs with past history of URI without fever. In her COVID 19 IgG antibody was positive. All patients initially treated with insulin but on follow up they are controlled with metformin plus gliptin. All patients have HbA1c less than 6.7 on follow up at 3 months. We have retrospectively analysed data at COVID hospital. We have used inclusion criteria as1Not known diabetes 2Either RT PCR + ve OR COVID-19 Ag +ve OR HR CT SCAN show atypical pneumonia or COVID-19 Ab positive 3Presented as hyperglycemia RBG > 200 mg% 4HbA1c > 7 with Urine Ketones + Exclusion Criteria Received steroids in recent past <2 wk. Total 30 patients presented with hyperglycemia at admission in last one month (September). Out of these, 8 patients who are neither obese nor having family history of DM, nor received steroids in last 2 weeks. All 13 patients (5 + 8) are of new onset DM with BMI around 24, presented with ketonuria, with no family history of DM and who did not received steroids. Hence we propose COVID-19 can cause switch in metabolism to form new type of DM. There are case reports are published about COVID-19 induced DM with ketoacidosis. In another retrospective analysis of 658 COVID-19 patients, 42 presented with ketosis.(Am J Emerg Med 2020:S0735-6757(20)30488-5) Out of these 27 were newly diagnosed DM. But other features like BMI, family history of DM, C peptide levels, use of steroid are missing. We coined new type of DM which cause metabolic switch in metabolism leading to ketosis with HbA1c more than 11 & high normal C peptide requiring insulin initially but later controlled with metformin and gliptin with HbA1c less than 6.7!We further propose that genetic material of virus can cause switch in metabolism, then why should not we use other viral genetic material to reswitch leading towards cure of DM. Further research is needed in this direction.","Phatale, Hemant Nagnath; Nikalje, Anand; Phatale, Priti Hemant",J Endocr Soc,330,10

While much research focuses on understanding the role of personality-level traits for those who share the news, such as partisanship and analytic thinking, characteristics of the articles themselves have not been studied. Across two pre-registered studies, we examined whether character-deprecation headlines – headlines designed to deprecate someone’s character, but which have no impact on policy or legislation – increased the likelihood of self-reported sharing on social media. In Study 1 we harvested fake news items from online sources and compared sharing intentions between Republicans and Democrats. Results showed that, compared to Democrats, Republicans had greater intention to share character-deprecation headlines compared to news with policy implications. We then applied these findings experimentally. In Study 2 we developed a set of fake news items that was matched for content across pro-Democratic and pro-Republican headlines and across news focusing on a specific person (e.g., Trump) versus a generic person (e.g., a Republican). We found that, contrary to Study 1, Republicans were no more inclined toward character deprecation than Democrats. However, these findings suggest that while character assassination may be a feature of pro-Republican news, it is not more attractive to Republicans versus Democrats. News with policy implications, whether fake or real, seems consistently more attractive to members of both parties regardless of whether it attempts to deprecate an opponent’s character. Thus, character deprecation in fake news may in be in supply, but not in demand.","McPhetres, Jonathon; Rand, David G.; Pennycook, Gordon",Group Process Intergroup Relat,330,5

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) -based screening model employing deep convolutional neural network for lung involvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An AI-based screening model was developed with state-of-the-art neural networks using Indian data sets from COVID-19 positive patients by authors of CAIR, DRDO, in collaboration with the other authors. Our dataset was comprised of 1324 COVID-19, 1108 Normal, and 1344 Pneumonia CXR images. Transfer learning was carried out on Indian dataset using popular deep neural networks, which includes DenseNet, ResNet50, and ResNet18 network architectures to classify CXRs into three categories. The model was retrospectively used to test CXRs from reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proven COVID-19 patients to test positive predictive value and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 460 RT-PCR positive hospitalized patients CXRs in various stages of disease involvement were retrospectively analyzed. There were 248 males (53.92%) and 212 females (46.08%) in the cohort, with a mean age of 50.1 years (range 12–89 years). The commonly observed alterations included lung consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and reticular–nodular opacities. Bilateral involvement was more common compared to unilateral involvement. Of the 460 CXRs analyzed, the model reported 445 CXRs as COVID -19 with an accuracy of 96.73%. CONCLUSION: Our model, based on a two-level classification decision fusion and output information computation, makes it a robust, accurate and reproducible tool. Based on the initial promising results, our application can be used for mass screening.","Rao, Vishal; Priyanka, M. S.; Lakshmi, A.; Faheema, A. G.

Service experiences at the point of encounter can impact the consumption of these tourism services extensively. However, measuring the service experience at the point of service encounter becomes a bit difficult. The tourists who visit India often share their experiences immediately regarding their service encounter in social media. These tweets often have high sentiments and emotional content. In this study, we attempt to identify factors which impact customer service experience, at the point of service encounter, by mining social media discussions. After removing spurious tweets, 7,91,804 tweets were identified and analysed in this study. Factors such as accessibility, accommodation, assurance, cultural attraction, Jugaadu service flexibility, cleanliness, hospitality, price, restaurant, and security were identified using topic modelling, topic association mining, and sentiment analysis. We attempt to model these experiences and their drivers across five zones of India, namely North, South, East, West, and North-East India. Our inferential analysis highlights that the importance and impact of these factors differ significantly zone wise across India, which indicates high location specificity of factors which impact the customer service experience.

Hospitals endeavour to find sustainable solutions for a variety of challenges ranging from productivity enhancements to resource allocation. For instance, in the UK, evidence suggests that hospitals are struggling due to increased delayed transfers of care, bed-occupancy rates well above the recommended levels of 85% and unmet A&E performance targets. In this paper, we present a hybrid forecasting-simulation-optimisation model for an NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. Using the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset for A&E, outpatient and inpatient services, we estimate the future patient demands for each speciality and model how it behaves with the forecasted activity in the future. Discrete event simulation is used to capture the entire hospital within a simulation environment, where the outputs is used as inputs into a multi-period integer linear programming (MILP) model to predict three vital resource requirements (on a monthly basis over a 1-year period), namely beds, physicians and nurses. We further carry out a sensitivity analysis to establish the robustness of solutions to changes in parameters, such as nurse-to-bed ratio. This type of modelling framework is developed for the first time to better plan the needs of hospitals now and into the future.","Ordu, Muhammed; Demir, Eren; Davari, Soheil",Soft comput,330,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: SARS-CoV–2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Early epidemiological data has suggested that the primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets, but the presence of SARS-CoV–2 has been identified in other bodily fluids such as feces, urine, and semen. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV–2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11–64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV–2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV–2 test and semen collection was 37 days (IQR=23). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=53.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV–2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV–2(+) men (p = 0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: First, most of the semen samples came from non-severe men of whom were in the recovery stage and lacked symptoms. Additionally, our sample size was relatively small and overnight mail-in semen analysis kits were used during the acute phase of infection to minimize contact with positive subjects. Wider implications of the findings: Our findings suggest extremely low risk of viral transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproductive techniques, although further data need to be obtained. The impact on TSC in recovered men from SARS-CoV–2 infection is concerning, nevertheless long-term follow-up of these men is critical to determine the nadir of TSC.

This study aimed to measure and explore the perception of stigmatization and bullying towards COVID-19 patients in Jordan. This was a web-based cross-sectional survey. Participants were recruited from social media platforms employing a snowball convenience sampling. The perception of bullying, beliefs regarding social consequences of infection, views on measures towards violators of patients’ privacy, and how to reduce the stigma were assessed by self-reported measures. 397 participants returned completed questionnaires. The majority of respondents believed that COVID-19 patients in Jordan are getting bullied (n = 255, 64.3%) and over 80% believed that people enjoy sharing identities, or news about COVID-19 patients. Although most respondents had adequate knowledge regarding transmission/prevention of COVID-19, they believed that all or some of the COVID-19 patients practiced something wrong to get infected (n = 358, 90.2%). Moreover, 86.9% of respondents reported that people in Jordan were crossing their lines with bullying behaviors towards COVID-19 patients. However, these negative views would not discourage most respondents to get tested and follow the government’s instructions if they or any of their acquaintances were suspected to be infected. Our study sheds the light on a high degree of stigma and bullying of COVID-19 patients during the early stage of the pandemic in Jordan. Hence, there is a need to develop and implement effective anti-stigma/anti-bullying campaigns that refute the misperception, raise public knowledge about COVID-19, and spread encouraging messages.","Akour, Amal; AlMuhaissen, Suha A.; Nusair, Mohammad B.; Al-Tammemi, Ala’a B.; Mahmoud, Nouf N.; Jalouqa, Sarah; Alrawashdeh, Maissa N.",SN Soc Sci,330,1

COPD patients were grouped according to their methylation status of MALAT1 and miR-146a promoters, and we found that forced vital capacity, volume that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration, and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide were the highest in the MALAT1 HYPO + miR-146a HYPER group and lowest in the MALAT1 HYPER + miR-146a HYPO group, and COPD patients with hypermethylated MALAT1 showed lower expression of MALAT1 than that in the COPD patients with hypomethylated MALAT1. Meanwhile, miR-146a was the most significantly upregulated in the MALAT1 HYPER + miR-146a HYPO group and the most significantly downregulated in the MALAT1 HYPO + miR-146a HYPER group. Both prostaglandin E(1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression were the highest in the MALAT1 HYPO + miR-146a HYPER group and the lowest in the MALAT1 HYPER + miR-146a HYPO group. In conclusion, our results established a MALAT1/miR-146a/COX2 signaling axis. The overexpression of MALAT1 could increase the expression of COX2 by inhibiting the expression of miR-146a, thus affecting the pulmonary function of COPD patients.","Sun, Li; Xu, Aiqun; Li, Min; Xia, Xingyuan; Li, Pulin; Han, Rui; Fei, Guanghe; Zhou, Sijing; Wang, Ran",Front Cell Dev Biol,330,20

Telemedicine was the perfect choice worldwide to compensate for the deficiency of physical healthcare services. Limitations especially in the elderly population questioned the feasibility of the telegeriatrics model. AIM: To study the feasibility and acceptability of the AVH telemedicine model in geriatric patients. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study performed from April to October 2020 recruiting patients above 60 years receiving telemedicine services as part of the telemedicine program delivered via AVH. Data was collected via Google forms that were sent to the patients and physicians via Whats app. RESULTS: 1471 patients were triaged via the Whats app managed by geriatric consultants and 64 received video consultations. 849 patients responded to the surveys from all age groups of which 21.8% were above 60 years. From the responders 19.7% consulted geriatric medicine while the 2.1% consulted other specialties. Most satisfaction domains were 85% and above positive responses with an insignificant difference between age groups. 90% of physicians felt confident in their medical management using telemedicine. Conclusion: telegeriatrics is feasible as it is well accepted, easily used and preferred over clinic visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and after, by patients.

In this paper, we propose UPHED, a unified approach, which combines both the document and token centric event detection techniques in an unsupervised manner such that events which are: rare (aperiodic); reoccurring (periodic) can be detected using a generative model for the domain of public health. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach as well as its effectiveness for two real-world case studies with respect to the quality of document clusters. Our results show that we are able to achieve a precision of 60% and a recall of 71% analyzed using manually annotated real-world data. Finally, we also make a comparative analysis of our work with the well-established rule-based system of MedISys and find that UPHED can be used in a cooperative way with MedISys to not only detect similar anomalies, but can also deliver more information about the specific outbreak of reported diseases.","Fisichella, Marco",Int J Digit Libr,330,16

The ability to accurately and automatically assess fibre orientation of composite parts is a significant enabler in the goal to optimise the established processes within aftermarket aerospace industries. Incorrect ply lay-up results in a structure with undesirable material properties and as such, has the potential to fail under safe working loads. Since it is necessary to assure structural integrity during re-manufacture and repair assessment, the paper demonstrates a novel method of readily and non-destructively determining fibre orientation throughout multi-ply Biaxial woven composite laminates using point temperature contact sensors and data analysis techniques. Once cured, only the outermost laminates are visible to assess orientation. The inspection method is conducted visually, with reference guides to allow for rapid adoption with minimum training, as well as harnessing established temperature sensors within the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) environment. The system is amenable to integration within existing repair/re-manufacture processes without significant impact to process flow. The method is able to identify noisy samples with an accuracy, precision and recall of 0.9, and for synthetically created samples of double the cure ply thickness, a precision of 0.75, a recall of 0.7 and an accuracy of 0.87.","Gillespie, David I; Hamilton, Andrew W; McKay, Ewan J; Neilson, Brian; Atkinson, Robert C; Andonovic, Ivan; Tachtatzis, Christos",Sensors,330,16

However, after an initial period of hybridization, reproductive isolation can evolve through different processes and lead to the interruption of gene flow and the completion of the speciation process. Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide SNP data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.","Tonzo, Vanina; Papadopoulou, Anna; Ortego, Joaquín",Molecular ecology,330,1

Method We overview recent research about stuttering and social anxiety in the context of contemporary cognitive models of social anxiety disorder. That emerging evidence for self-focused attention and safety behavior use with those who stutter is considered in relation to current treatment approaches for stuttering: speech restructuring and social anxiety management. Results The emerging information about social anxiety and stuttering suggests a conflict between the two clinical approaches. For those clients who wish to control their stuttering and where speech restructuring is deemed the most suitable approach, it is possible that speech restructuring may (a) induce or increase self-focused attention, (b) promote the use of safety behaviors, and (c) become a safety behavior itself. This conflict needs to be explored further within clinical and research contexts. Conclusions The issues raised in this review article are complex. It appears that evidence-based speech treatment procedures are in conflict with current best-practice treatment procedures that deal with social anxiety. In this review article, we propose directions for future research to inform the development of improved treatments for those who stutter and recommendations for interim clinical management of stuttering.","Lowe, Robyn; Menzies, Ross; Onslow, Mark; Packman, Ann; O'Brian, Sue","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",330,1

Two mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 have received emergency use authorization by US FDA, conditional marketing authorization by EMA, as well as multiple additional national regulatory authorities. The simple composition of an mRNA encoding the antigen formulated in a lipid nanoparticle enables a fast adaptation to new emerging pathogens. This can speed up vaccine development in pandemics from antigen and sequence selection to clinical trial to only a few months. mRNA vaccines are well tolerated and efficacious in animal models for multiple pathogens and will further contribute to the development of vaccines for other unaddressed diseases.

METHODS A prospective longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in 14 hospitals in Sweden. Two-hundred-and-thirty-five women with EC were included; 116 underwent surgery that included lymphadenectomy (+LA) and 119 were without lymphadenectomy (-LA). Lymphedema was assessed objectively on four occasions; preoperatively, at 4-6 weeks, six months and one year postoperatively using systematic measurement of leg circumferences, enabling calculation of leg volumes, and a clinical grading of LLL, and subjectively by the patient's perception of lymphedema measured by a lymphedema-specific quality-of-life instrument. Lymphocyst was evaluated by vaginal ultrasonography. RESULTS After one year the incidence of LLL after increase in leg volume adjusted for body mass index was 15.8% in +LA women and 3.4% in -LA women. The corresponding figures for clinical grading were 24.1% and 11.8%, and for patient-reported perceived LLL 10.7% and 5.1%. The agreement between the modalities revealed fair to moderate correlation between patient-reported LLL and clinical grading, but poor agreement between volume increase and patient-reported LLL or clinical grading. Lymphocysts were found in 4.3% after one year. CONCLUSIONS Although the incidence of LLL and lymphocysts after surgery for EC including LA seemed to be relatively high the study demonstrated significant variations in incidence depending on the measurement modality. This emphasizes the need for a 'gold standard' of measurement of LLL in clinical practice and research.","Wedin, Madelene; Stålberg, Karin; Marcickiewicz, Janusz; Ahlner, Eva; Åkesson, Åsa; Lindahl, Gabriel; Kjølhede, Preben",Gynecologic oncology,330,16

A single-port access system with articulating arms and strong instrumentation should minimize these issues. The TransEnterix system may facilitate safe and straightforward single-port surgery. METHODS The TransEnterix single-port surgery system was used in both survival and nonsurvival porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomies under animal use committee approval. Nonsurvival procedures compared four standard laparoscopic with four single-port cholecystectomies from a histologic perspective. Five single-port swine laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures were completed in sterile conditions, and all animals survived for 1 week postoperatively. Standard surgical clips were used for both cystic duct and artery ligation. At sacrifice, both gross and microscopic histology were obtained for assessment of surgical complications. RESULTS All cholecystectomies were successfully completed with the TransEnterix single-port system. Operative time for the survival procedures averaged 39.4 (range 18-66) min. Histology of the acute specimens showed less inflammation at the single-port site compared with the trocar sites from the standard cholecystectomy. At sacrifice, no complications were identified. CONCLUSIONS The TransEnterix system is safe and straightforward for completing single-port cholecystectomy in this limited porcine series. Port site inflammation is reduced compared with standard laparoscopic trocars.","Pryor, Aurora D; Tushar, John R; DiBernardo, Louis R",Surgical endoscopy,330,1

To assess whether metabolic activity imaged by (18)F-FDG PET represents signs of disease activity as reflected by BAL, (18)F-FDG PET patterns were compared with BAL cell profiles. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, 77 newly diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis patients underwent BAL and (18)F-FDG PET. Based on (18)F-FDG PET, patients were diagnosed with exclusively mediastinal/hilar activity (group A) and activity in the lung parenchyma (group B). Per group, BAL lymphocytes (%), CD4/CD8 ratio, CD103(+)CD4(+)/CD4(+) ratio and neutrophils (%) were compared with the extent of metabolic activity expressed as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)). Additionally, SUV(max) and BAL parameters per radiographic stage were analysed. RESULTS Overall, the SUV(max) in the lung parenchyma correlated with neutrophils and SUV(max) of the mediastinum/hila correlated with the CD4/CD8 ratio. In both groups, a significant, negative correlation between the SUV(max) of the mediastinum/hila and the CD103(+)CD4(+)/CD4(+) ratio was found. In group B, the SUV(max) of the mediastinum/hila correlated with the CD4/CD8 ratio, while the SUV(max) in the lung parenchyma correlated with the CD103(+)CD4(+)/CD4(+) ratio and neutrophils. Significant differences were found in the SUV(max), CD4/CD8 ratio, CD103(+)CD4(+)/CD4(+) ratio and neutrophils between the radiographic stages. The SUV(max) of the lung parenchyma was positively related to the radiographic stage, while the SUV(max) of the mediastinum/hila and CD4/CD8 ratio were inversely related. CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET correlates with the CD4/CD8 ratio and neutrophils, suggesting that (18)F-FDG PET represents this specific cell profile in BAL. High SUV(max) values of the lung parenchyma may therefore correlate with more severe parenchymal involvement, particularly when accompanied by a low SUV(max) of the mediastinum/hila.","Keijsers, Ruth G; Grutters, Jan C; van Velzen-Blad, Heleen; van den Bosch, Jules M; Oyen, Wim J; Verzijlbergen, Fred J",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,330,29

METHODS In this retrospective study, 1202 patients' medical records after CABG were evaluated by a research-made checklist. Tarone-Ware test was used to determine the predictors of patients' LOS in the ICU. Cox regression model was used to determine the risk factors and risk ratios associated with ICU LOS. RESULTS The mean ICU LOS after CABG was 55.27±17.33 hours. Cox regression model showed that having more than two chest tubes (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.005-1.287, Relative Risk [RR]=1.138), occurrence of atelectasis (95% CI 1.000-3.007, RR=1.734), and occurrence of atrial fibrillation after CABG (95% CI 1.428-2.424, RR=1.861) were risk factors associated with longer ICU LOS. The discrimination power of this set of predictors was demonstrated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and it was 0.69. A simple risk scoring system was developed based on three identified predictors that can raise ICU LOS. CONCLUSION The simple risk scoring system developed based on three identified predictors can help to plan more accurately a patient's LOS in hospital for CABG and can be useful in managing human and financial resources.","Zarrizi, Maryam; Paryad, Ezzat; Khanghah, Atefeh Ghanbari; Leili, Ehsan Kazemnezhad; Faghani, Hamed",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,330,1

Here we investigated the roles and possible targets of circulating microRNA-223 in human ischemic stroke within the first 72 hours. METHODS Blood samples were collected from patients within 72 hours after cerebral ischemia (n = 79) and compared with healthy control samples (n = 75). The level of possible downstream factors of microRNA-223 including insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and interleukin-6 was examined by ELISA assay. The relationship between the microRNA-223 level and NIHSS scores, TOAST subtypes, and infarct volume was analyzed respectively. In addition, twelve adult male CD-1 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion using the suture technique. Circulating blood and brain tissue in the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere were collected at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. microRNA-223 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reactions. RESULTS microRNA-223 levels in the circulating blood of acute ischemic stroke patients were greatly increased compared to the control (p < 0.05). microRNA-223, which were negatively correlated with NIHSS scores (r = -0.531, p < 0.01) and infarct volume (r = -0.265, p = 0.039), was significantly up-regulated in large artery and small artery strokes. The plasma level of insulin-like growth factor-1 was positively associated with that of microRNA-223 (r = 0.205, p = 0.022). Moreover, microRNA-223 in blood and brain were positively correlated (r = 0.834, p < 0.05), and they were up-regulated significantly in mice that underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that microRNA-223 is associated with acute ischemic stroke and possibly plays a role in stroke through up-regulating growth factor such as insulin-like growth factor-1 gene.","Wang, Yang; Zhang, Yu; Huang, Jun; Chen, Xiaoyan; Gu, Xiang; Wang, Yongting; Zeng, Lili; Yang, Guo-Yuan",BMC neurology,330,19

No study to date has assessed whether a priori defined covariates; type of hospital setting and year of study publication, influence the relationship between delirium and mortality. This is also the first study to examine the longitudinal trend of delirium-associated mortality over recent decades, to analyse the trajectory of our efforts in combating this disease. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, were searched from January 1981 to May 2018 for English-language primary articles. Rigorous title and abstract screen and full-text screen were conducted independently by two reviewers. This paper adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data was extracted independently by one reviewer using standardised data-collection sheets, with a separate reviewer verifying for accuracy. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Unadjusted effect sizes and event counts were analysed with a random effects model in primary meta-analysis and meta-regression, whereas a mixed effect model was used in secondary sub-group analysis. Mortality data at longest follow-up and cumulative mortality (hospital mortality combined with mortality at longest follow-up) data were analysed. RESULTS As part of a larger project, 446 of 6790 articles were retrieved, including 71 studies that measured mortality. Our results demonstrate that elderly inpatients with delirium had significantly greater odds of mortality (OR 3.18 [95%CI: 2.73, 3.70]) compared to non-delirious controls. Patients with delirium in the ICU had the highest odds for mortality (OR: 7.09 [95%CI: 3.60, 14.0]); double the risk compared to the average. Curiously, despite advancements in delirium research, delirium associated in-hospital odds of mortality has not changed in 30 years. CONCLUSION This is the largest meta-analysis to confirm the association between delirium and mortality, in older (age ≥ 65) hospital inpatients. The current meta-analysis highlights the significant odds of mortality after an episode of delirium, and these odds are much higher for ICU patients. However, in contrast to other medical conditions that have seen a decrease in associated mortality over the past few decades, delirium associated mortality remains unchanged. These findings underscore the urgent need for better delirium treatments.

At present, data are conflicting, with no consensus on whether exercise performance is affected by MC phase. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of the MC on exercise performance and provide evidence-based, practical, performance recommendations to eumenorrheic women. METHODS This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases were searched for published experimental studies that investigated the effects of the MC on exercise performance, which included at least one outcome measure taken in two or more defined MC phases. All data were meta-analysed using multilevel models grounded in Bayesian principles. The initial meta-analysis pooled pairwise effect sizes comparing exercise performance during the early follicular phase with all other phases (late follicular, ovulation, early luteal, mid-luteal and late luteal) amalgamated. A more comprehensive analysis was then conducted, comparing exercise performance between all phases with direct and indirect pairwise effect sizes through a network meta-analysis. Results from the network meta-analysis were summarised by calculating the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA). Study quality was assessed using a modified Downs and Black checklist and a strategy based on the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. RESULTS Of the 78 included studies, data from 51 studies were eligible for inclusion in the initial pairwise meta-analysis. The three-level hierarchical model indicated a trivial effect for both endurance- and strength-based outcomes, with reduced exercise performance observed in the early follicular phase of the MC, based on the median pooled effect size (ES0.5 = - 0.06 [95% credible interval (CrI): - 0.16 to 0.04]). Seventy-three studies had enough data to be included in the network meta-analysis. The largest effect was identified between the early follicular and the late follicular phases of the MC (ES0.5 = - 0.14 [95% CrI: - 0.26 to - 0.03]). The lowest SUCRA value, which represents the likelihood that exercise performance is poor, or among the poorest, relative to other MC phases, was obtained for the early follicular phase (30%), with values for all other phases ranging between 53 and 55%. The quality of evidence for this review was classified as ""low"" (42%). CONCLUSION The results from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that exercise performance might be trivially reduced during the early follicular phase of the MC, compared to all other phases. Due to the trivial effect size, the large between-study variation and the number of poor-quality studies included in this review, general guidelines on exercise performance across the MC cannot be formed; rather, it is recommended that a personalised approach should be taken based on each individual's response to exercise performance across the MC.","McNulty, Kelly Lee; Elliott-Sale, Kirsty Jayne; Dolan, Eimear; Swinton, Paul Alan; Ansdell, Paul; Goodall, Stuart; Thomas, Kevin; Hicks, Kirsty Marie",Sports medicine,330,7

Significant improvements in clinical endpoints were observed during the trial along with excellent safety profile. Fifty subjects aged between 18 and 55 years suffering from FD as per ROME III criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomized into two treatment groups, one group received OLNP-06, 200 mg twice daily and other group received placebo 200 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy end point was global assessment of overall treatment efficacy (OTE). Secondary efficacy endpoints were elimination rate of three major symptoms (postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation) and elimination rate for each individual symptom scores. Biochemical and hematological parameters including urine analysis were performed to evaluate the safety of OLNP-06. Out of 50 subjects, 48subjects completed the study. Total 79% of the subjects receiving OLNP-06 and 21% of the subjects receiving placebo (p < .05) were classified as responders according to the assessment of OTE. Elimination rate (score 0) of postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation was 64% in subjects receiving ONLP-06 compared with 13% in the placebo group (p < .05).

Most biological materials do not contain dense elements capable of scattering electrons to create an image; therefore, a negative stain, which places dense heavy metal salts around the sample, is required. In order to visualize viruses in suspension under the TEM they must be applied to small grids coated with a transparent surface only nanometers thick. Due to their small size and fragility, these grids are difficult to handle and easily moved by air currents. The thin surface is easily damaged, leaving the sample difficult or impossible to image. Infectious viruses must be handled in a biosafety cabinet (BSC) and some require a biocontainment laboratory environment. Staining viruses in biosafety levels (BSL)-3 and -4 is especially challenging because these environments are more turbulent and technicians are required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which decreases dexterity. In this study, we evaluated a new device to assist in negative staining viruses in biocontainment. The device is a capsule that works as a specialized pipette tip. Once grids are loaded into the capsule, the user simply aspirates reagents into the capsule to deliver the virus and stains to the encapsulated grid, thus eliminating user handling of grids. Although this technique was designed specifically for use in BSL-3 or -4 biocontainment, it can ease sample preparation in any lab environment by enabling easy negative staining of virus. This same method can also be applied to prepare negative stained TEM specimens of nanoparticles, macromolecules and similar specimens.","Blancett, Candace D; Monninger, Mitchell K; Nguessan, Chrystal A; Kuehl, Kathleen A; Rossi, Cynthia A; Olschner, Scott P; Williams, Priscilla L; Goodman, Steven L; Sun, Mei G",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,330,17

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to articulate the basis for investigating online racism as a form of structural racism with growing implications for racial health disparities in the digital age. We first define the structural features of online settings that generate and reinforce inequities among racial groups in the United States. Next, we propose a conceptual model detailing potential mechanisms through which structural online racism may translate into racial health disparities.

Our study aimed to identify the cumulative incidence of rebleeding, develop a predictive model of rebleeding, and evaluate whether the model can be applied in other outcomes among patients with OGIB. METHODS We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 320 patients with OGIB who underwent VCE between 2009 and 2014. A rebleeding model was developed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and evaluated using Harrell's c-index. RESULTS Rebleeding occurred in 43 patients (13.4%) during a mean follow-up period of 18.3 (standard error, 0.9) months. The rebleeding sources were the small intestine (n = 17), extra-small intestine (n = 13), and unknown (n = 13). The cumulative incidence of rebleeding was 11.0% at 12 months and 35.3% at 60 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that female gender, liver cirrhosis, warfarin use, overt bleeding, and positive VCE findings were significant predictors of rebleeding. The rebleeding rate was 0% in patients with no predictors and 40% in patients with full predictors (P < 0.01). The model presented a high predictive accuracy (c-statistic, 0.733). Patients with higher predictors exhibited higher transfusion requirements, longer length of stay, and higher mortality (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The cumulative incidence of rebleeding at 12 and 60 months was 11.0% and 35.3%, respectively. Five factors enable prediction of not only rebleeding but also transfusion requirements, length of stay, and death in OGIB patients.","Niikura, Ryota; Yamada, Atsuo; Nagata, Naoyoshi; Kobayashi, Yuka; Okamoto, Makoto; Mitsuno, Yuzo; Ogura, Keiji; Yoshida, Shuntaro; Shimbo, Takuro; Hirata, Yoshihiro; Koike, Kazuhiko",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,330,1

However, there are also reports of a paradoxical response to β₂ agonists resulting in bronchoconstriction. Asymptomatic bronchoconstriction is likely to be far more common than is symptomatic bronchoconstriction with β₂ agonists, but no systematic studies have been done. We assessed the prevalence of paradoxical response in current and former smokers with and without COPD, and its radiological correlates and clinical implications. METHODS Non-Hispanic white and African-American patients (aged 45-80 years) from a large multicentre study COPDGene were classified into two groups on the basis of a paradoxical response, defined as at least a 12% and 200 mL reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV₁) or forced vital capacity (FVC), or both, after administration of a shortacting β₂ agonist (180 μg salbutamol). FINDINGS Patients were recruited from January, 2008, to June, 2011. 9986 (96%) of 10,364 patients enrolled in the COPDGene study were included in the analysis population (mean age 59·6 years [SD 9·0]). Paradoxical response was noted in 453 (5%) of 9986 patients and the frequency was similar in patients with COPD (198 [4%] of 4439) and smokers without airflow obstruction (255 [5%] of 5547). Compared with white patients, a paradoxical response was twice as common in African-American patients (227 [7%] of 3282 vs 226 [3%] of 6704; p<0·0001). In the multivariate analyses, African-American ethnic origin (adjusted odds ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·50-2·39; p<0·0001), less emphysema (0·96, 0·92-0·99; p=0·023), and increased wall-area percentage of the segmental airways (1·04, 1·01-1·08; p=0·023) were independently associated with a paradoxical response. A paradoxical response was independently associated with worse dyspnoea (adjusted β for Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale 0·12 [95% CI 0·00 to 0·24]; p=0·05), lower 6 min walk distance (-45·8 [-78·5 to -13·2]; p=0·006), higher Body Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise Capacity (BODE) index (0·31 [0·19 to 0·43]; p<0·0001), and a greater frequency of severe exacerbations (increased by a factor of 1·35, 1·00-1·81; p=0·048). INTERPRETATION Paradoxical response to β₂ agonists is associated with respiratory morbidity and is more common in African-Americans. These findings might have implications for the use of β2agonists in some patients.

Studies appearing since 1991 indicate health care personnel may not be willing to work in all disaster situations-and if so, this could degrade surge response. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the state of the evidence concerning the willingness of health care personnel to work in disaster. The aims of this review are to collate and assess the literature concerning willingness of health care personnel to work during a disaster, to identify gaps in the literature as areas for future investigation, and to facilitate evidence-based disaster planning. Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (25 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies). The current evidence indicates there may be certain factors related to willingness to work (or lack of willingness) in disaster including the type of disaster, concern for family, and concerns about personal safety. Barriers to willingness to work have been identified including pet care needs and the lack of personal protective equipment. This review describes the state of an emerging area of science.

Microcapsules containing these encapsulates are readily produced at room temperature in the form of alginate beads that are stabilized by an outer shell consisting of an ultra thin chitosan-calcium phosphate membrane. Modulation of the shell thickness and composition influences the rates of release and diffusion of encapsulated cells, growth factors and genes to produce microcapsules with tailored spatial and temporal properties that offer significant potential as novel biomimetic delivery systems in tissue engineering applications such as skeletal tissue repair and regeneration. We demonstrate the use of mineralized microcapsules to enable regeneration from encapsulated human mesenchymal populations, functional quantities of growth factor capture, and gene transfection. Significantly, we highlight the ability to fabricate integrated capsules consisting of spatially separated multiple components in nested combination that may provide phased temporal release of appropriate growth factors, analogous to the natural regeneration process.","Green, David W; Mann, Stephen; Oreffo, Richard O C",Soft matter,330,24

Some researchers propose that cataphors trigger an active search during incremental processing in which the parser predictively posits potential antecedents in upcoming syntactic positions (Kazanina et al., Journal of Memory and Language, 56[3], 384-409, 2007). One characteristic of active search is that it is persistent: If a prediction is disconfirmed in an earlier position, the parser should iteratively search later positions until the predicted element is found. Previous research has assumed, but not established, that antecedent search is persistent. In four experiments in English and Norwegian, we test this hypothesis. Two sentence completion experiments show a strong off-line preference for coreference between a fronted cataphor and the first available argument position (the main subject). When the main subject cannot be the antecedent, participants posit the antecedent in the next closest position: object position. Two self-paced reading studies demonstrate that comprehenders actively expect the antecedent of a fronted cataphor to appear in the main clause subject position, and then successively in object position if the subject does not match the cataphor in gender. Our results therefore support the claim that antecedent search is active and persistent.","Giskes, Anna; Kush, Dave",Memory & cognition,330,16

METHODS A phase II randomized comparison of postoperative intraperitoneal (IP) vs. intravenous (IV) paclitaxel was conducted. Patients with resectable gastric linitis plastica, cancer with minimal amount of peritoneal deposits (P1), or cancer positive for the peritoneal washing cytology (CY1) were eligible. After intraoperative confirmation of the above disease status and of resectability, patients were randomized to be treated either by the IP therapy (paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 delivered intraperitoneally on days 0, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49, and 56) or the IV therapy (80 mg/m2 administered intravenously using the identical schedule) before receiving further treatments with evidence-based systemic chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was 2-year survival rate. RESULTS Of the 86 patients who were randomized intraoperatively, 83 who actually started the protocol treatment were eligible for analysis (n = 39, IP group; n = 44, IV group). The 2-year survival rate of the IP and IV groups was 64.1% (95% CI 47.9-76.9) and 72.3% (95% CI 56.3-83.2%), respectively (p = 0.5731). The IP treatment did not confer significant overall or progression-free survival benefits, and was associated with particularly poor performance in patients with residual disease, including the CY1 P0 population. CONCLUSIONS We were unable to prove superiority of the IP paclitaxel over IV paclitaxel delivered after surgery to control advanced gastric cancer with high risk of peritoneal recurrence.","Takahashi, Naoto; Kanda, Mitsuro; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Takiguchi, Nobuhiro; Fujitani, Kazumasa; Miyamoto, Katsufumi; Ito, Yuichi; Takayama, Osamu; Imano, Motohiro; Mitsumori, Norio; Sakamoto, Junichi; Morita, Satoshi; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,330,9

To date, no published meta-analysis has investigated changes in the regional ALFF in medication-free depressed patients. METHODS In this study, we aimed to explore whether resting-state rCBF and ALFF changes co-occur in the depressed brain without the potential confound of medication. Using signed differential mapping (SDM), we conducted two meta-analyses, one of rCBF studies and one of ALFF studies, involving medication-free patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, we conducted a multimodal meta-analysis to identify brain regions that showed abnormalities in both rCBF and ALFF. RESULTS A total of 16 studies were included in this series. We identified abnormalities in resting-state rCBF and ALFF in the left insula in medication-free MDD patients compared with healthy controls (HC). In addition, we observed altered resting-state rCBF in the limbic-subcortical-cortical circuit and altered ALFF in the default mode network (DMN) and some motor-related brain regions. LIMITATIONS The analysis techniques, patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS The conjoint alterations in ALFF and rCBF in the left insula may represent core neuropathological changes in medication-free patients with MDD and merit further studying.","Li, Wenbin; Chen, Ziqi; Wu, Min; Zhu, Hongyan; Gu, Lei; Zhao, Youjin; Kuang, Weihong; Bi, Feng; Kemp, Graham J; Gong, Qiyong",Journal of affective disorders,330,10

There is concern regarding disruption or dissemination of tissue during this process, which may be of particular significance in cases of undetected malignancy. Contained tissue extraction techniques have been developed in an effort to mitigate morcellation-related risks. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to quantify perioperative outcomes of contained tissue extraction using power morcellation, specifically evaluating parameters of tissue or fluid leakage from within the containment system. STUDY DESIGN This was a study including a multicenter prospective cohort of adult women who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy or myomectomy using a contained power morcellation technique. Blue dye was applied to the tissue specimen prior to removal to help identify cases of fluid or tissue leakage from within the containment system. RESULTS A total of 76 patients successfully underwent the contained power morcellation protocol. Mean time for the contained morcellation procedure was 30.2 minutes (±22.4). The mean hysterectomy specimen weight was 480.1 g (±359.1), and mean myomectomy specimen weight was 239.1 g (±229.7). The vast majority of patients (73.7%) were discharged home the same day of surgery. Final pathological diagnosis was benign in all cases. Spillage of dye or tissue was noted in 7 cases (9.2%), although containment bags were intact in each of these instances.

Most trauma-related research originates from trauma centres, and there are limited available data regarding the treatment of trauma patients throughout the Nordic countries. These countries differ from economically similar countries due to their cold climate, mix of rural and urban areas, and the long distances separating many residents from a trauma centre. Research funders and the general public expect trauma research to focus on all links in the treatment chain. Here we conducted a systematic review to assess the amount of trauma-related research from the Nordic countries between January 1995 and April 2018, and the distribution of this research among different countries and different parts of the trauma treatment chain. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus. We included studies concerning the trauma population from Nordic countries, and published between January 1995 and April 2018. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and performed data extraction from full-text articles. RESULTS The literature search yielded 5117 titles and abstracts, of which 844 full-text articles were included in our analysis. During this period, the annual number of publications increased. Publications were equally distributed among Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in terms of numbers; however, Norway had more publications relative to inhabitants. There were fewer overall publications from Finland and Iceland. We identified mostly cohort studies and very few randomized controlled trials. Studies focused on the level of care were predominantly epidemiological studies. Research at the pre-hospital level was three-fold more frequent than research on other elements of the trauma treatment chain. CONCLUSION The rate of publications in the field of trauma care in the Nordic countries has increased over recent years. However, several parts of the trauma treatment chain are still unexplored and most of the available studies are observational studies with low research evidence.","Jeppesen, Elisabeth; Iversen, Valdemar Vea; Hansen, Ingrid Schrøder; Reierth, Eirik; Wisborg, Torben","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",330,1

This study was conducted to evaluate outcome of the occluded ICA and efficacy of recanalization under protective flow arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty consecutive patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute ICA occlusion were identified from the prospectively collected data base. We assessed NIHSSo, occlusion type (cardioembolism vs atherosclerosis), occlusion level (supraclinoid-terminal, petrocavernous, or bulb-cervical), recanalization degree (TICI), and efficacy of recanalization (protective flow arrest vs nonprotection) leading to better outcome. RESULTS Successful recanalization (TICI ≥ 2) was obtained in 90% of patients and good recovery (mRS ≤ 2) in 60% of patients. Good outcome was related to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (P < .001), TICI (P < .007), occlusion type (P = .022), and occlusion level (P = .038). Poor initial patient status, less recanalization, cardioembolism, and supraclinoid-terminal occlusion were associated with poor prognosis. Application of protective flow arrest led to better outcome in the distal ICA segment than in the bulb-cervical segment. CONCLUSIONS In addition to the initial patient status and successful recanalization, the occlusion level or type of the occluded ICA could affect clinical outcome. In this study, treatment benefits of protective flow arrest were accentuated in patients with ICA occlusion above the bulb-cervical segment.","Kwak, J H; Zhao, L; Kim, J K; Park, S; Lee, D-G; Shim, J H; Lee, D H; Kim, J S; Suh, D C",AJNR.

Material and ethods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data over 5 years. RESULTS A total of 150 subjects on PMV, ready to undergo a weaning process, were included in the study. Of them, 60 (40.0%) were males. The mean age of the whole study population was 76.5 years (SD = 13.6; range 22.0-96.0 years). The subjects were on MV for a mean period of 170.1 days (SD = 237.6; range 25.0-1624.0 days). Sixty patients (40%) were successfully weaned. The mean RSBI in the successfully weaned population was 41.9 breaths/min/L (SD = 12.3; range 13.0-80.4 breaths/min/L), in the population where weaning failed, it was 114.8 breaths/min/L (SD = 69.2; range 47.5-450.0 breaths/min/L). By univariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (p < 0.007), female gender (p < 0.001), decreased duration of MV (p < 0.023), re-spiratory rate (p < 0.001) and RSBI (p < 0.001), increased tidal volume/ideal body weight (p < 0.001) and minute ventilation (p < 0.01) were found to be factors that significantly predict successful weaning. By multivariate analysis, increased tidal volume/ /ideal body weight (p < 0.007) and decreased RSBI (p < 0.046) were found to be independent predictors of successful weaning (p < 0.001; R2 Nagelkerke = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS Factors independently predicting successful weaning in patients requiring extreme PMV included increased tidal volume/ideal body weight and decreased RSBI.","Leonov, Yuval; Kisil, Igor; Perlov, Alona; Stoichev, Vladimir; Ginzburg, Yulia; Nazarenko, Alla; Gimelfarb, Yuri",Advances in respiratory medicine,330,20

As the age at diagnosis is decreasing, and treatment options are becoming more complex, increasing numbers of women are facing decisions about the use of disease modifying therapy (DMT) in and around pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS New data are rapidly becoming available, particularly regarding the safety of therapies in both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Effective treatment and suppression of relapses is key to ensuring good outcomes in the longer term for the woman, however this must be balanced against individual risk of relapse and risks to the fetus. Women should be advised that it is possible to breastfeed while taking selected DMT. SUMMARY In this review, we discuss evidence surrounding the safety of DMTs in both pregnancy and breastfeeding, and use this knowledge to suggest approaches to pregnancy and family planning in women with MS.","Dobson, Ruth; Hellwig, Kerstin",Current opinion in neurology,330,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three patients (mean age 51.3 years; range 43-56) with gastro-entero pancreatic NET (GEP-NET) liver metastases underwent 18F-FDOPA PET/CT-guided RFA. Patients were referred with oligometastatic hepatic-confined disease (1-6 metastases; <3 cm) on 18F-FDOPA PET/CT; poor lesion visualisation on US, CT, and MR; and ongoing symptoms. Procedures were performed in an interventional PET/CT scanner under general anaesthesia using a split-dose protocol. Lesion characteristics, procedural duration and technical success (accurate probe placement and post-procedural ablation-zone photopaenia), complications, patient and operator dose, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Thirteen liver metastases (mean size 11.4 mm, range 8-16) were treated in three patients (two presented with ""carcinoid syndrome""). Technical success was 100 % with a mean procedural duration of 173.3 min (range 90-210) and no immediate complications. Mean patient dose was 2844 mGy·cm (range 2104-3686). Operator and radiographer doses were acceptable other than the operator's right hand in the first case (149 µSv); this normalised in the second case. There was no local tumour or extra-hepatic disease progression at mid-term follow-up (mean 12.6 months; range 6-20); however, two cases progressed with new liver metastases at different sites. There was 100 % clinical success (n = 2) in resolving carcinoid syndrome symptoms. CONCLUSION 18F-FDOPA PET/CT-guided RFA appears technically feasible, safe, and effective in patients with GEP-NETs and low-burden hepatic metastases. Further prospective studies are required to elucidate its precise role in tailored multimodality management of GEP-NET liver metastases.","Cazzato, Roberto Luigi; Garnon, Julien; Ramamurthy, Nitin; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Imperiale, Alessio; Namer, Izzie Jacques; Bachellier, Philippe; Caudrelier, Jean; Rao, Pramod; Koch, Guillaume; Gangi, Afshin",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,330,1

The early detection of this pathology is very helpful for minimizing the chances of stroke, other heart-related disorders, and coronary artery diseases. This paper proposes a novel method for the detection of AF pathology based on the analysis of the ECG signal. The method adopts a multi-rate cosine filter bank architecture for the evaluation of coefficients from the ECG signal at different subbands, in turn, the Fractional norm (FN) feature is evaluated from the extracted coefficients at each subband. Then, the AF detection is carried out using a deep learning approach known as the Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (H-ELM) from the FN features. The proposed method is evaluated by considering normal and AF pathological ECG signals from public databases. The experimental results reveal that the proposed multi-rate cosine filter bank based on FN features is effective for the detection of AF pathology with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 99.40%, 98.77%, and 100%, respectively. The performance of the proposed diagnostic features of the ECG signal is compared with other existing features for the detection of AF. The low-frequency subband FN features found to be more significant with a difference of the mean values as 0.69 between normal and AF classes.","Ghosh, S K; Tripathy, R K; Paternina, Mario R A; Arrieta, Juan J; Zamora-Mendez, Alejandro; Naik, Ganesh R",Journal of medical systems,330,13

SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted in overwhelming number of reported deaths. Unfortunately it is still spreading uncontrollably despite implementing stringent protective measures. Rapid development of effective therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of infection is crucially required. Although genomic characterization has assisted in unfolding various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 but development of specific antiviral drugs and vaccine against COVID-19 is still a worldwide challenge. Understanding the disease pathological course underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the vital targets for drug development. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the host cell and primarily target type II alveolar cells. COVID-19 disease progression is associated with distressed immune functions and hyper active inflammatory system leading to development of cytokine storm which is a vital factor involved in disease advancement. The current review elucidates the disease pathology and summarizes the possible therapeutic options to battle against COVID-19 on the basis of current state of understanding about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic pathways and knowledge gained from previous SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics. Therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent infection as well as to suppress the disease progression to reduce severity and mortality rate is discussed.

In adipose tissue, chronic nutrient overload results in mitochondria driven increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to carbonylation of proteins that impair mitochondrial function and downregulation of key genes linked to mitochondrial biogenesis. In patients with T2DM, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery leads to improvements in glycemic profile prior to significant weight loss. Consequently, we hypothesized that improved glycemia early after RYGB would be paralleled by decreased protein carbonylation and increased expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis in adipose tissue. METHODS To evaluate this hypothesis, 16 obese individuals were studied before and 7-8 days following RYGB and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained pre- and post-bariatric surgery as well as from eight healthy, non-obese individual controls. RESULTS Prior to surgery, adipose tissue expression of PGC1α, NRF1, Cyt C, and eNOS (but not Tfam) showed significantly lower expression in the obese bariatric surgery group when compared to lean controls (p < 0.05). Following RYGB, but not after AGB, patients showed significant decrease in HOMA-IR, reduction in adipose protein carbonylation, and increased expression of genes linked to mitochondrial biogenesis. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that rapid reduction in protein carbonylation and increased mitochondrial biogenesis may explain postoperative metabolic improvements following RYGB.","Jahansouz, Cyrus; Serrot, Federico J; Frohnert, Brigitte I; Foncea, Rocio E; Dorman, Robert B; Slusarek, Bridget; Leslie, Daniel B; Bernlohr, David A; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Obesity surgery,330,6

The procedures have become more complex and the number of patients has increased. This scenario could have important implications for public health and infection control but, to date, the scientific literature has dealt little with matters relating to microbiological monitoring in RDs. PURPOSE To examine the level of microbiological contamination in the main RDs of Turin, a city in northern Italy, in order to analyze the presence of a possible biological risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data from 12 RDs. Samples were taken from X-ray tubes, control panels, radiographic cassettes, and imaging plates. We used the French guidelines ""Standards NF S 90--351"" in order to obtain the threshold values of reference. Through a questionnaire we investigated the use of personal protective equipment by the chiefs of the RDs. RESULTS We found values out of limits in 41.7% of the X-ray tubes sampled, in 91.7% of the control panels and imaging plates, while only 8% of the radiographic cassettes were contaminated. A total of 58.3% of RDs reported values above the threshold for three out of four samples. In 16.7% of the RDs only one surface presented acceptable values. CONCLUSION Healthcare-associated infections are a cogent issue for the RDs, and knowledge of how to prevent them is increasingly required by health professionals. This study is meant to be a first analysis of the issue that highlights the need of further investigations, maybe with a more detailed monitoring through the characterization of the microbial species involved. Moreover, the development of shared and maybe official standards for the evaluation of microbiological contamination in RDs is strongly suggested.","Giacometti, M; Gualano, M R; Bert, F; Minniti, D; Bistrot, F; Grosso, M; Siliquini, R",Acta radiologica,330,26

BACKGROUND PAOS is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder affecting programming and planning of speech. Patients with PAOS predictably develop Parkinsonism. DAT scan is a neuroimaging tool that assesses the integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters in striatum and is usually abnormal in PSP and CBS. METHODS As part of an NIH-funded grant, we performed a DAT scan on 17 PAOS patients early in the disease course. DaTQUANT software was used to quantify uptake in the left and right caudate and anterior/posterior putamen, with striatum to background ratios (SBRs). The PAOS cohort was compared to 15 PSP and 8 CBS patients. RESULTS Five PAOS patients (29%) showed abnormalities in at least one striatal region on DAT scan. When the five PAOS patients with abnormal DAT were compared to the PSP and CBS patients, the only difference observed was lower uptake in the posterior putamen in PSP (p = 0.03). There were no differences is putamen/caudate ratio or in symmetry of uptake, across all groups. There was also no difference in MDS-UPDRS-III scores between PAOS patients with and without abnormal DAT scans (p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS Abnormal DAT scan is observed early in the disease course in approximately 30% of PAOS patients, with striatal abnormalities similar to those in PSP and CBS.","Seckin, Zeynep Idil; Whitwell, Jennifer L; Utianski, Rene L; Botha, Hugo; Ali, Farwa; Duffy, Joseph R; Clark, Heather M; Machulda, Mary M; Jordan, Lennon G; Min, Hoon-Ki; Lowe, Val J; Josephs, Keith A",Journal of neurology,330,1

This is particularly concerning given that isolation and loneliness are associated with increased cannabis use, as well as using cannabis to cope with negative affect. Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020. Pre-pandemic cannabis use levels had been collected four months earlier. Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.","Bartel, S J; Sherry, S B; Stewart, S H",Substance abuse,330,20

Based on VLPs, chimeric VLPs (chi-VLPs) have been generated through genetic modifications or chemical couplings. For construction of multivalent chi-VLPs vaccines, multiple genetic engineering strategies are continuously being developed. Thus, it is important to provide a summary as reference for researchers in this field.Areas covered: The representative studies on the genetic engineered multivalent chi-VLPs are summarized and mainly focused on chimeric capsid VLPs and chimeric enveloped VLPs. The advantages and limitations of each strategy are also discussed at last, as well as opinions on platform choice and future directions of eVLPs vaccines.Expert opinion: The design of multivalent chi-VLPs vaccines needs to meet the following specifications: 1) the incorporated antigens are suggest to displayed on the exposed surface of chi-VLPs and do not have excessive adverse effects on the stability of chi-VLPs; 2) the chi-VLPs should elicit protective antibodies against the incorporated antigen as well as the source virus of VLPs. However, there is no requirement of retaining the antigenicity of VLPs when using VLPs solely as carriers for antigens display or drug delivery.","Lei, Xinnuo; Cai, Xiong; Yang, Yi",Expert review of vaccines,330,31

Methods We performed a literature search via MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were used to assess the certainty of the data. Results Two searches yielded 1252 references; 26 met the inclusion criteria and included literature on nitrogen mustard, retinoids, corticosteroids, carmustine, fluorouracil, methotrexate-laurocapram, hexadecylphosphocholine, peldesine, ingenol mebutate, topical methotrexate with oxygen flow-assisted LP3 carrier, and resiquimod. Most studies were single intervention, observational series. Nitrogen mustard, with the most published reports, was effective with 12%-82% early-stage MF patients (total n > 1000) achieving complete remission (CR) (low certainty evidence). Clinical CR was achieved among 10%-60% treated with topical retinoids (low certainty evidence). Two moderate-sized retrospective case series on topical steroids had 18%-63% CR (low certainty evidence). Only single studies were available for the other therapies. Conclusions For most outcomes of interest, the GRADE certainty for topical therapies for early-stage MF was low.

Thirty-eight patients had diarrhoea in control group, and twenty-two patients had diarrhoea in study group, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups about vomiting and regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that ICU staff initiate enteral nutrition with fibre-enriched formulas rather than fibre-free formulas to avoid frequent feeding interruptions that cause protein energy malnutrition in ICU patients.","Yagmurdur, Hatice; Leblebici, Figen",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,330,12

DESIGN Prospective multicentre cohort study. SUBJECTS In total, 304 patients with first-ever stroke (male sex 59%, mean age 68.7 years) participated from Norway (n = 170) and Denmark (n = 134). METHODS The Quality of Life after Brain Injury-Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS) was administered twice to measure change in satisfaction with function and wellbeing. RESULTS QOLIBRI-OS scores showed a small statistically significant difference in favour of Norway at 12 months post-stroke (p = 0.02; Cohen's d = 0.26). Using a calculated minimal clinically important difference score of 12, 20% reported worse, 54% unchanged and 26% better QOLIBRI-OS scores between 3 and 12 months. Age below 65 years predicted a negative change (odds ratio (OR) 0.4, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION In this population with mild and moderate stroke, QOLIBRI-OS scores were slightly higher in the Norwegian region. Approximately 50% of participants experienced clinically important changes in satis-faction with functioning and wellbeing between 3 and 12 months post-stroke. Younger age predicted nega-tive change. This result could indicate increased rehabilitation needs over time in young patients and should be investigated further.","Heiberg, Guri; Friborg, Oddgeir; Pedersen, Synne Garder; Thrane, Gyrd; Stabel, Henriette Holm; Feldbæk Nielsen, Jørgen; Anke, Audny",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,330,27

Damaneh-Daran aquifer is located at upstream of the Zayandehrood reservoir in west-central Iran. This aquifer has been highly contaminated by nitrate and is still rapidly being contaminated. Thus, its quality needs to be remediated. This paper is focused on the quantity-quality modeling to predict the average nitrate concentration of the aquifer. Several remediation scenarios are presented in a period beginning from fall 2019, ending in spring 2024. These scenarios address several ways to mitigate the injection of the major sources of contamination in the region, such as equipping the urban regions with wastewater collection and treatment plants and reducing the fertilizers' use. The decreased use of the fertilizers may be achieved through two strategies: directly reducing the amount of the fertilizers by several specific and predefined rates of reduction and indirectly decreasing the amount of the fertilizers used by crop pattern modification. The latter strategy is evaluated to replace all or a part of the areas allocated to the more fertilizer-demanding crops with those of the less fertilizer-demanding crops. Furthermore, some of these scenarios are hybridized to more mitigate groundwater quality degradation. The results of performing the proposed scenarios are once compared together and then compared with the trend scenario letting current case study conditions and facilities be held in the future. The results suggest that the scenario hybridizing the effects of the wastewater treatment plants-equipping scenario with those of the quality-enhancing crop pattern modification scenario is evaluated as the most effective and best-performing scenario, implementation of which offers 20% and 30% reduction of the nitrate concentration for the agricultural and urban areas, respectively.","Samadi-Darafshani, Mahsa; Safavi, Hamid R; Golmohammadi, Mohammad H; Rezaei, Farshad",Environmental monitoring and assessment,330,1

With the use of a ""blind"" TAP block technique, these procedures have had variable success in cadaver and in vivo studies. For more accurate injection with the intended medication, ultrasound guidance allows visualization of the correct layer of the abdominal wall planes in which the thoracolumbar nerves reside. OBJECTIVE To assess the spread of various volumes of contrast placed under live ultrasound guidance into the TAP using computed tomography (CT). METHODS Four TAP blocks were performed on 2 fresh frozen cadaver torsos with predetermined contrast volumes of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mL. A CT scan of the cadaver was then performed and interpreted by a musculoskeletal radiologist. This cadaver study was carried out at a tertiary care academic medical center. RESULTS Cranial-caudal spread of injected contrast correlated with increasing injectate volume and was roughly 1 vertebral level (end plate to end plate) for the 5 mL injection and 2 vertebral levels for the 10, 15, and 20 mL injections. However, the degree of injectate spread may be different for live patients than for cadavers. CONCLUSION This study helps further the understanding of injectate spread following ultrasound-guided TAP injections. Specifically, it suggests that 15 mL provides additional cranial-caudal spread and may be an optimal volume of anesthesia.","Moeschler, Susan M; Murthy, Naveen S; Hoelzer, Bryan C; Gazelka, Halena M; Rho, Richard H; Pingree, Matthew J",Journal of pain research,330,1

IAVs exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical illness in humans, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains to acute respiratory distress syndrome during infections with some highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. In the present study, we infected A549 human cells with seasonal H1N1 (sH1N1), 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1), or novel H7N9 and HPAI H5N1 strains. We used multiplexed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification to measure proteomic host responses to these different strains at 1, 3, and 6 h post-infection. Our analyses revealed that both H7N9 and H5N1 strains induced more profound changes to the A549 global proteome compared to those with low-pathogenicity H1N1 virus infection, which correlates with the higher pathogenicity these strains exhibit at the organismal level. Bioinformatics analysis revealed important modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) oxidative stress response in infection. Cellular fractionation and Western blotting suggested that the phosphorylated form of NRF2 is not imported to the nucleus in H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections. Fibronectin was also strongly inhibited in infection with H5N1 and H7N9 strains. This is the first known comparative proteomic study of the host response to H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1 viruses and the first time NRF2 is shown to be implicated in infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza.","Simon, Philippe François; McCorrister, Stuart; Hu, Pingzhao; Chong, Patrick; Silaghi, Alex; Westmacott, Garrett; Coombs, Kevin M; Kobasa, Darwyn",Journal of proteome research,330,27

METHODS Ninety-eight patients with 126 HCCs designated to undergo thermal ablation treatment were enrolled in this prospective study. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion was performed intraoperatively to evaluate whether 5-mm AM was covered by the ablative area. If possible, supplementary ablation was applied at the site of inadequate AM. The CEUS image quality, the time used for CEUS-CT/MR image fusion and the success rate of image fusion were recorded. Local tumor progression (LTP) was observed during follow-up. Clinical factors including AM were examined to identify risk factors for LTP. RESULTS The success rate of image fusion was 96.2% (126/131), and the duration required for image fusion was 4.9 ± 2.0 (3-13) min. The CEUS image quality was good in 36.1% (53/147) and medium in 63.9% (94/147) of the cases. By supplementary ablation, 21.8% (12/55) of lesions with inadequate AMs became adequate AMs. During follow-up, there were 5 LTPs in lesions with inadequate AMs and 1 LTP in lesions with adequate AMs. Multivariate analysis showed that AM was the only independent risk factor for LTP (hazard ratio, 9.167; 95% confidence interval, 1.070-78.571; p = 0.043). CONCLUSION CEUS-CT/MR image fusion is feasible for intraoperative use and can serve as an accurate method to evaluate AMs and guide supplementary ablation to lower inadequate AMs.","Li, Kai; Su, Zhong-Zhen; Xu, Er-Jiao; Ju, Jin-Xiu; Meng, Xiao-Chun; Zheng, Rong-Qin",BMC cancer,330,1

However, this procedure carries infrequent but serious long-term complications, which may require revisional procedures. This study reports the indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal that have not been described well in the literature. METHODS A multicenter retrospective study of 50 patients who underwent reversal of RYGB conducted between 2006 and 2015 was reviewed to describe the usual indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal surgeries. RESULTS Of 50 patients, 7 (14 %) were males and 43 (86 %) were females. The mean age of the patient population was 40.4 ± 11.6 years (range 19-66). Reasons for reversal included anastomotic ulcers (n = 27), anastomotic complications (n = 9), malnutrition (n = 2), and functional disorder (n = 12). The mean BMI before the reversal was 29 ± 9.4 kg/m(2) (range 16-60). The mean time between the primary procedure and reversal was 60 ± 65.5 months (range 2-300). Fourteen of the reversals were done via laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 8.4 ± 7.3 days (range 3-34 days). There was no peri-operative death 30 days after reversal. Following gastric bypass reversal, 92.6 % (n = 25) of the patient population had resolution from ulcers, 77.8 % (n = 7) of the patient population had resolution from anatomic complications, 100 % (n = 2) of the patient population had resolution from malnutrition, and 66.7 % (n = 8) of the patient population had resolution from functional disorders. CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass reversal is a reasonable and safe treatment for complications arising from the GBP surgery.

We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID- 19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. ≤0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID- 19 response plans as soon as permitting.","Bisanzio, Donal; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Bogoch, Isaac I; Brewer, Thomas; Brownstein, John S; Reithinger, Richard",Geospatial health,330,1

Evolutionary emergence is the process by which new pathogen strains arise in response to such selective pressures. Theoretical studies over the last decade have clarified some determinants of emergence risk, but have neglected the influence of fitness on evolutionary rates and have not accounted for the multiple scales at which pathogens must compete successfully. We present a cross-scale theory for evolutionary emergence, which embeds a mechanistic model of within-host selection into a stochastic model for emergence at the population scale. We explore how fitness landscapes at within-host and between-host scales can interact to influence the probability that a pathogen lineage will emerge successfully. Results show that positive correlations between fitnesses across scales can greatly facilitate emergence, while cross-scale conflicts in selection can lead to evolutionary dead ends. The local genotype space of the initial strain of a pathogen can have disproportionate influence on emergence probability. Our cross-scale model represents a step towards integrating laboratory experiments with field surveillance data to create a rational framework to assess emergence risk.","Park, Miran; Loverdo, Claude; Schreiber, Sebastian J; Lloyd-Smith, James O","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In the present study, we initially focused on the detection of recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates by examining previously published data sets of ORF5 sequences (genotypes 1 and 2) obtained worldwide. We then examined full-length genome sequences in order to determine potential recombination breakpoints along the viral genome. For ORF5, 11 sets of genotype 1 sequences from different geographical areas, including 2 Asian, 1 American, and 7 European regions, and three sets of genotype 2, including sets from China, Mexico, and the United States, were analyzed separately. Potential recombination breakpoints were detected in 10/11 genotype 1 sets, including 9 cases in which the clustering of at least one isolate was different before and after the breakpoints. In genotype 2, potential breakpoints and different tree clustering of at least one strain before and after the breakpoint were observed in 2 out of 3 sets. The results indicated that most of the ORF5 data sets contained at least one recombinant sequence. When the full-length genome sequences were examined, both genotype 1 and 2 sets presented breakpoints (10 and 9, respectively), resulting in significantly different topologies before and after the breakpoints. Mosaic genomes were detected in genotype 1 sequences. These results may have significant implications for the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of PRRSV. IMPORTANCE PRRSV is one of the most important viruses affecting swine production worldwide, causing big economic losses and sanitary problems. One of the key questions on PRRSV arises from its genetic diversity, which is thought to have a direct impact on immunobiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and vaccine efficacy. One of the causes of this genetic diversity is recombination among strains. This study provides evidence that recombinant PRRSV isolates are common in most of the countries with significant swine production, especially PRRSV genotype 1. This observation has implications in the proper characterization of PRRSV strains, in the future development of phylogenetic studies, and in the development of new PRRSV control strategies. Moreover, the present paper emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and circumstances involved in the generation of genetic diversity of PRRSV.","Martín-Valls, G E; Kvisgaard, L K; Tello, M; Darwich, L; Cortey, M; Burgara-Estrella, A J; Hernández, J; Larsen, L E; Mateu, E",Journal of virology,330,27

To assess mesenchymal and stromal expression of CD10, we performed immunohistochemical assays in whole body sections from eight fetuses of gestational ages 15-20 weeks. In addition to expression in urinary tract and intestinal epithelium, CD10 was strongly expressed at both gestational ages in fibrous tissues surrounding the airways from the larynx to lung alveoli, in the periosteum and ossification center, and in the glans of external genitalia. CD10 was not expressed, however, in other cavernous tissues. These findings suggest that mesenchymal, in addition to epithelial cells at specific sites, are likely to express CD10. The glomeruli, alveoli, and glans are all end products of budding or outgrowth processes in the epithelium or skin. However, in contrast to the CD34 marker of stromal stem cells, CD10 was not expressed in vascular progenitor cells and in differentiated vascular endothelium. The alternating pattern of CD10 and CD34 expression suggests that these factors play different roles in cellular differentiation and proliferation of the kidneys, airway and external genitalia.","Kim, Ji Hyun; Hwang, Si Eun; Yu, Hee Chul; Hwang, Hong Pil; Katori, Yukio; Murakami, Gen; Cho, Baik Hwan",Anatomy & cell biology,330,8

Ever since it was first detected in December 2019, the number of confirmed cases has continued to increase. Within a short period, this disease has become a global issue, and therefore it is characterized as a pandemic. The current understanding and explanations are based on epidemiological, clinical and physiological observations. Besides, it remains a great challenge, as much remains to be understood about this new disease-causing virus. Therefore, we seek to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2, including its classification, origin, genomic structure, replication cycle, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatments, prevention and vaccine options. We conducted a literature search for the articles published up to August 2020 using the keywords 'SAR-CoV-2' and 'COVID19' in medical databases; PubMed, google scholar, EMBASE, and web of science. Based on the information collected, the emerging COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, exhibits strong infectivity but less virulence in terms of severity of disease and mortality rates in certain age groups. It inflicts more damage in terms of peoples' health and well-being, social life, and global economic impacts. Unfortunately, there is no adequate global and standard response to this pandemic to date, and each country is facing a crisis based on its situation, expertise, and hypotheses. While there is no effective therapy and vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 yet, preventive measures are the only tool available to our disposal to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing and future research is focused more on developing standard treatment strategies, and efficacious vaccines, which would be useful to tackle this pandemic globally.","Hokello, Joseph; Sharma, Adhikarimayum Lakhikumar; Shukla, Girish C; Tyagi, Mudit",Annals of translational medicine,330,11

There is no clear explanation why food allergy appears to have increased so rapidly in recent years, particularly in young children, hence ongoing research to identify effective primary prevention strategies. Food allergy prevention guidelines for health professionals have been developed based on existing clinical trial evidence for effective translation and implementation. As these guidelines underpin clinical practice, it is important to ensure robust processes of development. We conducted a systematic review to identify food allergy prevention guidelines for health professional use; to compare the recommendations made by the identified guideline documents; and to assess the quality of the identified guideline documents. We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Global Health and Guidelines International Network for the period 1990 to 13 August 2019, to identify articles referring to English-language food allergy prevention guidelines or the guidelines themselves. A grey literature search of Google Scholar and reference checking was also undertaken. The guidelines were compared for recommendation similarities and differences. An Appraisal Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) appraisal was undertaken to assess guideline quality. The electronic database search yielded 1121 publications and reference checking identified an additional 16 publications. After title, abstract and full text screening, data extraction was undertaken on 156 publications and with additional reference checking, 28 food allergy prevention guidelines and advice documents were identified. Comparison of the recommendations within the guidelines and advice documents indicated the greatest variation in recommendations related to exclusive breastfeeding and timing of solid food introduction. Eight of the 10 guidelines and none of the 18 advice documents met the quality threshold set by the reviewers. Overall, documents specifically termed ""guidelines"" scored better than advice documents when assessed using the AGREE II tool. Variation in recommendations may create confusion for health professionals and result in inconsistent advice being provided to parents, and less translation of the evidence into actual food allergy reduction in the population. Appraisal using the AGREE II tool identified that there is considerable room for improvement in the development of guidelines and advice documents for food allergy prevention. The AGREE II appraisal identified common areas of poorer quality development and/or documentation of processes to inform future guideline development. Based on this study, we recommend the use of validated guideline development tools, to direct food allergy prevention guideline review or development. Use of the AGREE II tool, to direct the review and development of guidelines, is very likely to improve guideline quality.","Vale, Sandra L; Lobb, Monique; Netting, Merryn J; Murray, Kevin; Clifford, Rhonda; Campbell, Dianne E; Salter, Sandra M",The World Allergy Organization journal,330,8

Icosahedral RNA phage VLPs can be formed from coat proteins (CPs) and are efficiently produced in bacteria and yeast. Both genetic fusion and chemical coupling have been successfully used for the production of numerous chimeras based on RNA phage VLPs. In this review, we describe advances in RNA phage VLP technology along with the history of the Leviviridae family, including its taxonomical organization, genomic structure, and important role in the development of molecular biology. Comparative 3D structures of different RNA phage VLPs are used to explain the level of VLP tolerance to foreign elements displayed on VLP surfaces. We also summarize data that demonstrate the ability of CPs to tolerate different organic (peptides, oligonucleotides, and carbohydrates) and inorganic (metal ions) compounds either chemically coupled or noncovalently added to the outer and/or inner surfaces of VLPs. Finally, we present lists of nanotechnological RNA phage VLP applications, such as experimental vaccines constructed by genetic fusion and chemical coupling methodologies, nanocontainers for targeted drug delivery, and bioimaging tools.","Pumpens, Paul; Renhofa, Regina; Dishlers, Andris; Kozlovska, Tatjana; Ose, Velta; Pushko, Peter; Tars, Kaspars; Grens, Elmars; Bachmann, Martin F",Intervirology,330,1

It is disappointing that there are no specific drugs until now. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medication seems to be the current more effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients in China. In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic. Among them, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Bupleurum chinense, Lonicera japonica,Scutellaria baicalensi, and Astragalus membranaceus are common herbs and have a certain regulation on GM, immunity, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Notably, Qingfei Paidu decoction and MaxingShigan have been demonstrated to modulate GM. Finally, the hypothesis of GM-mediated TCM treatment of COVID-19 is proposed, and more clinical trials and basic experiments need to be initiated to confirm this hypothesis.","Zhang, Qiao; Yue, Shijun; Wang, Wenxiao; Chen, Yanyan; Zhao, Chongbo; Song, Yijun; Yan, Dan; Zhang, Li; Tang, Yuping",The American journal of Chinese medicine,330,29

The Mobility Enhancement Robotic Wheelchair (MEBot) was designed to improve the stability of Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) when driving over these environments. MEBot offers six independently height-adjustable wheels to control attitude of its seat over uneven and angled terrains. Its attitude control application uses an inertial measurement unit to detect seat angles changes to adjust each wheel-height accordingly. MEBot was compared to commercial EPWs in terms of EPW performance (seat angle changes and response time) and participant perception (satisfaction and task-load demand) towards each device. Ten participants drove their own EPW and MEBot for five trials each through driving tasks that replicated outdoor environments. Results showed less change in the pitch angle when driving up and down a 10° slope using MEBot (5.6 ± 1.6°, 6.6 ± 0.5°) compared to the participants' own EPW (14.6 ± 2.6°, 12.1 ± 2.6°). However, MEBot required 7.8 ± 3.0 s to self-adjust to the minimum angle when driving over the tasks. Participants reported no difference in satisfaction and task load demand between EPWs due to similarities in comfort and ease-of-use. Improving the speed and efficiency of MEBot's attitude control application will be addressed in future work based upon participants' feedback.","Sivakanthan, Sivashankar; Candiotti, Jorge L; Sundaram, S Andrea; Battles, Courtney; Daveler, Brandon J; Chung, Cheng-Shiu; Grindle, Garrett G; Cooper, Rosemarie; Dicianno, Brad E; Cooper, Rory A",Medical engineering & physics,330,4

Orient yourself in a sea of information and knowledge.],16.033411,5.8642745,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Reduced gestational age and low birthweight are associated with an increased risk of neonatal infections. However, the long-term risk of infection, especially in late preterm infants or those at near-normal birthweight, is unknown. We estimated whether rates of infection-related admissions to hospital for children in Western Australia were associated with age, gestational age, birthweight, and birth length. METHODS We did a population-based, data-linkage study using total-linked, registry data from the Western Australia Birth Register of all liveborn, non-Indigenous Australian singleton births recorded from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2010. We followed up individuals from birth-related hospital discharge to age 18 years, death, or end of 2010, and linked to data about subsequent admissions to hospital or death registrations. Gestational age was assessed from both the last menstrual period and from estimates based on ultrasonography. We categorised birthweight by 500 g bands and birth length by 5 cm bands, and approximated the reference ranges for both to the 50th percentile. Because size at birth and gestational age are strongly associated, we calculated Z scores for gestational-specific and sex-specific birthweight, birth length, and ponderal index. Our primary outcomes were the number and type of infection-related admissions to hospital. We used multilevel negative binomial regression to generate rate ratios (RR) for such admissions, identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, versions 9 and 10-AM. We adjusted the RRs for maternal age at delivery, birth year, birth season, parity, sex, 5-min Apgar score, delivery method, socioeconomic status, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. FINDINGS Of 719 311 liveborn singletons included in the analysis and followed up for 8 824 093 person-years, 365 867 infection-related admissions to hospital occurred for 213 683 (30%) children. Of the 719 311 children included in the analysis, 137 124 (19%) had one infection-related admission to hospital, 43 796 (6%) had two, 16 679 (2%) had three, and 16 084 (2%) had four or more. The 365 867 admissions to hospital included a diagnosis of infection of the upper respiratory tract for 174 653 (48%), the lower respiratory tract for 74 297 (20%), the gastrointestinal tract for 44 755 (12%), and a viral infection for 37 213 (10%). Infection-related rates of admissions to hospital increased by 12% for each week reduction in gestational age less than 39-40 weeks (RR 1·12, 95% CI 1·12-1·13), by 19% for each 500 g reduction in birthweight less than 3000-3500 g (1·19, 1·18-1·21), and by 41% for each 5 cm reduction in birth length less than 45-50 cm (1·41, 1·38-1·45). Gestational age-specific and sex-specific birthweight Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile and birth length Z scores lower than the 10th to 25th percentile were associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 1·15, 95% CI 1·12-1·19, and 1·11, 1·07-1·14, respectively). Ponderal index Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile were also associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 1·08, 95% CI 1·04-1·12). A gestational age of 41 weeks or later, a birthweight or birth length Z score above the 50th percentile, or a ponderal index Z score between the 75th and 95th percentile, were associated with modestly reduced rates of infection-related admissions to hospital. INTERPRETATION Children who were born with reduced gestational age, birthweight, and birth length have persistently increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital until age 18 years. Pregnancy outcomes should be optimised to prevent infection occurring in this population, especially in resource-limited settings where suboptimum intrauterine growth and moderate prematurity are common.

METHODS DESIGN Analysis of data derived from two separate data banks. SAMPLE 54 subjects, 32 with HT (29 women, mean age 38.8 ± 13.9); 22 without HT (19 women, mean age 36.5 ± 12.25). ASSESSMENT Psychiatric diagnosis was carried out by Simplified Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDIS) using DSM-IV categories; cerebral perfusion was measured by (99 m)Tc-ECD SPECT. Statistical analysis was done through logistic regression. RESULTS MDD appears to be associated with left frontal hypoperfusion, left temporal hypoperfusion, diffuse hypoperfusion and parietal perfusion asymmetry. A statistically significant association between parietal perfusion asymmetry and MDD was found only in the HT group. CONCLUSION In HT, MDD is characterized by a parietal flow asymmetry. However, the specificity of rCBF in MDD with HT should be confirmed in a control sample with consideration for other health conditions. Moreover, this should be investigated with a longitudinally designed study in order to determine a possible pathogenic cause. Future studies with a much larger sample size should clarify whether a particular perfusion pattern is associated with a specific course or symptom cluster of MDD.","Hardoy, Maria Carolina; Cadeddu, Mariangela; Serra, Alessandra; Moro, Maria Francesca; Mura, Gioia; Mellino, Gisa; Bhat, Krishna M; Altoé, Gianmarco; Usai, Paolo; Piga, Mario; Carta, Mauro G",BMC psychiatry,330,30

This study examines the treatment of bifurcation aneurysms endovascularly with flow-diverting stents and presents an integrative computational modeling suite allowing for rehearsing all aspects of the treatment. Six bifurcation aneurysms are virtually treated with 70% porosity flow-diverters. Substantial reduction (>50%) in aneurysm inflow due to device deployment is predicted in addition to reductions in peak and average aneurysm wall shear stress to values considered physiologically normal. The subsequent impact of flow-diverter deployment on daughter vessels that are jailed by the device is investigated further, with a number of simulations conducted with increased outlet pressure conditions at jailed vessels. Increased outlet pressures at jailed daughter vessels are found to have little effect on device-induced aneurysm inflow reduction, but large variation (13-86%) is seen in the resulting reduction in daughter vessel flow rate. Finally, we propose a potentially powerful approach for validation of such models, by introducing an angiographic contrast model, with contrast transport modeled both before and after virtual treatment. Virtual angiograms and contrast residence curves are created, which offer unique clinical relevance and the potential for future in vivo verification of simulated results.","Peach, T W; Spranger, K; Ventikos, Y",Annals of biomedical engineering,330,1

To investigate how mutations that alter the activation pH of the HA protein influence the fitness of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in a mammalian model, we infected C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice and compared the replication and virulence of recombinant A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1) HA-Y231H mutant, wild-type, and HA-H241Q and HA-K582I mutant viruses that have HA activation pH values of 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.4, respectively. The HA-Y231H mutant virus was highly susceptible to acid inactivation in vitro and was attenuated for growth and virulence in mice, suggesting that an H5N1 HA protein triggered at pH 6.3 is too unstable for the virus to remain fit. Wild-type and HA-H241Q viruses were similar in pathogenicity and grew to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian tissues, suggesting that H5N1 HA proteins triggered at pH values in the range of 5.9 to 5.6 broadly support replication. The HA-K582I mutant virus had greater growth and virulence in DBA/2J mice than the wild type did, although the mutant virus was highly attenuated in ducks. The data suggest that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for infection in mammals is supported by a decrease in the HA activation pH to 5.4. Identification of the HA activation pH as a host-specific infectivity factor is expected to aid in the surveillance and risk assessment of currently circulating H5N1 influenza viruses.","Zaraket, Hassan; Bridges, Olga A; Russell, Charles J",Journal of virology,330,2

Anesthesiologists frequently perform virus-aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation and extubation, that place them at increased risk of infection. We sought to determine how the initial COVID-19 outbreak affected members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) on both personal and professional levels. Specifically, we examined the potential effects of gender and age on personal stress, burnout, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression, assessed job satisfaction, and explored financial impact. METHODS After receiving approval from the SPA Committees for Research and Quality and Safety, and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, we emailed a questionnaire to all 3,245 SPA members. The survey included 22 questions related to well-being and 13 questions related to effects of COVID-19 on current and future practice, finances, retirement planning, academic time and productivity, and clinical and home responsibilities. To address low initial response rates and quantify nonresponse bias, we sent a shortened follow-up survey to a randomly selected subsample (n=100) of SPA members who did not respond to the initial survey. Response differences between the two cohorts were determined. RESULTS A total of 561 (17%) members responded to the initial questionnaire. Because of COVID-19, 21.7% of respondents said they would change their clinical responsibilities and 10.6% would decrease their professional working time. Women were more likely than men to anticipate a future COVID-19-related job change (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63, P = 0.011), perhaps because of increased home responsibilities (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.00, P <0.001). Additionally, 14.2% of respondents planned to retire early and 11.9% planned to retire later. Women and non-whites had higher likelihoods of burnout on univariate analysis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.94, P = 0.026 and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08 to 3.04, P = 0.017, respectively) and 25.1% of all respondents felt socially isolated. In addition, both changes in retirement planning and future occupational planning were strongly associated with total job satisfaction scores (both P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of pediatric anesthesiologists, albeit not equally, as women and non-whites have been disproportionately impacted. The pandemic has significantly affected personal finances, home responsibilities, and retirement planning, reduced clinical and academic practice time and responsibilities, and increased feelings of social isolation, stress, burnout, and depression/anxiety.","Margolis, Rebecca D; Strupp, Kim M; Beacham, Abbie O; Yaster, Myron; Austin, Thomas M; Macrae, Andrew W; Diaz-Berenstain, Laura; Janosy, Norah R",Anesthesia and analgesia,330,5

We hypothesized that neutrophils recruited into an infected joint secrete enzymes that may be used as markers for infection. In this prospective study, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of one of these enzymes, leukocyte esterase, in diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS Between May 2007 and April 2010, synovial fluid was obtained preoperatively from the knees of patients with a possible joint infection and intraoperatively from the knees of patients undergoing revision knee arthroplasty. The aspirate was tested for the presence of leukocyte esterase with use of a simple colorimetric strip test. The color change (graded as negative, trace, +, or ++), which corresponded to the level of the enzyme, was noted after one or two minutes. RESULTS On the basis of clinical, serological, and operative criteria, thirty of the 108 knees undergoing revision arthroplasty were infected and seventy-eight were uninfected. When only a ++ reading was considered positive, the leukocyte esterase test was 80.6% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.9% to 91.9%) and 100% specific (95% CI, 94.5% to 100.0%), with a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 83.4% to 100.0%) and a negative predictive value of 93.3% (95% CI, 85.4% to 97.2%). The leukocyte esterase level correlated strongly with the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (r = 0.7769) and total white blood-cell count (r = 0.5024) in the aspirate as well as with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.6188) and C-reactive protein level (r = 0.4719) in the serum. CONCLUSIONS The simple colorimetric strip test that detects the presence of leukocyte esterase in synovial fluid appears to be an extremely valuable addition to the physician's armamentarium for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. The leukocyte esterase reagent strip has the advantages of providing real-time results, being simple and inexpensive, and having the ability to both rule out and confirm periprosthetic joint infection. However, additional multicenter studies are required to substantiate the results of our preliminary investigation before the reagent strip can be used confidently in the clinic or intraoperative setting.","Parvizi, Javad; Jacovides, Christina; Antoci, Valentin; Ghanem, Elie",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

In Barrett's esophagus, esophageal impedance monitoring is hampered by low baseline impedance values. Whether these low baselines are caused by an intrinsically low impedance of cylindrical epithelium or by the excessive reflux itself is hitherto unknown. Data on esophageal motility after RFA are scarce. Our aim was to examine the effect of RFA on esophageal motility and esophageal baseline impedance in patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS In 10 patients, conventional esophageal manometry and 24-h pH-impedance measurements were performed before and after RFA. The number and type of reflux episodes were assessed and baseline impedance values were measured in all recording segments. In another five patients, high-resolution manometry was performed before and after RFA. RESULTS Complete regression of all Barrett's epithelium was achieved in all 15 patients after 3 ± 1 RFA sessions. Overall, no significant motility changes were found after RFA. Patients had excessive acid exposure times before and after RFA [25 (17-42) and 16 (9-24)%, respectively]. Baseline esophageal impedance values were low, with the lowest values in the distal recording segments. RFA increased baseline impedance in all recording segments in the upright position; in the supine position, the effect just failed to reach statistically significant levels. CONCLUSION RFA did not alter esophageal motility significantly. Low esophageal baseline impedance levels in patients with Barrett's esophagus reflect, at least in part, intrinsic impedance properties of cylindrical epithelium, as baselines increased after conversion into neosquamous epithelium.","Hemmink, Gerrit J M; Alvarez Herrero, Lorenza; Bogte, Auke; Bredenoord, Albert J; Bergman, Jaques J; Smout, André J P M; Weusten, Bas L A M",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,330,28

Fifty-one patients with a history of PCI and LDA use were enrolled, and 45 eligible patients were analyzed. Patients were grouped based on DAPT (DAPT: n = 10 and non-DAPT: n = 35) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (PPI user: n = 22 and PPI-free patients: n = 23) to compare small intestinal endoscopic findings. The relationship between LDA-use period and small intestinal endoscopic findings was also examined. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for LDA-induced mucosal injury using age, sex, DAPT, PPI, gastric mucoprotective drug, and LDA-use period. The rate of small intestinal mucosal injury incidence did not significantly differ between DAPT and non-DAPT patients (50% vs 51.1%, respectively; p = 0.94), or PPI users and PPI-free patients (50% vs 52.2%, respectively; p = 0.88). Additionally, LDA-use period of ≤24 months (n = 15) yielded a significantly higher rate of small intestinal mucosal injury incidence than LDA-use period >24 months (n = 30) (80% vs 36.7%, respectively; p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed that a LDA-use period of ≤24 months was a significant risk factor for small intestinal mucosal injury (odds ratio: 19.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.48-154.00, p = 0.005). Following PCI for coronary stenosis, neither DAPT nor PPI affected LDA-induced small intestinal mucosal injury. Moreover, patients who used LDA within the last 24 months were at a greater risk of small intestinal mucosal injury.","Hara, Azusa; Ota, Kazuhiro; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Kojima, Yuichi; Hirata, Yuki; Ozaki, Haruhiko; Kawaguchi, Shinpei; Takahashi, Yoshiaki; Harada, Satoshi; Sakanaka, Taisuke; Ogura, Takeshi; Nouda, Sadaharu; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Kawakami, Ken; Asai, Akira; Fukunishi, Shinya; Sanomura, Makoto; Tominaga, Kazunari; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition,330,1

RESULTS The surgery group had the lowest rSco2 values before closure (n = 35), 48% ± 9.7% (mean ± SD) as compared with the indomethacin (n = 35), 59% ± 10.4 (P < .001), and control groups (n = 70), 66% ± 6.9 (P < .001); the highest postnatal age before effective treatment; and the lowest volumes of most brain regions at term-equivalent age. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant effect of preductal closure rSco2 on cerebellar volume in this group. No differences were found in maturation of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. CONCLUSIONS Long-standing suboptimal cerebral oxygenation due to a PDA may negatively influence brain growth, affecting neurodevelopmental outcome.","Lemmers, Petra M A; Benders, Manon J N L; D'Ascenzo, Rita; Zethof, Jorine; Alderliesten, Thomas; Kersbergen, Karina J; Isgum, Ivana; de Vries, Linda S; Groenendaal, Floris; van Bel, Frank",Pediatrics,330,24

Part II.,15.977208,6.0371943,2009,"BACKGROUND The objective of this multicenter, prospective observational study was to determine the factors related to patency rates after construction of vascular access (VA) and the first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). METHODS The 24-month primary and secondary patency rates after construction of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RC-AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The 12-month post-PTA patency rate was also investigated. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify clinical parameters associated with the primary patency rate and the post-PTA patency rate. RESULTS A total of 611 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary patency rate after VA construction was lower in hemodialysis (HD) patients with an AVG than in those with an AVF. Aging (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 per 1 year; p < 0.001), female sex (HR, 1.41; p = 0.03), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.37; p = 0.03), low serum albumin (HR, 0.76 per 1-g/dL decrease; p = 0.02), and use of an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (HR, 1.62; p = 0.02) were risk factors for VA problems. The post-PTA patency rate was associated with aging (HR, 1.02; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.49; p = 0.02), polycystic kidney disease (HR, 2.14; p = 0.01), temporary catheter use for initiation of HD (HR, 1.60; p = 0.02), and period from VA construction to use (HR, 0.99; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION Although a poor patency rate is commonly associated with advanced age and diabetes, different risk factors affect patency between VA construction and the first PTA.","Yoshida, Mahoko; Doi, Shigehiro; Nakashima, Ayumu; Kyuden, Yasufumi; Kawai, Toru; Kawaoka, Koichiro; Takahashi, Shunsuke; Ueno, Toshinori; Nishizawa, Yoshiko; Masaki, Takao",The journal of vascular access,330,29

Resistance training has been considered one of the most useful tools for patients with pulmonary disease, improving their quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resistance training (RT) on the prevention of thickening of the right ventricle wall of rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control (C), Smoker (S), Exercised (E) and Exercised Smoker (ES). The smoker groups were exposed to the smoke of four cigarettes for 30 min, twice daily, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The exercised groups climbed on a vertical ladder with progressive load, once a day, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The heart, trachea, lung, liver and gastrocnemius muscle were removed for histopathological analysis. Pulmonary emphysema (S and ES vs C and E, P < 0.0001) and pulmonary artery thickness enlargement (S vs C and E, P = 0.003, ES vs C, P = 0.003) were detected in the smoking groups. There was an increase in the right ventricle thickness in the S group compared with all other groups (P < 0.0001). An increase in resident macrophages in the liver was detected in both smoking groups compared with the C group (P = 0.002). Additionally, a relevant reduction of the diameter of the muscle fibers was detected only in ES compared with the C, S and E groups (P = 0.0002), impairing, at least in part, the muscle mass in exercised smoking rats. Therefore, it was concluded that resistance training prevented the increase of thickness of the right ventricle in rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke, but it may be not so beneficial for the skeletal muscle of smoking rats.","Moreno, Ana Caroline Rippi; Nai, Gisele Alborghetti; Laurindo, Caroline Pancera; Gregorio, Karen Cristina Rego; Olean-Oliveira, Tiago; Teixeira, Marcos Fernando Souza; Seraphim, Patricia Monteiro",PloS one,330,1

METHODS The Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to May 2019. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data from eligible articles via the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (why, what, who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications, and how well). RESULTS Twenty-three trials were included. The total number of participants was 7178. Most interventions were in primary care. Although face-to-face was the most common modality of contact, rates of contact were highest for telephone. Potential PLs were identified primarily through recommendations from health professionals, based on their communication skills, HbA1c, and coaching interest. PLs were mostly female, university educated, and had a long history of diabetes (≥ 10 years). PL training varied significantly in length and content; the two most frequent topics were communication skills and diabetes knowledge. Although several studies implemented methods to evaluate ""intervention fidelity,"" only few rigorously assessed the two key components of fidelity,""adherence"" and ""competence,"" through audio-, video-taping or direct observations.

The Y-Balance Test Lower Quarter (YBT-LQ) has emerged as a tool to identify these deficits. Purpose To review the reliability of the YBT-LQ, determine if performance on the YBT-LQ varies among populations (i.e., sex, sport/activity, and competition level), and to determine the injury risk identification validity of the YBT-LQ based on asymmetry, individual reach direction performance, or composite score. Study Design Systematic Review. Methods A comprehensive search was performed of 10 online databases from inception to October 30, 2019. Only studies that tested dynamic single leg balance using the YBT-LQ were included. Studies were excluded if the Y-Balance Test kit was not utilized during testing or if there was a major deviation from the Y-Balance test procedure. For methodological quality assessment, the modified Downs and Black scale and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used. Results Fifty-seven studies (four in multiple categories) were included with nine studies assessing reliability, 36 assessing population differences, and 16 assessing injury prediction were included. Intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.85-0.91. Sex differences were observed in the posteromedial direction (males: 109.6 [95%CI 107.4-111.8]; females: 102.3 [95%CI 97.2-107.4; p = 0.01]) and posterolateral direction (males: 107.0 [95%CI 105.0-109.1]; females: 102.0 [95%CI 97.8-106.2]). However, no difference was observed between sexes in the anterior reach direction (males: 71.9 [95%CI 69.5-74.5]; females: 70.8 [95%CI 65.7-75.9]; p=0.708). Differences in composite score were noted between soccer (97.6; 95%CI 95.9-99.3) and basketball (92.8; 95%CI 90.4-95.3; p <0.01), and baseball (97.4; 95%CI 94.6-100.2) and basketball (92.8; 95%CI 90.4-95.3; p=0.02). Given the heterogeneity of injury prediction studies, a meta-analysis of these data was not possible. Three of the 13 studies reported a relationship between anterior reach asymmetry reach and injury risk, three of 10 studies for posteromedial and posterolateral reach asymmetry, and one of 13 studies reported relationship with composite reach asymmetry. Conclusions There was moderate to high quality evidence demonstrating that the YBT-LQ is a reliable dynamic neuromuscular control test. Significant differences in sex and sport were observed. If general cut points (i.e., not population specific) are used, the YBT-LQ may not be predictive of injury. Clinical population specific requirements (e.g., age, sex, sport/activity) should be considered when interpreting YBT-LQ performance, particularly when used to identify risk factors for injury.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and ketofol on recovery after laparoscopic surgery in pediatric patients. METHODS Two hundred children with median age of 5 years who underwent laparoscopic surgery were randomized into two groups. Propofol 1% was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in group I, while ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) was used in group II. Ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) was prepared in the same applicator for group II. Ketofol ratios of 1:4 and 1:7 were used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, respectively. A reduced McFarlan infusion dose was used in group I (1.2, 1.0, and 0.8 mL/kg/h for 15, 15, and 30 min, respectively), while a McFarlan infusion dose was used in group II (1.5, 1.3, and 1.1 mL/kg/h for 15, 15, and 30 min, respectively). Extubating time, duration of anesthesia, and length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were recorded. RESULTS Extubating time was significantly lower in the ketofol group than in the propofol group (240 s vs. 530 s; p < 0.00001). Significantly shorter duration of anesthesia (47 min vs. 60 min; p < 0.00001) as well as length of stay in the PACU (35 min vs. 100 min; p < 0.00001) were recorded in ketofol compared to the propofol group. Total fentanyl (100 µg (interquartile range, IQR 80, 125) vs. 50 µg (IQR 40, 60); p < 0.00001) and propofol (260 mg (IQR 200, 350) vs. 160 mg (IQR 120, 210); p < 0.00001) consumption per body weight were significantly lower in the ketofol group. CONCLUSIONS TIVA with ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) using a reduced McFarlan dose regimen shortened extubating time, duration of anesthesia, as well as length of stay in the PACU in pediatric anesthesia after laparoscopic surgery.","Biliškov, Ana Nevešćanin; Ivančev, Božena; Pogorelić, Zenon",Children,330,1

In this sensing system, an intelligent multi-signal readout interface (MSRI) with multidimensional response-ability to thermal stimulus was developed and utilized as a sensing element. A bio-bar-code photothermal probe peptides@H2N-HCNTs acted as a target associated photothermal agent anchored on MSRI via competitive reaction. The multi-signal assay of target was realized under the driven of 808 nm laser, photo-to-thermal conversion effect of photothermal probe caused dramatically thermal energy increase on MSRI. As a result, the competitive recognition events were translated into several detectable signals on MSRI, including a local temperature elevation, a visual color change from blue to green as well as weight loss on MSRI, all of these signals were proportional to the target concentration. This assay has been successfully applied in field work for detecting zearalenone (ZEN), a common mycotoxin in grain food, with linear ranger from 10-7 ng/mL to 10-1 ng/mL and detection limits of 1.06 × 10-7 ng/mL.

Low Vitamin D levels have been found in patients with atopic conditions. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune antigen mediated disease found to be highly associated in patients with atopic disease and treated with dietary elimination with recommendations to utilize a dietician to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Nonetheless, the relationship between EoE and vitamin deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review the evidence to support a possible association between vitamin deficiency and eosinophilic esophagitis. METHODS Electronic searches were performed with keywords relating to EoE and vitamins among pediatric patients in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Summary estimates were calculated. Citations were reviewed against pre-defined criteria; (Inclusion: human subjects, aged 0-18, with eosinophilic esophagitis. Exclusion: adults over 18 years, non-English papers). RESULTS The search yielded 1707 studies. Five of these studies with a total of 137 pediatric patients, were included in the systematic review. Outcome measures were assessed at different points in EoE treatment across studies. The single common outcome measure across all included studies was vitamin D. Reported prevalence of low vitamin D varied in these studies (0-52%). Vitamin D levels of children with EoE both pre and post intervention was low. CONCLUSIONS There is limited published literature on vitamin deficiencies associated with EoE both pre and post intervention. The limited data on Vitamin D suggests that insufficiency or deficiency may be present in these patients, but it remains unclear whether deficiency is caused by diet. More prospective, well defined studies, in addition to routine reporting on dietary intake and nutritional status are needed to make any conclusions or recommendations for screening.","Fissinger, Alexis; Mages, Keith C; Solomon, Aliza B",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,330,27

Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation.

Fourteen piglets with a mean body weight of 6.08 ± 0.86 kg were divided into pulsatile (N = 7) and nonpulsatile (N = 7) ECMO groups. The experimental ECMO circuit consisted of a centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator, and a pneumatic pulsatile flow generator system developed in-house. Nonpulsatile ECMO was initiated at a flow rate of 140 mL/kg/min for the first 30 min with normal heart beating, with rectal temperature maintained at 36°C. Ventricular fibrillation was then induced with a 3.5-V alternating current to generate a cardiac dysfunction model. Using this model, we collected the data on pulsatile and nonpulsatile groups. The piglets were weaned off ECMO at the end of the experiment (180 min after ECMO was initiated). The animals did not receive blood transfusions, inotropic drugs, or vasoactive drugs. Blood samples were collected to measure hemoglobin, methemoglobin, blood gases, electrolytes, and lactic acid levels. Hemodynamic energy was calculated using the Shepard's energy equivalent pressure. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor brain and kidney perfusion. The pulsatile ECMO group had a higher atrial pressure (systolic and mean), and significantly higher regional saturation at the brain level, than the nonpulsatile group (for both, P < 0.05). Additionally, the pulsatile ECMO group had higher methemoglobin levels within the normal range than the nonpulsatile group.

CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms influence clopidogrel activity. We aimed to study the clinical impact of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Information on demographics and cerebrovascular status was collected as baseline. Clopidogrel response was tested by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. CYP2C19 genotyping was undertaken by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three-month follow-up data included vascular complications, mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score. Associations were investigated among CYP2C19 genotypes, clopidogrel responsiveness, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and eight participants were included. Median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 48.8-65.0 years), and 35 (32.4%) were male. Forty-four participants were classified into group 1 (homozygous CYP2C19*1/*1); 31, into group 2 (25 with CYP2C19*1/*2, two with CYP2C19*1/*3, three with CYP2C19*3/*3, one with CYP2C19*2/*3); 28, into group 3 (24 with CYP2C19*1/*17, four with CYP2C19*17/*17); and 5, into group 4 (CYP2C19*2/*17).

We sought to evaluate the frequency at which alternative pedicle maneuvers were required for these reconstructions and determine if there was any association with flap survival or postoperative complications. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review at three tertiary care institutions. METHODS Database review. RESULTS Free flap reconstruction of the upper and midface was performed in 295 patients (108 bony, 187 soft tissue). In 82% of cases, the vessels reached the ipsilateral neck for anastomosis to traditional target vessels. Arterial grafts were required in 2% of reconstructions (4% bony and 1% soft tissue). Venous grafting was required in 7% of reconstructions (21% fibula, 16% scapula, and 3% soft tissue) and was associated with an increase in flap failure rate (19% vs 3%, P = .003). The most common recipient artery for revascularization was the cervical facial artery (78%). Alternate recipient vessels were selected in 13% of cases, including the superficial temporal vessels (7%), distal facial branches through a separate facial incision (4%), and angular vessels (2%). Vein grafting was associated with a higher flap failure rate. Alternative maneuvers did not affect need for intraoperative pedicle revision or complications. CONCLUSIONS In upper and midface reconstruction, vascular grafting, targeting more distal branches of the facial system, or additional maneuvers to optimize pedicle orientation is often required to secure revascularization. Vein grafting is associated with a higher free flap failure rate. Scapular border flaps often require vascular grafting or atypical anastomotic locations.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) account for only one percent of all gastrointestinal malignancies, whereby an oesophageal location represents a medical rarity. Although surgical resection is the gold standard, the optimal procedure remains a matter of debate. Conventional oesophageal resection is the most common therapeutic choice to ensure complete removal with an appropriate safety margin and avoid dissemination of neoplastic cells. Anyhow, occasional case reports about enucleation of oesophageal GIST have been published. This video paper for the first time describes the use of right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) as a technique to enucleate an oesophageal GIST within the left tracheobronchial angle. INDICATION A 68-year-old male patient was evaluated for recurrent haemoptysis and dysphagia and diagnosed with a 1.4 cm sized oesophageal tumour at the left tracheobronchial angle. CT scan showed a submucosal location without signs of invasive growth. After conducting endosonography we suspected a leiomyoma and performed minimally invasive enucleation with right-sided VATS. METHOD Employing independent lung ventilation the patient was put into a left lateral position. Four trocars were applied. After incision of the mediastinal pleura the tumour was localised with intraoperative gastroscopy and diaphanoscopy. By mobilisation of the oesophagus and transection of the azygous vein it was possible to bluntly dissect the mass from surrounding oesophageal muscular fibres and safely extract it with a specimen bag. After removal of the thoracic drainage on the first postoperative day the patient was discharged the day after. The further course was uneventful. Histological work-up showed a GIST pT1cN0M0 R0 with a Ki-67 index less than 1 % (UICC I). After 10 months of follow-up the patient is recurrence-free and shows no symptoms. CONCLUSION Enucleation of a locally limited oesophageal GIST by right-sided VATS is a feasible and safe surgical procedure with dramatically reduced invasiveness compared to conventional open oesophageal resections.","Nawara, C; Augschöll, C; Hutter, J; Ofner, D; Primavesi, F",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,330,2

I argue that virtual specialist-patient interaction challenges clinical reasoning and clinical judgement (clinical reasoning combined with statistical reasoning). However, clinical reasoning can improve by recognising the abductive, deductive, and inductive methods that the clinician employs. Abductive reasoning leading to an inference to the best explanation or invention of an explanatory hypothesis is the default response to unfamiliar or confusing situations. Deductive reasoning supports a previously established goal, but deductive accuracy requires sound premises leading to a valid conclusion. Inductive reasoning uses efficient data sorting, data interpretation, and plan creation without a previously established goal, and allows assessing inferential accuracy over time. In all cases, communication remains the backbone of the clinical encounter. Virtual care for CCD challenges clinical judgement by reducing available information, so even experienced specialists who use induction might default to deduction or abduction. The visit might shorten, decreasing narrative competence and in-turn management quality. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters can be enhanced by allowing sufficient time, employing allied health staff, using an advance script, avoiding dogmatic commitment to either virtual or in-person encounters, special training in virtual care, and conscious awareness of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning processes. Clinical judgement in virtual encounters especially calls for Gestalt cognition to assess a situational pattern irreducible to its parts and independent of its particulars, so that efficient data interpretation and self-reflection are enabled. Gestalt cognition integrates abduction, deduction, and induction, appropriately divides the time and effort spent on each, and can compensate for reduced available information. Evaluating one's clinical judgement for those components especially vulnerable to compromise can help optimize the delivery of virtual care for patients with CCD.","Prasad, G V Ramesh",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,330,16

METHODS Six DPFs (Accunet, Angioguard, FilterWire, Gore Embolic Filter, NAV6, and SpiderFX) were evaluated in a physiologically realistic flow loop. A blood analog was heated to body temperature and circulated by a pulsatile pump outputting a time-varying flow rate representative of the ICA. The ICA flow model was a highly curved tube representing a challenging site for filter deployment. The DPFs were deployed at the apex of the curved segment, and 2 sizes of microspheres (143 and 200 µm) were injected to simulate embolization. The capture efficiency, pressure gradient, normalized pressure gradient, and vascular impedance were calculated. RESULTS The Gore filter had high capture efficiency (143 µm: 99.97%; 200 µm: 100.00%) with relatively small increases in pressure gradient (143 µm: +27%; 200 µm: +20%) and vascular impedance (143 µm: +23.4%; 200 µm: +6.1%) after particles were injected. Spider had the lowest capture efficiency (143 µm: 1.50%; 200 µm: 19.34%, p<0.0005), while NAV6 (143 µm: +916%, p<0.0005) and Accunet (200 µm: +179%, p<0.0005) yielded the largest pressure gradient increases. CONCLUSION A bench-top flow apparatus exhibiting physiologically realistic conditions was developed by combining pulsatile flow and a body temperature blood analog. Using microspheres larger than the pore size of most of the DPFs, the device-wall apposition has an important effect on the overall filter performance and the global fluid dynamics in the flow model.","Siewiorek, Gail M; Wholey, Mark H; Finol, Ender A",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,330,1

This is despite the obvious asymmetry in the initiation and termination of natural sleep. In order to characterize the restoration of consciousness after surgery, we recorded frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) from 100 patients in the operating room during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. We have defined, for the first time, 4 steady-state patterns of anesthetic maintenance based on the relative EEG power in the slow-wave (<14 Hz) frequency bands that dominate sleep and anesthesia. Unlike single-drug experiments performed in healthy volunteers, we found that surgical patients exhibited greater electroencephalographic heterogeneity while re-establishing conscious awareness after drug discontinuation. Moreover, these emergence patterns could be broadly grouped according to the duration and rapidity of transitions amongst these slow-wave dominated brain states that precede awakening. Most patients progressed gradually from a pattern characterized by strong peaks of delta (0.5-4 Hz) and alpha/spindle (8-14 Hz) power ('Slow-Wave Anesthesia') to a state marked by low delta-spindle power ('Non Slow-Wave Anesthesia') before awakening. However, 31% of patients transitioned abruptly from Slow-Wave Anesthesia to waking; they were also more likely to express pain in the post-operative period. Our results, based on sleep-staging classification, provide the first systematized nomenclature for tracking brain states under general anesthesia from maintenance to emergence, and suggest that these transitions may correlate with post-operative outcomes such as pain.","Chander, Divya; García, Paul S; MacColl, Jono N; Illing, Sam; Sleigh, Jamie W",PloS one,330,26

As patients with acute pain may include those who have limited prior exposure to opioids, this phase 1, open-label, randomized, multiple ascending-dose study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-naïve participants. This article primarily reports the pharmacokinetics results. METHODS Study drugs were administered in four dosing cohorts: every 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h for a maximum of three doses per cohort. Eight fasted individuals per cohort were randomized to either fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, or 400 µg) or fentanyl citrate IV 50 µg (6:2 ratio). Blood samples were collected pre-dose through 24 h post first dose. RESULTS A total of 98 healthy adults were enrolled and 96 completed the study. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased with increasing doses of fentanyl sublingual spray administered every 0.5-4 h. With multiple doses, systemic exposure increased relative to the first dose; shorter dosing intervals resulted in higher concentrations. Analysis of dose proportionality suggested that systemic exposure increased in a linear but slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation between the first and last doses of fentanyl sublingual spray was more pronounced with shorter dosing intervals. CONCLUSION Dose-dependent fentanyl pharmacokinetics following multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray were well characterized in an opioid-naïve population. CLINICALTRIALS.

However, tumour progression is still frequent, and treatment strategies need further improvement. One possible approach could be to combine different therapy options. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of a combined treatment with everolimus and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in female Lewis rats. METHODS Animals received 200 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE once and/or 5 mg/kg body weight everolimus or placebo weekly for 16 weeks and were divided into four groups (group 1, placebo; group 2, everolimus; group 3, placebo + [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE; group 4, everolimus + [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE). Blood levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed weekly to monitor nephrotoxicity, and a full blood count was performed at the time of euthanasia to monitor myelotoxicity. Additionally, renal function was analysed by sequential [99mTc]Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([99mTc]Tc-MAG3) scintigraphies. Histopathological examination was performed in all the kidneys using a standardized renal damage score (RDS). RESULTS Rats receiving everolimus showed a significantly lower increase in creatinine levels than those receiving placebo. Everolimus therapy reduced white blood count significantly, which was not observed for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Functional renal scintigraphies using [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 showed a compromised initial tracer uptake after PRRT and slower but still preserved excretion after everolimus. Histology showed no significant RDS differences between groups. CONCLUSION Renal scintigraphy is a highly sensitive tool for the detection of renal function impairment after a combination of everolimus and PRRT.

As minimally invasive approaches have become more widely adopted, their use in IPAA has also become increasingly commonplace. Laparoscopy has the same limitations during the proctectomy portion as seen in operations for rectal cancer, including dissection in the mid-to-lower rectum attributed to angles created by bony confines of the deep pelvis and lack of visibility when constructing the anastomosis. Robotic surgery provides improved 3-dimensional and high-definition visualization of the pelvis and multiple degrees of freedom, which greatly enhance performance during the proctectomy and construction of the anastomosis. TECHNIQUE In the setting of a previous subtotal colectomy, the ileostomy site is taken down and stapled across. A 15-mm balloon trocar is placed in the site to achieve insufflation, and the robotic ports are placed horizontally just above the umbilicus. The lateral mesenteric attachments are mobilized laparoscopically, then the J-pouch is constructed through the ostomy site. The J-pouch is placed back into the abdomen with the anvil in place, and the proctectomy is performed after docking the robot. The rectum is stapled with the robotic stapler and exteriorized from the ileostomy site, and the anastomosis is constructed under direct robotic visualization. RESULTS In addition to the potential ergonomic advantages, the maneuverability and visualization in the pelvis during the proctectomy and construction of the anastomosis are reported by many surgeons to be improved as compared with laparoscopy, especially in male or obese patients. CONCLUSIONS A robotic approach during the proctectomy and IPAA offers significant advantages to a laparoscopic approach, expanding our armamentarium of minimally invasive surgical techniques to IPAA.","Lightner, Amy L; Kelley, Scott R; Larson, David W",Diseases of the colon and rectum,330,1

The aim of this study was to examine the magnitude and temporality of this association. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for observational studies investigating the association between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. We computed overall effect estimates (EEs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects meta-analytic model. The EEs were stratified by length of follow-up from chronic pancreatitis diagnosis to pancreatic cancer (lag period). Robustness of the results was examined in sensitivity analyses. We identified 13 eligible studies. Pooled EEs for pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis were 16.16 (95% CI: 12.59-20.73) for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 2 years from their chronic pancreatitis diagnosis. The risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis decreased when the lag period was increased to 5 years (EE: 7.90; 95% CI: 4.26-14.66) or a minimum of 9 years (EE: 3.53; 95% CI: 1.69-7.38). In conclusion, chronic pancreatitis increases the risk of pancreatic cancer, but the association diminishes with long-term follow-up. Five years after diagnosis, chronic pancreatitis patients have a nearly eight-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We suggest that common practice on inducing a 2-year lag period in these studies may not be sufficient. We also recommend a close follow-up in the first years following a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis to avoid overlooking a pancreatic cancer.","Kirkegård, Jakob; Mortensen, Frank Viborg; Cronin-Fenton, Deirdre",The American journal of gastroenterology,330,1

Although minimally invasive techniques have been described and offer some promise, each has considerable limitations. This study assesses the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy (LTN), a novel technique for the management of necrotizing pancreatitis. STUDY DESIGN Between 2009 and 2013, patients with retrogastric pancreatic necrosis requiring debridement were evaluated for LTN. Debridement was performed via a laparoscopic transgastric approach using 2 to 3 ports and the wide cystgastrostomy left open. Patient demographics, disease severity, operative characteristics, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients (13 men, median age 54 years; interquartile range [IQR] 46 to 62 years) underwent LTN during the study period. The duration between pancreatitis onset and debridement was 65 days (IQR 53 to 124 years). Indications for operation included infection (7 patients) and persistent unwellness (14 patients). Median duration of LTN was 170 minutes (IQR 136 to 199 minutes); there were no conversions. Control of the necrosis was achieved via the single procedure in 19 of 21 patients. Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 3 to 14 days) and the majority (71%) of patients experienced no (n = 9) or only minor postoperative complications (n = 6) by Clavien-Dindo grade. Complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher developed in 6 patients, including 1 death (5%). With a median follow-up of 11 months (IQR 7 to 22 months), none of the patients required additional operative debridement or had pancreatic/enteric fistulae or wound complications develop. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy is a novel, minimally invasive technique for the management of pancreatic necrosis that allows for debridement in a single operation. When feasible, LTN can reduce the morbidity associated with traditional open necrosectomy and avoid the limitations of other minimally invasive approaches.","Worhunsky, David J; Qadan, Motaz; Dua, Monica M; Park, Walter G; Poultsides, George A; Norton, Jeffrey A; Visser, Brendan C",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,330,1

However, there is no research examining how the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) regulates morphine's paradoxical effect of reward and aversion. The present study addresses this issue, utilizing a high concentration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) via injections to destroy the VTA or the PAG. Moreover, the study employed the new ""pre- and postassociation"" experimental paradigm (2010) to test whether the simultaneous rewarding and aversive effects of morphine can be affected by an NMDA lesion in the VTA or the PAG. The results indicated that the NMDA lesion of the VTA simultaneously reduced morphine-induced conditioned suppression of saccharin solution intake in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and morphine-induced spent time in the preference compartment in conditioned place preference (CPP), whereas the PAG lesion did not change either measure. Thus, the VTA, but not the PAG, appears to contribute to the paradoxical effect reward in CPP and aversion in CTA induced by morphine. The VTA's involvement in morphine-induced CTA aversion and CPP reward supports the paradoxical effect hypothesis of abused drugs.

However, uncontrolled inflammation could be detrimental to the host, resulting in inflammatory disease, such as inflammatory lung disease. Although the etiology of the disease is well defined, the underling pathogenesis is still incompletely understood. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of the primary cardiovascular regulatory systems, has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease. In particular, the RAS has been implicated as advances in the understanding of the multifunctionality of individual components of the system have been made, and by the fact that the RAS acts not only systemically, but also locally in a variety of tissues, including the lung. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a relatively new member of the RAS, has drawn extensive attention since 2003, because of the findings that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS Corona virus and that maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung is beneficial for the host to combat inflammatory lung disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism through which ACE2 plays a role in inflammatory lung disease has not been clearly identified. In an attempt to summarize current literature findings and progress made in uncovering the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease, this review will focus on recent studies examining pulmonary ACE2 biology, its roles in inflammatory lung disease pathogenesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Finally, we will discuss pulmonary ACE2 as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory lung disease.","Jia, Hongpeng",Shock,330,16

This relationship could be caused by Galectin-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. Keeping PDs under control and maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period is very important. Patients with older age and pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are in the higher risk group for developing severe Covid-19 infections. The inflammatory pathways that are involved in these conditions are the same pathways that we see in periodontal diseases (PDs). This raises a significant question: Is PD a pre-existing condition that can increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection? Several studies have shown that Galectins play a key role in the homeostasis of immune cells, and recently, a relationship was found between Covid-19 and Galectin-3 (Gal-3).It has been determined that an important area in the spike protein of Coronavirus-19 is almost exactly the same as the morphology of Gal-3, and these spike proteins are critical for the entry of the virus into host cells. We suspect that there is enough evidence to support a close relationship between PDs severity and Covid-19 infections. There is accumulating evidence to suggest a relationship between the severity of PD and the risk of infection with Covid-19, which requires further investigation. This relationship could be caused by Gal-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. In this context, we want to emphasize the importance of keeping PD under control by maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period. We would also like to point out the possibility that having PD may be a pre-disposition toward developing a severe Covid-19 infection.","Kara, Cankat; Çelen, Kübra; Dede, Figen Öngöz; Gökmenoğlu, Ceren; Kara, Nihal Beldüz",Experimental biology and medicine,330,1

In mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, current recommendations suggest either to separate the dyad or encourage protected rooming-in under appropriate precautions. No data are available regarding the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during rooming-in. Objective To evaluate the risk of postnatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mothers to their neonates following rooming-in and breastfeeding. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective, multicenter study enrolling mother-infant dyads from March 19 to May 2, 2020, followed up for 20 days of life (range, 18-22 days), was performed. The study was conducted at 6 coronavirus disease 2019 maternity centers in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Participants included 62 neonates born to 61 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were eligible for rooming-in practice based on the clinical condition of the mother and infants whose results of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at birth. Exposures Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection were encouraged to practice rooming-in and breastfeeding under a standardized protocol to minimize the risk of viral transmission. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical characteristics and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 on neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs at 0, 7, and 20 days of life. Results Of the 62 neonates enrolled (25 boys), born to 61 mothers (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 28-36 years), only 1 infant (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%) was diagnosed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection at postbirth checks. In that case, rooming-in was interrupted on day 5 of life because of severe worsening of the mother's clinical condition. The neonate became positive for the virus on day 7 of life and developed transient mild dyspnea. Ninety-five percent of the neonates enrolled were breastfed. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study provide evidence-based information on the management of mother-infant dyads in case of SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection suggesting that rooming-in and breastfeeding can be practiced in women who are able to care for their infants.","Ronchi, Andrea; Pietrasanta, Carlo; Zavattoni, Maurizio; Saruggia, Martina; Schena, Federico; Sinelli, Maria Teresa; Agosti, Massimo; Tzialla, Chryssoula; Varsalone, Felicia Filomena; Testa, Lea; Ballerini, Claudia; Ferrari, Stefania; Mangili, Giovanna; Ventura, Maria Luisa; Perniciaro, Simona; Spada, Elena; Lunghi, Giovanna; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Mosca, Fabio; Pugni, Lorenza",JAMA pediatrics,330,16

These findings may help explain why after 30 years of proposed government obesity policies, obesity prevalence and health inequities still have not been successfully reduced. If policymakers address the issues identified in this analysis, population obesity could be tackled more successfully, which has added urgency given the COVID-19 pandemic. CONTEXT In England, the majority of adults, and more than a quarter of children aged 2 to 15 years live with obesity or excess weight. From 1992 to 2020, even though the government published 14 obesity strategies in England, the prevalence of obesity has not been reduced. We aimed to determine whether such government strategies and policies have been fit for purpose regarding their strategic focus, nature, basis in theory and evidence, and implementation viability. METHOD We undertook a mixed-methods study, involving a document review and analysis of government strategies either wholly or partially dedicated to tackling obesity in England. We developed a theory-based analytical framework, using content analysis and applied thematic analysis (ATA) to code all policies. Our interpretation drew on quantitative findings and thematic analysis. FINDINGS We identified and analyzed 14 government strategies published from 1992 to 2020 containing 689 wide-ranging policies. Policies were largely proposed in a way that would be unlikely to lead to implementation; the majority were not interventionist and made high demands on individual agency, meaning that they relied on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences, and are thus less likely to be effective or to reduce health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS The government obesity strategies' failure to reduce the prevalence of obesity in England for almost 30 years may be due to weaknesses in the policies' design, leading to a lack of effectiveness, but they may also be due to failures of implementation and evaluation. These failures appear to have led to insufficient or no policy learning and governments proposing similar or identical policies repeatedly over many years. Governments should learn from their earlier policy failures. They should prioritize policies that make minimal demands on individuals and have the potential for population-wide reach so as to maximize their potential for equitable impacts. Policies should be proposed in ways that readily lead to implementation and evaluation.","Theis, Dolly R Z; White, Martin",The Milbank quarterly,330,12

With limited resources to protect themselves against the virus and strict safety regulations that alter the way they work, healthcare providers have felt forced to engage in work behaviours that conflicted with their professional and personal sense of right and wrong. Although many providers have experienced moral distress while being physically in the workplace, others suffered while at home. Some healthcare providers worked in facilities that were unable to open during the pandemic due to restrictions, which could contribute to a sense of powerlessness and guilt. The current study assessed whether the ability to see patients each week impacted the relationship between an employee's moral distress and their mental health strain, burnout, and maladaptive coping. A total of 378 healthcare providers responded to weekly surveys over the course of 7 months (April 2020-December 2020). Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to examine the study variables over time. Results showed that moral distress predicted an individual's mental health strain and burnout, even after controlling for the prior week. However, moral distress was not a significant predictor of maladaptive coping. Interestingly, there was not a significant difference between the average ratings of moral distress between those who were able, and those who were not able to see patients, meaning that both groups experienced symptoms of moral distress. However, cross-level moderation results indicated that the ability to see patients magnified the relationships between moral distress and mental health strain and burnout over time. Implications of the results and recommendations for how moral distress should be addressed among healthcare providers are discussed.","Wilson, Chloe A; Metwally, Hannah; Heavner, Smith; Kennedy, Ann Blair; Britt, Thomas W",International journal of mental health nursing,330,31

METHODS RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression of SNHG4 and METTL3 in the serum from NP patients and normal volunteers, as well as in LPS treated-WI-38 cells. The SNHG4 overexpression vector (pcDNA-SNHG4) was transfected into LPS-treated cells. CCK-8, Transwell, annexin V-FITC/PI, ELISA and Western blot assays were used to determine cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, contents of IL-6, TNF-α, SOD and MDA, as well as the expression levels of NF-κB pathway proteins, respectively. The enrichment of SNHG4 in the METTL3 promoter region was assessed with RIP assay. m6A quantitative analysis illustrated the m6A level with or without SNHG4 overexpression or METTL3 silencing. Bioinformatics analysis and RIP-PCR were used to predict and validate YTHDF1-mediated m6A levels on signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) mRNA in METTL3 inhibited cells. Then rescue experiments were performed to explore effects of SNHG4 and METTL3 or STAT2 on LPS-treated cell functions. Subsequently, in vivo functional experiments were performed to investigate the role of SNHG4 in LPS induced pneumonia in mice. RESULTS SNHG4 was downregulated, and METTL3 was upregulated in NP patients and LPS-treated cells. SNHG4 overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, migration and SOD concentration, as well as inhibited cell apoptosis and production of IL-6, TNF-α and MDA, and suppressed the expression of NF-κB pathway proteins. Mechanistically, SNHG4 bound with METTL3 and downregulated METTL3 expression. Besides, total m6A level was lower in the SNHG4 overexpressed or METTL3 inhibited cells. METTL3 interference reduced m6A levels of STAT2 mRNA, decreased STAT2 mRNA stability and promoted STAT2 translation level. Upregulation of METTL3 or STAT2 reversed the effects of SNHG4 overexpression on LPS-treated cell functions. CONCLUSIONS This study reveals that SNHG4 promotes LPS induced inflammation in human lung fibroblasts and mouse lung tissues in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting METTL3-mediated m6A level of STAT2 mRNA, which may provide a potential therapeutic mechanism for NP.","Li, Si-Xiu; Yan, Wen; Liu, Jian-Ping; Zhao, Yu-Juan; Chen, Lu",Molecular immunology,330,20

The primary aim of this investigation was to expand the MOAA/S score to include truly noxious stimulation, thereby extending the dynamic range of the assessment to include sedation states consistent with deeper levels of general anaesthesia. METHODS Twenty healthy volunteers received target controlled infusions of fentanyl (target=0.8 ng ml(-1)) and propofol (starting at 0.5 µg ml(-1) and gradually increasing to 5 µg ml(-1)). At each propofol concentration, a MOAA/S score was obtained before and after tetanic electrical stimulation. The tetanic electrical stimulation current was gradually increased until the subject responded or until 50 mA was delivered without a response. A pharmacodynamic model was constructed to characterize the concentration-effect relationship between propofol and the MOAA/S scores. RESULTS All subjects required a significantly higher propofol concentration to produce unresponsiveness to tetanic electrical stimulation at 50 mA compared with a standardized trapezius squeeze. The pharmacodynamic model adequately characterized the concentration-effect relationship. CONCLUSIONS The Extended Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (or EOAA/S) extends the range of the widely used MOAA/S score to include truly noxious stimulation, thereby enabling the identification of drug-induced central nervous system depression representative of surgical anaesthesia.","Kim, T K; Niklewski, P J; Martin, J F; Obara, S; Egan, T D",British journal of anaesthesia,330,31

While HRV infections are restricted to the respiratory tract, HEV infections may spread to secondary target organs. The method of choice for sensitive specific detection of these viruses is reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers targeting the conserved 5' noncoding region of the viral RNA. On the other hand, sequence similarities between HRVs and HEVs complicate their differential detection. In this study, we describe the use of locked nucleic acid (LNA) analogues in short double-dye probes which contained only two selectively HRV- or HEV-specific bases. The double-stranded DNA dye BOXTO (4-[6-(benzoxazole-2-yl-(3-methyl-)-2,3-dihydro-(benzo-1,3-thiazole)-2-methylidene)]-1-methyl-quinolinium chloride) was used with the LNA probes in a tricolor real-time PCR assay to allow specific detection of HRVs (probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] [green]) and HEVs (Cy5 [red]) with additional melting curve analysis (BOXTO [yellow]). The functionality of the probes was validated in PCR and RT-PCR assays using plasmids containing viral cDNA, quantified viral RNA transcripts, cultivated rhino- and enterovirus prototypes, and clinical specimens. Of 100 HRV and 63 HEV prototypes, the probes correctly identified all HEVs except one that produced only a BOXTO signal. Among 118 clinical specimens with sequencing results, concordant results were obtained for 116 specimens. Two specimens were reactive with both probes, but sequencing yielded only a single virus. Real-time PCR with LNA probes allowed sensitive group-specific identification of HRVs and HEVs and would enable relative copy number determination. The assay is suitable for rapid and accurate differential detection of HRVs and HEVs in a diagnostic laboratory setting.","Osterback, Riikka; Tevaluoto, Tuire; Ylinen, Tiina; Peltola, Ville; Susi, Petri; Hyypiä, Timo; Waris, Matti",Journal of clinical microbiology,330,7

A shorter quarantine might improve compliance, and CDC recommends two options to reduce the duration of quarantine for close contacts without symptoms, based on local circumstances and availability of testing: 1) quarantine can end on day 10 without a test or 2) quarantine can end on day 7 after receiving a negative test result.† However, shorter quarantine might permit ongoing disease transmission from persons who develop symptoms or become infectious near the end of the recommended 14-day period. Interim data from an ongoing study of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand the proportion of household contacts that had detectable virus after a shortened quarantine period. Persons who were household contacts of index patients completed a daily symptom diary and self-collected respiratory specimens for 14 days. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Single- and multiphase CTA collateral scoring systems have been described but are subjective and require training. We aimed to test whether the CTP-derived hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status and whether a threshold hypoperfusion intensity ratio exists that predicts poor CTA collaterals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Imaging and clinical data of consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively reviewed. Single-phase CTA and multiphase CTA scoring were performed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists using the Tan, Maas, and Calgary/Menon methods. CTP was processed using RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion software (RAPID). Hypoperfusion intensity ratio = ratio of brain volume with time-to-maximum >10 seconds over time-to-maximum >6-second volume. Correlation between the hypoperfusion intensity ratio and CTA collateral scores was calculated using the Pearson correlation. The optimal threshold of the hypoperfusion intensity ratio for predicting poor collaterals was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS Fifty-two patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were included. Multiphase CTA collateral scoring showed better interrater agreement (κ = 0.813) than single-phase CTA (Tan, κ = 0.587; Maas, κ = 0.273). The hypoperfusion intensity ratio correlated with CTA collateral scores (multiphase CTA: r = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.40; P ≤ .001). The optimal threshold for predicting poor multiphase CTA collateral status was a hypoperfusion intensity ratio of >0.45 (sensitivity = 78%; specificity = 76%; area under the curve = 0.86). Patients with high hypoperfusion intensity ratio/poor collateral status had lower ASPECTS/larger infarcts, higher NIHSS scores, and larger hypoperfused volumes. CONCLUSIONS The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status in patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is an automated and quantitative alternative to CTA collateral scoring methods for both clinical and future stroke trial settings.","Lyndon, D; van den Broek, M; Niu, B; Yip, S; Rohr, A; Settecase, F",AJNR.

The main objective was to compare the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 versus patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Methods This is an observational controlled-cohort study performed at a single center of a university teaching hospital in France. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was prospectively assessed using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and compared to patients from a 3-year historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. In patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, CTPA was performed approximately 7 days after intubation or earlier in case of respiratory or hemodynamic worsening. Results CTPA was performed in 29 out of the 42 patients (69%) with ARDS related to COVID-19 and in 51 out of the 156 patients (33%) from the historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 40% (17/42) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 3% (5/156) in the historical cohort (P=0.001). The proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism among all patients who had CTPA was 59% (17/29) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 10% (5/51) in the historical cohort (P=0.0001). After adjustment on the interval between ICU admission and computed tomography, COVID-19 remained independently associated with pulmonary embolism. Conclusions Pulmonary embolism was particularly frequent in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, thereby suggesting that CTPA should be systematically performed in these patients.","de Roubin, Victor; Reynaud, Faustine; Coudroy, Rémi; Rodriguez, Maeva; Monseau, Grégoire; Joly, Florent; Bardin, Justine; Boissier, Florence; Chatellier, Delphine; Veinstein, Anne; Robert, René; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Thille, Arnaud W",Annals of translational medicine,330,30

Susceptible persons at proximity, usually within 1-2 m, to infected persons are largely at risk of being infected. Unfortunately, health workers usually evaluate patients within this distance. Eye care professionals (ECPs) are faced with a higher risk scenario of being infected as they undertake routine clinical eye examination procedures at a close face-to-face proximity to patients, which place them at a high risk of respiratory droplets and aerosolised particles, particularly from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers. The slit lamp examination procedure is typically at a distance of between 0.25 m and 0.5 m. While undertaking certain procedures on the slit lamp, such as gonioscopy and slit lamp indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ECP holds the accessory lenses either directly on the patient's eye or at about 5-10 cm from the patient's face, respectively. The authors found it pertinent to articulate this narrative review article to guide slit lamp examination practice by ECPs during routine ophthalmic evaluation, with a view to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to ECPs. In conclusion, ECPs are at increased risk of infection due to high-risk scenarios for routine slit lamp examination procedures of the eye. Adherence to standard precautionary measures with slit lamp use is highly recommended.","Ezeh, Ernest Ikechukwu; Nkanga, Elizabeth Dennis; Chinawa, Elijah Ndubuisi; Ezeh, Roseline Nkeiruka",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,330,6

METHODS A systematic review (PRISMA guidelines) based on a systematic search through PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE (1 February 2017) was performed. Methodological index of non-randomised studies score was selected to assess the methodological quality. Patient demographics and raw data for intraperitoneal microdialysis concentrations of glucose, lactate, glycerol and pyruvate for 5 d postoperative were obtained from the respective study groups. RESULTS Ten studies with a total of 128 patients were included. Thirty (23%) patients developed clinical anastomotic leakage. The area under the curve for intraperitoneal lactate concentration was significant higher in patients with anastomotic leakage (58.2; 95% CI 39.2, 77.2) compared with the no leakage group (41.0; 95% CI 35.2, 46.1; p = .007). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the maximum measured lactate concentration demonstrated 25% sensitivity, 88% specificity and 74% accuracy for AL at a cut-off value of 9.8 mmol/L. The odds ratio for a 5 mmol/L increase in lactate in relation to the risk of AL was 2.9 (CI 1.1, 8.0). CONCLUSIONS Increased intraperitoneal lactate concentration within the first 5 d postoperative was significantly associated with clinical anastomotic leakage, but with low predictive values. The microdialysis method is not yet ready for clinical implication before large prospective studies have defined cut off values for a biologic marker in the setting of a clear definitions of leakage.","Ellebæk, Mark Bremholm; Daams, Freek; Jansson, Kjell; Matthiessen, Peter; Cosse, Cyril; Fristrup, Claus; Ellebæk, Signe Bremholm; Sabroe, Jonas Emil; Qvist, Niels",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,330,30

The objective of this study was to analyze prehospital antibiotic therapy (PH-ABT) of children with PPE/PE and investigate its effects on clinical outcome and pathogen detection. METHODS Prospective nationwide active surveillance in Germany between October 2010 and June 2018. Children and adolescents <18 years of age with pneumonia-associated PE or PPE requiring drainage or with persistence of PPE/PE >7 days were included. RESULTS A total of 1724 children with PPE/PE were reported, of whom 556 children (32.3% of 1719 with available data) received PH-ABT. Children with PH-ABT had a shorter median hospital length of stay (15 vs. 18 days, P < 0.001), a longer time from onset of symptoms until hospital discharge (25 vs. 23 days, P = 0.002), a lower rate of intensive care unit admission (58.3% vs. 64.4%, P = 0.015) and fewer infectious complications (5.9% vs. 10.0%; P = 0.005). Bacterial pathogens in blood or pleural fluid culture were detected in 597 (34.5%) of 1513 children. Positive culture results were less frequent in children with than without PH-ABT (81/466 [17.4%] vs. 299/1005 [29.8%]; P < 0.001), whereas detection rates in pleural fluid samples by polymerase chain reaction were similar (91/181 [50.3%] vs. 220/398 [55.3%]; P = 0.263). CONCLUSIONS In children with PPE/PE, PH-ABT significantly reduced the overall rate of bacterial pathogen detection by culture, but not by polymerase chain reaction. PH-ABT was associated with a lower rate of infectious complications but did not affect the overall duration of disease. We therefore speculate that the duration of PPE/PE is mainly a consequence of an infection-induced inflammatory process, which can only partially be influenced by antibiotic treatment.","Forster, Johannes; Piazza, Giuseppina; Goettler, David; Kemmling, Daniel; Schoen, Christoph; Rose, Markus; Streng, Andrea; Liese, Johannes G",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,330,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2002 to December 2012, 1037 women underwent appendectomy (average age: 25±15.7 y; range: 6 to 91 y). Of these, 519 underwent open appendectomy (OA) and 518 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). For all the patients we determined the postoperative hospital stay, the eventual readmissions within 30 days after discharge, the length of surgical procedures (data were available only for the period from January 2008 to December 2012), the costs for the OA and LA, and the rate of negative appendicitis. RESULTS In our cohort of patients, 189 women (18.2%) had a negative appendectomy. Considering the postoperative hospital stay (average: 4.2±3.6 d; range: 1 to 32 d in OA group and average: 3.9±3.1 d; range: 1 to 21 d in LA group; P=0.15) there were no statistical differences between 2 groups. The average length of surgical procedures in LA group was 42.3±18.4 minutes (range: 8 to 135 min) and 43.2±19 minutes in the OA group (range: 10 to 135 min) (P=0.63). The average net cost of LA was 1203.61 euros, whereas for OA it was 95.18 euros. In this study, we considered only the surgical materials. CONCLUSIONS LAs are not associated with a lower complication rate than the OAs and, above all, LAs are more expensive than OAs. Also we believe that laparoscopic approach should be used only in case of unclear abdominal pain and not for the treatment of clear acute and uncomplicated appendicitis.","Casarotto, Andrea; Zarantonello, Fabio R; Rebonato, Matteo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",330,26

A cough is at the efferent end of a complex reflex arc and, due to its well-known mechanical respiratory cleaning function, usually the first symptom prompting a pneumological clarification. However, the chemical and mechanical afferent neuronal parts of the reflex, the cough receptors, are distributed over a variety of organ systems, some of which directly and indirectly affect the heart. Cardiology therefore plays a central role in the clarification of coughs. In cardiology, a cough is most frequently caused by acute and chronic heart failure resulting from different types of cardiomyopathies. It can, however, be caused by other pathologies as well. The connection between cough and cardiac arrhythmia is interesting, although cough can be cause, consequence and therapy. Last but not least, almost all drugs frequently prescribed in cardiology can cause cough in one way or another. In addition, a cough is the current number 1 warning sign when it comes to COVID-19 infection. On the one hand, it must be differentiated from cardiac-induced coughs, but on the other hand it can also be closely related to them.","Pavlicek-Bahlo, Maryam; Hunziker, Lukas",Therapeutische Umschau.

The authors review the literature and present a new case. METHODS Both OVID dating back to 1946 and PubMed records were reviewed using the terms (""Bow hunter syndrome"" OR ""bow hunter's"") OR ""rotational vertebral artery occlusion"" combined with ""child,"" and limited to English language. SCOPUS and the bibliographies of cases found in the search were used to identify additional articles. RESULTS Twelve articles were found describing 25 patients; there were 26 patients when combined with our case. Ages ranged from 1 to 18 years. Most (88.5%, 23/26) were male. Medical treatments included aspirin, clopidogrel, abciximab, enoxaparin, warfarin, and cervical collar. Stenting was tried in 2 cases but did not work long-term. Surgical treatments included decompression, cervical fusion, or a combination. We present a new case of a 12-year-old girl with recurrent stroke who had bilateral vascular compression only visible on provocative angiographic imaging with head turn. She was referred for cervical fusion, and abnormal ligamentous laxity was noted intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Bow hunter's syndrome is a rare but important cause of stroke since many of the patients experience recurrent strokes before the diagnosis is made. Reasons for the male predominance are unclear. Provocative angiography plays a key role in diagnosis, and both medical treatment and neurosurgical intervention may prevent recurrence.","Golomb, Meredith R; Ducis, Katrina A; Martinez, Mesha L",Journal of child neurology,330,15

This study aimed to quantify and identify bacteria in intraoperative bronchial fluids and to evaluate the relationship between impairment of cough/swallowing reflexes and silent aspiration of oral bacteria in elderly patients. After obtaining informed consent, cough and swallowing reflexes were assessed using an ultrasonic nebulizer and a nasal catheter, respectively. Using a micro-sampling probe, intraoperative bronchial fluids were collected from nine subjects with pulmonary carcinoma and cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates. After 7 days, CFUs were counted and isolated bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four subjects (aged 71.0 ± 8.4 years) had impaired swallowing reflexes with normal cough reflexes, whereas five subjects (73.6 ± 6.5 years) had normal cough and swallowing reflexes. The bacterial counts (mean CFU ± SD) tended to be higher in intraoperative bronchial fluids of subjects with impaired swallowing reflexes ([5.1 ± 7.7] × 10(5)) than in those of subjects with normal reflexes ([1.2 ± 1.9] × 10(5)); however, this difference was not statistically significant. Predominant isolates from intraoperative bronchial fluids were Streptococcus (41.8%), Veillonella (11.4%), Gemella (8.9%), Porphyromonas (7.6%), Olsenella (6.3%) and Eikenella (6.3%). These findings indicate that intraoperative bronchial fluids contain bacteria, probably derived from the oral microbiota, and suggest that silent aspiration of oral bacteria occurs in elderly patients irrespective of impairment of swallowing reflex.","Hasegawa, Ayako; Sato, Takuichi; Hoshikawa, Yasushi; Ishida, Naoko; Tanda, Naoko; Kawamura, Yoshiaki; Kondo, Takashi; Takahashi, Nobuhiro",Microbiology and immunology,330,8

As finance actors such as asset management firms, pension funds, private equity funds, state owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds engage in speculative farmland investment, commodity futures trading, and the conversion of farmland into a financial asset, power within agro-industrial food supply chains becomes increasingly concentrated. This has been associated with increased food prices and more processed food, contributing to obesogenic diets, hunger, and poorer health outcomes for many. The potential for negative social and environmental impacts has prompted awareness of the need for financial actors to demonstrate sustainability, responsibility and accountability in their farmland investments. METHODS This paper uses thematic analysis of qualitative interviews and key documents to assess four recent acquisitions of sugarcane land in North Queensland. We consider how companies' efforts to establish or maintain a social license to operate (SLO) intersect with their capital accumulation strategies. RESULTS Our findings demonstrate that the link between the commodification of 'unhealthy' food inputs (such as sugar) and financialisation remains outside the purview of financiers. Instead, agribusiness firms use narratives centred on biofuels investment and energy/food security to justify their legitimacy in the sugar sector. We organise our findings according to two 'narratives:' constructing trust and credibility through ethical compliance; and, biofuels expansion as a legitimate response to climate change. The concept of social license is much stronger in the second narrative, but health is largely missing. CONCLUSION The 'distancing' between responsibility and health outcomes highlights the limits to principles of responsible financial investment, and to the legitimacy of finance to claim an SLO - the ongoing approval and acceptance by society to conduct its activities.","Smith, Kiah; Lawrence, Geoffrey",International journal of health policy and management,330,1

It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries and is also rising at alarming rates in developing countries. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging viral infection without any approved treatment. Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and their risk factors in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Aim: The aim of our study is to establish an effect on serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after surgery in lung cancer patients. Methods:This was a prospective study. For the estimation of VEGF, 50 lung cancer patients were studied. Both preoperative and postoperative levels of VEGF were estimated for all subjects. Blood samples were obtained from all cases both preoperatively and postoperatively (four weeks after surgery). Blood samples of 100 age and sex matched healthy controls were collected from the Outpatient Departments of SKIMS to establish normal serum VEGF levels. Conclusion: Our findings show that serum VEGF levels are higher as the tumor stage progresses and tumor size increases, which explains the lower serum VEGF levels observed by us in the operable patient group.","Rather, Shabir Hussain; Bhat, Showkat Ali; Bashir, Arshad; Dar, Abdul Majeed; Zaman, Muzzafar; Nabi, Naveed; Shah, Aliya; Shah, Akif Mutahar",Maedica,330,1

METHOD Prevalence study. The presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in HCP of the HD. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used. Field work took place from April 24, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The age, sex, occupation (physician, nurse, etc.) and the work area (Primary Care, Emergency Room, etc.) were gathered. The IgG antibody prevalence was then calculated with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). To study the association between HCP characteristics and the presence IgG the Chi Square test was used, and to study the magnitude of association, the Odds Ratio (95%CI) was calculated. RESULTS Of the 4813 HCP in the HD, 4179 (87,1%) participated. Of these, 73,3% (3065) were women and 26,7% (1114) men. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 6,6% (95%CI: 5,8-7,3).

Vaccination against IB virus (IBV) is an important control measure against the disease. The objective of the present study was to test Avishield IB GI-13, the vaccine candidate against IBV, strain V-173/11 (GI-13 genotype), according to European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) efficacy requirements. Laboratory study on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens showed 100% protection against challenge 10 days after vaccination of 1-7 day-old chickens by three recommended routes. Duration of immunity was shown to be at least 8 weeks after vaccination. Chickens with maternally derived antibodies (MDA) were 100% protected against challenge 21 and 35 days after vaccination. Testing of the vaccine candidate in field conditions on commercial broiler and layer farms showed 80-90% protection against homologous challenge after spray (broilers and layers) or oral (broilers) vaccine administration. Serum antibodies were monitored during the studies, and although good seroconversion was observed in MDA-positive chickens 34 days after vaccination or later, the data from SPF chickens indicate that non-humoral immunity is important in protection against challenge. Neutralizing antibodies in tears were detected, however, their level could not be fully linked with individual protection scores. A cross-protection study showed that administration of the combination of Avishield IB H120 vaccine and Avishield IB GI-13 vaccine candidate at day 1, confers good protection against heterologous QX-like challenge. Stability of the vaccine after reconstitution in 0.2% skimmed milk solution or distilled water at room temperature was confirmed over the period of 3 h. The vaccine candidate fully complied with Ph.

Immune responses can affect the brain and might increase the risk of mood disorders, but longitudinal studies of comorbidity are lacking. OBJECTIVE To estimate the effect of autoimmune diseases and infections on the risk of developing mood disorders. DESIGN Nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study with 78 million person-years of follow-up. Data were analyzed with survival analysis techniques and adjusted for calendar year, age, and sex. SETTING Individual data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 3.56 million people born between 1945 and 1996 were followed up from January 1, 1977, through December 31, 2010, with 91, 637 people having hospital contacts for mood disorders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of a first lifetime diagnosis of mood disorder assigned by a psychiatrist in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or emergency department setting. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and accompanying 95% CIs are used as measures of relative risk. RESULTS A prior hospital contact because of autoimmune disease increased the risk of a subsequent mood disorder diagnosis by 45% (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.39-1.52). Any history of hospitalization for infection increased the risk of later mood disorders by 62% (IRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.60-1.64). The 2 risk factors interacted in synergy and increased the risk of subsequent mood disorders even further (IRR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.25-2.46). The number of infections and autoimmune diseases increased the risk of mood disorders in a dose-response relationship. Approximately one-third (32%) of the participants diagnosed as having a mood disorder had a previous hospital contact because of an infection, whereas 5% had a previous hospital contact because of an autoimmune disease.

An ample number of clinical trials with multiple drugs is underway to overcome the current perilous condition. Still, the situation is alarming with no therapeutic measure in our hand at present. Keeping the present scenario in mind, this review comprises the research, clinical knowledge, and repurposed herbals with regard to COVID-19. Preventive measures such as yoga, nasal breathing, and herbal administration could also provide protection and beneficial effects against coronavirus. Innumerable clinical trials are ongoing to manage COVID-19 and the drugs were selected on the basis of life cycle of coronavirus. The selection of herbals was done on the basis of the previous reported pharmacological activities and docking study. The results concluded that garlic, liquorice, and Ashwagandha have a potential against SARS-CoV-2, which was further proved via a docking study and their reported biological functions. The very well-known fact ""prevention is always better than cure"" is applied to overcome with coronavirus infection.

The posterior circulation represents a difficult therapeutic dilemma because of the close proximity of crucial life-sustaining brainstem structures. The use of flow diverter technology has been very limited in posterior circulation vessels. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We present the case of a 49-year-old female patient, who was diagnosed with a symptomatic large vertebrobasilar junction aneurysm, which was initially thought to be a proximal basilar dilatation. The aneurysm was later verified to arise from the proximal end of a basilar fenestration, distended by the aneurysm fundus. The small-caliber fenestration limbs were the only connection to the distal basilar artery, but were stretched laterally and concealed by the aneurysm fundus. This complex lesion was successfully treated by flow diverter deployment through one of the fenestration limbs, followed by coiling of the aneurysm fundus, and sacrificing the contralateral vertebral artery. A 6-month follow-up angiogram showed remodeling of the basilar artery and complete occlusion of the aneurysm with good clinical outcome. Careful diagnostic workup, multidisciplinary discussions, and the innovative use of versatile endovascular technology were crucial to achieve an optimal result in this case. CONCLUSION This is the first report of a successful basilar artery reconstruction for the treatment of a large atypical vertebrobasilar junction fenestration aneurysm by deployment of a flow diverter device directly in a small, obscured fenestration limb.","Toth, Gabor; Hui, Ferdinand; Bain, Mark",Operative neurosurgery,330,1

Almost 30 years ago, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) revolutionised the technique and outcomes of transanal surgery, first becoming the standard of treatment for large rectal adenomas, then offering a possibly curative treatment for early rectal cancer, and finally generating discussion on its potential role in combination with neoadjuvant therapies for the treatment of more invasive cancer. TEM afforded the advantage of combining a less invasive transanal approach with low recurrence rates thanks to enhanced visualization of the surgical field, which allows more precise dissection. We describe the current indications, the preoperative work-up, the surgical technique (with the aid of a video), postoperative management and results obtained in an over 20-year-long experience. Designed as an accurate means to allow excision of benign rectal neoplasms with a very low morbidity rate, TEM today is indicated as a curative treatment of malignant neoplasms that are histologically confirmed as pT1 sm1 carcinomas.

Their crystal structures have been studied using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (I) is a new member of the A+M2+M3+[PO4]2 family. Its open 3D framework built by AlO5 and PO4 polyhedra includes small channels populated by columns of CuO6 octahedra sharing edges, and large channels where K+ ions are deposited. It is assumed that the stability of this structure type is due to the pair substitution of Cu/Al with Ni/Fe, Co/Fe or Mg/Fe in different representatives of the series.

We evaluated COVID-19 incidence among our hemodialysis patients and investigated the most probable immune mechanisms against COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Başkent University has 21 dialysis centers across Turkey, with 2420 patients on hemodialysis and 30 on peritoneal dialysis. Among these, we retrospectively evaluated 602 patients (257 female/345 male) with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis as renal replacement therapy; 7 patients (1.1%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2. We retrospectively collected patient demographic characteristics, clinical data, and immunological factors affecting the clinical course of the disease. We divided patients into groups and included 2 control groups (individuals with normal renal functions): group I included COVID-19-positive patients with normal renal function, group II included COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients, group III included COVID-19-negative hemodialysis patients, and group IV included COVID-19-negative patients with normal renal function. Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and typing of human leukocyte antigens were analyzed in all groups, with killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor genes analyzed only in COVID-19-positive patients and healthy controls. RESULTS No deaths occurred among the 7 COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients. Group I patients were significantly older than patients in groups II and III (P = .039, P = .030, respectively) but not significantly different from group IV (P = .060). Absolute counts of natural killer cells in healthy controls were higherthan in other groups (but not significantly). ActivatedT cells were significantly increased in both COVID-19-positive groups versus COVID-19-negative groups. Groups showed significant differences in C and DQ loci with respect to distribution of alleles in both HLA classes. CONCLUSIONS Although immunocompromised patients are at greater risk for COVID-19, we found lower COVID-19 incidence in our hemodialysis patients, which should be further investigated in in vitro and molecular studies.","Arslan, Hande; Musabak, Ugur; Ayvazoglu Soy, Ebru H; Kurt Azap, Ozlem; Sayin, Burak; Akcay, Sule; Haberal, Kemal Murat; Akdur, Aydincan; Yildirim, Sedat; Haberal, Mehmet",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,330,1

AREAS COVERED Although a massive endothelial disruption is a rare condition, caused by acute and uncontrolled inflammatory responses (e.g., the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection), more frequently the vascular tree is the first target of slowly progressive inflammatory processes which affect the integrity of endothelium and its ""barrier"" function, supporting the onset of atherosclerotic plaque and spreading inflammation. This endothelial dysfunction leads to decrease NO biosynthesis, impaired regulation of vascular tone and increased platelet aggregation. Such a chronic sub-clinic inflammation leads to macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, many efforts should be addressed to find useful approaches to preserve vascular endothelium from inflammation. In this review, the authors have evaluated the most recent strategies to counteract this pathological condition. EXPERT OPINION The therapeutic and nutraceutical approaches represent useful tools to treat, slow down or prevent different phases of vascular inflammation. In particular, the pharmacological approach should be used in advanced phases characterized by clinical signs of vascular disease, whilst the nutraceutical approach may represent a promising preventive strategy to preserve the integrity of the endothelial tissue.","Martelli, Alma; Citi, Valentina; Calderone, Vincenzo",Expert opinion on drug discovery,330,1

We present a retrospective - subgroup analysis aimed at identifying predictive factors for difficult mask ventilation (DMV) in patients undergoing pre-operative airway assessment before elective surgery at a major teaching hospital. METHODS Data for this retrospective analysis were derived from a database of airway assessments, management plans, and outcomes that were collected prospectively from August 2008 to May 2010 at a Level 1 academic trauma center. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the difficulty of mask ventilation and the cohorts were analyzed using univariate analysis and stepwise selection method. RESULTS A total of 1399 pre-operative assessments were completed with documentation stating that mask ventilation was attempted. Of those 1399, 124 (8.9%) patients were found to be difficult to mask ventilate. A comparison of patients with and without difficult mask ventilation identified seven risk factors for DMV: age, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, history of difficult intubation, presence of facial hair, perceived short neck and obstructive sleep apnea. Although seven risk factors were identified, no individual subject had more than four risk factors. CONCLUSION The results of this study confirm that in a real world clinical setting, the incidence of DMV is not negligible and suggest the use of a simple bedside predictive score to improve the accuracy of DMV prediction, thereby improving patient safety. Further prospective studies to validate this score would be useful.","Cattano, Davide; Killoran, Peter V; Cai, Chunyan; Katsiampoura, Anastasia D; Corso, Ruggero M; Hagberg, Carin A",F1000Research,330,1

However, the spillover of CPV-2 to noncarnivores is rarely mentioned. Taiwanese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla pentadactyla) are threatened due to habitat fragmentation and prevalent animal trafficking. Interactions between Taiwanese pangolins, humans, and domestic animals have become more frequent in recent years. However, information about the susceptibility of pangolins to common infectious agents of domestic animals has been lacking. From October 2017 to June 2019, 4 pangolins that were rescued and treated in wildlife rescue centers in central and northern Taiwan presented with gastrointestinal signs. Gross and histopathological examination revealed the main pathologic changes to be necrotic enteritis with involvement of the crypts in all intestinal segments in 2 pangolins. By immunohistochemistry for CPV-2, there was positive labeling of cryptal epithelium throughout the intestine, and immunolabeling was also present in epidermal cells adjacent to a surgical amputation site, and in mononuclear cells in lymphoid tissue. The other 2 pangolins had mild enteritis without crypt involvement, and no immunolabeling was detected. The nucleic acid sequences of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons from these 4 pangolins were identical to a Chinese CPV-2c strain from domestic dogs. Quantitative PCR revealed a higher ratio of CPV-2 nucleic acid to internal control gene in the 2 pangolins with severe intestinal lesions and positive immunoreactivity.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects. RESULTS The search resulted in 13 941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n=174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n=52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n=17 934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n=528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n=467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited.

The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB.","Lyu, Lingna; Li, Zihui; Pan, Liping; Jia, Hongyan; Sun, Qi; Liu, Qiuyue; Zhang, Zongde",BMC infectious diseases,330,1

Data were analyzed with quality improvement methodology including Statistical Process Control charts (XmR and U charts). INTERVENTION Addition of a geriatric medicine service providing automatic comprehensive geriatric assessment and co-management consultative services for all admitted patients from admission onwards who met criteria for the intervention. The intervention commenced on August 1, 2013. MEASUREMENTS Outcome measures were length of stay (days), service interruption frequency, and average functional independence measure (FIM) change (discharge FIM minus admission FIM) which uses the validated FIM score, a marker of functional ability. A 22 point change in FIM score is clinically relevant. RESULTS Patient characteristics: general rehabilitation patients (n = 1395, mean age = 79.7, 50.1% female) and dialysis rehabilitation patients (n = 838, mean age = 72.8, 41.8% female). The average FIM change following intervention improved from 20.8 to 29.3 in the general rehabilitation cohort (40.6% improvement, SD = 5.51) and from 22.1 to 30.6 in the dialysis rehabilitation cohort (38.6% improvement, SD = 5.88). Changes in length of stay (24.9%-28.1% reduction) and service interruption frequency (34.3%-49.7% reduction) were also observed. CONCLUSION Introduction of a geriatric medicine service for rehabilitation inpatients was associated with significant FIM score improvements. Our results suggest this intervention contributes to important gains in functional independence in reduced time for older adults receiving inpatient rehabilitative care.","Fitzgerald, Sabrina R; Romanovsky, Lindy; Norman, Richard; Sinha, Samir K",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,330,1

That being said, it was expected that the intelligentsia would focus their attention on these processes; however, figures such as Agamben and Žižek leaped at the opportunity to frame the pandemic in terms of their perennially unfulfilled socio-ideological prophecies rather than attempting to understand the reality of the pandemic as a health/disease/care-prevention process. Taking these dominant tendencies among contemporary intellectuals as a starting point, in this article I analyze the self-care processes of micro-groups related to disease, which have informed health policies in all countries. In other words, the core strategy for combatting COVID-19 has been and continues to be self-care, which constitutes one of the basic structures that micro-groups generate in order to live and to survive, but that biomedicine has coopted as a ""policy"" of its own making, thereby masking once again the true locus of power in containing the pandemic.","Menéndez, Eduardo L",Salud colectiva,330,28

Methods: The case record files of an inpatient psychiatric unit from March 23 to September 22, 2019, and March 23 to September 22, 2020 were retrieved. Sociodemographic data, admission criteria of the patients, clinical diagnosis (as per ICD-10 criteria), duration of stay in the ward, and details of capacity assessment were assessed. The data collected were tabulated as per coding system and analyzed and compared using statistical analysis system software. Results: Of a total of 312 admissions, 236 were in 2019 and 76 were in 2020 (P < .05), which was a significant (P < .05) decrease. More patients admitted in 2020 were in the age group of 30-39 years (P < .05), were residents of Chandigarh (P < .05), were housewives by occupation (P < .05), had incomes < 3,500 Indian rupees (US$ 48.01) per month (P < .01), were Hindu, and belonged to extended families (P < .05). The predominant reasons for admission in 2020 were complicated withdrawals, noncompliance to treatment (P < .05), and aggravation of psychiatric illness due to comorbid substance use. The ICD diagnoses schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorder (F20-29) and mood disorders, predominantly mania (F30-31) were significantly higher and mental and behavioral disorder due to psychoactive substance use (F10-19) was lower among patients admitted in 2020. Conclusions: The results show that the numbers of admissions to the psychiatry ward in 2020 were significantly lower than pre-COVID 2019, and the predominant reasons for admission were complicated withdrawals due to psychoactive substance abuse and noncompliance to treatment. Also, the mean duration of stay was longer in 2020 compared to the previous year.","Sidana, Ajeet; Goel, Vibha; Kaur, Sahildeep",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,330,1

Here, we compare B-cell and serum auto-antibody profiles between patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CCLE, and overlap conditions. METHODS B-cells were compared by flow cytometry amongst healthy controls, CCLE without systemic lupus (CCLE+/SLE-) and SLE patients with (SLE+/CCLE+) or without CCLE (SLE+/CCLE-). Serum was analyed for autoreactive 9G4+, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-chromatin and anti-RNA antibodies by ELISA and for anti-RNA binding proteins (RBP) by luciferase immunoprecipitation. RESULTS Patients with CCLE+/SLE- share B-cell abnormalities with SLE including decreased unswitched memory and increased effector B-cells albeit at a lower level than SLE patients. Similarly, both SLE and CCLE+/SLE- patients have elevated 9G4+ IgG autoantibodies despite lower levels of anti-nucleic acid and anti-RBP antibodies in CCLE+/SLE-. CCLE+/SLE- patients could be stratified into those with SLE-like B-cell profiles and a separate group with normal B-cell profiles. The former group was more serologically active and more likely to have disseminated skin lesions. CONCLUSION CCLE displays perturbations in B-cell homeostasis and partial B-cell tolerance breakdown. Our study demonstrates that this entity is immunologically heterogeneous and includes a disease segment whose B-cell compartment resembles SLE and is clinically associated with enhanced serological activity and more extensive skin disease. This picture suggests that SLE-like B-cell changes in primary CCLE may help identify patients at risk for subsequent development of SLE. B-cell profiling in CCLE might also indentify candidates who would benefit from B-cell targeted therapies.","Jenks, Scott A; Wei, Chungwen; Bugrovsky, Regina; Hill, Aisha; Wang, Xiaoqian; Rossi, Francesca M; Cashman, Kevin; Woodruff, Matthew C; Aspey, Laura D; Lim, S Sam; Bao, Gaobin; Drenkard, Cristina; Sanz, Ignacio",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,330,19

The potent invasion and migration of HCC mainly impact the prognosis and recurrence of the disease. Our previous study found that miR-99b was highly expressed in HCC, and its expression was associated with vascular invasion. It was speculated that miR-99b may play a role in HCC invasion and migration, while the specific mechanism remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS qRT-PCR was applied to detect expressions of miR-99b and KAI1 genes in L02, HepG2, and MHCC97H cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-99b inhibitor, miR-99b mimic, and NC. Flow cytometry was used to test cell cycle and apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was adopted to validate the target gene of miR-99b. Wound healing assay was used to detect cell migration. Transwell assay was performed to detect cell invasion. Western blot was performed to detect KAI1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expressions. Immunofluorescence assay was adopted to test Vimentin expression. RESULTS The level of miR-99b was reduced in L02 while up-regulated in MHCC97H. By contrast, the expression of KAI1 was increased in L02 but declined in MHCC97H. The transfection of miR-99b mimic inhibited HepG2 apoptosis and accelerated cell cycle. MiR-99b suppressed KAI gene expression through targeting its 3'-UTR. MiR-99b mimic or si-KAI1 transfection promoted cell invasion and migration, while their simultaneous action significantly enhanced cell invasion and migration. The overexpression of miR-99b or knockdown of KAI1 significantly weakened HepG2 cell adhesion, reduced E-cadherin expression, upregulated N-cadherin and Vimentin, and promoted cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSIONS MiR-99b contributes to promoting function in HCC migration and invasion through inhibiting KAI1 expression.","Liu, C-J; Yang, J-H; Huang, F-Z; Liu, C-P; Mao, X-H; Yi, W-M; Shen, X-B; Peng, C; Chen, M-F; Jiang, B; Wu, J-S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,330,32

The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. RESULTS Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. CONCLUSIONS Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.","Brinjikji, W; Iyer, V N; Yamaki, V; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Thielen, K R; Swanson, K L; Wood, C P",AJNR.

A study was established to assess if the long-term feeding of a gamma-irradiated diet could induce this disease. Cats fed exclusively on diet irradiated at 25.7-38.1 kGy (""typical"" dose) and 38.1-53.6 kGy (high-end dose), respectively, developed typical lesions with attendant, progressively severe ataxia between study days 140 and 174. The onset of ataxia at day 140 and the number of animals affected at this time were similar in animals fed each ration. A maximum ataxia ""score"" was first reached by an animal on the high-end dose diet on day 167 and by 2 cats fed the ""typical-end"" dose diet 21 days later. Ataxic cats and 1 animal euthanized on day 93 prior to the onset of ataxia exhibited varying degrees of Wallerian degeneration in the spinal cord and brain, similar to the spontaneous disease. The elevated total antioxidant status of spinal cord segments and hepatic superoxide dismutase concentration of cats fed typical and high-end treated diets suggested free-radical involvement in the pathogenesis. The significantly elevated peroxide concentrations of the irradiated diets (1,040% and 6,440% of untreated values) may have resulted in increased oxidative insult, a factor possibly exacerbated by the treated diets' reduced vitamin A content. This study has reproduced leukoencephalomyelopathy in cats similar to spontaneous outbreaks by feeding a gamma-irradiated dry diet with elevated peroxide and reduced vitamin A concentrations.","Caulfield, C D; Kelly, J P; Jones, B R; Worrall, S; Conlon, L; Palmer, A C; Cassidy, J P",Veterinary pathology,330,6

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, exposed significant shortcomings of the Russian healthcare reform, showing serious problems in the shortage of specialists, hospital beds, protective equipment, ventilators, tests, and medicines. The reduction of hospital beds and the number of infectious diseases doctors in order to increase the average salary in healthcare has led to the inability of the Russian healthcare system to cope with the spread of coronavirus infection without involving residents, professors, teachers and students of medical organizations. At the present stage of development, the issues of combating the spread of coronavirus infection, mobilization and professional training of medical workers are of particular relevance. Nevertheless, despite the results of the health care reform, which led to a massive reduction of medical organizations in our country, the number of doctors per 10,000 people in 2018 was 47.9 employees, over the past 20 years, has not changed much in the direction of reduction. In our view, we should not talk about a global reduction in human resources in healthcare.

Previous studies showed that in ovo vaccination with HVT enhances innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses in egg-type chicken embryos. This study evaluated if in ovo vaccination with HVT hastens immunocompetence of commercial meat-type chickens and optimized vaccination variables (dose and strain of HVT) to accelerate immunocompetence. A conventional HVT vaccine was given at recommended dose (RD), HVT-RD = 6080 plaque forming units (PFU), double-dose (2x), half-dose (1/2), or quarter-dose (1/4). Two rHVTs were given at RD: rHVT-A = 7380 PFU, rHVT-B = 8993 PFU. Most, if not all, treatments enhanced splenic lymphoproliferation with Concanavalin A and increased the percentage of granulocytes at day of age. Dose had an effect and HVT-RD was ideal. An increase of wing-web thickness after exposure to phytohemagglutinin-L was only detected after vaccination with HVT-RD. Furthermore, compared to sham-inoculated chickens, chickens in the HVT-RD had an increased percentage of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T-helper cells, and increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II on most cell subsets (CD45+ cells, non-T leukocytes, T cells and the CD8+ and T cell receptor γδ T-cell subsets). Other treatments (HVT-1/2 and rHVT-B) share some of these features but differences were not as remarkable as in the HVT-RD group. Expression of MHC-I was reduced, compared to sham-inoculated chickens, in most of the cell phenotypes evaluated in the HVT-RD, HVT-2x and rHVT-A groups, while no effect was observed in other treatments. The effect of in ovo HVT on humoral immune responses (antibody responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and to a live infectious bronchitis/Newcastle disease vaccine) was minimal. Our study demonstrates in ovo vaccination with HVT in meat-type chickens can accelerate innate and adaptive immunity and we could optimize such effect by modifying the vaccine dose.","Boone, Allison C; Käser, Tobias; Cortes, Aneg L; Kulkarni, Raveendra R; López de Juan Abad, Blanca A; Villalobos, Tarsicio; Esandi, Javier; Perozo, Francisco; Lemiere, Stephane; Gimeno, Isabel M",Vaccine,330,1

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding interferon gamma (IFNG), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) have been associated with increased and decreased risk of developing FIP. This study was designed to determine whether these associations were present in a UK population of pedigree cats using samples from cats euthanased with a confirmed diagnosis (FIP, n = 22; non-FIP, n = 10) or clinically healthy cats over 11 years of age (n = 3). METHODS DNA was extracted from tissue (n = 32) or blood (n = 3) and PCR performed for regions of IFNG, TNFA and CD209. PCR amplicons were sequenced, each SNP genotype was determined, and genotype/allele frequency for each SNP and FIP status were compared. RESULTS No significant association was found between the genotype and FIP status for any SNP analysed. There was a trend for the heterozygous CT genotype at both IFNG g.401 and IFNG g.408 to be associated with FIP (P = 0.13), but this genotype was also found in a substantial proportion of non-FIP cats. There was also a trend for the heterozygous CT genotype at IFNG g.428 to be associated with FIP (P = 0.06), although most cats with FIP had the CC genotype at this locus. No associations were found between any allele at TNFA g.-421, CD209 g.1900, CD209 g.2276, CD209 g.2392 and CD209 g.2713 and FIP.

Few, if any, studies have shown an advantage of one type of NCPAP over another. It has been theorized that bubble-generated NCPAP may be advantageous for the preterm neonate versus traditionally used ventilator-generated NCPAP. The aim of this study was to examine for any short-term differences in physiologic parameters in preterm subjects receiving these two different methods of NCPAP. METHODS We conducted a randomized, prospective, cross-over pilot study of preterm infants being treated with NCPAP in the neonatal intensive care unit. Subjects were continuously monitored for several physiologic parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction using routine neonatal monitors and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while on 2 h of bubble NCPAP and 2 h of ventilator NCPAP. Subjects were randomized to be monitored while either starting on bubble NCPAP and then switching to ventilator NCPAP or starting on ventilator NCPAP and switching to bubble NCPAP. RESULTS Eighteen subjects were included. We found no statistically significant difference in any of the physiologic parameters while subjects were receiving bubble NCPAP versus ventilator NCPAP during the monitoring time periods. While on bubble NCPAP, subjects showed a trend toward decreasing respiratory rate and decreasing cerebral fractional oxygen extraction over time, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION There appears to be no difference in immediate physiologic effects between bubble NCPAP and ventilator NCPAP. This does not preclude the possibility of potential long-term differences, but any differences seen would likely be based on mechanisms that take more time to develop. A larger prospective trial is warranted to confirm our findings.","Guerin, Craig; Bailey, Sean M; Mally, Pradeep V; Rojas, Mary; Bhutada, Alok; Rastogi, Shantanu",Journal of perinatal medicine,330,16

Initial series have shown a low complication rate with good efficacy. OBJECTIVE To report clinical and anatomical results of the WEB treatment in the cumulated population of WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm) and French Observatory series. METHODS WEBCAST and French Observatory are single-arm, prospective, multicenter, Good Clinical Practice studies dedicated to the evaluation of WEB treatment. Ruptured and unruptured bifurcation aneurysms located in the basilar artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior communicating artery, and internal carotid artery terminus were included in both studies. Clinical data were independently evaluated. Postoperative, 6-month (in WEBCAST), and 1-year aneurysm occlusion was independently evaluated with a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The cumulated population was 113 patients (74 female, 65.5%) 33 to 74 years of age with 114 aneurysms with a mean neck size of 5.6 mm. There was no mortality at 1 month, and morbidity was 2.7%. A statistically significant difference in the rate of occurrence of thromboembolic events was observed between the use of any antiplatelet agent and the use of no antiplatelet agent (P < .001). At 1 year, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed in 56.0%, neck remnant in 26.0%, and aneurysm remnant in 18.0%. Worsening of aneurysm occlusion between the procedure and 12 months was observed in 2.0% and between 6 months and 1 year in 7.1%. CONCLUSION The analysis in this large cumulated population of studies confirms favorable safety and efficacy of WEB treatment.","Pierot, Laurent; Spelle, Laurent; Molyneux, Andrew; Byrne, James",Neurosurgery,330,24

Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.","Milman, Evgenia; Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Death studies,330,6

The authors thus aimed to assess the effect of case volume on the rate of various types of complications after clipping of UIAs. METHODS Using information on the outcomes of inpatient admissions for surgical clipping of UIAs collected within a national database, the relationship of institutional case volume to the incidence of different types of complications after clipping was investigated. Complications were subdivided into different categories, which included all complications, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, medical complications, infectious complications, complications related to anesthesia, and wound complications. The relationship of case volume to different types of complications was assessed using linear regression analysis. The relationships between case volume and overall complication and stroke rates were fit with both linear and quadratic equations. The numerical cutoff for institutional case volume above and below which the authors found the greatest differences in mean overall complication and stroke rate was determined using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS Between October 2012 and September 2015, 125 health care institutions reported patient outcomes from a total of 6040 cases of clipping of UIAs. On linear regression analysis, increasing case volume was negatively correlated to both overall complications (r2 = 0.046, p = 0.0234) and stroke (r2 = 0.029, p = 0.0557) rate, although the relationship of case volume to the complication (r2 = 0.092) and stroke (r2 = 0.067) rate was better fit with a quadratic equation. On CART analysis, the cutoff for the case number that yielded the greatest difference in overall complications and stroke rate between higher- or lower-volume centers was 6 cases/year and 3 cases/year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Although the authors confirm that increasing case volume is associated with reduced complications after clipping of UIAs, their results suggest that the relationship between case volume and complications is not necessarily linear. Moreover, these results indicate that the effect of case volume on outcome is most evident between very-low-volume centers relative to centers with a medium-to-high volume.","Rinaldo, Lorenzo; McCutcheon, Brandon A; Murphy, Meghan E; Shepherd, Daniel L; Maloney, Patrick R; Kerezoudis, Panagiotis; Bydon, Mohamad; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery,330,1

RESEARCH QUESTION/AIM/OBJECTIVES/METHOD The purpose of this basic qualitative descriptive study is to describe the willingness of graduating nurses to provide care during the Covid-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT One week prior to graduation, students were required to submit a written assignment describing willingness to practice in light of the ongoing pandemic. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study was approved by an Institutional Review Board. FINDINGS/RESULTS Eighty-four (n = 84) assignments were used for analysis. Of these, 82% (n = 69) of the graduating nurses describe a willingness to voluntarily care for Covid-19 patients. After summarizing narrative responses, two themes emerged including self-assessment of personal and familial risk and conflicting obligations. DISCUSSION The assessment of risk to self and family are key in determining whether graduating nurses will care for Covid-19 patients. Conflicting obligations may contribute to stress and uncertainty potentially leading to early burnout. CONCLUSION Findings from this study can inform academicians of the need to adequality prepare graduating nurses for Covid-19-associated risks and ethical decision making.

METHODS This prospective observational study enrolled adult patients undergoing elective neck or thyroid procedures below the mandible. Using fibreoptic bronchoscopy, distances from the RAE tube adapter to the carina and to the tube tip were measured in the neutral position and after neck extension with a 10 cm D-shaped gel shoulder positioner. The change in distance of the RAE tube tip migration was compared with the change in TMD in each patient. RESULTS This study enrolled 106 patients. During neck extension with a 10-cm shoulder positioner, RAE tubes cranially migrated 2.7 cm from the neutral position, but RAE tube migration was not correlated with the change in external TMD. CONCLUSION Oral RAE tube migration was not significantly correlated with the change in external TMD. Due to their large variability, changes in TMD were not useful predictors of RAE tube migration.","Jin, Seok-Joon; Choi, Yoon-Ji; Park, Sang-Wook; Lee, Yu-Mi",The Journal of international medical research,330,1

Thus, we aimed to describe the therapeutic history of feline cases infected by itraconazole-resistant Sporothrix brasiliensis in an endemic region of Southern Brazil. Medical records of cats attended at the Veterinary Clinic Hospital (Pelotas/RS, Brazil) between 2016 and 2017 were reviewed. Twelve cases of infection by S. brasiliensis with that showed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (≥ 4 μg/mL) to itraconazole by M38-A2 of CLSI were selected. At the hospital consultation, disseminated (cats 1-l0, 12) and localized (cat 11) skin lesions remained in the cats, even after treatment with fluconazole, ketoconazole (02/12), and itraconazole (ITZ, 09/12) performed before this study. High doses (25-100 mg/kg/day) of ITZ for up to 4 months (03/12, cats 2, 6, 12) or over 12 months (05/12, cats 1, 5, 7, 8, 11) did not provide a clinical cure, except for the association of ITZ plus potassium iodide (01/12, cat 12) for 3 months, which proved useful in infections with itraconazole-resistant S. brasiliensis. However, the combined issues of abandonment of therapy by owners for financial reasons, difficulties surrounding therapy administration (03/12, cats 6, 11, 12), and the inappropriate choice of medication (01/12, cat 6), together reflect the reality of this endemic region, which greatly compromises clinical healing. This study highlighted the occurrence of refractory cases by itraconazole-resistant S. brasiliensis in cats from Southern Brazil, as well as the abandonment of treatment and therapeutic errors.

METHODS We combined data from 3 large cohorts of consecutive patients diagnosed with CeAD (i.e., Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients-Plus consortium). We dichotomized cases into 2 groups, age ≥60 and <60 years, and compared clinical characteristics, risk factors, vascular features, and 3-month outcome between the groups. First, we performed a combined analysis of pooled individual patient data. Secondary analyses were done within each cohort and across cohorts. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated. RESULTS Among 2,391 patients diagnosed with CeAD, we identified 177 patients (7.4%) aged ≥60 years. In this age group, cervical pain (ORadjusted 0.47 [0.33-0.66]), headache (ORadjusted 0.58 [0.42-0.79]), mechanical trigger events (ORadjusted 0.53 [0.36-0.77]), and migraine (ORadjusted 0.58 [0.39-0.85]) were less frequent than in younger patients. In turn, hypercholesterolemia (ORadjusted 1.52 [1.1-2.10]) and hypertension (ORadjusted 3.08 [2.25-4.22]) were more frequent in older patients.

Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.","Sedaghat, Ahmad R; Gengler, Isabelle; Speth, Marlene M",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,330,15

Critically ill cases of COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failures. However, no effective drugs have been available till now, leading to more than 300,000 deaths up to 29 April 2020. Here, we present a critically ill case utilizing umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs). CASE PRESENTATION A 72-year-old man was admitted, with the diagnosis of COVID-19, ARDS, type-2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, renal insufficiency, and hypertension. His clinical condition continually developed to be life-threatening even receiving various treatment options including antiviral therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Between 28 February and 8 March 2020, the patient was given 5-time intravenous infusions of UCB-MSCs. His hematological and biochemical indexes, including lymphocytes and renal function improved. Pulmonary static compliance increased significantly and PaO2/FiO2 ratio maintained stable. On March 10, he received lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS Our current findings suggested that UCB-MSCs therapy may show some positive effect in treating critical COVID-19 to some extent, for its delaying deterioration of the disease and efficacy in respiratory and renal function, though limited.","Tao, Jianxin; Nie, Yunjuan; Wu, Hui; Cheng, Liang; Qiu, Yuanwang; Fu, Juanjuan; Jiang, Xiufeng",Journal of infection in developing countries,330,1

However, lead-free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we develop a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead-free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr 3 NCs (red-color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs 3 MnBr 5 NCs (green-color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr 3 NCs and 0D Cs 3 MnBr 5 NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs 2 MnBr 4 ·2H 2 O NCs (blue-color emission).

Additionally, 116 viral, environmental swab samples were also collected from the Wuhan and Guangzhou seafood markets. Five typical enteric bacterial pathogens (Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., and Listeria monocytogenes) and four viruses (Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus, and Sapovirus) were detected positive. Results showed that eight Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates appeared in seafood imported to Dalian, Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing. In contrast, Vibrio fluvialis and Aeromonas were isolated in another two samples. Norovirus was detected in one oyster sample imported from France and environmental surface in Guangzhou. The remaining pathogens were negative in all the samples being tested. With 120 V. parahaemolyticus isolates from the above countries, the genomic analysis revealed that sequence type ST1152 isolates imported from Canada were clustered with two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from Canada.

While media outlets have portrayed health care workers actively battling this disease, there has been little to no discussion of how the pandemic has affected medical students. Currently practicing physicians chose their specialties long before the threat of this novel coronavirus was known. It is unclear how the pandemic may change the mindset of current medical students and their decisions regarding their choice of residency specialty following graduation. Study Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine if the COVID19 pandemic has affected future residency specialty choices for current M.D. candidate students. Methods: In September 2020, a brief (approximately 3 minute) anonymous survey of first through fourth-year medical students was created utilizing Qualtrics software and emailed via medical school listservs. Survey questions included basic demographics, what residency specialty they plan to pursue, and what residency specialty they planned to pursue prior to the COVID19 pandemic. The electronic survey was disseminated to current M.D. candidate students (first year [MS-1] through fourth year [MS-4]) at a large, suburban medical school in New Jersey with over 600 students over four clinical and pre-clinical years. A 14 day period was provided for medical students to complete the survey, with a reminder sent to students at the 7 day mark. Results: A total of 87 medical students responded to the survey. Of those that responded, 21% were MS-1, 18% were MS-2, 29% were MS-3, and 29% were MS-4. Eighty-six participants chose to report a sex. Of those, 60% identified as female. Seventy percent of those who responded knew someone personally who was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Eleven respondents intended to go into emergency medicine. Five medical students planned on selecting a different residency specialty based on the pandemic. Of those, two had initially planned to pursue emergency medicine and changed specialties based on the pandemic (to radiology and ophthalmology). Of the remaining students, they made the following changes in specialty: psychiatry to anesthesiology, orthopedic to general surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology to undecided. Of these five students who switched specialties, 4 (80%) knew someone negatively affected by COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect it has had on medical student education, the majority of current medical students who responded to this survey have not let it affect their decision regarding which residency specialty to pursue. Of the small sample of students in this survey that did change their decision regarding residency specialty, two students made the decision to switch from emergency medicine to radiology and ophthalmology.","Esposito, A.; Patti, L.; Laumbach, S.; Polvino, D.; Butler, L.; Heinert, S.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,330,7

However, longitudinal analyses are scarce. Methods An online, longitudinal study was conducted among self-selected UK adults (n=1,818), involving three surveys during 2020 (May-June, August-September, November-December), covering height, weight and sociodemographic, COVID-19-related and behavioural measures. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Results Self-reported average weight and body mass index (BMI) significantly increased from May-June to August-September (74.95kg to 75.33kg, 26.22kg/m2 to 26.36kg/m2, both p<0.001), and then significantly decreased to November-December (to 75.06kg, 26.27kg/m2, both p<0.01), comparable to May-June levels (p=0.274/0.204). However, there was great interindividual variation, with 37.0%/26.7% reporting an increase and 34.5%/26.3% reporting a decrease in weight/BMI greater than 0.5kg/0.5kg/m2, respectively from May-June to November-December. The average weight/BMI increase was 3.64kg (95% confidence interval: 3.32,3.97)/1.64kg/m2 (1.49,1.79), and the average weight/BMI decrease was 3.59kg (3.34,3.85)/1.53kg/m2 (1.42,1.63). In fully adjusted models, increase in weight/BMI across surveys was significantly negatively associated with initial BMI, and positively associated with monthly high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks intake and alcohol consumption, and for BMI only, older age. However, associations were time-varying, such that lower initial BMI, higher HFSS snacks intake and high-risk alcohol consumption were associated with maintenance of increased weight/BMI from August-September to November-December. Conclusion The average weight/BMI of UK adults increased during the early pandemic months, before returning to baseline levels in November-December 2020. However, this masks substantial interindividual variation in weight/BMI trajectories, indicating vulnerabilities associated with changes in food and alcohol consumption throughout the pandemic.","Dicken, S.

Detection of viral RNA provides the highest sensitivity and specificity for detection of early and asymptomatic infections. Thus, this work aimed at developing a label-free genosensor composed of graphene as a working electrode that could be embedded into a flex printed circuit board (FPCB) for the rapid, sensitive, amplification-free and label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2. To facilitate liquid handling and ease of use, the developed biosensor was embedded with a user-friendly reservoir chamber. As a proof-of-concept, detection of a synthetic DNA strand matching the sequence of ORF1ab was performed as a two-step strategy involving the immobilization of a biotinylated complementary sequence on a streptavidin-modified surface, followed by hybridization with the target sequence recorded by the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) technique in the presence of a ferro/ferricyanide redox couple. The effective design of the sensing platform improved its selectivity and sensitivity and allowed DNA quantification ranging from 100 fg/mL to 1 mu g/mL. Combining the electrochemical technique with FPCB enabled rapid detection of the target sequence using a small volume of the sample (5-20 mu L). We achieved a limit-of-detection of 100 fg/mL, whereas the predicted value was similar to 33 fg/mL, equivalent to approximately 5 x 10(5) copies/mL and comparable to sensitivities provided by isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests. We believe that the developed approach proves the ability of an FPCB-implemented DNA sensor to act as a potentially simpler and more affordable diagnostic assay for viral infections in Point-Of-Care (POC) applications.","Damiati, S.; Sopstad, S.; Peacock, M.; Akhtar, A.

However, due to the regulation of protecting patients' privacy, sensitive individual patient data (IPD) are usually not allowed to be shared across sites. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for distributed linear mixed models (DLMMs). Our proposed DLMM algorithm can achieve exactly the same results as if we had pooled IPD from all sites, hence the lossless property. The DLMM algorithm requires each site to contribute some aggregated data (AD) in only one iteration. We apply the proposed DLMM algorithm to analyze the association of length of stay of COVID-19 hospitalization with demographic and clinical characteristics using the administrative claims database from the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Research Database.","Luo, C.; Islam, M.

NK cells are the predominant innate lymphoid cells that mediate anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. However, whether and how m6A modifications affect NK cell immunity remains unknown. Here, we discover that YTHDF2, a well-known m6A reader, is upregulated in NK cells upon activation by cytokines, tumors, and cytomegalovirus infection. Ythdf2 deficiency in NK cells impairs NK cell anti-tumor and anti-viral activity in vivo. YTHDF2 maintains NK cell homeostasis and terminal maturation, correlating with modulating NK cell trafficking and regulating Eomes, respectively. YTHDF2 promotes NK cell effector function and is required for IL-15-mediated NK cell survival and proliferation by forming a STAT5-YTHDF2 positive feedback loop. Transcriptome-wide screening identifies Tardbp to be involved in cell proliferation or survival as a YTHDF2-binding target in NK cells. Collectively, we elucidate the biological roles of m6A modifications in NK cells and highlight a new direction to harness NK cell anti-tumor immunity.","Ma, Shoubao; Yan, Jiazhuo; Barr, Tasha; Zhang, Jianying; Chen, Zhenhua; Wang, Li-Shu; Sun, Joseph C.; Chen, Jianjun; Caligiuri, Michael A; Yu, Jianhua",bioRxiv,330,24

To date, vaccines are available in the developed countries to prevent the infection of this virus, however, medicines are necessary to help control COVID-19. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) causes the common cold. The main protease (Mpro) is an essential enzyme required for the multiplication of these two viruses in the host cells, and thus is an appropriate candidate to screen potential medicinal compounds. Flavonols and dihydroflavonols are two groups of plant flavonoids. In this study, we report docking simulation with two Mpro enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)-dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercetin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1’, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Their affinity scores ranged from −8.8 to −7.4. Likewise, these compounds were predicted to bind and inhibit the HCoV-229E Mpro activity with affinity scores ranging from −7.1 to −7.8. In vitro inhibition assays showed that seven available compounds effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity and their IC50 values ranged from 0.125 to 12.9 µM. Five compounds inhibited the replication of HCoV-229E in Huh-7 cells. These findings indicate that these antioxidative flavonols and dihydroflavonols are promising candidates for curbing the two viruses.","Zhu, Yue; Scholle, Frank; Kisthardt, Samantha C.; Xie, De-Yu",bioRxiv,330,22

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 67 in-service instructors in various hospitality and tourism institutions in Vietnam participated in the proposed course. Constructivist approaches were adopted to design learning activities. Delivered via Blackboard Collaborate’s classroom version, the course aims at enhancing instructors’ self-confidence in the knowledge and skills required for synchronous online teaching: developing online presence, planning lessons, handling technology, adapting to learners’ preferences and classroom management. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses, this paper evaluated the proposed course by comparing participants’ levels of self-confidence in conducting synchronous online teaching before and after the training. Findings: The results show that participants’ self-confidence was enhanced after the course. To improve the course, however, more time should be allotted for practice sessions where participants can pedagogically and technologically familiarize themselves with online teaching tools. Originality/value: By translating constructivism into online pedagogy, this study provided empirical evidence of how a teachers’ training program was designed and implemented to meet the need to shift from real-life to real-time classrooms in Vietnam during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The resonance of this for the Asia-Pacific is plain, having experienced a financial crisis in 1997/1998;regular issues of pollution, haze, and the early impacts of climate change;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Flu pandemics and now COVID-19;massive migration;and regular and periodically massive natural disasters. Second, it stressed that many, if not most, of these newly-recognised security threats are transnational, rather than inter-state.

Analysis of both the cases determined that 86.69% (n=443) of them belonged to the Delta variant along with Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into 4 distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage I had mutations: ORF1ab, A1306S, P2046L, P2287S, V2930L, T3255I, T3446A, G5063S, P5401L, A6319V and N G215C; Sub lineage II : ORF1ab P309, A3209V, V3718A, G5063S, P5401L and ORF7a L116F; Sub lineage III : ORF1ab A3209V, V3718A, T3750I, G5063S, P5401L and Spike A222V; Sub-lineage IV ORF1ab P309L, D2980N, F3138S and spike K77T. This study indicated that majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality.","Gupta, N.; Kaur, H.; Yadav, P.; Mukhopadhyay, L.; Sahay, R. R.; Kumar, A.; Nyayanit, D.

Two co-leaders led the group while the third disseminated electronic materials and scored the patients' online sleep diaries. Virtual administration of CBT-I had benefits and challenges. Report of case(s): Firstly, many of the patients were familiar with teleconferencing as their jobs also transitioned to virtual meetings and could identify environments with limited interruptions. Telehealth group etiquette such as muting audio, timely diary submission, and peer support were easily mastered. However, one patient had poor internet connection, which necessitated switching between their laptop and phone to connect and seemed to negatively impact engagement with the group. Furthermore, the clinicians were confronted with the difficult decision to continue helping troubleshoot technical issues or continue with the session. During in-person visits, co-leaders could address difficulties with sleep prescription or questions about the material;however, balancing technical issues, answering questions, and facilitating support amongst the patients via telehealth was often distracting and inefficient. From a clinician perspective, it was difficult to co-lead the group due to patients respectfully muting their mics, resulting in less contributions to discussion. Additionally, many of the administrative tasks typically completed with clinic staff after an in-person session were completed during session, making it challenging to maintain confidentiality. Presentation of visual aids was difficult as patient using cellphones to connect could not view and download files while connected to session. Finally, basic clinical techniques were impacted using the virtual platform. For instance, 'sitting in silence' was less effective while maintaining eye contact with the entire group was facilitated by looking directly at the camera. Unfortunately, reading facial expressions and non-verbals was often more difficult and clinicians relied on more direct questions rather than open-ended questions. Conclusion: These challenges provide opportunities to learn how to make CBT-I via telehealth more effective. Despite the challenges of transitioning to telepsychology, the CBT-I group was effective as evidenced by high satisfaction ratings from patients, reductions in PHQ-9 and ISI scores, SOL, WASO, and increases in sleep efficiency.","Nguyen, A.

Design: Stool samples from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK were analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method between March 2017 to March 2020. Clinical details described on the test request were recorded. Patients were followed up for up-to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and bowel inflammation) colorectal disease. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT is reported by gender, age, and FIT threshold. Results: In 9,896 adult patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, a FIT result [≥]10 ug/g had an overall sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90.5% (95% CI 84.9%-96.1%), women 90.0 (80.7-99.3), men 90.8 (83.7-97.8); overall specificity 91.3 (90.8-91.9), women 92.4 (91.8-93.1), men 89.8 (88.8-90.7); overall Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 10.1 (8.15-12.0), women 7.64 (5.24-10.0), men 12.5 (9.52-15.5)); and an overall Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 99.9 (99.8-100.0), women 99.8 (99.7-100.), men 99.9 (99.9-100.0). The PPV and specificity of FIT were higher for serious colorectal disease combined and the sensitivity and NPV were lower than for colorectal cancer alone. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for all patients did not change substantially by increasing the minimum age of testing. In this population, 10% would be further investigated to detect 91% of the cancers at 10ug/g and 3% further investigated to detect 54% of the cancers at 150ug/g. The number needed to scope to detect one cancer at was ten using FIT at 10ug/g. Conclusion: A FIT threshold of 10ug/g is appropriate to triage adult patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of serious colorectal disease. FIT may provide an appropriate approach to reprioritising patients colorectal cancer symptoms whose tests have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nicholson, B. D.; James, T.

We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab treatment in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched articles from Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and MedRxiv between 30 January 2020 and August 5, 2021. We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies with a control group to assess the efficiency of bamlanivimab in treating patients with COVID-19. Results: Our meta-analysis retrieved 3 RCTs and 7 cohort studies including 14461 patients. Bmlanivimab may help outpatients to prevent hospitalization or emergency department visit (RR 0.41 95%CI 0.29 to 0.58), reduce ICU admission (RR 0.47 95%CI 0.23 to 0.92) and mortality (RR 0.32 95%CI 0.13 to 0.77) from the disease. The combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab may had a greater potential for positive treatment outcome. Conclusion: Bamlanivimab has demonstrated clinical efficacy on mild or moderate ill patients with COVID-19 to prevent hospitalization, reduce severity and mortality from the disease. Combinations of two or more monoclonal antibody increase the effect. Well-designed clinical trials to identify the clinical and biochemical characteristics in COVID-19 patients'population that could benefit from bamlanivimab are warranted in the future.","Xiang, H.; He, B.; Li, Y.; Cheng, X.; Zhang, Q.; Peng, W.",,330,25

However, this number is still debated, since both the numerator and the denominator are uncertain. Data analysis from the most affected areas in the world minimizes computational errors and represents a unique approach for estimating infection fatality rate. We first extracted data from PubMed/Medline, Google, traditional media and social media to obtain the rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence in the most affected and best-studied areas in the world: Val Seriana (Italy), Ischgl (Austria) and Manaus (Brasil). We then searched mortality data from national institutes of statistics and calculated excess mortality. We estimated the infection fatality rate considering several scenarios according to the mortality attributable to COVID-19 and the proportion of the population infected with the virus. We found that the seropositivity was surprisingly close to 40% in all the considered areas. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate for Val Seriana, using from half to the entire excess mortality (1208 deaths) and considering from 40% to 80% of the population as being infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the most conservative scenario, infection fatality rate was as low as 0.55%, while in the worst-case one it was 2.2%. We found that the seroconversion rate in the most affected areas worldwide is about 40%. We consequently estimated the infection fatality rate to be between 0.55% and 2.2% in an area with a relatively elderly population. © 2021 The Author(s).

Two-dimensional matching of empirical characteristic functions to its theoretical counterpart is employed for dependency parameter estimation. Estimations are reported for 3920 daily return sequences of one thousand days. Path simulation is done using conditional distribution functions. The paths display levels of squared return correlation and decay rates for the squared return autocorrelation function that are comparable to these magnitudes in daily return data. Regressions of log characteristic functions at different time points are used to estimate time scaling coefficients. Regressions of these time scaling coefficients on squared return correlations support the view that autocorrelation in squared returns slows the rate of passage of economic time.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV led to smaller epidemics with very high case fatality rates while SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a global pandemic. These zoonotic coronaviruses have their likely origins in bat species and they transmit to humans through intermediate hosts. Coronaviruses can occasionally jump between host species due to their high rate of recombination.

Inference of personality traits, such as Myers-Briggs Personality Type, as well as an understanding of dependencies between personality traits and users' behavior on various social media platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry applications. The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues makes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and efficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However, the research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal social media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different social network data on machine learning performance has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is not such dataset in the research community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts towards bridging such an important research gap. Specifically, in this work, we infer the Myers-Briggs Personality Type indicators, by applying a novel multi-view fusion framework, called""PERS""and comparing the performance results not just across data modalities but also with respect to different social network data sources. Our experimental results demonstrate the PERS's ability to learn from multi-view data for personality profiling by efficiently leveraging on the significantly different data arriving from diverse social multimedia sources. We have also found that the selection of a machine learning approach is of crucial importance when choosing social network data sources and that people tend to reveal multiple facets of their personality in different social media avenues.

It affects both genders with a higher frequency among women. This study examined the factors contributing to the development of burnout among women in oncology from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Methods: An online crosssectional survey was distributed to oncology professionals from different countries in the MENA region. The validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) of emotional exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DE), and Personal Achievement (PA) plus questions about demography/work-related factors and attitudes toward oncology were included. Data were analyzed to measure BO prevalence and related factors. Results: Between February 10 and March 15, 2020, 545 responses were submitted by female professionals. The responses pre-dated the COVID-19 pandemic emergence in the region. BO prevalence was 71% among female professionals. Women aged < 44 years represented 85% of the cohort.

Its consequence was a re-evaluation of the culture of workplaces and a significant change has occurred to the pattern of daytime employment distribution. In this paper, the network distribution model was built with three constraints, Distribution Bias 1, 2, and 3. These biases were determined through questionnaires, survey data collections of responses from Yangonites, and geographical data of urban employment cores. These percentile biases influenced the amount of employed population per distribution times and gave rise to two results. One was the ordinary daytime employed population and another was the improved daytime employed distribution (considering WFH). These two results were compared and contrasted with coefficient of variations, t-tests, and other correlation methods to determine the effect of WFH on the daytime employed population. With survey data, it was clarified that majorities in Yangon do favor work from home as an alternative option for future employment. Subsequently, the compared results revealed that work from home significantly decreased the amount of employment distribution and the amount of such decrements were more consistent and had less variations, hence reducing cramming during daytime distribution. © The Author(s) 2021.

The collected data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results indicated that subjective norm as the external factor of the TPB has a stronger effect than the internal factors;attitude and behavioral control. It appears that in a collectivist society, prohibition enforced by family and friends, as well as the government’s sanctions have a stronger influence on one’s decision to travel. The findings also suggested that knowledge, perceived risks and social concern effect tourists’ behavior. Uncertainty and inadequate knowledge will decrease the level of perceived risk, which leads to lower control in practicing physical distancing and increasing intention to travel during the pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThe research has limitations in its use of a convenient sampling method. This method may not represent the whole population, causing the results to be difficult for generalization. There is also the need for extending the TPB model with different variables in the context of tourism and pandemic. This study enriches the existing tourism literature by applying TPB to examine tourists’ behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on knowledge, social concern and perceived risk theory.Practical implicationsThis paper offers useful insights for tourism planners in the government and private destination management levels. It is crucial for a destination management organization to understand the relationship between knowledge, perception and social concern with tourists’ behavior while traveling during pandemics.

Vulnerability of a geographical region/country to COVID-19 has been a topic of interest, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like India to assess the multi-factorial impact of COVID-19 on the incidence, prevalence or mortality data. Datasets and Methods Based on publicly reported socio-economic, demographic, health-based and epidemiological data from national surveys in India, we compute contextual, COVID-19 Vulnerability Indices (cVIs) across multiple thematic resolutions for different geographical and spatial administrative regions. These multi-resolution cVIs were used in regression models to assess their impact on indicators of the spread of COVID-19 such as the average time-varying instantaneous reproduction number. Results Our observational study was focused on 30 districts of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It is an agrarian state, prone to natural disasters and one of the largest contributors of an unprotected migrant workforce. Our analyses identified housing and hygiene conditions, availability of health care and COVID preparedness as important spatial indicators. Conclusion Odisha has demonstrated success in containing the COVID-19 infection to a reasonable level with proactive measures to contain the spread of the virus during the first wave. However, with the onset of the second wave of COVID, the virus has been making inroads into the hinterlands and peripheral districts of the state, burdening the already deficient public health system in these areas. The vulnerability index presented in this paper identified vulnerable districts in Odisha. While some of them may not have a large number of COVID-19 cases at a given point of time, they could experience repercussions of the pandemic. Improved understanding of the factors driving COVID-19 vulnerability will help policy makers prioritise resources and regions leading to more effective mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Bhattacharyya, R.; Burman, A.; Singh, K.; Banerjee, S.; Maity, S.; Auddy, A.; Rout, S.

In this context, this study examines the dynamic association among economic policy uncertainty, green bonds, clean energy stocks, and global rare earth elements. A dynamic conditional correlation-multivariate generalized autoregres-sive conditional heteroscedasticity (DCC-MGARCH) model was used to gauge the time-varying co-movements among these indices. The analysis finds that green bonds act more as a hedge than a safe haven against economic policy uncertainty (EPU). In the case of diversification, green bonds work as diversifiers with clean energy stocks and rare earth elements during COVID-19 and in the whole sample period. Additionally, clean energy stocks and rare earth elements show safe haven properties against EPUs. This study contributes to the hedging and safe haven literature with some new insight considering the role of green bonds and clean energy stocks. Additionally, the outcomes of the research contribute toward the literature of portfolio diversification theory. These findings pave the way for not only US investors to hedge long-term economic policy risk by investing in green bonds, but also for China and the UK, as these financial assets (green bonds, clean energy stocks, and rare earth metals) and EPU are long-term financial and economic variables. © 2021 by the authors.

Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty. Findings In scenario I and II, the isolation-and-quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation-and-quarantine with additional cost of US$ 166 871 and US$180 140 respectively. The effectiveness of isolation-and-quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay-time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply; when the quarantine delay-time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost-effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay-time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions. Interpretation The isolation-and-quarantine was the most cost-effective intervention. However, personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation-and-quarantine. Certain restrictions should be considered, such as more initial imported cases, longer quarantine delay-time and lower quarantine probability.","Wang, Qiang; Shi, Naiyang; Huang, Jinxin; Cui, Tingting; Yang, Liuqing; Ai, Jing; Ji, Hong; Xu, Ke; Ahmad, Tauseef; Bao, Changjun; Jin, Hui",,330,16

The leading hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of the virus internalisation as well as its influence on the nervous system in extenso are presented, as well as the latest available knowledge, after a selective choice of articles relating to the subject. Brief description of the state of knowledge: Dizziness, tinnitus and sudden hearing loss are the main symptoms in the organ of hearing and balance, but it is often not possibile to objectively investigate their etiology and make a proper diagnosis. Among the most common causes of hearing disorders, such as vestibular neuritis, sudden sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, there are infections, injuries, and diseases that predispose to the occurrence of symptoms of hearing disorders. Despite the numerous possible causes, a high percentage of clinical symptoms still remain without diagnosis. Conclusions: The global health crisis has provoked a change in the perspective of thinking about infections and the consequences of viral infections;it haalso given rise to a new perception and conceptualisation of the impact of infections on other human systems. The challenge faced by scientists due to this virus is multi-dimensional, and it requires explication and reinterpretation of the knowledge to-date. It even forces us to retrospect the existing explanations of the known disorders, as well as to conduct prospective correlative studies that will help in understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and consequentl, to be able to establish a management pattern in order to prevent the spread of the virus causing the pandemic.","Krasowska, Sylwia",Medycyna Środowiskowa = Environmental Medicine,330,11

Recent attention-based networks emphasize few facial parts, while ignoring other potentially discriminative ones. This is more serious when there are large pose variations, occlusions (e.g. face masks), or other image quality changes. To address this, we propose Diverse and Sparse Attentions, called DSA-Face. First, a divergence loss is designed to explicitly encourage the diversity among multiple attention maps by maximizing the Euclidean distance between every pair attention maps. As a result, a Pairwise Self-Contrastive Attention (PSCA) is developed to locate diverse facial parts which provide comprehensive descriptions. Second, an Attention Sparsity Loss (ASL) is proposed to encourage sparse responses in attention maps where only discriminative parts are emphasized while distracted regions (e.g. background or face masks) are discouraged. Built upon the PSCA and ASL, the DSA-Face model is developed to learn diverse and sparse attentions, which can extract diverse discriminative local representations and suppress the focus on noisy regions. Due to the pandemic of the COVID-19, the task of masked face matching is now very important, and our model can handle this much better than previous methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and usefulness. Moreover, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several other FR benchmarks, showing that it is also general to address various challenges in FR.

Special attention needs to be directed towards families with children with special educational needs. Since there are relatively few studies analysing the coherence of effective cooperation with educators during the pandemic, especially in our surroundings, this study aimed to examine whether certain sociodemographic characteristics of educators (years of work experience and professional qualifications) are related to specific aspects of the quality ofpartnerships and cooperation in early childhood and preschool education institutions during the pandemic. For the purpose of this study, a Questionnaire on the quality ofpartnerships between educators and parents during the out-of-the-ordinary life circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was developed and distributed to 313 educators. Correlation coefficients were calculated to test the relationship between the educators' self-assessment of their partnerships and cooperation with parents and their work experience (in years), as well as their professional qualifications. Analysis of variance was used to test the differences in the assessment of some aspects of cooperation with regards to the work experience of the educators. The results show that educators assess their partnerships with parents during the pandemic as being of high quality and perceive themselves as competent in building partnerships with parents of all children, as well as in providing support to parents of children with disabilities. Educators with more y ars of work experience consider themselves as less competent in using digital technology and believe that they need more theoretical knowledge and practical experience in this aspect.","Lozančić, Anka Jurčević Mirošević Jasna Kudek",Hrvatska Revija za Rehabilitacijska Istrazivanja,330,2

These shapes combine several geometric features such as zero curvature (straight), constant curvature (circular) and variable curvature surfaces. The components often contain thin-walled sections having inherently lower stiffness that induces static deflections transforming into surface error and violation of error limits specified by the designer. This paper presents a comparison of deflection induced surface error profile generated during the end milling of zero and constant curvature thin-walled components. The proposed framework incorporates computational model to estimate cutting forces, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model to compute workpiece deflections, and surface generation mechanism to derive error profile. The paper also investigates the effect of change in the radial engagement area due to workpiece curvature by introducing the concept of ‘Equivalent Radial Depth of Cut’. Further, the effect of change in workpiece curvature is investigated on the surface error profile in the paper. The proposed framework has been generalized to accommodate the variation of workpiece geometry, and the results are validated by conducting a set of end milling experiments.","Agarwal, Ankit; Desai, K.

Responsible behaviour of dentists, aimed at stopping the spread of the virus from dental offices showed that only emergency procedures were to be performed, in cases of toothache, trauma and odontogenic infections that might put organs or systems at risk. At the same time, with the cessation of all types of treatments, there was an immediate cessation of teaching processes in all university settings for dental medicine, since the data from China strongly suggested death rates among doctors and students in close contact with infected persons. Stress and unease that have grown among people due to isolation and quarantine, the only ways of prevention of the spread of the invisible enemy will have long-lasting and visible effect on mental health of the people. Health issues in the oral cavity will most certainly occur due to the lack of regular check-ups and care. Caries and periodontal disease will appear more frequently. While we are expecting an efficient vaccine, the only way to counter the virus are epidemiological measures and responsible behaviour of every individual, in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.","Brkić, Hrvoje",Acta Stomatol Croat,330,5

SARS-Cov infection stimulates cytokines (e.g., IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-1, etc.) expression dramatically, and T lymphocytes and their subsets CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are decreased after onset of the disease. SARS-specific IgG antibody is generated in the second week and persists for a long time, whereas IgM is expressed transiently. The spike protein and neucleocapsid protein are most abundant in SARS-Cov and contribute dominantly to the antibody production during the course of disease. Spike protein, especially the ACE-2 binding region (318-510aa) is capable of producing neutralizing antibody to SARS-Cov. Neucleocapsid protein induces protective specific CTL to SARS-Cov. Therefore, applications with spike subunit, neucleocapsid subunit as well as inactivated SARS-Cov are three prospective vaccination strategies for SARS.","Zhu, Minsheng",Cellular & molecular immunology,330,1

This study analysed the postoperative length of stay after vaginal hysterectomy in 3 different periods of time. Material and Methods: In the period October 2011 - September 2012, 75 patients underwent vaginal hysterectomies (± adnexectomy); another 114 vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomies with additional operations (e.g. prolapse surgery and incontinence surgery) and malignancies were not included. The time periods August 1995 - July 1996 (n = 50) and October 1996 - September 1997 (n = 96) served as a comparison. Reducing the length of stay was not an explicit goal. Results: The median postoperative stay was shortened from 7 (5-9) to 5 (3-15) or 3 (0-5) days (p < 0.001). The recovery rate remained unchanged at 2.7 % (n = 2), cf. 2 % (n = 1) and 3.1 % (n = 3). In 40/75 cases (53.3 %), the surgery took place on the day of admission. Conclusion: The length of hospital stay after vaginal hysterectomy has more than halved since 1995/1996 and continues to decline. This development occurred without a shortened stay being an explicit goal of the clinic. The shortened length of stay does not appear to have a negative impact on postoperative complications and recovery rate.","Reif, P; Drobnitsch, T; Aigmüller, T; Laky, R; Ulrich, D; Haas, J; Bader, A; Tamussino, K",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,330,28

S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991; R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). To examine the role of posttranscriptional modification of MHVR on virus-receptor interactions, a vaccinia virus-based expression system was employed. Expression from the vaccinia virus recombinant (Vac-MHVR) in BHK-21 cells resulted in high levels of MHVR glycoprotein on the cell surface and made these cells susceptible to MHV-A59 infection. Nonglycosylated core MHVR proteins were made in Vac-MHVR-infected BHK-21 cells in the presence of tunicamycin by in vitro translation of MHVR mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system in the absence of microsomal membranes and by expression of an N-terminal deletion clone of MHVR lacking its signal peptide. These three nonglycosylated MHVR proteins were recognized by polyclonal antibody against affinity-purified receptor but did not bind antireceptor monoclonal antibody (MAb) CC1 or MHV-A59 virions. Partial glycosylation of MHVR, either expressed in Vac-MHVR-infected cells treated with monensin or synthesized by in vitro translation with microsomal membranes, restored both the MAb CC1- and the virus-binding activities of the MHVR glycoprotein. Deletion of 26 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of MHVR resulted in a secreted protein which was able to bind MAb CC1 and MHV-A59. These results suggest that either a carbohydrate moiety is an element of the MHVR-binding site(s) for virus and MAb CC1 or a posttranslational membrane-associated process is required for functional conformation of the receptor glycoprotein.","Pensiero, M N; Dveksler, G S; Cardellichio, C B; Jiang, G S; Elia, P E; Dieffenbach, C W; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,330,7

DESIGN A prospective observational cohort study was performed during 3 consecutive years. SETTING Sixteen US hospitals participated in the study. PARTICIPANTS Children younger than 2 years hospitalized with bronchiolitis were included. MAIN EXPOSURE The results of nasopharyngeal aspirate polymerase chain reaction pathogen testing served as the main exposure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hospital LOS was determined. RESULTS Of 2207 participants, 72.0% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 25.6% had human rhinovirus(HRV); the incidence of each of the other viruses and bacteria was 7.8% or less. Multiple pathogen infections were present in 29.8% of the children. There were 1866 children(84.5%) with RSV and/or HRV. Among these 1866 children, the median age was 4 months and 59.5% were male. The median LOS was 2 days (interquartile range,1-4 days). Compared with children who had only RSV,an LOS of 3 or more days was less likely among children with HRV alone (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.36; 95%CI, 0.20-0.63; P.001) and those with HRV plus non-RSV pathogens (AOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.66; P.001)but more likely among children with RSV plus HRV(AOR,1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.73; P=.04), controlling for 15 demographic and clinical factors. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, RSV was the most common virus detected, but HRV was detected in one-quarter of the children. Since 1 in 3 children had multiple virus infections and HRV was associated with LOS, these data challenge the effectiveness of current RSV-based cohorting practices, the sporadic testing for HRV in bronchiolitis research, and current thinking that the infectious etiology of severe bronchiolitis does not affect short-term outcomes.","Mansbach, Jonathan M; Piedra, Pedro A; Teach, Stephen J; Sullivan, Ashley F; Forgey, Tate; Clark, Sunday; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,330,9

METHODS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 sepsis patients and 50 controls were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-α to induce DCs maturation. DCs from sepsis patients were also treated with three different concentrations of OXPAPC. Cells were characterized with optical and electron microscopy, FACS analysis for CD1α, HLA-DR and CD86 on cell surface and ELISA analysis of IL-12p70 in the supernatant. RESULTS DCs from sepsis patients had smaller cell bodies and nucleus and had almost no surface projection. DCs had similar CD1α expression in sepsis patients (86.37 ± 17.24) and controls (88.58 ± 10.05). HLA-DR expression was dramatically reduced in sepsis patients (2.74 ± 5.15) compared to controls (198.35 ± 12.04). Similarly, CD86 expression was also drastically lower in sepsis patients (14.72 ± 4.83) than controls (154.56 ± 11.56). Furthermore, OXPAPC treatment of DCs from sepsis patients increased cell surface projection, HLA-DR and CD86 surface expression and IL-12p70 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. With 40 μg/ml of OXPAPC, DCs of sepsis patients have similar phenotypes observed in healthy controls. CONCLUSION DCs from sepsis patients are defective in maturation and cytokine secretion and these defects can be corrected by OXPAPC treatment.","Tan, Yun; Li, Jin-Xiu; Xiang, Xu-Dong; Lü, Jian-Lei",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,330,28

PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-five patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to a standard treatment protocol adopted by the Hospital Authority were matched with controls retrieved from the Hospital Authority severe acute respiratory syndrome central database. Matching was done with respect to age, sex, the presence of co-morbidities, lactate dehydrogenase level and the use of pulse steroid therapy. The 75 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were divided into two subgroups for analysis: lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment, and lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy. These groups were compared with matched cohorts of 634 and 343 patients, respectively. Outcomes including overall death rate, oxygen desaturation, intubation rate, and use of pulse methylprednisolone were reviewed. RESULTS The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment (15.6% and 11.0% respectively, P<0.05) and a lower rate of use of methylprednisolone at a lower mean dose. The subgroup who had received lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy, showed no difference in overall death rate and rates of oxygen desaturation and intubation compared with the matched cohort, and received a higher mean dose of methylprednisolone.

We developed transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a functional receptor for the virus, under the regulation of a global promoter. A transgenic lineage, designated AC70, was among the best characterized against SARS coronavirus infection, showing weight loss and other clinical manifestations before reaching 100% mortality within 8 days after intranasal infection. High virus titers were detected in the lungs and brains of transgene-positive (Tg+) mice on days 1 and 3 after infection. Inflammatory mediators were also detected in these tissues, coinciding with high levels of virus replication. Lower virus titers were also detected in other tissues, including blood. In contrast, infected transgene-negative (Tg-) mice survived without showing any clinical illness. Pathologic examination suggests that the extensive involvement of the central nervous system likely contributed to the death of Tg+ mice, even though viral pneumonia was present. Preliminary studies with mice of a second lineage, AC63, in which the transgene expression was considerably less abundant than that in the AC70 line, revealed that virus replication was largely restricted to the lungs but not the brain. Importantly, despite significant weight loss, infected Tg+ AC63 mice eventually recovered from the illness without any mortality. The severity of the disease that developed in these transgenic mice--AC70 in particular--makes these mouse models valuable not only for evaluating the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines, but also for studying SARS coronavirus pathogenesis.","Tseng, Chien-Te K; Huang, Cheng; Newman, Patrick; Wang, Nan; Narayanan, Krishna; Watts, Douglas M; Makino, Shinji; Packard, Michelle M; Zaki, Sherif R; Chan, Teh-Sheng; Peters, Clarence J",Journal of virology,330,28

Disruption of gene 7 did not affect virus replication or morbidity in golden Syrian hamsters, suggesting that the gene 7 products are not required for acute infection in vivo. The data indicate that open reading frames 7a and 7b contribute to but are not solely responsible for the apoptosis seen in SARS-CoV-infected cells.","Schaecher, Scott R; Touchette, Erin; Schriewer, Jill; Buller, R Mark; Pekosz, Andrew",Journal of virology,330,19

The specific essential functions of nsP3 remain unknown, but it is known to be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Here we have completed mapping of the individual phosphorylation sites on Semliki Forest virus nsP3 (482 amino acids) by point mutational analysis of threonine residues. This showed that threonines 344 and 345 represented the major threonine phosphorylation sites in nsP3. Experiments with deletion variants suggested that nsP3 itself had no kinase activity; instead, it was likely to be phosphorylated by multiple cellular kinases. Phosphorylation was not necessary for the peripheral membrane association of nsP3, which was mediated by the N-terminal region preceding the phosphorylation sites. Two deletion variants of nsP3 with either reduced or undetectable phosphorylation were studied in the context of virus infection. Cells infected with mutant viruses produced close to wild type levels of infectious virions; however, the rate of viral RNA synthesis was significantly reduced in the mutants. A virus totally defective in nsP3 phosphorylation and exhibiting a decreased rate of RNA synthesis also exhibited greatly reduced pathogenicity in mice.","Vihinen, H; Ahola, T; Tuittila, M; Merits, A; Kääriäinen, L",The Journal of biological chemistry,330,17

Health care providers, along with essential workers and patients, continue to be concerned about functioning in a safe and responsible manner. Consequently, a level of comfort is created by the testing health care workers with long exposure to new patients and patients undergoing interventions in high risk environments. As the United States and the world suffers from an ongoing infodemic, there are substantial amounts of misinformation, and some appropriate information being produced on molecular, antigen and antibody testing. Consequently, this manuscript is undertaken to describe the value and validity of coronavirus antibody testing. METHODS Literature review. RESULTS Antibody tests detect antibodies or immunoglobulins that are produced as the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A positive result suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. When immunoglobulins M (IgM) antibodies are present, they can indicate an active or recent infection, whereas immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies show up later in the infection process and can often indicate a past infection, but does not exclude recently infected patients who can still be contagious, especially when IgM antibodies are also concurrently detected. While past knowledge indicates that for viral infections, IgG antibodies usually persist longer than IgM antibodies and provide immunity from re-infection, it is not clearly known if that is true for COVID-19. LIMITATIONS A narrative review with paucity of literature. CONCLUSION Antibody tests have been developed to detect IgG only, both IgG and IgM, or total antibodies. At present, multiple antibody tests are available for use in the United States. In a review of 54 available studies through the end of April, mostly from China, the accuracy of pooled results for combination IgG/IgM tests was 91.4% (95% CI, 87.0 - 96.6) for 15 to 21 days post-symptom onset.

Tisseel® is a tissue glue commonly used as an adjunct in dural repair but is not optimal for this purpose. DuraSeal® has several properties advantageous for dural repair but is not widely accepted in Canada partly due to its increased cost. OBJECTIVE A cost analysis of DuraSeal® versus Tisseel® in endoscopic pituitary surgery. METHODS A cost analysis was performed based on typical endoscopic pituitary surgery cases performed at our tertiary care institution. Operating room, hospital admission, and surgical sealant costs were obtained directly while estimates of patient recovery time and post-operative CSF leak rates were based on consensus values reported in the literature. Outcomes were reported for various possible clinical scenarios of sealant use. RESULTS In a model where surgical sealant is employed only in high-risk cases, use of DuraSeal® allows for a yearly cost savings of at least $4486.72. If surgical sealant is used in all cases, regular use of DuraSeal® versus Tisseel® either marginally reduces yearly costs or increases them by a maximum of $7619.25, depending on the case volume and estimated post-operative CSF leak rate. CONCLUSION In most clinical scenarios, use of DuraSeal® in endoscopic pituitary surgery may reduce overall yearly hospital costs compared to Tisseel®.","Kus, Lukas H; Rotenberg, Brian W; Duggal, Neil",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

In vivo, MHV3 induced in C3H mice a genetically controlled infection of meningeal cells, ependymal cells, and neurons. In vitro, purified MHV3 bound to the surface of isolated ependymal cells and cultured cortical neurons but not to oligodendrocytes or cultured astrocytes. MHV3 replicated within cultured cortical neurons and neuroblastoma cells (NIE 115); infected cultured neurons nonetheless survived and matured normally for a 7-day period postinfection. On the other hand, MHV3 had a low affinity for cortical glial cells or glioma cells (C6 line), both of which appear to be morphologically unaltered by viral infection. Finally, MHV3 infected and disrupted cultured meningeal cells. This suggests that differences in the affinity of cells for MHV3 are determinants of the selective vulnerability of cellular subpopulations within the CNS. In vivo, a higher titer of virus was needed for CNS penetration in the genetically resistant (A/Jx) mice than in the susceptible (C57/BL6) mouse strain. However, in spite of viral invasion, no neuropathological lesions developed. In vitro viral binding to adult ependymal cells of susceptible and resistant strains of mice was identical. Genetic resistance to MHV3-CNS infection appeared to be mediated both by a peripheral mechanism limiting viral penetration into the CNS and by intra-CNS mechanisms, presumably at a stage after viral attachment to target cells.","Tardieu, M; Boespflug, O; Barbé, T",Journal of virology,330,16

In the USA, meaningful discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the Canadian system has been thwarted by ideological mudslinging on the part of large insurance companies seeking to preserve their ultra-profitable turf and backed by conservative political forces stirring up old fears of 'socialised medicine'. These distractions have relegated the possibility of a 'public option' to the legislative dustbin, leaving tens of millions of people to face uninsurance, under-insurance, bankruptcy and unnecessary death and suffering, even after passage of the Obama health plan. While South Africa appears to experience similar legislative paralysis, there remains room for reasoned health reform debate to address issues of equity, access, and financing. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to contribute to the debate from a Canadian perspective, setting out the basic principles of Medicare (Canada's health care system), reviewing its advantages and challenges, clarifying misunderstandings, and exploring its relevance to South Africa. We periodically refer to the USA because of the similarities to the South African situation, including its health care system, which mirrors South Africa's current position if left unchanged.

The revised definition distinguishes between the term ""clinical practice guideline"" and other forms of clinical guidance derived from widely disparate development processes, such as consensus statements, expert advice, and appropriate use criteria. OBJECTIVE To assess the literature and develop methodology for evidence synthesis and development of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. METHODS A systematic review of the literature including methodology of guideline development encompassing GRADE approach for guidance on evidence synthesis with recommendations. RESULTS Some of the many factors described in 2011 continue as of 2020 and impede the development of clinical practice guidelines. These impediments include biases due to a variety of conflicts and confluence of interest, inappropriate and poor methodological quality, poor writing and ambiguous presentation, projecting a view that these are not applicable to individual patients or too restrictive with the elimination of clinician autonomy, and overzealous and inappropriate recommendations, either positive, negative, or non-committal. Thus, ideally, a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of experts with true lack of bias and confluence of interest must develop guidelines based on a systematic review of the existing evidence.

Herein, we show that the application of two strategies, cloning of the cDNAs into a bacterial artificial chromosome and nuclear expression of RNAs that are typically produced within the cytoplasm, is useful for the engineering of large RNA molecules. A cDNA encoding an infectious coronavirus RNA genome has been cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome. The rescued coronavirus conserved all of the genetic markers introduced throughout the sequence and showed a standard mRNA pattern and the antigenic characteristics expected for the synthetic virus. The cDNA was transcribed within the nucleus, and the RNA translocated to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the recovered virus had essentially the same sequence as the original one, and no splicing was observed. The cDNA was derived from an attenuated isolate that replicates exclusively in the respiratory tract of swine. During the engineering of the infectious cDNA, the spike gene of the virus was replaced by the spike gene of an enteric isolate. The synthetic virus replicated abundantly in the enteric tract and was fully virulent, demonstrating that the tropism and virulence of the recovered coronavirus can be modified. This demonstration opens up the possibility of employing this infectious cDNA as a vector for vaccine development in human, porcine, canine, and feline species susceptible to group 1 coronaviruses.","Almazán, F; González, J M; Pénzes, Z; Izeta, A; Calvo, E; Plana-Durán, J; Enjuanes, L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,330,24

Role of bacterial colonization of big and small airways in patients affected by COPD is still unclear but it is likely to play a role in directly or indirectly maintaining the vicious circle of infection/inflammation. Colonizer pathogens are capable to stimulate mucus production, to alter the ciliary function by inducing dyskinesia and stasis; in addition, they represent a strong stimulus for neutrophils to come in the airways, which release elastase that, in turn, inhibit the mucus-ciliary function. The same pathogens are responsible for epithelial damage and chronic inflammation, by releasing neutrophilic elastase, leading to the damage progression and obstruction. Recent studies have also shown that infection sustained by H. influenzae is not limited to bronchial mucosa, i.e. surface epithelial cells, but that the pathogen is capable to penetrate cells, so spreading the infection in sub-epithelial cellular layers. In addition, the ability to produce biofilm is another possible defence mechanism which allows them to grow and colonise. Such a mechanism could in part explain the lack of response to antimicrobials and contribute to stimulation of parenchymal inflammatory response, the cause of pathological-anatomic damage which occurs in COPD. The impossibility to eradicate chronic infection and bacterial exacerbations of COPD are likely the elements that promt and worsen obstruction, so determining the disease's progression.","Legnani, Delfino","Le infezioni in medicina : rivista periodica di eziologia, epidemiologia, diagnostica, clinica e terapia delle patologie infettive",330,21

Soon thereafter, some politicians and authors publicly advocated for quarantine of travelers returning from regions where mosquitoes carrying Zika virus are prevalent. The public health tool of quarantine can be used to prevent the spread of infection by restricting the movement of persons who have been exposed to a deadly disease that can be transmitted from person to person before symptom onset. With 80% of Zika virus infections being asymptomatic, no rapid test being available to detect the virus, and primary transmission being via the bites of certain mosquitoes, application of quarantine in this setting is not scientifically sound or practically feasible. Rather, public health interventions should focus on preventing bites from infected mosquitoes, counseling pregnant women on the risks of fetal microcephaly and other birth defects, and identifying patients with signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome. As was seen in the Ebola virus disease outbreak of 2014, non-evidence-based factors can influence policy decisions.

Further, most conventional host-pathogen theory assumes that transmission is related to host density, and therefore a pathogen should become extinct before its sole host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is a recently emerged infectious cancer that has led to massive population declines and grave concerns for the future persistence of this largest surviving marsupial carnivore. Here we report the results of mark-recapture studies at six sites and use these data to estimate epidemiological parameters critical to both accurately assessing the risk of extinction from this disease and effectively managing this disease threat. Three sites were monitored from before or close to the time of disease arrival, and at three others disease was well established when trapping began, in one site for at least 10 years. We found no evidence for sex-specific differences in disease prevalence and little evidence of consistent seasonal variation in the force of infection. At all sites, the disease was maintained at high levels of prevalence (>50% in 2-3-year-old animals), despite causing major population declines. We also provide the first estimates of the basic reproductive rate R0 for this disease. Using a simple age-structured deterministic model, we show that our results are not consistent with transmission being proportional to the density of infected hosts but are consistent with frequency-dependent transmission. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that local disease prevalence in 2-3-year-olds still exceeds 50% at a site where population density has been reduced by up to 90% in the past 12 years. These findings lend considerable weight to concerns that this host-specific pathogen will cause the extinction of the Tasmanian devil. Our study highlights the importance of rapidly implementing monitoring programs to determine how transmission depends on host density and emphasizes the need for ongoing management strategies involving a disease-free ""insurance population,"" along with ongoing field monitoring programs to confirm whether local population extinction occurs.","McCallum, Hamish; Jones, Menna; Hawkins, Clare; Hamede, Rodrigo; Lachish, Shelly; Sinn, David L; Beeton, Nick; Lazenby, Billie",Ecology,330,22

We established a mouse model to study postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia and evaluated the role of IL-10 in host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae after recovery from influenza infection. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with 10 median tissue culture infective doses of influenza A (A/PR/8/34) or PBS (control) on day 0. By day 14 mice had regained their normal body weight and had cleared influenza virus from the lungs, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. On day 14 after viral infection, mice received 10(4) CFU of S. pneumoniae (serotype 3) intranasally. Mice recovered from influenza infection were highly susceptible to subsequent pneumococcal pneumonia, as reflected by a 100% lethality on day 3 after bacterial infection, whereas control mice showed 17% lethality on day 3 and 83% lethality on day 6 after pneumococcal infection. Furthermore, 1000-fold higher bacterial counts at 48 h after infection with S. pneumoniae and, particularly, 50-fold higher pulmonary levels of IL-10 were observed in influenza-recovered mice than in control mice. Treatment with an anti-IL-10 mAb 1 h before bacterial inoculation resulted in reduced bacterial outgrowth and markedly reduced lethality during secondary bacterial pneumonia compared with those in IgG1 control mice. In conclusion, mild self-limiting influenza A infection renders normal immunocompetent mice highly susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia. This increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia is at least in part caused by excessive IL-10 production and reduced neutrophil function in the lungs.","van der Sluijs, Koenraad F; van Elden, Leontine J R; Nijhuis, Monique; Schuurman, Rob; Pater, Jennie M; Florquin, Sandrine; Goldman, Michel; Jansen, Henk M; Lutter, René; van der Poll, Tom",Journal of immunology,330,0

METHODS Detailed gross and microscopic examination of the autopsy specimen is performed, including lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes. RESULTS All of the lungs are markedly enlarged and consolidated. Microscopically, pulmonary edema is a prominent finding, especially at the early stage of the disease (5 days after the onset). The alveolar spaces are filled with fibrinous exudates and lined with hyaline membrane. In 5 cases that undergo over 3 weeks of the course, the main pattern is organization of intra-alveolar deposit, along with fibroblastic proliferation in the alveolar septa, which leads to obliteration of alveolar space and pulmonary fibrosis. All of the lungs show bronchopneumonia, scattered hemorrhage, and proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells with desquamation. Microthrombi are seen in 6 cases. Fungal infection is noted in 2 cases. One of them is disseminative, involving bilateral lungs, heart, and kidney; the other one is diagnosed in hilar lymph nodes. In immune system, hilar and abdominal lymph nodes are usually congested and hemorrhagic, with depletion of lymphocytes, and accompanied with subcapsular sinus histiocytosis. One of the cases shows enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes, which have reduced number of germinal centers. Spleen exhibits atrophy of white pulps, and even lost of white pulps in some areas. The red pulp is markedly congested and hemorrhagic. In 5 cases, cardiomegale is prominent. Thrombosis (2 cases), focal myocarditis (1 case), and fungal myocarditis (1 case) are observed. In addition, liver shows massive necrosis (1 case) and nodular cirrhosis (1 case). CONCLUSIONS Lung is the major organ affected by SARS, demonstrated as diffuse alveolar damage. It is postulated that viral infection induces severe damage of alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial cells, leads to pulmonary edema, intra-alveolar fibrin deposit, and hyaline membrane formation. Consequently, intra-alveolar organization and alveolar septal fibrosis causes loss of alveolar spaces, eventually, pulmonary fibrosis and atelectasis. The immune system is often affected, and presented as depletion of lymphoid tissue in lymph nodes and spleen. Secondary infection is a common complication, which should be paid close attention in the management of SARS patients.","Chen, Jie; Zhang, Hong-tu; Xie, Yong-qiang; Wan, Jian-wei; Lu, Zhao-hui; Wang, De-tian; Wang, Qing-zhi; Xue, Xin-hua; Si, Wen-xue; Luo, Yu-feng; Qiu, Hong-mei",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,330,22

Whilst CB₁ receptors are mostly expressed in neurons, where they regulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic strength, CB₂ receptors are found mostly in glial cells and microglia, which become activated and over-express these receptors during disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea. The neuromodulatory actions at CB₁ receptors by endogenous agonists ('endocannabinoids'), of which anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the two most studied representatives, allows them to counteract the neurochemical unbalances arising during these disorders. In contrast, the immunomodulatory effects of these lipophilic mediators at CB₂ receptors regulate the activity and function of glia and microglia. Indeed, the level of expression of CB₁ and CB₂ receptors or of enzymes controlling endocannabinoid levels, and hence the concentrations of endocannabinoids, undergo time- and brain region-specific changes during neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, with the initial attempt to counteract excitotoxicity and inflammation. Here we discuss this plasticity of the endocannabinoid system during the aforementioned central nervous system disorders, as well as its dysregulation, both of which have opened the way to the use of either direct and indirect activators or blockers of CB₁ and CB₂ receptors for the treatment of the symptoms or progression of these diseases.","Bisogno, Tiziana; Di Marzo, Vincenzo",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,330,16

The current study aims to test if information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak was related to acute stress disorder (ASD) over and above other psychosocial stressors. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 7800 college students throughout China from January 31 through February 11, 2020. Existing scales were modified to measure ASD and six potential stressors including information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to assess the unique association of information uncertainty with ASD. To minimize the effect of large sample size and also to get a sense of whether the effects of information uncertainty were similar to people at the center of the epidemic, we repeated the hierarchical regression among 10% of the students who were randomly selected from the entire sample (""10% random sample""; n = 780) and 226 students from Hubei Province where the outbreak started. RESULTS: Information uncertainty was highly prevalent among the respondents (64%). It was significantly associated with ASD beyond other key variables and potential stressors across three samples. In the hierarchical regression among the entire sample, demographic variables accounted for 9.4% of the variance in ASD. The other five stressors added 5.1% of the variance. The information uncertainty (ß = .159; p < .001) explained an additional 2.1% of the variance. Likewise, the information uncertainty explained an additional 2.1 and 3.4% of the variance in ASD beyond all other variables among the 10% random sample (ß = .165; p < .001) and the Hubei sample (ß = .196; p < .01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Information uncertainty is a unique correlate of psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Reducing information uncertainty is essential not only for halting virus transmission but also for mitigating negative impacts of the pandemic on people's psychosocial wellbeing. Transparent, timely, and accurate communication can reduce public confusion, fear, and stress. Capacity building in governments, communities, and media outlets to prevent, reduce and manage information uncertainty should be a critical part of the response to an emerging global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Danhua; Friedman, Daniela B; Qiao, Shan; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoyan; Li, Xiaoming",BMC Public Health,330,24

Our objectives were to analyze mortality and its independent risk factors, and to assess the occurrence of a favorable evolution, defined as hospital discharge, or stay at the ward, or transfer from ICU to ward. Patients were stratified int o 4 subgroups: admission to the ward with pneumo nia and/or oxygen requirement (WARD;n=100);ICU admission (ICU;n=87);ICU admission with requirement of mechanical ventilation (ICU-MV;n=56), and ICU-MV plus septic shock (ICU-MV-SS;N=29).

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a major health problem and one of the most common causes of pain in the front of the knee in outpatients. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapeutic physical exercise (TPE) program supervised by a physiotherapist using telematic channels in reducing pain and disability in a sample of 54 patients with PFPS in the Physiotherapy Service of the San José de la Rinconada Health Center (Seville). Subjects were evaluated pre- and post-intervention (4 weeks-12 treatment sessions). An analysis was made of perceived pain-using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the DN4 neuropathic pain questionnaire-and functional balance-through the Kujala Score test and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale. The supervised TPE program in patients with PFPS produced a reduction in pain: VAS F1, 52 = 8.68 (p = 0.005) Î·2 = 0.14 and DN4: F1, 52 = 69.94 (p = 0.000) Î·2 = 0.57; and in Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) disability: F1, 52 = 19.1 (p = 0.000) Î·2 = 0.27 and KUJALA: F1, 52 = 60.28 (p = 0.000) Î·2 = 0.54, which was statistically significant (p = 0.000 for p < 0.05).

We hypothesised that preoperative intravenous iron and tranexamic acid (TXA) may reduce the transfusion rate in these patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HiFIT study is a multicentre, 2×2 factorial, randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial evaluating the effect of iron isomaltoside (IIM) (20 mg/kg) vs placebo and of TXA (intravenously at inclusion and topically during surgery) versus placebo on transfusion rate during hospitalisation, in patients undergoing emergency surgery for HF and having a preoperative haemoglobin between 95 and 130 g/L. 780 patients are expected. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients receiving an allogenic blood transfusion of packed red blood cells from the day of surgery until hospital discharge (or until D30 if patient is still hospitalised). Enrolment started on March 2017 in 11 French hospitals. The study was stopped between July 2017 and August 2018 (because of investigation of serious AEs with IIM in Spain) and slowed down since March 2020 (COVID-19 crisis). The expected date of final follow-up is May 2022. Analyses of the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations are planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The HiFIT trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest II and the French authorities (ANSM). It will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. The HiFIT trial will be the largest study evaluating iron and TXA in patients with HF.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study from December 18th 2015 to March 18th 2016 in three public hospitals in Douala. Three hundred and sixty participants were studied prospectively for associated factors using a multivariate logistic regression model and 4732 files were studied retrospectively for the prevalence of infertility. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The prevalence of couple infertility was 19.2%. In logistic models, the factors which independently increased the risk of couple infertility were a history of reproductive tract infection/STI, a history of uterine fibroids, a history of dysmenorrhea and abortion for the females while for males it was a history of mumps, erectile dysfunction and exposure to chemicals/toxic substances/pesticides. Conclusion: One in every five couples in this study was infertile. Several factors affect the risks associated with couple infertility. The identification of these factors could help detect subgroups of couples at high risk of infertility. Reproductive health education, screening programmes for STI's that may lead to infertility should be offered to couples.","Egbe, Thomas Obinchemti; Mbaki, Charmaine Ngo; Tendongfor, Nicholas; Temfack, Elvis; Belley-Priso, Eugene",Afr Health Sci,330,26

Clinical trials are an important alternative for the treatment of oncologic patients, especially in Latin America, where trials can be the only opportunity for some of them to access novel and, sometimes, standard treatments. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, in which a 22-question survey regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology clinical trials was sent to 350 representatives of research programs in selected Latin American institutions, members of the Latin American Cooperative Oncology Group. RESULTS: There were 90 research centers participating in the survey, with 70 of them from Brazil. The majority were partly private or fully private (n = 77; 85.6%) and had confirmed COVID-19 cases at the institution (n = 57; 63.3%). Accruals were suspended at least for some studies in 80% (n = 72) of the responses, mostly because of sponsors' decision. Clinical trials' routine was affected by medical visits cancelation, reduction of patients' attendance, reduction of other specialties' availability, and/or alterations on follow-up processes. Formal COVID-19 mitigation policies were adopted in 96.7% of the centers, including remote monitoring and remote site initiation visits, telemedicine visits, reduction of research team workdays or home office, special consent procedures, shipment of oral drugs directly to patients' home, and increase in outpatient diagnostic studies. Importantly, some of these changes were suggested to be part of future oncology clinical trials' routine, particularly the ones regarding remote methods, such as telemedicine. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this was the first survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on Latin American oncology clinical trials. The results are consistent with surveys from other world regions. These findings may endorse improvements in clinical trials' processes and management in the postpandemic period.","Lara Gongora, Aline B; Werutsky, Gustavo; Jardim, Denis L; Nogueira-Rodrigues, Angelica; Barrios, Carlos H; Mathias, Clarissa; Maluf, Fernando; Riechelmann, Rachel; Fraga, Maurício; Gomes, Henry; William, William N; Yamada, Camilla A F; de Castro, Gilberto; Rosa, Daniela D; de Melo, Andreia C; Sala, Raul; Bustamante, Eva; Bretel, Denisse; Arrieta, Oscar; Cardona, Andrés F; Bastos, Diogo A",JCO Glob Oncol,330,24

Given the time limitations (due to their heavy workloads) and need to minimize face-to-face interventions (in order to avoid contagions), psychological interventions for FHCWs should be as brief and remote as possible. Objective To evaluate the usability and clarity of evidence-based psycho-educational videos to prevent B&CF, to deal with uncooperative, hostile, and anxious patients and relatives, and to use personal protective equipment (PPE), from the perspective of Mexican FLHCWs. Method Based on a convenience sampling by intensity approach, videos were distributed requesting feedback based on specific questions through WhatsApp to FLHCWs. Field notes were used to triangulate the information. Results Content analysis of feedback from a final sample of 24 participants &#8210;75% women, 42 ± 8.4 years old&#8210; yielded three general thematic categories and seven subthemes: 1. content evaluation, which included three subthemes: utility, pertinence, and practicality; 2. dissemination and other needs, with two subcategories: willingness to share and receive more videos (other needs); and 3. format aspects, also comprising two subthemes: attractiveness and duration. All participants found the videos content very beneficial, relevant, and applicable to the workplace and even in their everyday personal and family life, and were willing to share them and to receive more videos on other issues, including strategies to manage problems related to isolation. Discussion and conclusion Escalation of this remote preventive intervention to other COVID-19 centers and future similar epidemics is recommended.","Robles, Rebeca; Palacios, Marcela; Rangel, Nancy; Real, Tania; Becerra, Benjamín; Fresán, Ana; Vega, Hamid; Rodríguez, Evelyn; Durand, Sol; Madrigal, Eduardo",Salud ment,330,16

The frothing ability of these plants is attributed to saponins which are also welldocumented to possess antimicrobial attributes. In the light of COVID-19, soap and hand hygiene have taken center stage. The pandemic has also revealed the low access to running water and commercial soaps in many marginalized and poor communities to the detriment of global health. Thus, soapy plants, either in their natural form or through incorporation in commercial products, may be a relevant additional weapon to assist communities to improve hand hygiene and contribute to curbing COVID-19 and other communicable infections. This review paper was compiled from a review of literature that was published between 1980 and 2020. We found 68 plant species, including those which are already used as traditional soaps. Our findings support the potential use of extracts from soapy plants because of their putative viricidal, bactericidal, and fungicidal activities for use in crude home-based formulations and possibly for developing natural commercial soap products. © 2021 by the authors.

They display advanced cognitive abilities, and the size of their large nervous system rivals that of many mammals. However, only one third of the neurons constitute the CNS, while the rest are located in an elaborate PNS, including eight arms, each containing myriad sensory receptors of various modalities [2-4]. This led early workers to question the extent to which the CNS is privy to non-visual sensory input from the periphery and to suggest that it has limited capacity to finely control arm movement [3-5]. This conclusion seemed reasonable considering the size of the PNS and the results of early behavioral tests [3, 6-8]. We recently demonstrated that octopuses use visual information to control goal-directed complex single arm movements [9]. However, that study did not establish whether animals use information from the arm itself [9-12]. We here report on development of two-choice, single-arm mazes that test the ability of octopuses to perform operant learning tasks that mimic normal tactile exploration behavior and require the non-peripheral neural circuitry to use focal sensory information originating in single arms [1, 10]. We show that the CNS of the octopus uses peripheral information about arm motion as well as tactile input to accomplish learning tasks that entail directed control of movement. We conclude that although octopus arms have a great capacity to act independently, they are also subject to central control, allowing well-organized, purposeful behavior of the organism as a whole.","Gutnick, Tamar; Zullo, Letizia; Hochner, Binyamin; Kuba, Michael J",Curr. biol,330,20

Thus, a sufficient level of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) must be ensured. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the KAP toward COVID-19 among HCWs in Shiraz, Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a large sample of HCWs dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple hospitals affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The survey featured four sections: demographic data, knowledge, attitude, and practice. An expert panel validated the questionnaire, and its reliability was ensured through a pilot study on 20 HCWs (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.9). Results: We found that 72.8% of HCWs had sufficient knowledge, 66.65% indicated correct attitudes, and 67.72% described good practices. However, 24.23% thought adequate protective equipment or facilities are unavailable. The knowledge scores were lowest on prevention and diagnosis, though symptoms were well-recognized. The male gender was correlated with more correct attitudes. Among nurses, 2-5 years of work experience was associated with better practice, with a master’s degree being related to more positive attitudes. Conclusions: The KAP of HCWs toward COVID-19 are acceptable in Shiraz, but further education and training is beneficial, especially on disinfectants and prevention;reassurance regarding protective equipment is also vital. © 2020, Author(s).","Kamali Haghighi, F.; Kouhi, P.; Amini, M.; Sepehrpoor, V.

We examined the impact of these tiered restrictions, and alternatives for lockdown stringency, timing, and duration, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19. METHODS: We fit an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to data on hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy (ISARIC4C/COVID-19 Clinical Information Network, National Health Service [NHS] England), seroprevalence (Office for National Statistics, UK Biobank, REACT-2 study), virology (REACT-1 study), and deaths (Public Health England) across the seven NHS England regions from March 1, to Oct 13, 2020. We analysed mobility (Google Community Mobility) and social contact (CoMix study) data to estimate the effect of tiered restrictions implemented in England, and of lockdowns implemented in Northern Ireland and Wales, in October, 2020, and projected epidemiological scenarios for England up to March 31, 2021. FINDINGS: We estimated a reduction in the effective reproduction number (Rt) of 2% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0-4) for tier 2, 10% (6-14) for tier 3, 35% (30-41) for a Northern Ireland-stringency lockdown with schools closed, and 44% (37-49) for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools closed. From Oct 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, a projected COVID-19 epidemic without tiered restrictions or lockdown results in 280â000 (95% projection interval 274â000-287â000) hospital admissions and 58â500 (55â800-61â100) deaths. Tiered restrictions would reduce hospital admissions to 238â000 (231â000-245â000) and deaths to 48â600 (46â400-50â700). From Nov 5, 2020, a 4-week Wales-type lockdown with schools remaining open-similar to the lockdown measures announced in England in November, 2020-was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 186â000 (179â000-193â000) and deaths to 36â800 (34â900-38â800). Closing schools was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 157â000 (152â000-163â000) and deaths to 30â300 (29â000-31â900). A projected lockdown of greater than 4 weeks would reduce deaths but would bring diminishing returns in reducing peak pressure on hospital services. An earlier lockdown would have reduced deaths and hospitalisations in the short term, but would lead to a faster resurgence in cases after January, 2021. In a post-hoc analysis, we estimated that the second lockdown in England (Nov 5-Dec 2) reduced Rt by 22% (95% CrI 15-29), rather than the 32% (25-39) reduction estimated for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools open. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown measures outperform less stringent restrictions in reducing cumulative deaths. We projected that the lockdown policy announced to commence in England on Nov 5, with a similar stringency to the lockdown adopted in Wales, would reduce pressure on the health service and would be well timed to suppress deaths over the winter period, while allowing schools to remain open. Following completion of the analysis, we analysed new data from November, 2020, and found that despite similarities in policy, the second lockdown in England had a smaller impact on behaviour than did the second lockdown in Wales, resulting in more deaths and hospitalisations than we originally projected when focusing on a Wales-stringency scenario for the lockdown.

The annual average number of flights taken by adults vary between 0.1 (visiting friends) and 0.8 (going on holiday), and the amount of CO2e emissions generated by each return flight is approximately 1100 kg. This leads to a total of 6 million tonnes CO2e emissions per year. Results of the Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood estimations reveal that the amount of CO2e emissions created is related to socio-demographic, locational and seasonal factors, although mainly for the largest group of travellers: the holiday makers. In this group, individuals with university degrees, young persons (16-24 years) and capital city residents generate the largest amounts of emissions, as opposed to persons with children and large households. Residents of the capital region each quarter cause 64 kg more CO2e emissions than inhabitants of rural areas, persons with university degrees create 74 kg larger emissions than those without degrees and young adults instigate 90 kg more emissions than middle-aged persons. CO2e emissions of holiday flights are highest in the first quarter of the year.

It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. RESULTS: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazil's epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million.","Veiga E Silva, Lena; de Andrade Abi Harb, Maria Da Penha; Teixeira Barbosa Dos Santos, Aurea Milene; de Mattos Teixeira, Carlos André; Macedo Gomes, Vitor Hugo; Silva Cardoso, Evelin Helena; S da Silva, Marcelino; Vijaykumar, N L; Venâncio Carvalho, Solon; Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho, André; Lisboa Frances, Carlos Renato",J Med Internet Res,330,16

Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has a bad clinical outcome, and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs. However, the etiology of severe COVID-19 has been largely unknown. Similar as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses. However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat; but it can produce severe inflammations in human.

Currently the potential extra-respiratory transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. METHODS: Using single-cell RNA Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets and immunohistochemical analysis, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the embryonic, fetal and adult human ocular surface. RESULTS: The co-expression of ACE2 receptor and entry protease TMPRSS2 was detected in the human adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium, but not in the embryonic and fetal ocular surface up to 21 post conception weeks. These expression patterns were corroborated by the single cell ATAC-Seq data, which revealed a permissive chromatin in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 loci in the adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium. Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was strongly detected in the superficial limbal, corneal and conjunctival epithelium, implicating these as target entry cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface. Strikingly, we also identified the key pro-inflammatory signals TNF, NFKß and IFNG as upstream regulators of the transcriptional profile of ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in the superficial conjunctival epithelium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilise inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression to enhance infection in ocular surface. CONCLUSIONS: Together our data indicate that the human ocular surface epithelium provides an additional entry portal for SARS-CoV-2, which may exploit inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry factors to enhance infection.","Collin, Joseph; Queen, Rachel; Zerti, Darin; Dorgau, Birthe; Georgiou, Maria; Djidrovski, Ivo; Hussain, Rafiqul; Coxhead, Jonathan M; Joseph, Agatha; Rooney, Paul; Lisgo, Steven; Figueiredo, Francisco; Armstrong, Lyle; Lako, Majlinda",Ocular surf,330,33

This process is based on a minimal number of suitably-designed group tests on subsets of items, where the test outcome is positive iff the given test contains at least one defective item. Motivated by physical considerations, we consider a generalized setting that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature. In our setting, which subsumes as special cases a variety of noiseless and noisy group-testing models in the literature, the test outcome is positive with probability $f(x)$, where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in a pool, and $f(\cdot)$ is an arbitrary monotonically increasing (stochastic) test function. Our main contributions are as follows. 1. We present a non-adaptive scheme that with probability $1-\varepsilon$ identifies all defective items. Our scheme requires at most ${\cal O}( H(f) d\log\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right))$ tests, where $H(f)$ is a suitably defined""sensitivity parameter""of $f(\cdot)$, and is never larger than ${\cal O}\left(d^{1+o(1)}\right)$, but may be substantially smaller for many $f(\cdot)$. 2. We argue that any testing scheme (including adaptive schemes) needs at least $\Omega \left((1-\varepsilon)h(f) d\log\left(\frac n d\right)\right)$ tests to ensure reliable recovery. Here $h(f) \geq 1$ is a suitably defined""concentration parameter""of $f(\cdot)$. 3.

Variables to measure aspects to ease the isolation impact (ease-isolating variables) were also included. Method: 539 Brazilian adults were recruited by convenience from March 25 to April 07, 2020. We administered a questionnaire on isolation behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO-5, the GHQ-12, the CLA, the GAD-7, the PSS-10, and the CES-D. To analyze data, we relied upon the network analysis approach. Results: COVID-19 isolation variables showed positive relationships with mental health indicators, and ease-isolating variables presented mixed associations with mental health indicators. For instance, satisfaction with the quality of social interactions connected strongly and positively with the well-being variable, while negatively with loneliness and general psychological symptoms. Conclusions: Our hypotheses were partially confirmed. We can conclude that the damage to mental health associated with social isolation during the pandemic can be minimized by maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships. We have three direct recommendations: mental health professionals should (a) elaborate strategies that contemplate the use of virtual tools to alleviate depressive feelings resulting from isolation, (b) give particular attention to risk groups that are most impacted by the isolation imposed by a pandemic situation and may suffer from loneliness, and (c) consider anxiety control strategies for the anxiogenic adverse reaction generated by the worldwide alert in times of disease outbreaks.","Gonçalves, André Pereira; Zuanazzi, Ana Carolina; Salvador, Ana Paula; Jaloto, Alexandre; Pianowski, Giselle; Carvalho, Lucas de Francisco",Arch.

However, most methods for estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of coronavirus disease and testing practices from different states in the United States from March 4 to August 30, 2020. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of coronavirus disease.","Pitzer, Virginia E; Chitwood, Melanie; Havumaki, Joshua; Menzies, Nicolas A; Perniciaro, Stephanie; Warren, Joshua L; Weinberger, Daniel M; Cohen, Ted",Am. j. epidemiol,330,11

Serological tests have been proposed as reliable tools for detecting Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in infected patients, especially for surveillance or epidemiological purposes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the agreement between the IgM/IgG rapid assays, based on lateral flow immunochromatographic assay, and the fully automated 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, based on chemiluminescence immunoassay. Materials and methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS IgM/IgG test (BIOSYNEX, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) and the MAGLUMI CLIA (IgM and IgG) (SNIBE - Shenzhen New Industries Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen, China) in 70 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. The strength of the agreement of the two methods was calculated by using the Cohen Kappa index. Results: The results showed a good grade of concordance between the two immunoassays with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.54-0.87) for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 0.70 (95%CI: 0.53-0.87) for IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In addition, the rapid assays BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 10.63 (95%CI: 2.79-40.57) for IgG and a LR of 6.79 (95%CI: 2.93-15.69) for IgM. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the immunochromatographic rapid IgM/IgG test and the chemiluminescence IgM and IgG immunoassay have a good degree of concordance, suggesting that both could be considered as useful tools for epidemiologic surveillance.","Gambino, Caterina Maria; Lo Sasso, Bruna; Colomba, Claudia; Giglio, Rosaria Vincenza; Agnello, Luisa; Bivona, Giulia; Ciaccio, Marcello",Biochem Med (Zagreb),330,16

The ""new normal"" we are living in to defend ourselves against this tiny yet dangerous enemy has serious repercussions on children's lives. This becomes even more evident if we think of those children who are doubly vulnerable - they are even more fragile because they live in conditions of particular hardship when they live outside their family, have a disability, or live in poverty. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the proliferation of numerous initiatives by various national and international children's rights institutions, which have called for urgent measures to protect children's rights. At this precise moment, the concept of the child's best interests is also reinterpreted as a result of a reasonable compression of certain children's rights and the prevalence of others. The present paper will attempt an analytical reconstruction of children's fundamental rights by analyzing how these rights have changed during the pandemic. In fact, it is necessary to know if and/or how much have the rights of minors changed as a result of the emergency. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the question of which children's rights will be most compromised or changed in the post-Covid-19 era.

RNA and related retro viruses represent a large and diverse family that contribute to the onset of human diseases such as AIDS; certain cancers like T cell lymphoma; severe acute respiratory illnesses as seen with COVID-19; and others. The hallmark of this viral family is the storage of genetic material in the form of RNA, and upon infecting host cells, their RNA genomes reprogram the cellular environment to favor productive viral replication. RNA is a multifunctional biomolecule that not only stores and transmits heritable information, but it also has the capacity to catalyze complex biochemical reactions. It is therefore no surprise that RNA viruses use this functional diversity to their advantage to sustain chronic or lifelong infections. Efforts to subvert RNA viruses therefore requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which these pathogens usurp cellular machinery. Here, we briefly summarize several experimental techniques that individually inform on key physicochemical features of viral RNA genomes and their interactions with proteins. Each of these techniques provide important vantage points to understand the complexities of virus-host interactions, but we attempt to make the case that by integrating these and similar methods, more vivid descriptions of how viruses reprogram the cellular environment emerges. These vivid descriptions should expedite the identification of novel therapeutic targets.","Haddad, Christina; Davila-Calderon, Jesse; Tolbert, Blanton S",Methods,330,18

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory infection by binding to ACE2 receptors present on alveolar epithelial cells, studies have been published linking the disease to the small intestine enterocytes and its microbiome. Dysbiosis of microbiome, mainly intestinal and lung, can affect the course of the disease. Environmental factors, such as reduced intake of commensal bacteria from the environment or their products in the diet, play an important role in microbiome formation, which can significantly affect the immune response. In elderly, obese or chronically ill people, the microbiota is often damaged. Therefore, we speculate that a good microbiome may be one of the factors responsible for lower CFR from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An approach using tailored nutrition and supplements known to improve the intestinal microbiota and its immune function might help minimize the impact of the disease at least on people at higher risk from coronavirus.","Janda, Lubomír; Mihalcin, Matús; Stastná, Michaela",Biologia (Bratisl),330,19

Our hypotheses were that being a junior doctor, having a previous mental health diagnosis and treating Covid-19 positive patients would predict higher rates of distress. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey conducted via Survey Monkey. Voluntary participants were recruited from the mailing list of a national-based referral service for doctors to psychiatrists. Distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Demographic factors were analysed for predictive value of a higher rating on the K10. Areas of concern in relation to Covid-19 and preference for support services were measured on a Likert scale and compared to levels of distress. RESULTS: The rate of very high distress was 15%. Being a junior doctor and having a previous mental health diagnosis were predictive factors of a higher K10 score. K10 was not affected by likelihood of contact with Covid-19-positive patients. Social isolation had a larger impact on mental health in the context of a previous psychiatric diagnosis. Face-to-face assessments were preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of distress in doctors have been higher than baseline during Covid-19. Some groups have been particularly vulnerable.","Adams, Michelle Anne; Brazel, Matthew; Thomson, Richard; Lake, Hannah",Australas Psychiatry,330,2

For those patients who are ready to embrace nutrition as an essential part of the healing process, however, it is oftentimes difficult to find healthy menus at hospitals. Meat-based entrées, sugar-sweetened beverages and candy appear to be omnipresent in cafeterias and restaurants at U.S. hospitals. On the other hand, healthy plant-based menus are still the exception rather than the rule. Some states undertook considerable efforts to change this and made plant-based meals the law. Upon request by a patient, hospitals in New York are now required by law to provide plant-based options at every meal. This recent development triggered a controversial discussion within the medical community whether other states should follow this example and make plant-based hospital menus the law as well. This editorial illuminates why mandatory plant-based hospital menus could be a win-win situation for many involved stakeholders, including patients, hospitals and food services. This step is not a loss-marking venture for hospitals but rather a chance to save money and to improve corporate brand marketing at the same time. The introduction of mandatory plant-based menus in hospitals at a large scale represents a unique opportunity at the nexus of health, innovative corporate strategies and economics. Adequate framework conditions are necessary to ensure that all individuals can make healthy and affordable dietary choices while being hospitalized.","Storz, Maximilian Andreas",Hosp Pract (1995),330,1

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese civil servants have faced high workloads that may contribute to mental disorders. We assessed the prevalence of both depression and anxiety symptoms among civil servants in Jiangsu and surrounding provinces using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Methods: The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: In total, 867 Chinese civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control were included in our study. Overall, 37.25 and 38.06% of all respondents reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Respondents who were younger and more educated and those who had fewer years of work experience had higher scores for both depression and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being younger, having more education and having fewer years of work experience were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, whether they had experience combating infectious diseases or worked in frontline, there was no significant difference between respondents with and without experience, as well as between frontline and non-frontline workers, in both symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: The civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control reported suffering from varying degrees of mental disorders. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to the psychological distress of these civil servants.","Hu, Qingqing; Hu, Xiaochu; Zheng, Beibei; Li, Lanjuan",Front Public Health,330,16

The COVID 19 pandemic has underscored long-existing health inequalities, both within countries and between the Global North and South. These disparities have been observed throughout the pandemic, from disparities in the severity and impact of the initial waves of cases to disparities in who was most protected during the roll-out of vaccination. As the Delta variant surges in many countries, structural inequalities shape the trajectory of the pandemic and exacerbate existing health disparities. In the age of vaccination, the double burden of disparities in both exposure to infection and vaccination coverage intersect to determine the current and future patterns of infection, immunity, and mortality. It is important to consider the ways in which these disparities, with overlapping but distinct drivers, interact to determine population-level immunity and the burden of COVID 19 in different communities. Individuals or communities can experience different pathways to immunity, whether through infection, vaccination, or both. Using San Francisco as a case study, we show how a seroepidemiological approach can illuminate disparities in the pathway to immunity.","Routledge, Isobel; Takahashi, Saki; Epstein, Adrienne; Hakim, Jill; Janson, Owen; Turcios, Kierstinne; Vinden, Joanna; Risos, John Tomas; Banquied, Margaret Rose; Pham, Lori; Germano, Clara Di; Busch, Michael Paul; Kushel, Margot B; Greenhouse, Bryan; Rodriguez-Barranquer, Isabel",,330,16

Multiple treatment protocols have been proposed worldwide with no definitive answer for acure. A prior retrospective study showed association between bitter taste receptor 38 (T2R38) phenotypes and the severity of COVID-19. Based on this, we proposed assessing the different T2R38 phenotypes response towards a targeted treatment protocol. Starting July 2020 till December 2020, we tested subjects for T2R38 phenotypic expression (supertasters, tasters, and nontasters). Subjects who were subsequently infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (diagnosed via PCR) were included. Based on their taster status, supertasters were given dexamethasone for 4 days; tasters were given azithromycin and dexamethasone +/- hydroxychloroquine for 7 days; and nontasters were given azithromycin and dexamethasone for 12 days. Subjects were followed prospectively and their outcomes were documented. Seven hundred forty-seven COVID-19 patients were included, with 184 (24.7%) supertasters, 371 (49.6%) tasters, and192 (25.7%) nontasters. The average duration of symptoms with the treatment protocol was 5 days for supertasters, 8.1 days for tasters, and 16.2 days for nontasters. Only three subjects (0.4%) required hospitalization (3/3 nontasters). Targeted treatment protocol showed significant correlation (p < 0.05) based on patients' T2R38 phenotypic expression. Assessing treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients according to their T2R38 phenotype could provide insight into the inconsistent results obtained from the different studies worldwide. Further study is warranted on the categorization of patients based on their T2R38 phenotype.","Taha, Mohamed A; Hall, Christian A; Shortess, Colin J; Rathbone, Richard F; Barham, Henry P",Viruses,330,23

Deltoid skin microvascular complement screening has been applied to patients with various systemic complement-mediated microvascular syndromes, best exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In 21 of 23 cases, substantial microvascular deposition of complement components was identified. The two patients without significant complement deposition included one patient with moderate disease and a severely ill patient who although on a ventilator for a day was discharged after 3 days. The dominant microvascular complement immunoreactant identified was the terminal membranolytic attack complex C5b-9. Microvascular complement deposition strongly colocalized in situ with the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and nonlesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. Microvascular SARS-CoV-2 viral protein, complement, and ACE2 expression was most conspicuous in the subcutaneous fat. Although the samples from severely ill patients with COVID-19 were from grossly normal skin, light microscopically focal microvascular abnormalities were evident that included endothelial cell denudement, basement membrane zone reduplication, and small thrombi. It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, especially in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19, and the strong colocalization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (ie, pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.","Magro, Cynthia M; Mulvey, J Justin; Laurence, Jeffrey; Seshan, Surya; Crowson, A Neil; Dannenberg, Andrew J; Salvatore, Steven; Harp, Joanna; Nuovo, Gerard J",Hum Pathol,330,16

This initiative became of great importance with the COVID-19 pandemic because it helped the CV service better navigate and more efficiently meet the patient care needs associated with patient care restrictions. The CV service had to quickly evaluate and implement measures to reduce the rate of transmission of the coronavirus, which included adapting the clinic workflow to comply with state and federal recommendations. To minimize the interruption of clinical services and the associated revenue, a rapid transition from outpatient clinic visits to telehealth visits was implemented. CASES: Two cases reports of patients with wounds managed with 2 different telehealth platforms are described. Doxy.me platform allows the provider to e-mail or text a link to their personal waiting room for patients to join the video call. The second platform is Cisco Jabber platform to connect directly to the nursing unit at a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION: Health care systems have had to adjust the manner in which they triage, evaluate, and care for patients using telehealth platforms that do not rely on in-person clinic visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are multiple telehealth platforms that require careful planning and treatment implementation.

stanowiącego być może kluczowy aspekt rozejścia się demokratycznej praktyki z teorią państwa nowoczesnego - wymaga z jednej strony obserwacji i analizy przekazów medialnych, z drugiej - uważnego namysłu nad niektórymi przykładami diagnozy nowoczesności, antycypującymi obecny stan rzeczy Zdaniem autora, szczególną rolę może tutaj odegrać spuścizna myślicieli amerykańskich z 1 połowy XX wieku PROCES WYWODU: Autor zaczyna od spostrzeżeń dotyczących sposobu relacjonowania w mediach stanowiska ekspertów dotyczącego ""walki z koronawirusem"", by następnie przejść do uogólnień na temat roli mediów oraz wykształconych elit Kolejne szczeble wywodu wiążą się z przywołaniem odpowiednich fragmentów diagnozy nowoczesnego państwa i społeczeństwa, formułowanych przez: Saula Bellowa, Christophera Lascha, Waltera Lippmanna, Roberta Shafera, Irvinga Babbitta, Paula Elmera More'a i George'a Santayanę W trzeciej części eseju stara się powrócić do zarysowanych wcześniej uogólnień, kładąc dodatkowy akcent na specyfikę doświadczenia polskiego (jednocześnie uzasadniając czerpanie z dorobku myślicieli amerykańskich) WYNIKI ANALIZY NAUKOWEJ: Wnioski z powziętych rozważań mogą dotyczyć: a) relewantności humanistycznej diagnozy nowoczesnego państwa i społeczeństwa (budowanej na podstawie refleksji wokół konieczności zbudowania nowych form arystokraqi w ramach ustroju demokratycznego), b) realności procesów zachodzących w skali globalnej, podważających demokratyczne consensus wskutek dominacji postaw irracjonalnych, c) konieczności wykorzystania tego rodzaju refleksji (dotyczącej wiedzy i rozumności) dla celów związanych z wychowaniem obywatelskim WNIOSKI, INNOWACJE, REKOMENDACJE: Tekst stanowi zachętę do refleksji badawczej, niestroniącej od inspiracji z zakresu historii idei, nad zmienną kondycją współczesnej demokracji, której istotne -

who either exert influence on actions taken by the decision makers or become used by the latter in order to justify their decisions - and the general public living under conditions of the so-called ""media democracy"" which mean, at it seems, the gradual predominance of the irrational attitude as well as distrust of the science To study this process - one that probably indicates the key aspect of parting ways between the practice of democracy and the theory of modern state - requires not only some observation and analysis of the media coverage but also a careful reflection on some cases of the diagnosis of modernity, insofar as they had anticipated the present-day situation And this may be the case of a couple of American thinkers from the 1 half of the 20 th century THE PROCESS OF ARGUMENTATION: ""The article begins with some notes on the actual media coverage of experts talking about the ""fight against coronavirus,"" and then we confront some useful generalizations about the role of mass-media and educated elites In the course of the argument there are references to passages providing examples of the diagnosis of the modern state and society by Saul Bellow, Christopher Lasch, Water Lippmann, Robert Shafer, Paul Elmer More, and George Santayana In the third part of the essay we return, in a mode, to the previous generalizations, while putting stress on a peculiarity of Polish experience (that should, nevertheless, turn out to be related to the legacy of American thinkers as mentioned above) RESEARCH RESULTS: They can be given as the following suggestions: a) the humanistic diagnosis of the modern state and society (based on the considerations about forms of aristocracy desirable from the democratic point of view) remains relevant to us, b) what we witness are real processes, taken place all over the globe, which undermine the consent (upon which democracy rests) since irrational attitudes now become prevalent within what happens, c) any serious reflection on that matter (i e , the political meaning of knowledge and rational discourse) must be connected with goals on the field of citizens' education CONCLUSIONS, INNOVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This text is, above all, the attempt to encourage scholars to reflect, having inspiration from the history of ideas, on the changing condition of contemporary democracy Its crucial - and troublesome - features become clear especially in the context of universal threat (or universal perception of such a thing) The reflection in question should not be treated as merely a response to our intellectual desires revealing, instead, the sense of responsibility for our fellow citizens who are mostly unconscious of the true value of rational public debate","Armada, Paweł",Horyzonty Polityki,330,10

An epidemiologic analysis of the nationwide COVID register, therefore, is necessary to outline and describe the impact in such population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the characteristics of a cohort of 5062 patients <18 years of age, until June 16, 2020, reported at the National Institute of Health-INS (https://www.ins.gov.co/News./Pages/Coronavirus.aspx), through the national public access database, with all subjects confirmed with COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2. RESULTS: Reviewed on June 16, 2020, a total of 54,971 confirmed cases were reported nationwide for COVID-19, of which 5062 (9.2%) are cases in patients under 18 years of age. There was a statistically significant difference between groups; age was statistically significantly higher in the asymptomatic, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate cases; moreover, age was statistically significantly higher in the mild, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate. Statistically significant difference determined with one-way ANOVA was found between groups (F = 16.08, P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis reveals significant differences between groups, the age of patients at home (9.39 years) and those recovered (9.3 years) being significantly higher than those in intensive care unit (4.9 years), in hospital (6.1 years), or than the deceased (2.9 years). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that, at the nationwide level, patients in more severe states (deceased, severe and moderate), are significantly younger than those in the milder state (asymptomatic and mild).","Bolaños-Almeida, Carlos Ernesto; Espitia Segura, Oscar Mauricio",Pediatr Infect Dis J,330,2

Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of human DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor so far with an EC50 of 17 nmol/L and an SI value of 10,505.88 in infected cells. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knock-out cells. This work demonstrates that both S312/S416 and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-regulation may have clinical potentials to cure SARS-CoV-2 or other RNA viruses circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses are mutated or not.","Xiong, Rui; Zhang, Leike; Li, Shiliang; Sun, Yuan; Ding, Minyi; Wang, Yong; Zhao, Yongliang; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Shan, Jiwei; Shen, Zihao; Tong, Yi; Xu, Liuxin; Chen, Yu; Liu, Yingle; Zou, Gang; Lavillete, Dimitri; Zhao, Zhenjiang; Wang, Rui; Zhu, Lili; Xiao, Gengfu; Lan, Ke; Li, Honglin; Xu, Ke",Protein Cell,330,16

Methods: A scoping review was conducted with multiple searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL databases. Full text articles in English were included if they involved humans with COVID-19. The search was updated twice, the latest on 19 May 2020. Results: After screening 266 records and cross referencing, 85 articles were included. The articles were case studies, opinion papers, letters to editors, and a few observational studies. No articles were found regarding cognitive consequences in COVID-19 patients. All reported on neurological manifestations and/or underlying mechanisms of CNS involvement in COVID-19. Conclusion: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 vary from mild (e.g. loss of taste and smell, dizziness, headache) to severe (e.g. ischemic stroke, encephalitis). Underlying pathways are suggested to be both indirect (as a result of thrombotic complication, inflammatory consequences, hypoxia, blood pressure dysregulation), and direct (neurotropic properties of the virus).

Due to an unexpected and huge increasing in number of patients during coronavirus (novel COVID-19) pandemic, it is considerably indispensable to monitor patients' health condition continuously before any serious disorder or infection occur. According to transferring the huge volume of produced sensitive health data of patients who do not want their private medical information to be revealed, dealing with security issues of IoT data as a major concern and a challenging problem has remained yet. Encountering this challenge, in this paper, a remote health monitoring model that applies a lightweight block encryption method for provisioning security for health and medical data in cloud-based IoT environment is presented. In this model, the patients' health statuses are determined via predicting critical situations through data mining methods for analyzing their biological data sensed by smart medical IoT devices in which a lightweight secure block encryption technique is used to ensure the patients' sensitive data become protected. Lightweight block encryption methods have a crucial effective influence on this sort of systems due to the restricted resources in IoT platforms. Experimental outcomes show that K-star classification method achieves the best results among RF, MLP, SVM, and J48 classifiers, with accuracy of 95%, precision of 94.5%, recall of 93.5%, and f-score of 93.99%. Therefore, regarding the attained outcomes, the suggested model is successful in achieving an effective remote health monitoring model assisted by secure IoT data in cloud-based IoT platforms.","Akhbarifar, Samira; Javadi, Hamid Haj Seyyed; Rahmani, Amir Masoud; Hosseinzadeh, Mehdi",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,330,1

Accidental or intentional foreign body insertions pose a diagnostic challenge to surgeons and put them in demanding circumstances for successful extraction. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 60-year-old male with alleged history of accidental foreign body insertion into the rectum. Radiographs showed a linear metallic foreign body with crooked end. Computed Tomography (CT) with rectal contrast revealed contrast extravasation indicating anterior wall perforation of upper rectum. Patient was taken urgently for exploration and foreign body removal. Intra-operatively, bladder was injured inadvertently. Primary repair of enterotomy and loop sigmoid-ostomy was done besides bladder repair. Patient tested positive for COVID-19. Patient was observed in critical care unit for two days. Post-operative period was unremarkable apart from midline abdominal wound gape for which secondary closure was done. Patient was discharged with urinary catheter in-situ. Patient followed-up with a normal cystourethrogram and a well-functioning stoma. Stoma closure after two months was uneventful. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A thorough history and clinical examination is required and one should raise a high index of suspicion of perforation in patients with rectal foreign bodies, which should be managed appropriately and promptly to prevent sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. Inadvertent bladder injuries are common with lower-midline incisions. However, give good results when repaired suitably. CONCLUSION: The rationale behind this report is to explicate the complexity and hurdles in the surgical management of rectal foreign bodies causing impalement injury.","Balamurugan, Ganesan; Bhagvat, Shirish; Wagh, Amol; Jawale, Hemant; Reddy, Keerthika; Jain, Saurabh",Int J Surg Case Rep,330,16

This was especially true during the first epidemic peak in France, which coincided with the national lockdown (17 March 2020 to 10 May 2020). Patients with serious and urgent disease like stroke may have experienced a degradation of care, or may have been hesitant to seek healthcare during this period. The aim of this study was to identify, on a national level, whether a decrease in stroke admissions occurred in spring 2020, by analyzing the evolution of all stroke admissions in France from January 2019 to June 2020. MethodsWe conducted a nationwide cohort study using the French national database of hospital admissions (PMSI) to extract exhaustive data on all hospitalizations in France with at least one stroke diagnosis between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference in the slope gradients of stroke hospitalizations between pre-epidemic, epidemic peak and post-epidemic periods. Modeling was carried out using Bayesian techniques. ResultsStroke hospitalizations dropped from 10 March 2020 (slope gradient: -11.70), and began to rise again from 22 March (slope gradient: 2.090) to 7 May. In total, there were 23 873 stroke admissions during the period March-April 2020, compared to 29 263 at the same period in 2019, representing a decrease of 18.42%. The percentage change was -15.63%, - 25.19%, -18.62% for ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and hemorrhagic strokes, respectively. In spatial models of French departments, the incidence of COVID-19 explained the ratio of stroke hospitalizations.

Hass was rich in water soluble vitamins, iron and calcium while, Reed contains more fat soluble vitamins. Benzaldehyde and butyl phenol derivatives were the major volatile components identified by solid phase extraction in Hass and Reed, respectively. Naringenin and rutin were the major compounds identified in Hass and Reed by HPLC analysis respectively. Hass showed a promising antimicrobial activity, especially, against Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MIC = 7.81 µg/mL). Two targets sites were selected to investigate the mechanism of action of Hass, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin-like X and Serine/threonine kinases Proteins (STK). Molecular docking demonstrated high binding affinity of naringenin towards Enterotoxin-like X. However, high levels of rutin in Reed might account for its cytotoxic activity against colorectal adenocarcinoma. Avocado extracts may be used for developing potential antibiotics.","Younis, Inas Youssef; Hifnawy, Mohamed Saeed; El-Hawary, Seham Salaheldin; El Bishbishy, Mahitab Helmi; Elateek, Sawsan Youssef",Nat Prod Res,330,16

This is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), which transfers the AA primarily from diacyl choline-containing phospholipids to ethanolamine-containing phospholipids. In this work we have comparatively analyzed glycerophospholipid changes leading to AA mobilization in mouse peritoneal macrophages responding to either zymosan or serum-opsonized zymosan (OpZ). These two phagocytic stimuli promote the cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent mobilization of AA by activating distinct surface receptors. Application of mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling to identify changes in AA-containing phospholipids during macrophage exposure to both stimuli revealed significant decreases in the levels of all major choline phospholipid molecular species and a major phosphatidylinositol species. Importantly, while no changes in ethanolamine phospholipid species were detected on stimulation with zymosan, significant decreases in these species were observed when OpZ was used. Analyses of CoA-IT-mediated AA remodeling revealed that the process occurred faster in the zymosan-stimulated cells compared with OpZ-stimulated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CoA-IT strongly blunted AA release in response to zymosan but had only a moderate effect on the OpZ-mediated response. These results suggest a hitherto undescribed receptor-dependent role for CoA-independent AA remodeling reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response of macrophages. Our data help define novel targets within the AA remodeling pathway with potential use to control lipid mediator formation.","Gil-de-Gómez, Luis; Monge, Patricia; Rodríguez, Juan P; Astudillo, Alma M; Balboa, María A; Balsinde, Jesús",,330,32

In the present study, 16 neonatal piglets were randomly assigned to two groups. In the first group piglets were given an intramuscularly injection of iron dextran at 150 mg as a positive control (CON) and the second group were not supplemented with iron as a negative control for iron deficiency (ID). At day 8, iron status, serum biochemical parameters, serum metabolome, hepatic histology, and hepatic expression of genes for the metabolism were analyzed. Results indicated that piglets without iron supplementation had significantly reduced iron values and increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations at day 8 (p < 0.05). Analysis of serum metabolome revealed that concentrations of serum lysine, leucine, tyrosine, methionine, and cholesterol were significantly decreased while concentrations of 3-Methyldioxyindole, chenodeoxycholate acid, indoleacetic acid, icosadienoic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, pantothenic acid, ursocholic acid, and cholic acid were significantly increased in iron deficient piglets (p < 0.05). Furthermore, expressions of cyp7a1 and the urea cycle enzyme (ornithinetranscarbamoylase and argininosuccinate synthetase) were significantly increased in iron deficient pigs (p < 0.05). The present experimental results indicated that neonatal piglets without iron supplementation drop to borderline anemia within 8 days after birth. Iron deficiency led to a series of metabolic changes involved in tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and upregulated activities of the urea cycle enzymes in the liver of neonatal piglets, suggesting early effects on metabolic health of neonatal piglets.","Dong, Zhenglin; Wan, Dan; Yang, Huansheng; Li, Guanya; Zhang, Yiming; Zhou, Xihong; Wu, Xin; Yin, Yulong",,330,16

METHODS: Altmetric Attention scores were collected for all articles in five leading radiology journals over a 5-year period ending in June 2020, and temporal smoothing yielded the filtered Altmetric Attention (fAA) score. Natural language processing methods were used to label articles with major topic areas. A forecasting model was used to identify periods of outlier behavior in the fAA score aggregated across all journals, for each journal individually, and stratified by article topic area. The distributions of fAA scores prior to the onset of the pandemic were statistically compared to those during the pandemic. For journals exhibiting increased fAA scores, the frequency distributions of articles not related to Covid-19 was compared to that prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: During the pandemic, we found sustained outliers and statistically significant increases in the aggregate fAA score across all five journals, as well as for Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, and Academic Radiology individually. Articles related to Covid-19, thoracic imaging, and radiology education also experienced significantly increased fAA scores during the pandemic period. We did not find significantly decreased rates of publication of non-Covid articles in the journals experiencing elevated fAA scores. CONCLUSION: Social media engagement with the radiological literature significantly increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. This preferentially affected certain journals and articles addressing specific topics, reflecting the intense public interest in the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19.","Patel, Vishal; Li, Charles H; Acharya, Jay; Lerner, Alexander; Rajamohan, Anandh G",Acad. radiol,330,31

Several frameworks exist to conceptualise healthcare systems, highlighting the stark contrast of frameworks unique to public health systems. The objectives of this study were to define public health systems and assess differences between healthcare systems and public health systems within established health systems frameworks. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis was conducted. Databases searched included EBSCOhost, OVID, Scholars Portal, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Health Systems Evidence. Data extraction, coding and analysis followed a best-fit framework analysis method. Initial codes were based on a current leading health systems and policy classification scheme - health systems arrangements (governance, financial and delivery arrangements). RESULTS: A total of 5933 unique documents were identified and 67 were included in the analysis. Definitions of public health and public health systems varied significantly as did their roles and functions across jurisdictions. Public health systems arrangements generally followed those of health systems, with the addition of partnerships (community and inter-sectoral) and communication playing a larger role in public health. A public health systems framework and conceptualisation of how public health currently fits within health systems are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Public health systems are unique and vital entities within health systems. In addition to examining how public health and public health systems have been defined within the literature, this review suggests that establishing the scope of public health is crucial to understanding its role within the larger health system and adds to the discourse around the relationship between public health, healthcare and population health. More broadly, this study addresses an important gap in understanding public health systems and provides conceptual and practical contributions as well as areas for future research.","Jarvis, Tamika; Scott, Fran; El-Jardali, Fadi; Alvarez, Elizabeth",Health Res Policy Syst,330,20

This study examines whether there is a causal relationship (and, if so, in which direction) between people's well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Two hundred and twenty-two participants (54.50% female, M age = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of subjective well-being (SWB) and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that people's SWB and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak (T1), decline (T2), and trough stages (T3) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants' SWB at T0 (pre-pandemic stage; the base level of SWB) and T1 could significantly predict their COVID-19 anxiety at T1 and T2 respectively. However, SWB at T2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at T3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent SWB from T1 to T3. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety through the development of epidemics, as well as finding ways to alleviate people's COVID-19 anxiety.

En avril 2020, un suivi infectieux a été mis en place pour les patients positifs, complété par un suivi multidisciplinaire pour prise en charge des séquelles de l’infection et par le suivi spécifique des protocoles de recherche clinique nationaux et locaux. En janvier 2021, le CAMI a également accueilli l’activité de vaccination anti-COVID. Matériels et méthodes Le CAMI a été une structure nomade avec 3 déménagements avant d’emménager dans les locaux actuels, ce qui a amené à restructurer le service et les équipes plusieurs fois avec nécessité de formation continue à la fois sur l’épidémie et sur la recherche clinique en lien avec la structure médicale. Nous rapportons ici l’expérience d’un point de vue infirmier de ce centre en évolution constante depuis sa création. Résultats D’avril 2020 à janvier 2021, le CAMI a réalisé 3686 consultations avec : – 2016 consultations diagnostiques dont 312 patients positifs. Initialement ouvert à la population générale sur régulation du SAMU, le CAMI a ensuite été en charge du diagnostic des patients symptomatiques avec facteurs de risques spécifiques (femmes enceintes, immunodéprimés) ainsi que du personnel de l’établissement en lien avec la médecine du travail. Les patients bénéficiaient d’une consultation médicale, d’une radiographie du thorax, d’un prélèvement nasal et d’une sérologie SARS-CoV-2. Un complément d’examens pouvait être prescrit en fonction de la symptomatologie du patient (ECG, bilans sanguins). Une filière spécifique de prélèvements infirmiers a également été mise en place pour les patients paucisymptomatiques: – 1669 consultations de suivi avec orientation de plus de 500 patients vers des consultations spécialisées pour prise en charge de symptômes persistants (ORL, pneumologie, psychologue, neuropsychologue). Le patient bénéficiait d’une consultation médicale, d’une imagerie thoracique, d’un bilan sanguin complet à J9 (réévaluation à la période d’aggravation), à 1 mois, à 3 mois et à 6 mois. À partir du 4 janvier 2021, le début de la vaccination a demandé une réorganisation du service: arrêt du dépistage (sauf personnel soignant symptomatique), restructuration et aménagement des locaux, création du CEVAC (CEntre de Vaccination Anti COVID) avec une capacité d’environ 800 primo-injections/jour pour les personnels de santé libéraux et patients éligibles suivis sur l’établissement, mutualisation des équipes et nouvelles formations. Différentes études en lien avec la vaccination ont été menées au CAMI. Conclusion L’ouverture du CAMI et son évolution a nécessité une adaptabilité constante de l’équipe infirmière, sur le plan logistique (locaux, recrutement des équipes, gestion du matériel, turn-over médical) mais aussi sur le plan théorique avec nouvelles activités, participation à la recherche clinique et progression des connaissances.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating impacts that an emerging pathogen, of animal origin, can have on human societies and economies. A number of scholars have called for the wider adoption of ""One Health integrated approaches"" to better prevent, and respond to, the threats of emerging zoonotic diseases. However, there are theoretical and practical challenges that have precluded the full development and practical implementation of this approach. Whilst integrated approaches to health are increasingly adopting a social-ecological system framework (SES), the lack of clarity in framing the key concept of resilience in health contexts remains a major barrier to its implementation by scientists and practitioners. We propose an operational framework, based on a transdisciplinary definition of Socio-Ecological System Health (SESH) that explicitly links health and ecosystem management with the resilience of SES, and the adaptive capacity of the actors and agents within SES, to prevent and cope with emerging health and environmental risks. We focus on agricultural transitions that play a critical role in disease emergence and biodiversity conservation, to illustrate the proposed participatory framework to frame and co-design SESH interventions. Finally, we highlight critical changes that are needed from researchers, policy makers and donors, in order to engage communities and other stakeholders involved in the management of their own health and that of the underpinning ecosystems.","De Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel; Binot, Aurélie; Ward, John; Caron, Alexandre; Perrotton, Arthur; Ross, Helen; Tran Quoc, Hoa; Valls-Fox, Hugo; Gordon, Iain J; Promburom, Panomsak; Ancog, Rico; Anthony Kock, Richard; Morand, Serge; Chevalier, Véronique; Allen, Will; Phimpraphai, Waraphon; Duboz, Raphaël; Echaubard, Pierre",Front Public Health,330,16

However, even for identical layers, their stacking, in particular the relative angle between their crystallographic directions, modifies properties of the structure. We demonstrate that the interatomic coupling between two two-dimensional crystals can be determined from angle-resolved photoemission spectra of a trilayer structure with one aligned and one twisted interface. Each of the interfaces provides complementary information and together they enable self-consistent determination of the coupling. We parametrise interatomic coupling for carbon atoms by studying twisted trilayer graphene and show that the result can be applied to structures with different twists and number of layers.

However, such information regarding subjects having Parkinson's disease (PD) is unavailable. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire, developed and validated by experts. PD subjects from nine centers across India were included. Questionnaire assessed presence as well as change in sleep-related parameters and PD symptoms during home confinement. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and REM sleep behavior disorder (REMBD) was diagnosed using validated questionnaire. Additionally, changes in physical activity, adoption of new hobbies during home confinement and perceived quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: Of 832 subjects, 35.4% reported sleep disturbances. New-onset/worsening of sleep disturbances (NOWS) was reported by 23.9% subjects. Among those with sleep disturbances (n = 295), insomnia symptoms worsened in half (51.5%) and nearly one-fourth reported worsening of RLS (24.7%) and REMBD (22.7%) each. NOWS was common in subjects lacking adequate family support during home confinement (P = 0.03); home confinement > 60 days (P = 0.05) and duration of PD > 7 years (P = 0.008). Contrarily, physical activity >1 h/day and engagement in new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep. NOWS was associated with worsening of motor as well as non-motor symptoms of PD (P < 0.001) and poorer life quality (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Home confinement during COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with NOWS among PD subjects. NOWS was associated with global worsening of PD symptoms and poorer life quality. Physical activity >1 h/day and adoption of new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep.","Kumar, Niraj; Gupta, Ravi; Kumar, Hrishikesh; Mehta, Sahil; Rajan, Roopa; Kumar, Deva; Kandadai, Rukmini Mridula; Desai, Soaham; Wadia, Pettarusp; Basu, Purba; Mondal, Banashree; Juneja, Sanchita; Rawat, Ankita; Meka, Sai Srilakshmi; Mishal, Bhushan; Prashanth, L K; Srivastava, Achal Kumar; Goyal, Vinay",Sleep Med,330,16

During the spread of this infectious disease in the world, health care workers are taking place as the main people in the screening and treatment of the disease. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between anxiety and depression levels with perceived stress and coping strategies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, 200 participants were included. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) were applied. Results: Mean scores for BDI and BAI were 9.2+/-8.9 and 8.2+/-9.2, respectively. BDI scores of 33 (16.5%) of 200 participants were &gt;=17. 62% of the participants had minimal depression, 21.5% of the participants had mild depression, 13.5 % of the participants had moderate depression, and 3% of the participants had severe depression according to BDI scores. 60.5% of the participants had minimal anxiety, 25.5% of the participants had mild anxiety, 8.5% of the participants had moderate anxiety and 5.5% of the participants had severe anxiety according to BAI scores. BAI and BDI scores of the female participants were statistically higher than the male participants. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BAI and BDI scores and PSS-10 scores. A statistically significant difference was found in the averages of BAI and BDI, PSS-10 COPE 3 (Focus on and venting of emotions), 7 (Religious coping) and 13 (Acceptance) subscales levels in occupational groups. A statistically significant difference was found in BDI levels in the clinical units during the pandemic. Conclusion: This study indicated that different coping strategies can be used in health care workers regarding anxiety, depression and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While problem-solving and emotion-focused adaptive coping mechanisms help reduce symptoms, maladaptive and negative coping mechanisms can cause symptoms to exacerbate. Thus, training should be given to developing attitudes of health care workers to cope with stress.","Besirli, A.; Erden, S. C.; Atilgan, M.; Varlihan, A.; Habaci, M. F.; Yeniceri, T.; Isler, A.

However, alternative work arrangements (AWAs) such as telecommuting have long been offered by accounting firms to mitigate work-family conflict and other concerns inherent to the public accounting profession. Prior research has examined attitudes and perceptions about AWAs, but relatively little is known from the AWA adopters themselves and those who work directly with them. Given the heavy reliance on teamwork, multiple supervisors, and multiple clients in public accounting, it is not clear how telecommuting impacts critical relationship dynamics. Accounting students, though experienced with remote learning, can learn from pre-COVID telecommuters’ insights and experiences. In this paper, we interview telecommuters in public accounting as well as a non-telecommuting teammate (subordinate or superior) to develop rich insights about telecommuting’s impact from multiple perspectives. Our findings present best practices and challenges regarding telecommuting implementation within a team setting. Our results are useful to accounting educators as they advise and mentor today’s students, who are likely to enter a workforce with increasing prevalence of telecommuting post-COVID.","Bagley, Penelope L.; Dalton, Derek W.; Eller, C.

In this study, we present the effect of surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency in sanitizing fluids. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), and two commercial dish soap and liquid hand soap were studied with the goal of evaporation rate reduction in sanitizing liquids to maximize surface contact time. Twelve fluids with different recipes composed of ethanol, isopropanol, SDBS, SLS, glycerin, and water of standardized hardness (WSH) were tested for their evaporation time and virucidal efficiency. Evaporation time increased by 17-63% when surfactant agents were added to the liquid. In addition, surfactant incorporation enhanced the virucidal efficiency between 15 and 27% according to the 4-field test in the EN 16615:2015 European Standard method. Most importantly, however, we found that surfactant addition provides a synergistic effect with alcohols to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Puzzling low incidence numbers and milder, non-fatal disease have been observed in Thailand and its Southeast (SE) Asian neighbors. Elusive genetic mechanisms might be operative, as a multitude of genetic factors are widely shared between the SE Asian populations, such as the more than 60 different thalassemia syndromes (principally dominated by the HbE trait). In this study, we have plotted COVID-19 infection and death rates in SE Asian (SEA) countries against heterozygote HbE and thalassemia carrier prevalence. COVID-19 infection and death incidence numbers appear inversely correlated with the prevalence of HbE and thalassemia heterozygote populations. We posit that the evolutionary protective effect of the HbE and other thalassemic variants against malaria and the dengue virus may extend its advantage to resistance to COVID-19 infection, as HbE heterozygote population prevalence appears to be positively correlated with immunity to COVID-19. Host immune system modulations induce antiviral interferon responses and alter structural protein integrity, thereby inhibiting cellular access and viral replication. These changes are possibly engendered by HbE carrier miRNAs. Proving this hypothesis is important, as it may shed light on the mechanism of viral resistance and lead to novel antiviral treatments. This development can thus guide decision-making and action to prevent COVID-19 infection.","Papadopoulos, Konstantinos I; Sutheesophon, Warachaya; Manipalviratn, Somjate; Aw, Tar-Choon",Med Sci Monit Basic Res,330,1

While it primarily affects the respiratory system, we now have evidence that it affects multiple organ systems in the human body. Cardiac manifestations may include myocarditis, life threatening arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, systolic heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Myocarditis is increasingly recognized as a complication of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) and may result from direct viral injury or from exaggerated host immune response. The diagnosis is established similar to other etiologies, and is based on detailed history, clinical exam, laboratory findings and non-invasive imaging studies. When available, cardiac MRI is the preferred imaging modality. Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Current management is mainly supportive with the potential addition of interventions recommended for severe COVID-19 disease, such as remdesivir, steroids, and convalescent plasma. In the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory, life-threatening arrhythmias that persist despite medical therapy, advanced mechanical circulatory support devices should be considered.

This piece aims to determine the use of accompaniment in healthcare interactions by persons with sensory impairment. METHODS: These cross-sectional analyses included data from the 2015 Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey and survey weighting provided by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Adjusted odds of reporting accompaniment to healthcare visits and given reasons for accompaniment among United States Medicare beneficiaries with self-reported sensory impairment (hearing, vision, and dual sensory impairment) were examined. RESULTS: After excluding observations with missing data, 10,748 Medicare beneficiaries remained representing a 46 million total weighted nationally representative sample, of which 88.9% reported no sensory impairment, 5.52% reported hearing impairment, 3.56% reported vision impairment, and 0.93% reported dual sensory impairment. Those with vision impairment and dual sensory impairment had 2.139 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.605-2.850) and 2.703 (CI = 1.549-4.718) times the odds of reporting accompaniment to healthcare visits relative to those without sensory impairment. A secondary analysis suggests communication needs as the primary reason for accompaniment among persons with hearing loss, while those with vision impairment were more likely to indicate transportation needs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare accompaniment is common for persons with sensory loss and healthcare systems should consider accommodations for and leveraging accompaniment to improve healthcare for persons with sensory impairments. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as hospitals limit visitors to reduce the spread of infection, arrangements should be made to ensure that the communication and transportation needs of those with sensory impairment are not neglected.","Reed, Nicholas S; Assi, Lama; Pedersen, Emily; Alshabasy, Yasmeen; Deemer, Ashley; Deal, Jennifer A; Willink, Amber; Swenor, Bonnielin K",BMC Health Serv Res,330,1

Identifying and supporting those most affected by the pandemic is required. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on individuals with tinnitus and to identify mediating factors. Methods: This is a mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online survey from 3,103 individuals with tinnitus from 48 countries. The greatest representation was from North America (49%) and Europe (47%) and other countries were only marginally represented. Results: Although the study was aimed at those with pre-existing tinnitus, 7 individuals reported having COVID-19 initiated tinnitus. Having COVID-19 symptoms exacerbated tinnitus in 40% of respondents, made no change in 54%, and improved tinnitus in 6%. Other mediating factors such as the social and emotional consequences of the pandemic made pre-existing tinnitus more bothersome for 32% of the respondents, particularly for females and younger adults, better for 1%, and caused no change to tinnitus for 67%. Pre-existing tinnitus was significantly exacerbated for those self-isolating, experiencing loneliness, sleeping poorly, and with reduced levels of exercise. Increased depression, anxiety, irritability, and financial worries further significantly contributed to tinnitus being more bothersome during the pandemic period. Conclusions: These findings have implications for tinnitus management, because they highlight the diverse response both internal and external factors have on tinnitus levels. Clinical services should be mindful that tinnitus may be caused by contracting COVID-19 and pre-existing tinnitus may be exacerbated, although in the majority of respondents there was no change. Additional support should be offered where tinnitus severity has increased due to the health, social, and/or emotional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tinnitus may be more bothersome for those experiencing loneliness, having fewer social interactions, and who are more anxious or worried.","Beukes, Eldré W; Baguley, David M; Jacquemin, Laure; Lourenco, Matheus P C G; Allen, Peter M; Onozuka, Joy; Stockdale, David; Kaldo, Viktor; Andersson, Gerhard; Manchaiah, Vinaya",Front Public Health,330,1

This novel coronavirus affects almost the whole world and it can quickly spread among the population in several ways. This has initially come from China and within a few months, covers the overall world. Therefore, many countries have decided to restrict the movement through lockdown to control the spreading of COVID-19 novel virus among the population. During this lockdown condition, almost all except few essential people stay at home means staying inside of houses 24 × 7 hours. The study aims to calculate the impact of this lockdown condition on the annual natural gamma radiation dose. The values of indoor gamma radiation are not the same as the outdoor gamma dose rate; the ration between indoor and outdoor gamma dose rates varies based on country to country. In this study, we have used indoor-outdoor gamma dose rate ratio which was reported by UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientiﬁc Commission on Eﬀects of Atomic Radiation) and calculated the variation of annual dose rate during this pandemic condition that will be helpful for estimation of gamma expose scale for this year of various countries. The higher ratio of indoor and outdoor gamma dose rates showed a high variation in annual dose rate. It was found that the change in annual dose rate continuously increases with respect to the number of days of lockdown. This will also affect much more at high background radiation areas as compared to the low background area.","Jindal, Manoj Kumar; Sar, Santosh Kumar",Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem.,330,13

A peptide such as 15-IgBP can be selectively crosslinked to the fragment crystallizable region of human IgG in an affinity-dependent manner via the Îµ-amino group of Lys8. Previously, we found that the peptide 15-Lys8Leu has a high affinity (Kd = 8.19 nM) due to the presence of the Î³-dimethyl group in Leu8. The primary amino group required for the crosslinking to the antibodies has however been lost. We report the design and synthesis of a novel unnatural amino acid, 4-(2-aminoethylcarbamoyl)leucine (Aecl), which possesses both the Î³-dimethyl fragment and a primary amino group. A peptide containing Aecl8 (15-Lys8Aecl) was synthesized and showed a binding affinity 10-fold higher (Kd = 24.3 nM) than that of 15-IgBP (Kd = 267 nM). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled 15-Lys8Aecl with an N-hydroxy succinimide ester at the side chain of Aecl8 (FITC-15-Lys8Aecl(OSu)) successfully labeled an antibody (Trastuzumab, Herceptin®) with the fluorophore.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS: We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48 hours and considered very preferential. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic care in prostate cancer offers an opportunity to develop new performance and follow-up protocols, which should be thoroughly analyzed in future studies, in order to create a safe environment and guarantee oncologic outcomes for patients.","García Rodríguez, J; de León, C González Ruiz; Sacristán González, R; Méndez Ramírez, S; Modrego Ulecia, L; Fernández-Gómez, J M",,330,7

We modeled the situation when cells can produce different costly secretions which increase the carrying capacity of the population. Strains that lose the function of producing one or more secretions avoid the cost of production and can exhaust the producers. However, secreting substances provides a private benefit for the producers in a density-dependent way. We developed a model to examine the outcome of the selection among different type of producer strains from the non-producer strain to the partial producers, to the full producer one. We were interested in circumstances under which selection maintains partners that produce complementary secreted materials thus forming an interdependent mutualistic interaction. We show that interdependent mutualism is selected under broad range of conditions if private benefit decreases with density. Selection frequently causes the coexistence of more and less generalist cooperative strains, thus cooperation and exploitation co-occur. Interdependent mutualism is evolved under more specific circumstances if private benefit increases with density and these general observations are valid in a well-mixed and in a structured deme model. We show that the applied population structure allows the invasion of rare cooperators and supports cooperation in general. This article is protected by copyright.

In this article, respirators are placeholders for similar life-saving modalities in short supply, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines and intensive care unit beds. In the article, I propose a system of triage for circumstances of scarcity of respirators. The system separates the hopeless from the curable, granting every treatable person a real chance of cure. The scarcity situation eliminates excesses of medicine, and then allocates respirators by a single scale, combining an evidence-based scoring system with risk-proportionate lottery. The triage proposed embodies continuity and consistency with the healthcare practices in ordinary times. Yet, I suggest two regulatory modifications: one in relation to expediting review of novel and makeshift solutions and the second in relation to mandatory research on all relevant medical data and standard (as opposed to experimental) interventions that are influenced by the triage.","Barilan, Y.

The planar laser is coplanar to the two-dimensional (2D) reference. The combination of a circle on the 2D reference, a point on the 2D reference and a random point on the laser stripe is considered as the invariant, which is impervious to the projection from the laser plane to the image. Therefore, the reconstruction model is achieved by the invariant, which is generated from the projections of the above geometric features. The experiments are performed to verify the performance and reconstruction error of the method. The minimum error is 0.473 mm for the camera-reference distance of 600 mm, the scaleplate-projector distance of 100 mm and the reference length of 30 mm.

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.IMPORTANCE Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zulauf, Katelyn E; Green, Alex B; Nguyen Ba, Alex N; Jagdish, Tanush; Reif, Dvir; Seeley, Robert; Dale, Alana; Kirby, James E",mBio (Online),330,16

A great variety of drugs has been used to treat viral diseases, which are not always safe and effective and may induce adverse effects, indicating the need for new antiviral drugs extracted from natural sources. Propolis is a bee-made product exhibiting many biological properties.

PubMed platform was used for data collection, searching for the keywords ""propolis"", ""virus"", ""antiviral"", ""antimicrobial"" and ""coronavirus"". KEY FINDINGS: Propolis is safe and exerts antiviral and immunomodulatory activity; however, clinical trials should investigate its effects on individuals with viral diseases, in combination or not with antiviral drugs or vaccines. SUMMARY: Regarding COVID-19, the effects of propolis should be investigated directly on the virus in vitro or on infected individuals alone or in combination with antiviral drugs, due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action. Propolis administration simultaneously with vaccines should be analyzed, due to its adjuvant properties, to enhance the individuals' immune response. The search for therapeutic targets may be useful to find out how propolis can help to control COVID-19.","Ripari, Nicolas; Sartori, Arthur Alves; da Silva Honorio, Mariana; Conte, Fernanda Lopes; Tasca, Karen Ingrid; Santiago, Karina Basso; Sforcin, José Maurício",J Pharm Pharmacol,330,18

In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. To predict the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town, we apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model (ROM), which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.","Silva, Vinicius L.

However, the closures of childcare, early education programs, and centers for family activities in the Spring of 2020 due to COVID-19 brought many sudden changes to the everyday lives of families with young children. In order to explore the impact of COVID-19 on shared reading, we surveyed parents of children between the ages of 2 and 5 (n = 85) about their children’s frequency of shared reading engagement in February and October, 2020 as well as the frequency of screen-mediated reading, the number of readers their children read with, and book preferences at both time points. Parents were also asked about changes in their children’s regular care and whether and how they had tried new kinds of (virtual) literacy activities during their increased time at home. Findings showed that there were no significant changes in frequency of shared reading from February to October, but there was a significant increase in frequency of screen-mediated reading, especially among families who lost outside-the-home childcare. There was also a significant decrease in the number of adults regularly reading with the children. Caregivers described adapting to virtual options for storytime. Ultimately, while families were still able to provide consistent amounts of shared reading with their children throughout COVID-19, the nature of that shared reading was changed. Future research will investigate whether these changes may have an impact on children’s typical learning from shared reading.","Read, Kirsten Gaffney Grace Chen Ashley Imran Amina",Early childhood education journal,330,16

Using peptide prints, we identified a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) of Sgo1 that mediates the interaction with condensin and is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. We show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the phosphomimic and phosphoresistant mutants revealed that SRM phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin-condensin interaction. We present evidence that Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast.","Yahya, Galal; Wu, Yehui; Peplowska, Karolina; Röhrl, Jennifer; Soh, Young-Min; Bürmann, Frank; Gruber, Stephan; Storchova, Zuzana",PLoS Genet,330,23

Although vaccination advances at good pace, effectiveness against emerging variants is unpredictable. The virus has displayed a remarkable resistance to treatments and no drugs have been proved fully effective against Covid-19. Thus, despite the international efforts, there is still an urgent need for new potent and safe antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Here we exploited the enormous potential of plant metabolism using the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and identified a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, following a bioactivity-guided fractionation and mass-spectrometry approach. We found that the chlorophyll derivative Pheophorbide a (PheoA), a porphyrin compound similar to animal Protoporphyrin IX, has an extraordinary antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 preventing infection of cultured monkey and human cells, without noticeable cytotoxicity. We also show that PheoA prevents coronavirus entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particle. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against (+) strand RNA viral pathogens such as HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses, but not against (-) strand RNA viruses, such as VSV. Our results indicate that PheoA displays a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Jimenez-Aleman, Guillermo H; Castro, Victoria; Longdaitsbehere, Addis; Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Marta; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Gastaminza, Pablo; Solano, Roberto",,330,16

During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time.

Objectives: In this study we compared the efficacy of a model-based WM training with (MB+) and without (MB) distractor inhibition on improving WM capacity to a dual-n-back and active control condition. Methods: This randomized clinical trial included 123 healthy elderly adults (78 women, 45 men;aged 64.1±8.3 years). All groups underwent twelve 40-min training sessions over three weeks and four cognitive testing sessions. The first two sessions served as double-baseline to account for practice effects. Primary outcome was WM capacity post-training measured by complex span tasks. Near and far transfer was assessed by simple span, n-back, visuospatial and verbal learning, processing speed and reasoning tasks. Results: Due to preliminary termination (COVID-19) 93 subjects completed the post-training and 60 the follow-up session. On whole group level, practice-effects occurred from pre-baseline to baseline in WM capacity (b = 4.85, t(103) = 4.01, p &lt; .001, r = 0.37). Linear mixed effects models revealed a difference in WM capacity post-training between MB+ and MB (b = -9.62, t(82) = -2.52), p = .014, r = 0.27) and a trend difference between MB+ and dual-n-back (b = -7.59, t(82) = -1.87), p = .065, r = 0.20) and control training (b = -7.08, t(82) = -1.86), p = .067, r = 0.20). Univariate analyses showed an increase between pre- and post-training for WM capacity within MB+ (t(22) = -3.34, p &lt; 0.05) only. There was no difference between groups pre- and post-training regarding near and far transfer. Univariate analyses showed improved visuospatial learning within MB+ (t(21) = -3.8, p &lt; .05), improved processing speed (t(23) = 2.19, p &lt; .05) and n-back performance (t(23) = 2.12, p &lt; .05) in MB and improved n-back performance (t(25) = 3.83, p &lt; .001) in the dual-n-back training.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, clinical outcome, and impact of COVID-19 on pwMS. METHODS: This observational study was prospectively performed on a cohort of pwMS (N = 11,560) followed up by 47 out of 51 Brazilian MS referral centers that registered pwMS with COVID-19 at the REDONE platform from 13 March to 4 June 2020. RESULTS: The incidence of COVID-19 for pwMS patients was 27.7/10,000 patients and for the general population was 29.2/10,000 inhabitants. A total of 94 (77 women) pwMS patients, aged 40 ± 10.25 years, presenting 9.9 ± 8.6 years of MS disease duration, developed the COVID-19, most of them (87%) exhibited the mild form of the disease. Eighty (96%) patients maintained the use of MS disease-modifying treatment (DMT) during COVID-19 pandemic and 14 patients were not in use of DMTs. CONCLUSION: Incidence of COVID-19 in Brazilian pwMS was not different from those observed for the general Brazilian population. Most pwMS exhibited mild COVID-19, despite the maintenance of the underlying MS treatment.","Anonymous,",Mult Scler,330,16

It originated in Wuhan, China and caused a total of 83,483 confirmed cases and 4634 deaths until June 2020. This novel virus spread primarily through respiratory droplets and close contact. The person-to-person transmission by direct transmittance through cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, and contact spreading from dry surfaces contaminated with secretions of nose, mouth, and eyes of an infected person has been proven about SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As disease progressed, a series of complications tends to develop, especially in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. Pathological studies showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and implications on multiple organs as well. However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are immediately available for the treatment of this lethal disease. The efficacy of some promising antivirals needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials. In current circumstances, supportive care, precautions, and social distancing are the only preventive options to ameliorate COVID-19. To disinfect the environment, mainly chemical disinfectants are being used robustly. However, due to panic state, fright, and unawareness, people are using it violently, which can have an adverse effect on human health and environment. This review discusses about the potential harmful effect of disinfectants, if used inappropriately. Here, we will also discuss safe preventive options as an alternative to robust use of disinfection methods to fight against COVID-19.","Rai, Nagendra Kumar; Ashok, Anushruti; Akondi, Butchi Raju",Crit Rev Toxicol,330,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between food insufficiency and mental health service utilisation. SETTING: US Census Household Pulse Survey data collected in October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 68 611 US adults. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, experiencing food insufficiency was associated with higher odds of unmet mental health need (adjusted OR (AOR) 2·90; 95 % CI 2·46, 3·43), receiving mental health counselling or therapy (AOR 1·51; 95 % CI 1·24, 1·83) and psychotropic medication use (AOR 1·56; 95 % CI 1·35, 1·80). Anxiety and depression symptoms mediated most of the association between food insufficiency and unmet mental health need but not the associations between food insufficiency and either receiving mental health counselling/therapy or psychotropic medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding access to supplemental food programmes may help to mitigate the need for higher mental health service utilisation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nagata, Jason M; Ganson, Kyle T; Cattle, Chloe J; Whittle, Henry J; Tsai, Alexander C; Weiser, Sheri D",Public Health Nutr,330,27

Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. Objective: To examine the factors associated with survey participants' self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. Results: A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10â¯000 to 1 in 1â¯000â¯000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: -0.13 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.11]; UK: -0.04 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","Kreps, Sarah; Prasad, Sandip; Brownstein, John S; Hswen, Yulin; Garibaldi, Brian T; Zhang, Baobao; Kriner, Douglas L",JAMA Netw Open,330,5

The aim of this study is to investigate real adherence to these measures among MS patients and to evaluate its impact on exposure to infection. Methods MS patients followed at the MS center of Tor Vergata University hospital, Rome, Italy were asked to complete an anonymous 35-items web-survey exploring demographics, residency, employment, social distancing habits, use of PPE, MS features and COVID19 infection data, including self-reported information about contacts with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive persons. In order to estimate adherence to social distancing and use of PPE, an overall 'Lockdown Score' (LS) on 0-10 scale was created analyzing four main domains (Working (0 - 4), Social distancing and PPE use (0 - 4), Assistance for shopping needs (0 - 2), Residency (-2 - 0)). Mean scores for several pre-defined subgroups of patients were compared using both univariable and multivariable analyses. Accuracy of the score in discriminating subjects at higher risk of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive individuals was calculated as the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-off was identified and used to dichotomize LS (high/ low). Logistic regression model was applied to estimate individuals' characteristics associated with high/low LS and odds ratio of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive persons based on continous and dichotomised LS. Results Respondents (N = 551) had a mean(±SD) overall LS of 6.52±2.11 (Working 3.16±1.19, Social distancing and PPE use 2.69±1.33, Assistance 0.66± 0.62, Residency penalty applied in 4 cases). Female, disabled and unemployed individuals had significantly higher mean LS (p<0.05). The AUC of the LS was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.77) and the optimal LS cut-off for discrimination was 6.0. Consistently, female, disabled and unemployed individuals had higher odd of getting a high LS (&#8805; 6) compared to male, independent and employed (p<0.05). Odd of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive individuals was significantly reduced for one-unit increase in LS (0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85)) and among individuals with high LS (0.37 (95% CI: 0.19-0.72)). Only one subject among respondents declared to have been diagnosed with COVID19. Conclusions MS patients, especially those with social unfavorable conditions, demonstrated good adherence to social distancing and use of protection equipment. Implementing domains, such as social assistance, may improve protection from infection. LS score is potentially able to identify subjects with behaviors at greater risk of infection, although it needs to be validated against MS population living in higher incidence areas.","Landi, Doriana; Ponzano, Marta; Nicoletti, Carolina Gabri; Cecchi, Gianluca; Cola, Gaia; Mataluni, Giorgia; Mercuri, Nicola Biagio; Sormani, Maria Pia; Marfia, Girolama Alessandra",Mult Scler Relat Disord,330,29

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status. We also describe a simple method to measure intracellular cytokine production to evaluate the inflammatory activity of neutrophils and IMMs in a mouse model of human coronavirus infection.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Perlman, Stanley",Methods Mol Biol,330,22

This article sets forth experience-based recommendations for how audiological centers can continue to safely and effectively function during COVID-19. METHODS: The recommendations are the result of panel discussion and are based on the clinical experience of the panelists/authors. RESULTS: The recommendations cover which patient groups and which interventions should be treated when and whether this can be performed in the clinic or remotely; how to maintain the safety of workplace via optimizing patient flow within the clinic and the sanitation of rooms and equipment; and overcoming communication challenges that COVID-19 intensifies. CONCLUSION: For essential audiological services to continue under COVID-19, safety measures must be implemented and maintained, and treatment and communication strategies must be adapted to offset communication difficulties due to personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing and to bolster patient confidence. In short, it is vital that staff feel safe, that patients either feel the clinic is safe enough to visit or that remote treatment may be an option, and that clinics and patients have a broad agreement on the urgency of any needed service.

An observational study is ongoing at San Donato Hospital with the aim to evaluate the contribution of MDW in the diagnostic pathway in adult patients entering in the ED setting and tested for SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHOD: COVID-19 symptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients presenting to ED (Emergency Department), have been enrolled consecutively. Whole blood venous samples have been collected on K2 EDTA for MDW determination, at the same time a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection have been collected. RESULTS: One hundred six patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 with MDW mean value of 20.3 ± 3.3, while forty-one were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with higher MDW mean value of 27.3 ± 4.9 (P < 0.005).

Finally twenty-three patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed an MDW value higher than the eighteen patients presenting few symptoms [28.8 ± 5.3 vs 25.4 ± 3.6 respectively, P < 0.05]. DISCUSSION: Monocytic population, in Covid19 disease, are the first elements of innate immunity to be involved, these changes are the basis of the modification of the MDW, with evident efficacy in term of sensitivity, particularly in the studied Covid19 patients. Moreover the patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed significantly elevated MDW respects to middle or low symptomatic one, suggest including this parameter as prognostic marker or of therapy efficacy, integrated with other laboratory findings.","Ognibene, Agostino; Lorubbio, Maria; Magliocca, Pasqualino; Tripodo, Emanuela; Vaggelli, Guendalina; Iannelli, Giovanni; Feri, Marco; Scala, Raffaele; Tartaglia, Alessandro Polcini; Galano, Angelo; Pancrazzi, Alessandro; Tacconi, Danilo",Clin Chim Acta,330,22

The virus underlying the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 98 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million deaths since January 2020. Although the most recent respiratory viral pandemic swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a cultural shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 125,000 COVID-19-related scientific articles within 10 months of the first confirmed case, of which more than 30,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, 2 growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, as well as characteristics of their propagation on online platforms.

We conducted a single-center study to describe respiratory mechanics and response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in COVID-19 ARDS and to compare COVID-19 patients to matched-control subjects with ARDS from other causes. METHODS: Thirty consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Rome, Italy, and fulfilling moderate-to-severe ARDS criteria were enrolled within 24 h from endotracheal intubation. Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and ventilatory ratio were measured at PEEP of 15 and 5 cmH2O. A single-breath derecruitment maneuver was performed to assess recruitability. After 1:1 matching based on PaO2/FiO2, FiO2, PEEP, and tidal volume, COVID-19 patients were compared to subjects affected by ARDS of other etiologies who underwent the same procedures in a previous study. RESULTS: Thirty COVID-19 patients were successfully matched with 30 ARDS from other etiologies. At low PEEP, median [25th-75th percentiles] PaO2/FiO2 in the two groups was 119 mmHg [101-142] and 116 mmHg [87-154]. Average compliance (41 ml/cmH2O [32-52] vs. 36 ml/cmH2O [27-42], p = 0.045) and ventilatory ratio (2.1 [1.7-2.3] vs. 1.6 [1.4-2.1], p = 0.032) were slightly higher in COVID-19 patients. Inter-individual variability (ratio of standard deviation to mean) of compliance was 36% in COVID-19 patients and 31% in other ARDS. In COVID-19 patients, PaO2/FiO2 was linearly correlated with respiratory system compliance (r = 0.52 p = 0.003). High PEEP improved PaO2/FiO2 in both cohorts, but more remarkably in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.005). Recruitability was not different between cohorts (p = 0.39) and was highly inter-individually variable (72% in COVID-19 patients and 64% in ARDS from other causes). In COVID-19 patients, recruitability was independent from oxygenation and respiratory mechanics changes due to PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Early after establishment of mechanical ventilation, COVID-19 patients follow ARDS physiology, with compliance reduction related to the degree of hypoxemia, and inter-individually variable respiratory mechanics and recruitability. Physiological differences between ARDS from COVID-19 and other causes appear small.","Grieco, Domenico Luca; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Chen, Lu; Menga, Luca S; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; Carelli, Simone; Michi, Teresa; Torrini, Flava; Lombardi, Gianmarco; Anzellotti, Gian Marco; De Pascale, Gennaro; Urbani, Andrea; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Tanzarella, Eloisa S; Bello, Giuseppe; Dell039,; Anna, Antonio M; Maggiore, Salvatore M; Brochard, Laurent; Antonelli, Massimo",Crit Care,330,23

Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone 10-13. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and also show strong binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs compared to the original virus. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination 14-18. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.","He, Wan-ting; Musharrafieh, Rami; Song, Ge; Dueker, Katharina; Callaghan, Sean; Yong, Peter; Beutler, Nathan; Torres, Jonathan L.; Volk, Reid M.; Zhou, Panpan; Yuan, Meng; Liu, Hejun; Anzanello, Fabio; Parren, Mara; Garcia, Elijah; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Smith, Davey M.; Wilson, Ian A.; Ward, Andrew B.; Rogers, Thomas; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees",,330,5

However, the strength of environmental exposures is difficult to measure, making it challenging to understand their impacts. On the other hand, some COVID-19 patients develop ARDS in an unfavorable disease progression and smoking has been suggested as a potential risk factor among others. Yet initial studies on COVID-19 cases reported contradictory results on the effects of smoking on the disease - some suggest that smoking might have a protective effect against it while other studies report an increased risk. A better understanding of how the exposure to smoking and other environmental factors affect biological processes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and unfavorable disease progression is needed. ApproachIn this study, we utilize mutational signatures associated with environmental factors as sensors of their exposure level. Many environmental factors including smoking are mutagenic and leave characteristic patterns of mutations, called mutational signatures, in affected genomes. We postulated that analyzing mutational signatures, combined with gene expression, can shed light on the impact of the mutagenic environmental factors to the biological processes. In particular, we utilized mutational signatures from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data set collected in TCGA to investigate the role of environmental factors in COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Integrating mutational signatures with gene expression in normal tissues and using a pathway level analysis, we examined how the exposure to smoking and other mutagenic environmental factors affects the infectivity of the virus and disease progression. ResultsBy delineating changes associated with smoking in pathway-level gene expression and cell type proportions, our study demonstrates that mutational signatures can be utilized to study the impact of exogenous mutagenic factors on them. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis showed that smoking mutational signature (SBS4) is associated with activation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. Smoking related changes in cell composition were also observed, including the correlation of SBS4 with the expansion of goblet cells. On the other hand, increased basal cells and decreased ciliated cells in proportion were associated with the strength of a different mutational signature (SBS5), which is present abundantly but not exclusively in smokers. In addition, we found that smoking increases the expression levels of genes that are up-regulated in severe COVID-19 cases. Jointly, these results suggest an unfavorable impact of smoking on the disease progression and also provide novel findings on how smoking impacts biological processes in lung.","Kim, Yoo-Ah; Hodzic, Ermin; Saslafsky, Ariella; Wojtowicz, Damian; Amgalan, Bayarbaatar; Przytycka, Teresa Maria",,330,16

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively.

The most common symptoms of COVID­19 are: fever (81.8%-100%), cough (46.3%-86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%-50%), expectoration (4.4%-72%), and dyspnea (18.6%-59%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in COVID­19 include decreased lymphocyte count (35%-82.1%), thrombocytopenia (17%-36.2%), elevated serum C­reactive protein (60.7%-93%), lactate dehydrogenase (41%-76%), and D­dimer concentrations (36%-46.4%). Among comorbidities in patients with COVID­19, cardiovascular disease is most commonly found. In addition, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases have worse prognosis and more often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients without such comorbidities. It is estimated that about 20% of patients with COVID­19 develop cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients with COVID­19 who require ICU care. In a group of critically ill patients, 27.5% had an elevated N­terminal pro-B­type natriuretic peptide concentration, and increased cardiac troponin level was found in 10% of patients. One of the life­threatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement. Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases. So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID­19 are limited. Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists. Thus, it is important to know typical COVID­19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.","Slawinski, Grzegorz; Lewicka, Ewa",Kardiol Pol,330,16

OBJECTIVES: We examined COVID-19-related concerns for health, finances, and organizational support among workers with no disability, a physical, mental health, or both physical and mental health disability, and factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. METHODS: An online, cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of Canadians in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions asked about COVID-19 perceptions, demographics (gender, age, education), work context (e.g., sector, contract work) and employment conditions (e.g., job stress, control, accommodation needs). Descriptive, multivariable, and nested regression analyses examined factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. RESULTS: A total of 3066 participants completed the survey. Workers with both a physical and mental health disability reported significantly greater health and financial concerns and less organizational support than those with no disability. Workers with a physical disability reported more health concerns and those with a mental health disability reported more financial concerns and less organizational support. Respondents with disabilities also reported significant differences in employment conditions (e.g., more contract work, stress, unmet accommodation needs) than those with no disability. Employment conditions were consistently significant predictors of COVID-19 perceptions and attenuated the significance of disability type in analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on one's health, finances, and organizational support reflected existing disability inequities in employment conditions and highlight the importance of creating more inclusive employment opportunities for people living with physical and mental health disabilities.","Gignac, Monique A M; Shahidi, Faraz V; Jetha, Arif; Kristman, Vicki; Bowring, Julie; Cameron, Jill I; Tonima, Sabrina; Ibrahim, Selahadin",Disabil Health J,330,16

Community workers, the main executors in community governance, experience a huge amount of stress, which affects their physical and mental health. Thus, it is crucial to pay more attention to the stressors and stress responses of community workers and propose strategies to alleviate such responses. This paper aims to analyze the work stress of community workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Design/methodology/approach Based on a questionnaire survey of 602 community workers during COVID-19 in China, the four main stressors and 14 stress factors of community workers were identified and six factors at three levels of stress responses were defined. A stress analysis model is proposed that tests the mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating role of organizational climate. Findings The results show that stressors influence stress responses through the moderating role of psychological capital, organizational climate plays a negative mediator role between stressors and psychological capital and the main stressors for community workers are work, safety and performance stress. Originality/value This paper contributes to existing research because it offers suggestions for reducing the impact of stress on the community workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it can promote the control and prevention of the COVID-19.","Gui, P.; Ji, X. T.; Mei, Y. L.; Quan, Z. C.",Kybernetes,330,29

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of ACEI/ARB and household transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a modified cohort study of household contacts of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 4 and May 17, 2020 in a large Northeast US health system. Household members were identified by geocoding and full address matching with exclusion of addresses with >10 matched residents or known congregate living functions. Medication use, clinical conditions and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) data on cohort entry. Cohort members were followed for at least one month after exposure to determine who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mixed effects logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to assess adjusted associations between medication use and testing positive. RESULTS: 1,499 of the 9,101 household contacts were taking an ACEI or an ARB. Probability of COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period was slightly higher among ACEI/ARB users in unadjusted analyses. However, ACEI/ARB users were older and more likely to have clinical comorbidities so that use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in mixed effect models (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.81) or propensity score analyses (predicted probability 18.6% in ACEI/ARB users vs. 24.5% in non-users, p = 0.03). These associations were similar within age and comorbidity subgroups, including patients with documented hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, as well as when including other medications in the models. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study of household transmission, use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. While causality cannot be inferred from these observational data, our results support current recommendations to continue ACEI/ARB in individuals at risk of COVID-19 exposure.","Armstrong, Katrina; Soltoff, Alex; Rieu-Werden, Meghan; Metlay, Joshua; Haas, Jennifer",PLoS One,330,1

AIMS: To describe the COVID-19 impact on medical oncology care provision in an Australian setting. METHODS: Calvary Mater Newcastle and Newcastle Private Hospital medical oncology data from 1 February to 31 April 2019 versus 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-four inpatient admissions occurred in 2020, 21% less than in 2019. Total inpatient days decreased by 22% (2842 vs 2203). April was most impacted (36% and 44% fewer admissions and inpatient days respectively). Mean length of stay remained unchanged (6.4 vs 6.2 days, P = 0.7). In all, 5072 outpatient consultations were conducted, including 417 new-patient consultations (4% and 6% increase on 2019 respectively). Telephone consultations (0 vs 1380) replaced one-quarter of face-to-face consultations (4859 vs 3623, -25%), with minimal telehealth use (6 vs 69).

There is growing recognition that digital technologies have the potential to improve the well-being of frontline workers. However, there has been limited development of wellness interventions using mobile health (mHealth) technology. More importantly, little research has been conducted on how frontline workers perceive mHealth-based support to promote their well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore frontline workers' experience of conventional psychological wellness programs and their perceptions of the usefulness of mHealth apps and features for promoting well-being. It also sought to identify factors that could potentially influence uptake and retention of an mHealth-based wellness program. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews using purposive sampling with frontline workers involved in the COVID-19 response. Various visual materials, collated from existing mHealth app features, were presented to facilitate discussion. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis based on grounded theory was undertaken. Themes were subsequently mapped to key nudge strategies-those commonly used for mHealth development-to assess participants' preferences for particular features and their reasoning. RESULTS: A total of 42 frontline workers participated in 12 one-on-one interviews or focus group discussions. Frontline workers generally had a limited ability to identify their own psychological problems and liked the reminders functionality of the app to track their mood over time. A personalized goal-setting feature (ie, tailoring) and in-app resources were generally valued, while frequent coaching and messages (ie, framing) were seen as a distraction. The majority of participants desired a built-in chat function with a counselor (ie, guidance) for reasons of accessibility and protection of privacy. Very few participants appreciated a gamification function. Frontline workers commonly reported the need for ongoing social support and desired access to an in-app peer support community (ie, social influence). There were, however, concerns regarding potential risks from virtual peer interactions. Intrinsic motivational factors, mHealth app technicality, and tangible rewards were identified as critical for uptake and retention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of mHealth apps with relevant features to be used as wellness tools by frontline health care workers. Future work should focus on developing a nonintrusive and personalized mHealth app with in-app counseling, peer support to improve well-being, and tangible and extrinsic rewards to foster continued use.","Yoon, Sungwon; Goh, Hendra; Nadarajan, Gayathri Devi; Sung, Sharon; Teo, Irene; Lee, Jungup; Ong, Marcus E H; Graves, Nicholas; Teo, Tess Lin",J Med Internet Res,330,16

We use an in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. The effect of fluid rheology on the shear stress distribution is also discussed. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","Patel, Maneesh; Harish Kruthiventi, S S; Kaushik, P",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,330,12

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. The FDA authorized emergency use of HCQ against COVID-19. HCQ may have dose-related cardiotoxicity. This clinical trial received ethical approval on May 15, 2020, operationalized in June to evaluate a low prophylaxis dose of HCQ (200mg BID) in household contacts of COVID-19-positive patients without physical contact between investigators and participants. It represents the first report of the FDA approved 6-lead EKGs with a smartphone KardiaMobile® 6L application. METHODS: To reach a sample size of 170, household members were contacted by telephone, emailed consent forms with electronic signature capability, and randomized 2:1 to HCQ or observation for 10 days with follow-up of 14 days. Home saliva PCR tests recorded COVID status on days 1 and 14. Symptoms and 6-lead EKGs were obtained daily. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were randomized with 42 evaluable at day 14. Remote monitoring of 407 EKGs revealed no QTc prolongation or other ECG changes in either group. At time of consent, no participants were symptomatic or COVID+. On days 1 and 14, COVID tests were positive in 4 and 2 in the HCQ group and 4 and 0 in the observation group. No tests converted to positive. There were no deaths or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical trial without personal contact, rapidly initiated and operationalized to exclude cardiac toxicity using daily remote 6-lead EKG monitoring, is feasible.

However, many have been retrospective or limited to more severe cases (hospitalized) and have not routinely included serial virologic sampling (especially in outpatients) and immunologic assessment. METHODS: Transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a respiratory sample PCR were prospectively followed up to 90 days. Patients provided consent for convalescent serum samples and serial nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody (anti-nucleoprotein and anti-RBD) and viral load respectively. RESULTS: In the 161 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19, the spectrum of disease ranged from asymptomatic infection (4.3%) to hospitalization (60.6%), supplemental oxygen requirement (43.1%), mechanical ventilation (22.7%) and death (15.6%). Increasing age (OR:1.031 95%CI 1.001-1.062, p=0.046) and >=2 comorbid conditions (OR:3.690 95%CI 1.418-9.615, p=0.007) were associated with need for supplemental oxygen.

MethodsWe constructed a compartmental mathematical model for the transmission, detection and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections for regions where Anglo American has mining operations. We fitted the model to publicly available data and used it to make short-term projections. Finally, we evaluated how the model performed by comparing short-term projections to actual confirmed cases, retrospectively. FindingsThe average forecast errors for four-week-ahead projections ranged between 1% and 8% in all the countries and regions considered in this study. All but one region had more than 75% of the true values falling within the range of four-week-ahead projections. The quality of the projections improved with time as expected due to increased historical data. ConclusionOur model produced four-week forecasts with a sufficiently high level of accuracy to guide operational and strategic planning for business continuity and COVID-19 responses in Anglo American mining sites.","Delva, Wim; Dominic, Emanuel; Beauclair, Roxanne; Ouifki, Rachid; Kroon, Matthys; Volmink, Heinrich; Dorkin, Elton",,330,26

Here we address the question whether stress-associated neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms can possibly contribute to an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections and influence the course of COVID-19 disease. Additionally, we discuss that not all forms of stress (e.g. acute versus chronic) are detrimental and that some types of stress could attenuate infection-risk and -progression. The overall aim of this review is to motivate future research efforts to clarify whether psychosocial interventions have the potential to optimize neuroendocrine-immune responses against respiratory viral infections during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The current state of research on different types of stress is summarized in a comprehensive narrative review to promote a psychoneuroimmune understanding of how stress and its mediators cortisol, (nor)adrenaline, neuropeptides and neurotrophins can shape the immune defense against viral diseases. Based on this understanding, we describe how people with high psychosocial stress can be identified, which behaviors and psychosocial interventions may contribute to optimal stress management, and how psychoneuroimmune knowledge can be used to improve adequate care for COVID-19 and other patients with viral infections.","Peters, Eva M J; Schedlowski, Manfred; Watzl, Carsten; Gimsa, Ulrike",Neurobiol Stress,330,16

Specifically, technologies that provide high performance and maximal use of biomass feedstocks into commodities with reduced environmental impact have been highly pursued. A key example comprises the extraction and/or dissolution of polysaccharides, one of the most abundant fractions of biomass, which still need to be improved regarding these processes' efficiency and selectivity parameters. In this context, the use of alternative solvents and the application of less energy-intensive processes in the extraction of polysaccharides might play an important role to reach higher efficiency and sustainability in biomass valorization. This review debates the latest achievements in sustainable processes for the extraction of polysaccharides from a myriad of biomass resources, including lignocellulosic materials and food residues. Particularly, the ability of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to dissolve and extract the most abundant polysaccharides from natural sources, namely cellulose, chitin, starch, hemicelluloses and pectins, is scrutinized and the efficiencies between solvents are compared. The interaction mechanisms between solvent and polysaccharide are described, paving the way for the design of selective extraction processes. A detailed discussion of the work developed for each polysaccharide as well as the innovation degree and the development stage of dissolution and extraction technologies is presented. Their advantages and disadvantages are also identified, and possible synergies by integrating microwave- and ultrasound-assisted extraction (MAE and UAE) or a combination of both (UMAE) are briefly described. Overall, this review provides key information towards the design of more efficient, selective and sustainable extraction and dissolution processes of polysaccharides from biomass.","Morais, Eduarda S; Lopes, André M da Costa; Freire, Mara G; Freire, Carmen S R; Coutinho, João A P; Silvestre, Armando J D",Molecules (Basel),330,4

Cytokines are important to immunity. To further elucidate the role of the immune system in COVID-19, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess comprehensively and bi-directionally the role of cytokines in COVID-19. Methods: We assessed primarily whether genetically different levels of 41 cytokines affected risk of any COVID-19 (laboratory confirmed, physician confirmed or self-reported, 36,590 cases, 1,668,938 controls), and conversely if genetic risk of liability to any COVID-19 affected these cytokines (n &lt;= 8293) using the most recent genome-wide association studies. We obtained inverse variance weighting (IVW) estimates, conducted sensitivity analyses and used a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to account for multiple comparisons. We also assessed whether any findings were evident for hospitalized COVID-19 (hospitalized laboratory confirmed, 12,888 cases, 1,295,966 controls). Results: Macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP1b;more commonly known as Chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 4 (CCL4) was inversely associated with COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) 0.97 per SD, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-0.99] but not after adjustment for multiple comparisons. This finding replicated for hospitalized COVID-19 (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98). Liability to any COVID-19 was nominally associated with several cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) but not after correction. Conclusion: A crucial element of immune response to infection (CCL4) was related to COVID-19, whether it is a target of intervention to prevent COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Li, M.; Yeung, C.

However, the speed at which the pandemic struck and the response was rolled out, the widespread impact on healthcare infrastructure, the lack of sufficient preparation within the public health system, and the complexity of the crisis led to utter confusion among test-takers. Invasion of privacy remains a crucial concern. The user experience of test takers remains low. User friction affects user behavior and discourages participation in testing programs. Test efficacy has been overstated. Test results are poorly understood resulting in inappropriate follow-up recommendations. Herein, we review the current landscape of COVID-19 testing, identify four key challenges, and discuss the consequences of the failure to address these challenges. The current infrastructure around testing and information propagation is highly privacy-invasive and does not leverage scalable digital components. In this work, we discuss challenges complicating the existing covid-19 testing ecosystem and highlight the need to improve the testing experience for the user and reduce privacy invasions. Digital tools will play a critical role in resolving these challenges.","Morales, Manuel; Barbar, Rachel; Gandhi, Darshan; Landage, Sanskruti; Bae, Joseph; Vats, Arpita; Kothari, Jil; Shankar, Sheshank; Sukumaran, Rohan; Mathur, Himi; Misra, Krutika; Saxena, Aishwarya; Patwa, Parth; SethuramanT., V.; Arseni, Maurizio; Advani, Shailesh; Jakimowicz, Kasia; Anand, Sunaina; Katiyar, Priyanshi; Mehra, Ashley; Iyer, Rohan; Murali, Srinidhi; Mahindra, Aryan; Dmitrienko, Mikhail; Srivastava, Saurish; Gangavarapu, Ananya; Penrod, Steve; Sharma, Vivek; Singh, Abhishek; Raskar, Ramesh",,330,16

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly. Our estimated parameters are largely in line with the World Health Organization estimates and previous studies.","Tian, Jing Jing; Wu, Jia Bing; Bao, Yun Ting; Weng, Xiao Yu; Shi, Lei; Liu, Bin Bin; Yu, Xin Ya; Qi, Long Xing; Liu, Zhi Rong",Math Biosci Eng,330,16

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE), transmission electron microcopy, and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type â ¡ alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis were observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type â ¡ alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. Conclusions: The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs.

Our knowledge of these aerosol constituents is sparse and gleaned from case reports and poorly controlled studies. Therefore, we tracked the origins of microbiota in aerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling, implant osteotomy, and restorative procedures by combining reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (to identify and quantify SARS-CoV-2) and 16S sequencing (to characterize the entire microbiome) with fine-scale enumeration and source tracking. Linear discriminant analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances revealed significant class separation between the salivary microbiome and aerosol microbiota deposited on the operator, patient, assistant, or the environment (P < 0.01, analysis of similarities). We also discovered that 78% of the microbiota in condensate could be traced to the dental irrigant, while saliva contributed to a median of 0% of aerosol microbiota. We also identified low copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the saliva of several asymptomatic patients but none in aerosols generated from these patients. Together, the bacterial and viral data encourage us to conclude that when infection control measures are used, such as preoperative mouth rinses and intraoral high-volume evacuation, dental treatment is not a factor in increasing the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients and that standard infection control practices are sufficiently capable of protecting personnel and patients from exposure to potential pathogens. This information is of immediate urgency, not only for safe resumption of dental treatment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but also to inform evidence-based selection of personal protection equipment and infection control practices at a time when resources are stretched and personal protection equipment needs to be prioritized.","Meethil, A P; Saraswat, S; Chaudhary, P P; Dabdoub, S M; Kumar, P S",J Dent Res,330,17

The great effort put in the development of ionizable lipids with increased in vivo potency brought LNPs from the laboratory benches to the FDA approval of patisiran in 2018 and the ongoing clinical trials for mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Despite these success stories, several challenges remain in RNA delivery, including what is known as ""endosomal escape."" Reaching the cytosol is mandatory for unleashing the therapeutic activity of RNA molecules, as their accumulation in other intracellular compartments would simply result in efficacy loss. In LNPs, the ability of ionizable lipids to form destabilizing non-bilayer structures at acidic pH is recognized as the key for endosomal escape and RNA cytosolic delivery. This is motivating a surge in studies aiming at designing novel ionizable lipids with improved biodegradation and safety profiles. In this work, we describe the journey of RNA-loaded LNPs across multiple intracellular barriers, from the extracellular space to the cytosol. In silico molecular dynamics modeling, in vitro high-resolution microscopy analyses, and in vivo imaging data are systematically reviewed to distill out the regulating mechanisms underlying the endosomal escape of RNA. Finally, a comparison with strategies employed by enveloped viruses to deliver their genetic material into cells is also presented. The combination of a multidisciplinary analytical toolkit for endosomal escape quantification and a nature-inspired design could foster the development of future LNPs with improved cytosolic delivery of nucleic acids.","Schlich, Michele; Palomba, Roberto; Costabile, Gabriella; Mizrahy, Shoshy; Pannuzzo, Martina; Peer, Dan; Decuzzi, Paolo",Bioeng Transl Med,330,1

The container CT is a multidetector CT scanner installed within a radiation-protected stand-alone container (a detachable lead shielding room) that is deployed outside the makeshift hospital buildings. The container CT approach provided various medical institutions with the solution not only for rapid CT installation and high adaptability to site environments, but also for significantly minimizing the risk of cross-infection between radiological personnel and patients during CT examination in the pandemic. In this article, we described the typical setup of a container CT and how it worked for chest CT examinations in Wuhan city, the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak.","Huang, Zixing; Zhao, Shuang; Leng, Qi; Hu, Shaoping; Li, Zhenlin; Song, Bin",Diagn Interv Radiol,330,10

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study comprising 1309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.01%-29.85%).

The use of social media by public health authorities has helped to reduce these threats by increasing effective risk communication between the government and the public. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal how China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses social media to improve three aspects of health communication between the government and the public: adoption, operation, and interaction. METHODS: To analyze the 134 CDC government Weibo accounts at the provincial- and prefecture-level administration regions in mainland China, we collected their account data and extracted 1215 Weibo tweets. We also supplemented the data to reveal the overall performance of the CDC's government Weibo use during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: The registration rate of the CDC's government Weibo accounts increased year by year, and the local authorities registered Weibo accounts before the central government authorities. In total, 29.8% (n=134) of the 450 CDC facilities have registered an account. Among the 134 CDC facilities that have registered Weibo accounts, the registration rate in the eastern region (n=68, 50.7%) was higher than those in the central region (n=30, 22.4%) and the western region (n=36, 26.9%). Nearly 90.0% of these Weibo accounts had official certification, but there were dropouts in the specific operating process. One-third of the accounts have not been updated for more than 1 year, and the number of Weibo followers was polarized, with a maximum and minimum difference of 1 million. The response rate to users' comments was less than 1%. Emergency information, multimedia content, and original content were more helpful in promoting communication between the government and the public. Such interaction was partially improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC updated the daily epidemic situation and provided popular science information for epidemic prevention and control for the public in a timely manner. CONCLUSIONS: China's CDC is using more social media to popularize daily health information and has taken the first step to improve communication between the government and the public. However, equal dialogue, two-way interactions, and effective communication with the public still need improvement.","Zeng, Runxi; Li, Menghan",J Med Internet Res,330,16

The baseline best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness were compared within the groups through months 1, 3, 6, and 12 of follow-up postoperatively. Then, changes in these two parameters at all follow-up points were compared between the groups. RESULTS: We enrolled 16 patients per study group. The baseline best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness were not significantly different between the two groups (p>0.05). Compared with the baseline, both the best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness improved significantly in both groups in all follow-ups (p<0.05), except for the best-corrected visual acuity of the epiretinal-membrane-only group after month 1 (p<0.05).

Among one of the categories that are most affected by SARS-Cov-2 infection are the elderly residents. Despite the need for prompt diagnoses, which are essential to implement all isolation measures necessary to contain the infection spread, deceased subjects in long-term care facilities are still are often diagnosed post-mortem. In this context, our study focuses on the use of post-mortem computed tomography for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, in conjunction with post-mortem swabs. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of post-mortem whole CT-scanning in identifying COVID-19 pneumonia as a cause of death, by comparing chest CT-findings of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities to control cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 24 deceased subjects: 13 subjects coming from long-term care facility and 11 subjects died at home. Whole body CT scans were performed within 48 h from death in all subjects to evaluate the presence and distribution of pulmonary abnormalities typical of COVID-19-pneumonia, including: ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion to confirm the post-mortem diagnosis. RESULTS: Whole-body CT scans was feasible and allowed a complete diagnosis in all subjects. In 9 (69%) of the 13 cases from long-term care facility the cause of death was severe COVID 19 pneumonia, while GGO were present in 100% of the study population. CONCLUSION: In the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks, given that laboratory tests for the novel coronavirus is time-consuming and can be falsely negative, the post-mortem CT can be considered as a reliable and safe modality to confirm COVID-19 pneumonia. This is especially true for specific postmortem chest CT-findings that are rather characteristic of COVID-19 fatalities.","De-Giorgio, Fabio; Cittadini, Francesca; Cina, Alessandro; Cavarretta, Elena; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Vetrugno, Giuseppe; Natale, Luigi; Colosimo, Cesare; Pascali, Vincenzo L",Forensic Sci Int,330,21

However, access to safe water and hygiene is inadequate in many places around the globe; hence T-zone touching restriction is considered more worthwhile compared to other prevention strategies. Aim: A systematic review was carried out to appraise the frequency of T-zone (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) touching in humans to comprehend the challenge of its restriction, and thus support public health professionals to produce evidence synthesis guidance for public.For this systemic review, data were collected by keyword searching, and several online databases were searched. The PRISMA checklist, PECO protocol and STROBE guideline were followed in this review, and pooled data were analysed in R version 4. Result: Total of 10 single arms observational studies were included. The pooled average (SD) facial self-touch per hour was 50.06 (±47) times, and a specific touch of T-zone was 68.7 (±27). T-zone self-touch within the total facial self-touch was found higher R = 0.680, with 95% CI 0.14, 0.91, P = 0.02 and X2 = 167.63, P < 0.0001. Conclusion: The review found that face-touch is a type of consistent regulatory movements. Control of T-zone touch requires extensive behaviour intervention and community awareness.","Rahman, Juma; Mumin, Jubayer; Fakhruddin, Bapon",Ann Glob Health,330,1

There are inconclusive data in this regard and causes of VV-ECMO failure are not yet understood well. CASE SERIES: Here, seven patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS who underwent VV-ECMO introduced and causes of VV-ECMO failure discussed. Medical records of seven COVID-19 patients treated with VV-ECMO were retrospectively evaluated to determine the clinical outcomes of VV-ECMO. Oxygenator failure occurred in four patients whom needed to oxygenator replacement. Successful VV-ECMO decannulation was done in three patients, however finally one patient survived. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercoagulability state and oxygenator failure were the most main etiologies for VV-ECMO failure in our study. All patients with COVID-19 undergoing VV-ECMO should be monitored for such problems and highly specialized healthcare team should monitor the patients during VV-ECMO.","Ahmadi, Zargham Hossein; Jahangirifard, Alireza; Farzanegan, Behrooz; Tabarsi, Payam; Abtahian, Zahra; Abedini, Atefeh; Sharifi, Mehrzad; Jadbabaei, Amir Naser; Mafhumi, Yadollah; Moslem, Ali; Sistani, Marjan; Yousefian, Sahar; Saffaei, Ali; Dastan, Farzaneh",J Card Surg,330,20

Here, we retrospectively analyze 851 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with at least two positive PCR tests and find that 99 of these patients remain SARS-CoV-2-positive after 4 weeks from their initial diagnosis date. For the 851-patient cohort, the mean lower bound of viral RNA shedding was 17.3 days (SD: 7.8), and the mean upper bound of viral RNA shedding from 668 patients transitioning to confirmed PCR-negative status was 22.7 days (SD: 11.8). Among 104 patients with an IgG test result, 90 patients were seropositive to date, with mean upper bound of time to seropositivity from initial diagnosis being 37.8 days (95% CI: 34.3-41.3). Our findings from juxtaposing IgG and PCR tests thus reveal that some SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are non-hospitalized and seropositive, yet actively shed viral RNA (14 of 90 patients). This study emphasizes the need for monitoring viral loads and neutralizing antibody titers in long-term non-hospitalized shedders as a means of characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 infection lifecycle.","Agarwal, Vineet; Venkatakrishnan, A J; Puranik, Arjun; Kirkup, Christian; Lopez-Marquez, Agustin; Challener, Douglas W; Theel, Elitza S; O039,; Horo, John C; Binnicker, Matthew J; Kremers, Walter K; Faubion, William A; Badley, Andrew D; Williams, Amy W; Gores, Gregory J; Halamka, John D; Morice, William G; Soundararajan, Venky",Cell Death Discov,330,29

Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.","Feng, Xiaotao; Sun, Ruoxi; Zhu, Xiaogang; Xue, Minhui; Wen, Sheng; Liu, Dongxi; Nepal, Surya; Technology, Yang Xiang Swinburne University of; Adelaide, The University of; Data61, CSIRO",,330,20

We aimed to investigate the adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) for COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the AEFIs associated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital from March 3 to March 22, 2021. We investigated the systemic and local adverse events during the 7 days following the vaccination using the Mobile Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (MVAERS) developed by our hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1,503 HCWs were vaccinated, and the data of 994 HCWs were reported in the MVAERS. The most commonly reported AEFIs were tenderness at the injection site (94.5%), fatigue (92.9%), pain at the injection site (88.0%), and malaise (83.8%). The severity of most AEFIs was mild-to-moderate, and the severity and number of AEFIs were less in the older age group. There were no serious events requiring hospitalization, and most AEFIs improved within a few days. CONCLUSION: The AEFIs associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were tolerable, and the use of the MVAERS was helpful in monitoring the AEFIs.

METHODS: The general recommendations included working remotely when feasible, implementation of screening/safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines, social distancing, regular cleaning of treatment environment, and testing for high-risk patients/procedures. All teaching conferences, tumor boards, and weekly chart rounds were conducted using a virtual platform. Additionally, specific recommendations were given to each section to ensure proper patient treatments. The impact of these measures, especially adaptability and resilience, were evaluated through specific questionnaire surveys. RESULTS: These comprehensive COVID-19-related measures resulted in most staff expressing a consistent level of satisfaction in regard to personal safety, maintaining a safe work environment, continuing quality patient care, and continuing educational activities during the pandemic. There was a significant reduction in patient treatments and on-site patient visits with an appreciable increase in the number of telemedicine e-visits. CONCLUSIONS: Survey results demonstrated substantial adaptability and resilience, including in the rapid recovery of departmental activities during the reactivation phase. In the event of a future public health emergency, the measures implemented may be adopted with good outcomes by radiation oncology departments across the globe.","Das, Indra J; Kalapurakal, John A; Strauss, Jonathan B; Zawislak, Brian R; Gopalakrishnan, Mahesh; Bajaj, Amishi; Mittal, Bharat B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),330,10

There is limited data regarding the incidence and management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients' post-transplantation. In the pre-COVID-19 era, these patients were already at an increased risk of developing opportunistic infections. These often manifested with atypical symptoms. CASE SUMMARY: We report another case of uneventful COVID-19 pneumonia in a 58-year old male who was 18 mo' post liver transplantation. He received tacrolimus monotherapy since July 2019. The clinical manifestations included only epigastric pain radiating to the right hypochondrium, nausea and vomiting. He had no fevers, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia or dysgeusia even if the chest computed tomography scan revealed an extension of the multiple patchy ground-glass density shadows to the upper lobe of the left lung too. He was hospitalised and received a course of oral chloroquine (200 mg × 3 per day) for a period of 10 d. Interestingly, the COVID 19 infection was uneventful though there were no modifications to his tacrolimus dosing. He was successfully discharged. We performed subsequent follow-up via telemedicine. CONCLUSION: In light of the current pandemic, it is even more important to identify how the liver recipient's patients present and are managed, especially for immunosuppression treatment.","Sessa, Anna; Mazzola, Alessandra; Lim, Chetana; Atif, Mohammed; Pappatella, Juliana; Pourcher, Valerie; Scatton, Olivier; Conti, Filomena",World J Gastroenterol,330,26

It affects the kidney in virtually all patients with classical and some late onset variants. Podocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, tubular and mesangial cells are involved in different ways. Proteinuria and chronic kidney disease are the result of the progressive accumulation of the enzyme substrates globotriaosylceramide (GB3) and lyso-GB3 in the cytoplasm of these cells (mainly in lysosomes), which leads to cellular and organ dysfunction and eventually renal failure and end-stage kidney disease. Specific enzyme replacement therapy and pharmacological chaperone are at present the main therapeutic approach. After enzyme infusion, the delivered enzyme is differentially uptaken by kidney cells in three different ways: By Mannose-6-phosphate receptor, megalin and sortilin. The delivered enzyme gradually clears cells from the accumulation of the glycosphingolipids and contributes to a cellular healthier status. The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to the collapse of health systems around the world and to thousands of deaths. Kidney involvement has been reported to range from proteinuria to acute kidney injury, 30% of which may require renal replacement therapy. In this review the potential causes for which Fabry patients should be at increased risk and the necessity not to discontinue therapy are discussed.","Trimarchi, Hernán",J. Nephropathol.,330,1

Mounting evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the air; however, this has not yet been demonstrated. Here we quantitatively analyze virion accumulation by accounting for aerosolized virion emission and destabilization. Reported superspreading events analyzed within this framework point towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Virion exposure calculated for these events is found to trace out a single value, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol that is comparable to the MIDs measured for other respiratory viruses; thus, the consistent infectious exposure levels and their commensurability to known aerosol-MIDs establishes the plausibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Using filtration at a rate exceeding the destabilization rate of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 can reduce exposure below this infective dose.","Kolinski, John M; Schneider, Tobias M",Phys Rev E,330,23

A retrospective cross-sectional study of ILD among 318 CTD patients diagnosed using relevant ACR criteria at the rheumatology unit of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Lagos from 2012 to 2019. Socio-demographics, clinical features, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes were documented. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 21 with p < 0.05. The LASUTH ethics committee approved the study. Interstitial lung disease occurred in 31 (9.7%) of 318 CTD cases. Their mean age was 38.8 ± 13.3 years, range 19-68 years with 28 (90.3%) females. Proportions of CTD-ILD were Sjogren's syndrome (50%), UCTD (50%), systemic sclerosis (46.7%), MCTD (33.3%), PM/DM (25%), SLE (6.5%), and RA (2.6%). Commonest presentations were cough (93.5%) and bibasal inspiratory crackles (83.9%) with a restrictive pattern in 83.9%. Antinuclear antibody occurred in 100% and anti-ENA in 67.7%. Traction bronchiectasis (89.7%) and ground glass opacities (96.6%) were frequent HRCT findings.

Depending on climatic, cultural, and economic contexts, these diseases have a similar geographical distribution as many other diseases, particularly tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, but are often less targeted by the national and many international healthcare systems. Another subgroup of fungal infections, such as candidiasis, cryptococcosis, pneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, and to a lesser extent, aspergillosis, are known as AIDS-related mycoses. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been able to decrease the mortality rate of these diseases, particularly cryptococcosis, the disproportionately low distribution of funds to their diagnosis and treatment remains an obstacle in saving and improving the lives of patients affected. A new wave of viral diseases dubbed the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hit the world at the end of 2019. Due to progressive symptoms and high mortality rates of COVID-19 compared to fungal infections, particularly the FNTDs, funding is currently allocated predominantly for diagnostic and therapeutic research on COVID-19. As a result, advances in FNTDs and AIDS-related mycosis care are considerably reduced. This paper explores the association between COVID-19, FNTDs, and AIDS-related mycoses with a predictive perspective.","Nargesi, Sanaz; Bongomin, Felix; Hedayati, Mohammad T",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,330,16

Seven major metabolic indices were measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT in 93 patients with HCC, prior to OLT. The Mann-Whitney U test was then used to predict the association of metabolic indices, including the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor-to-mediastinum SUV ratio, tumor-to-normal-liver SUV ratio, SUV normalized to lean body mass metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and uptake-volume product (UVP), with the recurrence risk. The Deauville-like scoring system was used to quantify the recurrence risk. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were performed to determine survival rate. The results showed that Deauville-like score (PET-negative vs. -positive), MTV (cutoff value, 13.36), TLG (cutoff value, 62.21) and UVP (cutoff value, 66.60) had high prediction performance for tumor recurrence (P<0.05). TLG had the highest receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.725. Among the clinical factors, high level of &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP, &#8805;144 ng/ml), Milan criteria, tumor number (>3), involvement of both right and left lobes, and tumor size (>5 cm) were found to be significant predictors of tumor recurrence. Patients in the low metabolic group had longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) times compared with those in the high metabolic group, regardless of whether they met the Milan criteria or not. AFP, uptake-volume product according the SUV mean of mediastinum (UVP-M), Milan criteria, lymph node metastasis, and the number of tumors were significant prognostic factors for RFS (P<0.05) in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Additionally, the MVI was a significant prognostic factor based on univariate survival analyses. Overall, the present study demonstrated the metabolic burden indices measured by PET/CT, Deauville-like score, MTV, TLG and UVP as significant prognostic factors in patients with HCC following OLT. The combination of metabolic indices measured by PET/CT and the existing criteria, such as the Milan criteria, may play an important role in evaluating the suitability of OLT in specific patients.","Ding, Enci; Lu, Dongyan; Wei, Lijuan; Feng, Xuemin; Shen, Jie; Xu, Wengui",Oncol Lett,330,16

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of various cancers and play an important role in GC progression. X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a carcinogenic lncRNA, is involved in human tumourigenesis and is altered in GC. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a transcription factor, is involved in cancer cell metastasis and differentiation. However, the exact mechanism underlying the biological roles of XIST and JAK2 in cancer cells remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted using GES-1, HGC-27, AGS and HEK-293 T cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect XIST, microRNA-337 (miR-337) and JAK2 expressions. GC cell invasion was investigated by using the Transwell assay. Fluorescein reporter gene detection was used to determine the relationship between JAK2 and XIST. RESULTS: Compared with that in GES-1 cells, XIST expression was significantly up-regulated in AGS and HGC-27 cells. miR-337 expression in GC cell lines was decreased. The proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells were simultaneously inhibited by XIST knockdown, and the relationship between XIST and miR-337 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. JAK2 is expected to be the target gene of miR-337. MiR-337 can negatively regulate JAK2 expression in vitro. In addition, si-XIST decreased JAK2 expression by up-regulating miR-337 in vitro, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we speculated that XIST regulates JAK2 by competing with miR-337 as a competitive endogenous lncRNA in GC. CONCLUSION: We elucidated the effects of migration and invasion after XIST inhibition, at least in part, by inhibiting miR-337 expression in GC cells to regulate JAK2. These data indicate that a positive feedback loop exists between XIST and JAK2 and suggest that JAK2 and XIST play a vital role in cancer cell migration and invasion.","Zheng, Wenqi; Li, Juan; Zhou, Xue; Cui, Li; Wang, Yunfang",,330,10

It is of great interest to the vaccinees who have received the COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine developers and authorities to identify the non-responders in a timely manner so intervention can take place by either giving additional boosts of the same vaccine or switching to a different vaccine to improve the protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. A robust correlation was seen between binding antibody titer and efficacy (p=0.93) in the clinic studies of 7 COVID-19 vaccines, so it is of urgency to develop a simple POCT for vaccinees to self-assess their immune response at home. MethodsUsing CHO cell-expressed full length SARS-CoV2 S1 protein as coating antigen on colloidal gold particles, a SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG-IgM antibody lateral flow test kit (POCT) was developed. The test was validated with negative human sera collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreaks, and blood samples from human subjects prior, during, and post-immunization of COVID-19 vaccines. ResultsThe specificity of the POCT was 99.0%, as examined against 947 normal human sera and 20 whole blood samples collected pre-immunization. The limit of detection was 50 IU/mL of pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PVNT) using human anti-SARS-2 neutralizing standards from convalescent sera. The sensitivity of POCT for SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein antibody IgG-IgM was compared with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody ELISA and determined to be 100% using 23 blood samples from vaccinated human subjects and 10 samples from non-vaccinated ones. Whole blood samples were collected from 119 human subjects (ages between 22-61 years) prior to, during, and post-vaccination of five different COVID-19 vaccines. Among them, 115 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies (showing positive at least once) and 4 people tested negative (tested negative at least twice on different days), demonstrating 96.64% of seroconversion after full-vaccination. 92.3% (36/39) of the human subjects who were younger than 45 achieved seroconversion within 2 weeks while only 57.1% (4/7) of subjects older than 45 tested positive for S1 antibodies, suggesting that younger people develop protection much faster than older ones. Even though the S1 antibody level in 88% of human subjects vaccinated with inactivated virus dropped below 50 IU/mL two months later, one boost could quickly raise the S1 antibody titer above 50 IU/mL of PVNT, indicates that the initial vaccination was successful and immunization memory was developed. ConclusionUsing the lateral flow tests of SARS-CoV2 S1 IgG+IgM, vaccinated human subjects can easily self-assess the efficacy of their vaccination at home. The vaccine developer could quickly identify those non-responders and give them an additional boost to improve the efficacy of their vaccines. Vaccinees who failed in response could switch to different types of COVID-19 vaccines since there are more than 10 COVID-19 vaccines approved using three different platform technologies. HighlightsO_LIMore than ten novel COVID-19 vaccines have been approved with protections against SARS-CoV-2 infections ranges between 52-95%. It is of great interest to the vaccinees who have received the COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine developers and authorities to identify the non-responders in a timely manner.

This study aimed to provide an insight into mental well-being of pregnant women in Denmark during COVID-19 by assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS: Data from two cohorts of pregnant women recruited from Danish general practice were compared. A COVID-19 lockdown cohort (N=330) completed questionnaires between 8 April and 6 May. Responses were compared to those from a control cohort of women from 2016 (N=1428). Mental well-being was measured with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Anxiety Symptom Scale (ASS). RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 83% of the COVID-19 lockdown cohort and by 93% of the control cohort. Multivariable analysis controlling for age, cohabitation status, occupation, smoking, alcohol use, chronic disease, fertility treatment, parity and children living at home showed no difference in depressive symptoms (MDI). Anxiety symptoms (ASS) were slightly worse in the COVID-19 lockdown cohort (mean difference=1.4 points), mainly driven by questions concerning general anxiety. The largest differences in anxiety were seen in first trimester (adjusted mean difference=4.0 points). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women questioned during the COVID-19 pandemic showed no change in symptoms of depression and only a modest elevation of anxiety when compared to pregnant women questioned during a non-pandemic period in 2016.","Overbeck, Gritt; Rasmussen, Ida Scheel; Siersma, Volkert; Andersen, Julie Høgsgaard; Kragstrup, Jakob; Wilson, Philip; Hauskov Graungaard, Anette; Ertmann, Ruth Kirk",Scand J Public Health,330,30

DATA SOURCES: Searches in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles made available in 2020, using the terms ""diagnosis"" OR ""diagnostic"" OR ""diagnostic tests"" OR ""tests"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" in the title. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Tests for the etiological agent identify genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 or humoral responses to it. The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract materials during the first week of symptoms. Serological tests should be indicated from the second week of symptoms onwards. A wide range of different tests is available, with variable sensitivity and specificity, most of which require validation. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, clotting tests, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and procalcitonin identify risk of disease with greater severity, thromboembolic complications, myocardial damage, and/or worse prognosis. Imaging tests may be useful for diagnosis, especially when there is a compatible clinical picture, and other tests presented negative results or were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genetic material of the virus by RT-PCR is the gold standard test, but its sensitivity is not satisfactory. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on clinical data, epidemiological history, tests for etiological diagnosis, and tests to support the diagnosis of the disease and/or its complications. New diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity and specificity, as well as faster results, are necessary.","Goudouris, Ekaterini S",,330,24

In order to streamline care at King's College Hospital (KCH), Paediatric Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) have developed a collaborative working approach allowing patients to be treated effectively and to streamline patient care in the absence of easy access to general anaesthetic facilities. METHOD: Presenting complaints, treatment need and the treatment received were recorded for all paediatric patients presenting with dental pain and infection in the ""lockdown"" period (23rd March- 14th June) during ""normal"" working hours and ""out of hours"" to either paediatric dentistry or OMFS. RESULTS: 420 calls were triaged which converted to 67 patients seen face-to-face for oro-facial pain and infection. 41% of children were treated successfully under Local anaesthetic alone, only 13% required a general anaesthetic (GA) in the ""lockdown"" period. The vast majority of patients had antibiotics prescribed prior to attendance (80%). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the demographic, presenting complaints and treatment need of patients who presented to KCH during the lockdown period with dental pain and infection.

In 2016, the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system launched a unique program to distribute video-enabled tablets to Veterans with access barriers. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the use of VA-issued video telehealth tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness in the VA system. DESIGN: Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we first evaluated the adoption of tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness and housed Veterans. We then analyzed health record and tablet utilization data to compare characteristics of both subpopulations, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with tablet use among Veterans experiencing homelessness. PATIENTS: In total, 12,148 VA patients receiving tablets between October 2017 and March 2019, focusing on the 1470 VA Veterans experiencing homelessness receiving tablets (12.1%). MAIN MEASURES: Tablet use within 6 months of receipt for mental health, primary or specialty care. KEY RESULTS: Nearly half (45.9%) of Veterans experiencing homelessness who received a tablet had a video visit within 6 months of receipt, most frequently for telemental health. Tablet use was more common among Veterans experiencing homelessness who were younger (AOR = 2.77; P <.001); middle-aged (AOR = 2.28; P <.001); in rural settings (AOR = 1.46; P =.005); and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.64; P <.001), and less common among those who were Black (AOR = 0.43; P <.001) and those with a substance use disorder (AOR = 0.59; P <.001) or persistent housing instability (AOR = 0.75; P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth care and connection for vulnerable populations are particularly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic but also beyond. VA's distribution of video telehealth tablets offers healthcare access to Veterans experiencing homelessness; however, barriers remain for subpopulations. Tailored training and support for these patients may be needed to optimize telehealth tablet use and effectiveness.","Garvin, Lynn A; Hu, Jiaqi; Slightam, Cindie; McInnes, D Keith; Zulman, Donna M",J. gen. intern. med,330,23

Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society. We call on psychologists to advocate for social justice in pandemic preparedness, promote disability justice in health care settings, call for transparency and accountability in rationing approaches, and support policy changes for macro- and microallocation strategies to proactively reduce the need for rationing.

Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13â077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22-38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20-35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 3·61 [95% CI 2·59-5·04]; p<0·0001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 2·60, 95% CI 1·05-6·43; p=0·039), elevated tumour necrosis factor &#945; (1·22, 1·01-1·47; p=0·037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (1·65, 1·03-2·78; p=0·032), reduced CD4+ T cells (0·84, 0·71-0·98; p=0·031), and reduced albumin-globulin ratio (0·12, 0·02-0·77; p=0·024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer.

Safety measures recommended by governments and health organizations include monitoring one's body and interpersonal and social distance from others. We contend that the diffuse safety anxiety stemming from sexual and self-objectification encourages targets to broadly adopt behaviors that protect against body-based dangers, including COVID-19. Accordingly, safety anxiety should predict greater compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. U.S. residents (N = 501) were recruited online and completed measures of sexual objectification, self-objectification, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety compliance. Two-step mediation analyses revealed a positive indirect effect of sexual objectification on safety anxiety through internalization of observers' perspectives (self-objectification Factor 1); in turn, there was a positive indirect effect of internalized others on COVID-19 body-based safety compliance through safety anxiety. Moreover, women (vs. men) reported higher levels of sexual objectification, internalization of observers' perspectives, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety measure compliance. Not only is safety anxiety relevant to cautionary behaviors protective against sexual objectification threat, but it also predicts compliance with measures that reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. Implications for objectification theory are discussed.","Earle, Megan; Prusaczyk, Elvira; Choma, Becky; Calogero, Rachel",Body Image,330,16

METHODS: Single-center, prospective observational cohort study. We recorded the presence of pain at operating room discharge, at 6 and 24 hours, using the numeric rating scale (NRS). We recorded also age, sex, ethnic origin, American Society of Anaesthesia physical status (ASA PS) classification, Charlson Comorbidity Index, the aetiology of the vitreoretinal pathology, length of surgery, and type of surgical procedure performed. RESULTS: Eye pain (NRS > 3) was present in 3 patients (0.7%) at operating room discharge, 59 (13.2%) at 6 and 65 (14.6%) at 24 hours after surgery. LASSO logistic regression analysis identified age, ASA PS, race, along with tamponade as independent risk factors for eye pain at 6 hours. Scleral buckling was selected for eye pain at 24 hrs. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol for pain control after PPV should be considered, especially in younger, non-Caucasian people, and patients with high ASA PS grade. Moreover, attention must be paid when additional surgical procedures are requested, restricting them to selected patients, and using the appropriate agent for intraocular tamponade.","Bandera, Elisabetta; Piva, Simone; Gambaretti, Eros; Minelli, Cosetta; Rizzo, Francesco; Rizzolo, Andrea; Morescalchi, Francesco; Ambrosoli, Luigi; Semeraro, Francesco; Latronico, Nicola",Minerva anestesiol,330,20

In this article, the use of alternative care sites (ACSs) for the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 or persons under investigation (PUI) in the City of Buenos Aires during the first wave of COVID-19 are described. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 and PUI with insufficient housing resources who could not comply with orders to stay home and who were considered at low clinical risk in the initial triage were referred to refurbished hotels in the City of Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires [CABA]). ACSs were divided into those for confirmed COVID-19 patients and those for PUI. RESULTS: From March to August 2020, there were 58,143 reported cases of COVID-19 (13,829 of whom lived in slums) in the CABA. For COVID-19 positive cases, 62.1% (n = 8587) of those living in slums and 21.4% (n = 9498) of those living outside the slums were housed in an ACS. In total, 31.1% (n = 18,085) of confirmed COVID-19 cases were housed in ACSs. In addition, 7728 PUI were housed (3178 from the slums) in an ACS. The average length of stay was 9.0 ± 2.5 days for patients with COVID-19 and 1.6 ± 0.7 days for PUI. For the individuals who were housed in an ACS, 1314 (5.1%) had to be hospitalised, 56 were in critical care units (0.22%) and there were 27 deaths (0.1%), none during their stay in an ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, about one-third of all people with COVID-19 were referred to an ACS in the CABA. For slum dwellers, the proportion was >60%. The need for hospitalisation was low and severe clinical events were rare. This strategy reduced the pressure on hospitals so their efforts could be directed to patients with moderate-to-severe disease.","Ferrante, Daniel; Macchia, Alejandro; González Villa Monte, Gabriel Alejo; Battistella, Gabriel; Baum, Analia; Zingoni, Paula; Angeleri, Patricia; Biscayart, Cristián; Walton, Carolina; Marcó, Florencia Flax; Esteban, Santiago; Mariani, Javier; Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán Gonzalez",Public Health,330,1

We recently demonstrated that Reticulon-like protein B13 (RTNLB13) from Arabidopsis thaliana contains a curvature-responsive amphipathic helix (APH) important for the proteins' ability to induce curvature in the ER membrane, but incapable of generating curvature by itself. We suggested it acts as a feedback element, only folding/binding once a sufficient degree of curvature has been achieved, and stabilizes curvature without disrupting the bilayer. However, it remains unclear whether this is unique to RTNLB13 or is conserved across all reticulons-to date, experimental evidence has only been reported for two reticulons. Here we used biophysical methods to characterize a minimal library of putative APH peptides from across the 21 A. thaliana isoforms. We found that reticulons with the closest evolutionary relationship to RTNLB13 contain curvature-sensing APHs in the same location with sequence conservation. Our data reveal that a more distantly-related branch of reticulons developed a ~ 20-residue linker between the transmembrane domain and APH. This may facilitate functional flexibility as previous studies have linked these isoforms not only to ER remodeling but other cellular activities.","Brooks, Rhiannon L; Mistry, Chandni S; Dixon, Ann M",Sci Rep,330,21

The extent to which these interventions are successful in stopping the spread have not been characterized in countries with distinct socioeconomic groups. We compared the effects of a partial lockdown on disease transmission among Kuwaitis (P1) and non-Kuwaitis (P2) living in Kuwait. METHODS: We fit a modified metapopulation SEIR transmission model to reported cases stratified by two groups to estimate the impact of a partial lockdown on the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). We estimated the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for the transmission in each group and simulated the potential trajectories of an outbreak from the first recorded case of community transmission until 12 days after the partial lockdown. We estimated [Formula: see text] values of both groups before and after the partial curfew, simulated the effect of these values on the epidemic curves and explored a range of cross-transmission scenarios. RESULTS: We estimate [Formula: see text] at 1·08 (95% CI: 1·00-1·26) for P1 and 2·36 (2·03-2·71) for P2. On March 22nd, [Formula: see text] for P1 and P2 are estimated at 1·19 (1·04-1·34) and 1·75 (1·26-2·11) respectively. After the partial curfew had taken effect, [Formula: see text] for P1 dropped modestly to 1·05 (0·82-1·26) but almost doubled for P2 to 2·89 (2·30-3·70). Our simulated epidemic trajectories show that the partial curfew measure greatly reduced and delayed the height of the peak in P1, yet significantly elevated and hastened the peak in P2. Modest cross-transmission between P1 and P2 greatly elevated the height of the peak in P1 and brought it forward in time closer to the peak of P2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate and quantify how the same lockdown intervention can accentuate disease transmission in some subpopulations while potentially controlling it in others. Any such control may further become compromised in the presence of cross-transmission between subpopulations. Future interventions and policies need to be sensitive to socioeconomic and health disparities.","Khadadah, Fatima; Al-Shammari, Abdullah A; Alhashemi, Ahmad; Alhuwail, Dari; Al-Saif, Bader; Alzaid, Saud N; Alahmad, Barrak; Bogoch, Isaac I",BMC Public Health,330,10

IV immunoglobulin modulates neutrophil activation through FcÎ³RIII binding. We hypothesized that early therapy with IV immunoglobulin would abrogate immunothrombosis and improve oxygenation and reduce progression to mechanical ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. Design: Prospective randomized open label. Setting: Inpatient hospital. Patients and Intervention: Hypoxic subjects with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia were randomized 1:1 to receive standard of care plus IV immunoglobulin 0.5 g/kg/d with methylprednisolone 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion for 3 days versus standard of care alone. Main Results: Sixteen subjects received IV immunoglobulin and 17 standard of care. Median ages were 51 and 58 years for standard of care and IV immunoglobulin, respectively. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Charlson comorbidity scores were similar for IV immunoglobulin and standard of care. Seven standard of care versus two IV immunoglobulin subjects required mechanical ventilation (p = 0.12, Fisher exact test). Among subjects with A-a gradient of greater than 200 mm Hg at enrollment, the IV immunoglobulin group showed: 1) a lower rate of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (2/14 vs 7/12, p = 0.038 Fisher exact test), 2) shorter median hospital length of stay (11 vs 19 d, p = 0.01 Mann Whitney U test), 3) shorter median ICU stay (2.5 vs 12.5 d, p = 0.006 Mann Whitey U test), and 4) greater improvement in Pao2/Fio2 at 7 days (median [range] change from time of enrollment +131 [+35 to +330] vs +44·5 [-115 to +157], p = 0.01, Mann Whitney U test) than standard of care. Pao2/Fio2 improvement at day 7 was significantly less for the standard of care patients who received glucocorticoid therapy than those in the IV immunoglobulin arm (p = 0.0057, Mann Whiney U test).

Inhalation is often the most relevant transmission mode in indoor environments. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the risk of inhalation transmission is not yet fully understood. Here, we used an indoor aerosol model combined with a regional inhaled deposited dose model to examine the indoor transport of aerosols from an infected person with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to a susceptible person and assess the potential inhaled dose rate of particles. Two scenarios with different ventilation rates were compared, as well as adult female versus male recipients. Assuming a source strength of 10 viruses/s, in a tightly closed room with poor ventilation (0.5 h-1), the respiratory tract deposited dose rate was 140-350 and 100-260 inhaled viruses/hour for males and females; respectively. With ventilation at 3 h-1 the dose rate was only 30-90 viruses/hour. Correcting for the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in air, these numbers are reduced by a factor of 1.2-2.2 for poorly ventilated rooms and 1.1-1.4 for well-ventilated rooms. Combined with future determinations of virus emission rates, the size distribution of aerosols containing the virus, and the infectious dose, these results could play an important role in understanding the full picture of potential inhalation transmission in indoor environments.","Hussein, Tareq; Löndahl, Jakob; Thuresson, Sara; Alsved, Malin; Al-Hunaiti, Afnan; Saksela, Kalle; Aqel, Hazem; Junninen, Heikki; Mahura, Alexander; Kulmala, Markku",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),330,24

In adolescents, detraining is poorly known as well as its prevention by homeexercises. This article aimed to assess the effects of Covid-19 confinement on detraining in young high-level soccer players despite a multimodal training program conducted at home. METHODS: Twenty-five elite soccer players, aged 14, were included to perform physical exercises at home during the Covid-19 confinement. Two cardio-training sessions and two upper and lower limb muscle strengthening sessions were performed per week. The exercise program was monitored remotely via the web. Hooper, training and mental indexes allowed a psychological follow-up. The effect of Covid-19 confinement on aerobic capacity was measured using a pre- and post-confinement Yo-Yo test. RESULTS: Out of the 25 adolescences who completed the exercises program, 19 performed the post-confinement Yo-Yo test. The running distance decreased by 614 +/- 630 m (-25%) (p = 0001) and the maximal running speed by 0.97 +/- 1 km/h (-5%) (p=0.001), confirming detraining.

BACKGROUND: To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, governments have imposed nationwide lockdowns to prevent direct contact; this has affected everyday lives and activities such as attending school classes. Such isolation may have impacted children's anxiety levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a web-based anonymous questionnaire from 22-26 April, 2020, among children (N = 2,292) in Spain. For children below 7 years of age, parents reported the children's behavioural, emotional and somatic symptoms and family environment data on a questionnaire designed by the researchers. Children over 7 years answered the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale either independently or with their parents' assistance. RESULTS: Children over 7 years, boys in particular, scored high on the anxiety spectrum. Moreover, participants who knew someone who had suffered from COVID-19 at home or whose parent was directly involved in the pandemic, obtained higher Total Anxiety scores. Significantly high values were found in all aspects of anxiety among those who feared infection or whose parents been unemployed. Of the children below 7 years, 56.3% had four or more anxiety-related symptoms, the most frequent of which were tantrums, emotional changes, restlessness and fear of being alone. The number of symptoms reported was significant when someone in the family home had been infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 home confinement had a significant impact on children, causing anxiety, behavioural problems and somatic manifestations. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses play a key role in screening children who have experience confinement owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to detect early anxiety symptoms using tele-health.

Due to multiple comorbidities, wound patients are at an increased risk for the most extreme complications of COVID-19 and providers must focus on reducing their exposure risk. The Federal, State, and local governments, as well as payers, have urged hospitals and providers to reduce utilization of nonessential health services, but they also have given more flexibility to shift the site of necessary care to lower risk environments. Providers must be prepared for disruption from this pandemic mode of health care for the next 18 months, at minimum. The wound provider must accept the new normal during the pandemic by adapting their care to meet the safety needs of the patient and the public.

Masks, depending on type, filter out the majority of viral particles, but not all. We first discuss the near-century-old literature around the viral inoculum and severity of disease (conceptualized as the LD50 or lethal dose of the virus). We include examples of rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking, including in closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) with and without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may be harmful for spread but could actually be beneficial if they lead to higher rates of exposure. Exposing society to SARS-CoV-2 without the unacceptable consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine. This theory of viral inoculum and mild or asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 in light of population-level masking has received little attention so this is one of the first perspectives to discuss the evidence supporting this theory.","Gandhi, Monica; Beyrer, Chris; Goosby, Eric",J Gen Intern Med,330,12

This hypercoagulable state coming from the endothelial injury pones COVID-19 patients to a higher risk for thrombosis. COVID 19 diabetic patients are more exposed to peripheral vascular disease progression. Multilevel peripheral arterial disease is the main cause of critical limb ischemia. Vascular interventions are required to increase distal blood flow and reduce the risk of amputation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of complex revascularization in a diabetic patient with aggressive right foot lesions evolution after COVID-19 infection. The patient presenting a Peripheral arterial ischemic involving the infrarenal aorta, iliac, femoral. The simultaneous intervention consisted of an endovascular aortic stent-graft placement and angioplasty of femoral artery. DISCUSSION: Diabetes is a risk factor of severity and deaths in patients infected with pulmonary viruses. In our experience, COVID 19 virus can accelerate the ulcers generation and progression in diabetic patient. Hybrid interventions can be performed simultaneously or staged with benefit given by the complementary role of endovascular and surgical treatments. In the reported case, a complex simultaneous treatment in a patient presenting Multilevel peripheral arterial disease in association to COVID 19 infection was feasible in the same operation. CONCLUSION: Hybrid procedures are safe with high degree of efficacy in terms of revascularization, reduced morbidity and shorter intensive care. In our experience, the use of a hybrid procedure is technically feasible and allowed the treatment of complicated diabetic COVID-19 patient with a good outcome.","Dinoto, E; Pecoraro, F; Ferlito, F; Tortomasi, G; Mirabella, D; Bajardi, G",Int J Surg Case Rep,330,6

To evaluate the causal associations between various white blood cell traits and the COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, we conducted two-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses with summary statistics from the largest and most recent genome-wide association studies. Our MR results indicated causal protective effects of higher basophil count, basophil percentage of white blood cells, and myeloid white blood cell count on severe COVID-19, with odds ratios (OR) per standard deviation increment of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60-0.95), 0.70 (95% CI: 0.54-0.92), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73-0.98), respectively. Neither COVID-19 severity nor susceptibility was associated with white blood cell traits in our reverse MR results. Genetically predicted high basophil count, basophil percentage of white blood cells, and myeloid white blood cell count are associated with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with a lower genetic capacity for basophils are likely at risk, while enhancing the production of basophils may be an effective therapeutic strategy.","Sun, Yitang; Zhou, Jingqi; Ye, Kaixiong",,330,16

Further, latent information about an individual's mobility can be present in the mobility patterns of both social and non-social ties, a distinction that has not yet been addressed. Here we develop a""colocation""network to distinguish the mobility patterns of an ego's social ties from those of non-social colocators, individuals not socially connected to the ego but who nevertheless arrive at a location at the same time as the ego. We apply entropy and predictability measures to analyse and bound the predictive information of an individual's mobility pattern and the flow of that information from their top social ties and from their non-social colocators. While social ties generically provide more information than non-social colocators, we find that significant information is present in the aggregation of non-social colocators: 3-7 colocators can provide as much predictive information as the top social tie, and colocators can replace up to 85% of the predictive information about an ego, compared with social ties that can replace up to 94% of the ego's predictability. The presence of predictive information among non-social colocators raises privacy concerns: given the increasing availability of real-time mobility traces from smartphones, individuals sharing data may be providing actionable information not just about their own movements but the movements of others whose data are absent, both known and unknown individuals.","Chen, Zexun; Kelty, Sean; Welles, Brooke Foucault; Bagrow, James P.; Menezes, Ronaldo; Ghoshal, Gourab",,330,20

Purpose To review the MRI findings associated with acute neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted between March 23 and May 7, 2020 at the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, a reference center for COVID-19 in the Paris area. Inclusion criteria were: adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, presenting with acute neurological manifestations and referred for a brain MRI examination. Patients were excluded if they had a previous history of neurological disease. The characteristics and the frequency of different MRI features were investigated. The findings were analyzed separately in patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other departments (non-ICU). Results During the inclusion period, 1176 consecutive patients were hospitalized for suspected COVID-19. Out of 308 patients with acute neurological symptoms, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria (23.7%) and were included: 35 ICU patients (47.9%) and 38 non-ICU patients (52.1%). The mean age was 58.5 ± 15.6 years, with a male predominance (65.8% vs. 34.2%). Forty-three patients presented pathological MRI findings 2-4 weeks after symptom onset (58.9%), including 17 with acute ischemic infarct (23.3%), 1 with a deep venous thrombosis (1.4%), 8 with multiple microhemorrhages (11.3%), 22 with perfusion abnormalities (47.7%), 3 with restricted diffusion foci within the corpus callosum consistent with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC, 4.1%). Multifocal white matter enhancing lesions were seen in 4 ICU patients (5%). Basal ganglia abnormalities were seen in 4 other patients (5%). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all tested patients (n=39). Conclusion In addition to cerebrovascular lesions, perfusion abnormalities, CLOCC and ICU-related complications, we identified two patterns including white matter enhancing lesions and basal ganglia abnormalities that could be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chougar, Lydia; Shor, Natalia; Weiss, Nicolas; Galanaud, Damien; Leclercq, Delphine; Mathon, Bertrand; Belkacem, Samia; Stroër, Sebastian; Burrel, Sonia; Boutolleau, David; Demoule, Alexandre; Rosso, Charlotte; Delorme, Cécile; Seilhean, Danielle; Dormont, Didier; Morawiec, Elise; Raux, Mathieu; Demeret, Sophie; Gerber, Sophie; Trunet, Stéphanie; Similowski, Thomas; Degos, Vincent; Rufat, Pierre; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Lehéricy, Stéphane; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya",Radiology,330,14

Concerns limiting lung transplantation include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and the potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Importantly, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to those of transplant. Here, we report the results of lung transplantation in three patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. We performed single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in explanted lung tissue from the three patients and in additional control lung tissue samples. We conducted extracellular matrix imaging and single cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue from the three patients who underwent transplantation and on warm post-mortem lung biopsies from two patients who had died from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Lungs from these five patients with prolonged COVID-19 disease were free of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by smFISH, but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis that resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Using machine learning, we compared single cell RNA sequencing data from the lungs of patients with late stage COVID-19 to that from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and identified similarities in gene expression across cell lineages. Our findings suggest that some patients with severe COVID-19 develop fibrotic lung disease for which lung transplantation is their only option for survival.","Bharat, Ankit; Querrey, Melissa; Markov, Nikolay S; Kim, Samuel; Kurihara, Chitaru; Garza-Castillon, Rafael; Manerikar, Adwaiy; Shilatifard, Ali; Tomic, Rade; Politanska, Yuliya; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Yeldandi, Anjana V; Lomasney, Jon W; Misharin, Alexander V; Budinger, G R Scott",Sci. transl. med,330,29

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We queried the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as of February 12th, 2021. All urologic symptoms were isolated and the reported adverse events associated with each symptom were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described urologic symptoms. A total of 156 urologic symptoms were described amongst the 113 adverse event reports. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the Moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. These symptoms were grouped into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n = 34, 22%), Hematuria (n = 22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n = 41, 26%), Skin and/or Soft Tissue (n = 16, 10%), and Other (n = 43, 28%). The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96) and 54% of the patients were female. CONCLUSION: Urologic symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Given the common prevalence of many of these reported symptoms in the general population, there does not appear to be a correlation between vaccination and urologic symptoms, but as the vaccination criteria expands, further monitoring of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is needed.","Zhao, Hanson; Souders, Colby; Carmel, Maude; Anger, Jennifer T",Urology,330,14

However, the exact mechanism underlying this remains unclear. To examine the relationship between air pollution and AD, a clinical, histological, and genetic analysis was performed on particulate matter (PM)-exposed mice. Five-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (control group, ovalbumin (OVA) group, PM group, OVA + PM group; n = 6) and treated with OVA or PM10, alone or together. Cutaneous exposure to OVA and PM10 alone resulted in a significant increase in skin severity scores, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and epidermal thickness compared to the control group at Week 6. The findings were further accentuated in the OVA + PM group showing statistical significance over the OVA group. A total of 635, 501, and 2149 genes were found to be differentially expressed following OVA, PM10, and OVA + PM10 exposure, respectively. Strongly upregulated genes included RNASE2A, S100A9, SPRR2D, THRSP, SPRR2A1 (OVA vs. control), SPRR2D, S100A9, STFA3, CHIL1, DBP, IL1B (PM vs. control) and S100A9, SPRR2D, SPRR2B, S100A8, SPRR2A3 (OVA + PM vs. control). In comparing the groups OVA + PM with OVA, 818 genes were differentially expressed with S100A9, SPRR2B, SAA3, S100A8, SPRR2D being the most highly upregulated in the OVA + PM group. Taken together, our study demonstrates that PM10 exposure induces/aggravates skin inflammation via the differential expression of genes controlling skin barrier integrity and immune response. We provide evidence on the importance of public awareness in PM-associated skin inflammation. Vigilant attention should be paid to all individuals, especially to those with AD.","Woo, Yu Ri; Park, Seo-Yeon; Choi, Keonwoo; Hong, Eun Sun; Kim, Sungjoo; Kim, Hei Sung",,330,16

METHODS: This is a descriptive study. A total of 735 people consisting of 426 health sector employees and 309 service sector employees, constituted the study sample. In this study, the data were collected using the personal information form and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A regression model was established to test the effect of socio-demographic characteristics on depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: While there was no difference in working a second job across different sectors (p = 0.450), the household income (p < 0.001) and the increase in expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.001) were different across the sectors. The scores of the overall scale and its sub-dimensions were significantly different across the sectors (p < 0.001). The DASS-21 scores were higher in the participants, who started to smoke more and who had their sleep duration decreased (p < 0.001). There is a statistically significant difference between social media use and the DASS-21 score (p < 0.001). There is a significant difference across all DASS-21 subgroups by the daily working hours in the health sector (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study provides significant findings regarding the mental health of individuals who continued working during the pandemic. To implement effective mental health interventions to risk groups and affected people in the COVID-19 pandemic, the recommendations of leading organizations, including WHO and ILO, should be implemented effectively concerning occupational health.","Kabasakal, Esma; Özpulat, Funda; Akca, Aysegül; Özcebe, L Hilal",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,330,16

METHODS: Based on the infectivity and hospital requirements of COVID-19, a new simple respirator was designed by the medical staff of the Department of Anesthesiology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, which was applied on the 22 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who needed oxygen therapy admitted to the Cancer Center of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from February 15th to March 15th in 2020. The new simple respirator contained two National Utility Model Patents (a respirator: ZL 2015 2 0410623.6, a fluid switch and oxygen suction device: ZL 2017 2 0873509.6), which was mainly composed of anesthesia mask and filter, L-shaped connecting tube, soft breathing bladder, connecting tube and elastic fixing belt. When in use, the anesthesia mask was fixed to the patient's mouth and nose with elastic straps, the connecting tube was inserted into the oxygen meter interface, the oxygen flow was adjusted to 6-10 L/min, and the L-shaped connecting tube was opened immediately after the soft breathing bag was full. The carbon dioxide and excess oxygen in the body was discharged from exhaust port. The oxygen flow was lowered to 2-3 L/min, the patient's respiratory rate (RR) was observed through the soft breathing bag fluctuations, and the oxygen flow was adjusted at any time. The changes of pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), RR and heart rate (HR) before and after application of new simple respirator were observed, and the blood gas test results of part of the patients were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with severe and critical COVID-19 had significantly higher SpO2 at 10 minutes after application of the new simple ventilator than before application (0.994±0.007 vs. 0.952±0.017, P < 0.01), and RR was significantly lower than that before application (times/min: 27.59±3.63 vs. 29.64±3.81, P < 0.01); after 1 day of application, each index was further improved. All 13 patients who received blood gas analysis indicated no carbon dioxide accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The new simple respirator can significantly improve the oxygen therapy effect of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. At the same time, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can be filtered through the filter to reduce the formation of aerosol and protect the medical staff and patients.","Hua, Fuzhou; Wang, Xifeng; Huang, Xiangfei; Xiao, Fan; Wei, Gen; Ying, Jun; Guo, Lian; Hu, Qian; He, Xianju; Yu, Shuchun; Xu, Guohai; Xu, Jianjun",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,330,27

Prior work has considered extracting document-level entity clusters and relations end-to-end from raw scientific text, which can improve literature search and help identify methods and materials for a given problem. Despite the importance of this task, most existing works on scientific information extraction (SciIE) consider extraction solely based on the content of an individual paper, without considering the paper's place in the broader literature. In contrast to prior work, we augment our text representations by leveraging a complementary source of document context: the citation graph of referential links between citing and cited papers. On a test set of English-language scientific documents, we show that simple ways of utilizing the structure and content of the citation graph can each lead to significant gains in different scientific information extraction tasks. When these tasks are combined, we observe a sizable improvement in end-to-end information extraction over the state-of-the-art, suggesting the potential for future work along this direction.

Highly pathogenic coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) in humans. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infects mice and serves as an ideal model of viral pathogenesis, mainly because experiments can be conducted using animal-biosafety level-2 (A-BSL2) containment. Human thymosin beta-4 (Tß4), a 43-residue peptide with an acetylated N-terminus, is widely expressed in human tissues. Tß4 regulates actin polymerization and functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and an antioxidant as well as a promoter of wound healing and angiogenesis. These activities led us to test whether Tß4 serves to treat coronavirus infections of humans. To test this possibility, here, we established a BALB/c mouse model of coronavirus infection using mouse CoV MHV-A59 to evaluate the potential protective effect of recombinant human Tß4 (rhTß4). Such a system can be employed under A-BSL2 containment instead of A-BSL3 that is required to study coronaviruses infectious for humans. We found that rhTß4 significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-A59 through inhibiting virus replication, balancing the host's immune response, alleviating pathological damage, and promoting repair of the liver. These results will serve as the basis for further application of rhTß4 to the treatment of human CoV diseases such as COVID-19.","Yu, Rui; Mao, Yunyun; Li, Kai; Zhai, Yanfang; Zhang, Yue; Liu, Shuling; Gao, Yuemei; Chen, Zhengshan; Liu, Yanhong; Fang, Ting; Zhao, Mengsu; Li, Ruihua; Xu, Junjie; Chen, Wei",Mediators Inflamm,330,16

It involves atrophy of the frontal and temporal regions of the brain affecting language, memory, and behavior. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is found in most FTD and ALS cases. It plays a role in transcription, translation and serves as a shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Prior to its aggregation, TDP-43 exists as polyubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated C-terminal fragments that correlate well with FTD disease progression. Because of the importance of TDP-43 in these diseases, reagents that can selectively recognize specific toxic TDP variants associated with onset and progression of FTD can be effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools. RESULTS: We utilized a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) based biopanning protocol to isolate single chain variable fragments (scFvs) from a phage display library that selectively bind TDP variants present in human FTD but not cognitively normal age matched brain tissue. We then used the scFvs (FTD-TDP1 through 5) to probe post-mortem brain tissue and sera samples for the presence of FTD related TDP variants. The scFvs readily selected the FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls. The scFvs were used in immunohistochemical analysis of FTD and control brain slices where the reagents showed strong staining with TDP in FTD brain tissue slice. FTD-TDP1, FTD-TDP2, FTD-TDP4 and FTD-TDP5 all protected neuronal cells against FTD TDP induced toxicity suggesting potential therapeutic value. CONCLUSIONS: These results show existence of different disease specific TDP variants in FTD individuals. We have identified a panel of scFvs capable of recognizing these disease specific TDP variants in postmortem FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls and can thus serve as a biomarker tool.","Venkataraman, Lalitha; He, Ping; Khan, Galam; Harris, Brent T; Sierks, Michael R",BMC Neurosci,330,16

The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (GenScript) is the first such commercially available assay that detects antibodies that block receptor-binding domain (RBD)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared with anti-RBD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). METHODS: Serum reference panels comprising 205 specimens were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization (PLV) assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Compared with PRNT-50, cPass sensitivity ranged from 77% to 100% and specificity was 95% to 100%. Sensitivity was also high compared with the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay (93%;95% confidence interval [CI], 85-97), but specificity was lower (58%;95% CI, 48-67). Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG (r = 0.823). Against the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, anti-RBD IgG sensitivity (99%;95% CI, 94-100) was very similar to that of cPass, but overall specificity was lower (37%;95% CI, 28-47). Against PRNT-50, results of cPass and anti-RBD IgG were nearly identical. CONCLUSIONS: The added value of cPass compared with an IgG anti-RBD ELISA was modest.","Papenburg, J.; Cheng, M.

Artemisinin-containing combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarials known. WHO recommends 7-day quinine therapy for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the first trimester despite the superior tolerability and efficacy of 3-day ACT regimens because artemisinins caused embryolethality and/or cardiovascular malformations at relatively low doses in rats, rabbits, and monkeys. The developmental toxicity of artesunate, artemether, and DHA were similar in rats but artesunate was embryotoxic at lower doses in rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) than artemether (no effect level = 25 mg/kg/day). In clinical studies in Africa, treatment with artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester was observed to be highly efficacious and the miscarriage rate (&#8804;3.1%) was similar to no antimalarial treatment (2.6%). When data from the first-trimester use of largely artesunate-based therapies in Thailand were pooled together, there was no difference in miscarriage rate compared to quinine. However, individually, artesunate-mefloquine was associated with a higher miscarriage rate (15/71 = 21%) compared to other artemisinin-based therapies including 7-day artesunate + clindamycin (2/50 = 4%) and quinine (92/842 = 11%). Thus, appropriate statistical comparisons of individual ACT groups are needed prior to assuming that they all have the same risk for developmental toxicity.

Experimental and acute exposure studies suggest that cadmium and lead individually affect red blood cell production; however, associations between environmental exposures and RDW have not been explored. We evaluated relationships of environmental cadmium and lead exposures to RDW. We used data from 24,607 participants aged &#8805;20 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2016) with information on blood concentrations of cadmium and lead, RDW and socio-demographic factors. In models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status and serum cotinine, RDW was increasingly elevated across progressively higher quartiles of blood cadmium concentration. A doubling of cadmium concentration was associated with 0.16 higher RDW (95% CI: 0.14, 0.18) and a doubling of lead concentration with 0.04 higher RDW (95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). Also, higher cadmium and lead concentrations were associated with increased odds of high RDW (RDW>14.8%). The associations were more pronounced in women and those with low-to-normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and held even after controlling for iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies. In analysis including both metals, cadmium remained associated with RDW, whereas the corresponding association for lead was substantially attenuated. In this general population sample, blood cadmium and lead exposures were positively associated with RDW. The associations may indicate hemolytic or erythropoietic mechanisms by which exposure increases mortality risk.","Peters, Junenette L; Perry, Melissa J; McNeely, Eileen; Wright, Robert O; Heiger-Bernays, Wendy; Weuve, Jennifer",PLoS One,330,15

The city's public health system, New York City Health + Hospitals, has been key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population is disproportionately affected by the disease. As the number of cases rose in the city, NYC Health + Hospitals carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary intensive care unit (ICU) spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, and new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments, procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and Department of Defense medical personnel. Supplies needed to deliver critical care were monitored closely and replenished to prevent interruptions. An emergency department action team was formed to ensure that the experience of front-line providers was informing network-level decisions. The steps taken by NYC Health + Hospitals greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.","Uppal, Amit; Silvestri, David M; Siegler, Matthew; Natsui, Shaw; Boudourakis, Leon; Salway, R James; Parikh, Manish; Agoritsas, Konstantinos; Cho, Hyung J; Gulati, Rajneesh; Nunez, Milton; Hulbanni, Anjali; Flaherty, Christine; Iavicoli, Laura; Cineas, Natalia; Kanter, Marc; Kessler, Stuart; Rhodes, Karin V; Bouton, Michael; Wei, Eric K",Health Aff (Millwood),330,2

Hence, the Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis (TEAMS) study aims to provide patient-centered, coordinated care by implementing a 12-week complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention for adults with MS. However, due to the societal impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-March 2020, the University of Alabama at Birmingham announced a limited business model halting all nonessential research requiring on-site visits, which includes the TEAMS study. OBJECTIVE: In compliance with the shelter-in-place policy and quarantine guidance, a modified testing and training protocol was developed to allow participants to continue the study. METHODS: The modified protocol, which replaces on-site data collection and training procedures, includes a teleassessment package (computer tablet, blood pressure cuff, hand dynamometer, mini disc cone, measuring tape, an 8"" step, and a large-print 8"" × 11"" paper with ruler metrics and wall-safe tape) and a virtual meeting platform for synchronous interactive training between the therapist and the participant. The teleassessment measures include resting blood pressure and heart rate, grip strength, Five Times Sit to Stand, Timed Up & Go, and the Berg Balance Scale. The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. RESULTS: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments. A modified analysis plan will include sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the study results in the presence of uncertainty and protocol deviations. Study results are projected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This modified remote teleassessment/teletraining protocol will impact a large number of participants with MS who would otherwise have been discontinued from the study.

According to the initial observation, it is concluded that the cocurricular implementation in the full-day school is not optimal. This is because of a lack of school preparation in designing the co-curricular program and its auxiliaries. An alternative offered by researchers to overcome the problem is by designing the Mathematics Club program as well as its module as the teaching module.

Many hypotheses have been presented to explain the pathologic hypercoagulability seen in these patients. It has been difficult to determine how each potential risk factor contributes to the development of thrombotic complications, however. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have underlying medical conditions, and the illness affects multiple organs. The use of various therapeutic modalities to mitigate the systemic effects of the illness can further obscure the direct effects of COVID-19. At this time, physicians are searching for ways to predict which patients with COVID-19 are most likely to be affected by thrombosis. Identifying them is important because aggressive VTE prophylaxis may increase the rates of major bleeding complications and mortality, even as it reduces thrombogenesis. The concept of individualizing the dosing of low-molecular-weight heparin according to the severity of each patient's COVID-19 clinical status is emerging, and adaptive therapeutic trials are in progress. Until results are available, however, it is important to recognize potential risk factors for thrombosis. The following observational studies from the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting provide some insights on how to accomplish this.","Kessler, C.

Consequently, half way through the second semester of the academic year 2019/2020, learning methods were delivered through distance learning (DL). We aimed to evaluate the student perspective of DL compared to classroom learning (CL) in the undergraduate dentistry study program at the Faculty of Dentistry Universitas Indonesia. METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent at the end of the semester. A total of 301 students participated in the study. RESULTS: Duration of study influenced student preference. Higher number of first-year students preferred DL compared to their seniors (p < 0.001). Students preferred CL for group discussion, as DL resulted in more difficult communication and gave less learning satisfaction. Only 44.2% students preferred DL over CL, although they agreed that DL gave a more efficient learning method (52.6%), it provided more time to study (87.9%) and to review study materials (87.3%). Challenges during DL included external factors such as unstable internet connection, extra financial burden for the internet quota and internal factors such as time management and difficulty to focus while learning online for a longer period of time. CONCLUSION: Despite some challenges, dental students could adapt to the new learning methods of full DL and the majorities agreed blended learning that combined classroom and distance learning can be implemented henceforth. This current COVID-19 pandemic, changes not only the utilization of technology in education but the pedagogy strategies in the future.","Amir, Lisa R; Tanti, Ira; Maharani, Diah Ayu; Wimardhani, Yuniardini Septorini; Julia, Vera; Sulijaya, Benso; Puspitawati, Ria",BMC Med Educ,330,26

Protein p7 of CFSV is a prototype of viroporin, a family of small, highly hydrophobic proteins postulated to modulate virus-host interactions during the processes of virus entry, replication and assembly. It has been shown that CSFV p7 displays substantial ion channel activity when incorporated into membrane systems, but a deep rationalization of the size and dynamics of the induced pores is yet to emerge. Here, we use high-resolution conductance measurements and current fluctuation analysis to demonstrate that CSFV p7 channels are ruled by equilibrium conformational dynamics involving protein-lipid interactions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirms the existence of a variety of pore sizes and their tight regulation by solution pH. We conclude that p7 viroporin forms subnanometric channels involved in virus propagation, but also much larger pores (1-10 nm in diameter) with potentially significant roles in virus pathogenicity. Our findings provide new insights into the sources of noise in protein electrochemistry and demonstrate the existence of slow complex dynamics characteristic of crowded systems like biomembrane surfaces.","Largo, Eneko; Queralt-Martín, María; Carravilla, Pablo; Nieva, José L; Alcaraz, Antonio",Bioelectrochemistry,330,24

In Africa, 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 deaths have been reported as of 02 June 2020. The five countries with the highest commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Ghana. Africa, and the rest of world, has had to swiftly undertake the necessary measures to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor reporting systems, and insufficient numbers of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to most African countries, from cities to rural areas, and has created a strong demand on already scarce resources. Intense mobilization of additional resources is required to implement established emergency contingency measures. Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include closure of borders and restricting movement of people within a country; this has resulted in the tourism sector being adversely affected by the loss of income. Cooperative prevention and control measures are one of the promising solutions to deplete the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.","Rutayisire, Erigene; Nkundimana, Gerard; Mitonga, Honore K; Boye, Alex; Nikwigize, Solange",Int J Infect Dis,330,20

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of all published papers on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnant women in Saudi Arabia to identify knowledge gaps. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on the PRISMA system. The search included all papers which were published between September 1, 2012 and November 29, 2020 on pregnant women with MERS-CoV and/ or COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Of 26 papers screened, five were included in the analysis. Results: A total of 11 pregnant women with MERS-CoV and four with COVID-19 were reported in Saudi Arabia in the medical literature during the review period. The mean ages of the women were 33 and 31 years old for MERS-CoV and COVID-19, respectively. Maternal and fetal mortality in cases of MERS-CoV were 35% and 30%, respectively, while no maternal or fetal mortalities were reported in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Very limited data has emerged from Saudi Arabia on pregnant women MERS-CoV and COVID-19. With such high mortality observed with MERS-CoV compared to COVID-19, there is a need for greater reporting of cases to truly grasp the extent of these infections in pregnant women in a country where both coronaviruses are circulating.","Barry, M.; Barry, M.

Having as a starting point the assumption that for maximizers choice is constitutive of identity, this research proposes that maximizing is associated with search for existential meaning in life. In turn, maximizers' propensity to search for meaning is associated with a higher susceptibility to experience reactance when their freedom of choice is restricted, which is further associated with higher engagement in online shopping during lockdown presumably as a means to combat reactance and restore choice freedom. Using the lockdown in spring 2020 as a naturalistic context to study consumer responses to restrictions of choice freedom, results of an online study in Austria support these predictions. These findings advance a view of maximizers as ""lay existentialists,"" who view choice as a meaning-making device that is tightly linked to their sense of identity. As a result, when their choice freedom is threatened, maximizers may respond with higher reactance and engage in restorative actions.","Kokkoris, Michail D",Front Psychol,330,30

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Telemedicine clinic at a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia. PARTICIPANTS: 337 patients with acute COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included intake visit more than 10 days after symptom onset and hospitalisation prior to intake visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptom duration in days. RESULTS: Common symptoms at intake visit are upper respiratory (73% cough, 55% loss of smell or taste, 57% sinus congestion, 32% sore throat) and systemic (66% headache, 64% body aches, 53% chills, 30% dizziness, 36% fever). Day of symptom onset was earliest for systemic and upper respiratory symptoms (median onset day 1 for both), followed by lower respiratory symptoms (day 3, 95% CI 2 to 4), with later onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (day 4, 95% CI 3 to 5), when present. Cough had the longest duration when present with median 17 days (95% CI 15 to 21), with 42% not resolved at final visit. Loss of smell or taste had the second longest duration with 14 days (95% CI 12 to 17), with 38% not resolved at final visit. Initial symptom severity is a significant predictor of symptom duration (p<0.01 for multiple symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 illness in outpatients follows a pattern of progression from systemic symptoms to lower respiratory symptoms and persistent symptoms are common across categories.

The main objective of the study was to explore factors that contribute the microclimate formation in connection with the changes that the formal postsecondary education undergoes because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and sixty-six students of several higher education institutions in Rostov-on-Don, Russia took part in the study. To fulfill the study objective, data about various individual characteristics of participating students and their subjective rating of the psychological microclimate in the respective student groups were collected by means of psychological testing and subjected first to the ANOVA and then to the multiple regression analyses. ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences across instructional formats either in the microclimate scores or in the respondents' psychological characteristics. The follow-up multiple regression analysis explored models of joint contribution of the predictor variables to the formation of the microclimate in student groups. Specifically, it found that the relationship between the microclimate and emotional tone is negative, whereas generosity and leadership inclinations are positive predictors of the psychological microclimate in student groups. Better understanding what factors determine dynamic interactions among students in various instructional formats could be instrumental in optimizing microclimate in students group, undoubtedly affected by rather dramatic changes in all aspects of our social lives, caused by the current epidemiological situation in the world. Psychological microclimate in a group is, in turn, capable of seriously impacting on students' learning performance and psychological wellbeing. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Dikaya, L.; Shipitko, O.; Borokhovski, E.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",330,27

(2) Does a respondent's opinion (belief) about the city as a living environment influence the assessment of the city in which the respondent lives? (3) Do factors describing the mobility of city inhabitants influence the quality of life? We revealed that the demographic characteristics of residents are to varying degrees related to the assessment of the attractiveness of the city Gender of respondents has no significant influence on the assessment of the city and current place of residence, while age and educational level of education are important for this assessment The older is the respondent, the lower is their assessment of the city Simultaneously, the higher is the educational level, the higher is the propensity to assess the attractiveness of the city The analysis of mobility revealed that not all examined mobility elements will equally improve the quality of life (measured by the assessment of the place of residence) Out of the 7 factors identified in the study, only 3 turned out to be statistically significant Therefore, it can be concluded that these factors improve the quality of life of city residents © 2020 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences All rights reserved","Szołtysek, J.; Otręba, R.",Economy of Region,330,24

To predict the effect of a change in t&#945; on the course of the pandemic. To evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the model in response to a change in the input parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Start parameters for the modified Bateman SIZ model were obtained from observational data published by the Robert-Koch-Institute in Berlin for the period June 1 to July 13, 2020. The robustness and sensitivity of the model were determined by changing the input parameter for the doubling-time (t&#945;) by ± 5% and ± 10%. RESULTS: The predictions show that small changes, ± 5%, in the doubling-time, t&#945; for the rate of increase in the number of new infections, can have a major effect, both positive and negative, on the course of the pandemic. The model predicted that the number of persons infected with the virus would reach 1 million within 8 years. A 5% longer t&#945; would reduce the number of infected persons by ~ 75%. In contrast, a 5% shorter doubling-time would increase the number of infections over 8 years to ~ 9 million when the number of infectious persons would exceed 100,000 at the end of 2022. The pandemic is predicted to have disappeared by the end of 2024. DISCUSSION: Predictions for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany based on the status quo up to July 13, 2020 have been obtained using the modified Bateman SIZ model. There are several important assumptions necessary to apply the model and thus the results must be interpreted with caution. The model, previously used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Heidelberg (pop. 166,000) gives comparable predictive data for the whole of Germany (pop. 83 million) and thus appears to be both sensitive and robust. CONCLUSION: Since a shorter doubling-time for the number of infectious persons by only 5% would result in a major clinical emergency, interventional measures such as vaccination are urgently needed. Taking into consideration that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not yet available and the efficacy of the Corona-Warn-App has yet to be shown, a relaxation in the lockdown conditions in Germany in 2020 appears premature.","Braun, Peter; Haffner, Steffen; Aguirre Davila, Lukas; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,330,16

SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 may increase ectodomain shedding but consequences for the renin-angiotensin system and pathology in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. We measured soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sACE levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 114 hospital-treated COVID-19 patients compared with 10 healthy controls; follow-up samples after four months were analyzed for 58 patients. Associations between sACE2 respectively sACE and risk factors for severe COVID-19, outcome, and inflammatory markers were investigated. Levels of sACE2 were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, median 5.0 (interquartile range 2.8-11.8) ng/ml versus 1.4 (1.1-1.6) ng/ml, p < .0001. sACE2 was higher in men than women but was not affected by other risk factors for severe COVID-19. sACE2 decreased to 2.3 (1.6-3.9) ng/ml at follow-up, p < .0001, but remained higher than in healthy controls, p = .012. sACE was marginally lower during COVID-19 compared with at follow-up, 57 (45-70) ng/ml versus 72 (52-87) ng/ml, p = .008. Levels of sACE2 and sACE did not differ depending on survival or disease severity. sACE2 during COVID-19 correlated with von Willebrand factor, factor VIII and D-dimer, while sACE correlated with interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Conclusions: sACE2 was transiently elevated in COVID-19, likely due to increased shedding from infected cells. sACE2 and sACE during COVID-19 differed in correlations with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting release from different cell types and/or vascular beds.","Lundström, Annika; Ziegler, Louise; Havervall, Sebastian; Rudberg, Ann-Sofie; von Meijenfeldt, Fien; Lisman, Ton; Mackman, Nigel; Sandén, Per; Thålin, Charlotte",J Med Virol,330,20

The U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain (USPSC) has diversified and now relies on international sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products (FDPs). Despite years of effort raising concerns about the USPSC, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians continue to spend a substantial amount of time and energy responding to, and mitigating the impact of, medication shortages, drug recalls, and the adverse outcomes related to low-quality medications. The extent of U.S. reliance on foreign sources of medications is largely unknown. Pharmacists do not have a reliable way to determine the country of origin (i.e., source), capacity, or geographic location of pharmaceutical manufacturers, limiting our ability to anticipate challenges or mitigate risks to our Nation's drug supply. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's task of regulating quality and safety is challenging and will likely require additional safeguards and resources. In addition to pharmacists' engagement, solutions will likely need to leverage a mix of policy, economic incentives, and expanded objective surveillance testing. The U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, global, and goes beyond FDPs. The 2020 American Pharmacists Association House of Delegates has rightly asserted that ""The quality and safety of pharmaceutical and other medical products and the global pharmaceutical and medical product supply chain are essential to the United States national security and public health."" Pharmacy professionals on the front line engage with patients, identify medication-related issues, and engage in drug-procurement decisions.

DESIGN: We collected and sequenced 392 tongue-coating samples, 172 faecal samples and 155 serum samples from Central China and East China. We characterised microbiome and lipid molecules, constructed microbial classifiers in discovery cohort and verified their diagnostic potential in 74 confirmed patients (CPs) from East China and 37 suspected patients (SPs) with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Oral and faecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in CPs versus healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, butyric acid-producing bacteria were decreased and lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria were increased in CPs in oral cavity. The classifiers based on 8 optimal oral microbial markers (7 faecal microbial markers) achieved good diagnostic efficiency in different cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic efficacy reached 87.24% in the cross-regional cohort. Moreover, the classifiers successfully diagnosed SPs with IgG antibody positivity as CPs, and diagnostic efficacy reached 92.11% (98.01% of faecal microbiome). Compared with CPs, 47 lipid molecules, including sphingomyelin (SM)(d40:4), SM(d38:5) and monoglyceride(33:5), were depleted, and 122 lipid molecules, including phosphatidylcholine(36:4p), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0p/20:5) and diglyceride(20:1/18:2), were enriched in confirmed patients recovery. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterise the oral microbiome in COVID-19, and oral microbiomes and lipid alterations in recovered patients, to explore their correlations and to report the successful establishment and validation of a diagnostic model for COVID-19.","Ren, Zhigang; Wang, Haiyu; Cui, Guangying; Lu, Haifeng; Wang, Ling; Luo, Hong; Chen, Xinhua; Ren, Hongyan; Sun, Ranran; Liu, Wenli; Liu, Xiaorui; Liu, Chao; Li, Ang; Wang, Xuemei; Rao, Benchen; Yuan, Chengyu; Zhang, Hua; Sun, Jiarui; Chen, Xiaolong; Li, Bingjie; Hu, Chuansong; Wu, Zhongwen; Yu, Zujiang; Kan, Quancheng; Li, Lanjuan",Gut,330,16

Till now, there is no drug molecule that has been convincingly identified as the inhibitor of the function of this protein. The current pandemic situation demands a shortcut to quickly reach to a lead compound or a drug, which may not be the best but might serve as an interim solution at least. Following this notion, the present investigation uses virtual screening to find a molecule which is alraedy approved as a drug for some other disease but could be repurposed to inhibit Mpro. The potential of the present method of work to identify such a molecule, which otherwise would have been missed out, lies in the fact that instead of just using the crystallographically identified conformation of the receptor's ligand binding pocket, molecular dynamics generated ensemble of conformations has been used. It implicitly included the possibilities of ""induced-fit"" and/or ""population shift"" mechanisms of ligand fitting. As a result, the investigation has not only identified antiviral drugs like ribavirin, ritonavir, etc., but it has also captured a wide variety of drugs for various other diseases like amrubicin, cangrelor, desmopressin, diosmin, etc. as the potent possibilities. Some of these ligands are versatile to form stable interactions with various different conformations of the receptor and therefore have been statistically surfaced in the investigation. Overall the investigation offers a wide range of compounds for further testing to confirm their scopes of applications to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Paul, Debarati; Basu, Debadrita; Ghosh Dastidar, Shubhra",J Mol Model,330,16

Here we use a multiscale computational approach to investigate the PT thermodynamics in the apo enzyme and in complex with two potent inhibitors, N3 and the &#945;-ketoamide 13b. We show that with the inhibitors the free energy cost to reach the charge-separated state of the active-site dyad is lower, with N3 inducing the most significant reduction. We also show that a few key sites (including specific water molecules) significantly enhance or reduce the thermodynamic feasibility of the PT reaction, with selective desolvation of the active site playing a crucial role. The approach presented is a cost-effective procedure to identify the enzyme regions that control the activation of the catalytic reaction and is thus also useful to guide the design of inhibitors.","Zanetti-Polzi, Laura; Smith, Micholas Dean; Chipot, Chris; Gumbart, James C; Lynch, Diane L; Pavlova, Anna; Smith, Jeremy C; Daidone, Isabella",J Phys Chem Lett,330,10

We hoped to find if patient compliance could be maintained and to determine the anatomical and functional consequences of consistent mask wear. While this study was ongoing, COVID-19 impacted on normal eye clinic practice, allowing an unexpected analysis of the effects of this disruption to the clinical system on mask wear and disease progress. Throughout the whole study, outcomes were positive, with a high level of consistent patient use of the mask, above 74% up to and beyond 1 year.

First identified in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is affecting more than 185 countries and territories around the world, with more than 15,754,651 confirmed cases and more than 640,029 deaths. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US). As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths.

The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality. Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential. Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable. Societal and cultural barriers for ethnic minorities to achieve health equity are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies, producing long-overdue, substantive changes to end health care inequities.","Alcendor, Donald J.",J.

Recent reports showed that children with KD-like disease from KD low prevalence regions had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology despite a negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples. OBJECTIVES: To describe 3 pediatric Kawasaki Disease patients with false positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively recruited children with KD diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results including SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were retrieved. We performed a microparticle-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and a microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Three Chinese children with typical KD were identified. They had no epidemiological links with COVID-19 patients and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPA PCR. They were treated with IVIG and aspirin, and were discharged without complications. Subsequently 2 of them were tested positive against anti-RBD and anti-NP antibodies and 1 was tested positive against anti- RBD antibodies. However, microneutralization assay showed that neutralizing antibodies were absent, suggesting a false-positive IgG result. CONCLUSION: Detection of neutralizing antibodies is recommended to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in IgG-positive but PCR-negative patients.","To, Kelvin Kw; Chua, Gilbert T; Kwok, Ka Li; Wong, Joshua Sc; Au, Dennis Chi Yu; Lam, Yuen Yu; Wong, Wilfred Hs; Ho, Marco Hk; Chan, Godfrey Cf; Chui, Celine Sl; Li, Xue; Tung, Keith Ts; Wong, Rosa S; Tso, Winnie Wy; Wong, Ian Ck; Wong, Christina Sm; Fong, Carol Hy; Chan, Kwok Hung; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Ip, Patrick; Kwan, Mike Yw",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,330,26

Objective: To assess patterns of telehealth use across surgical specialties before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Insurance claims from a Michigan statewide commercial payer for new patient visits with a surgeon from 1 of 9 surgical specialties during one of the following periods: prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (period 1: January 5 to March 7, 2020), early pandemic (period 2: March 8 to June 6, 2020), and late pandemic (period 3: June 7 to September 5, 2020). Exposures: Telehealth implementation owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Conversion rate defined as the rate of weekly new patient telehealth visits divided by mean weekly number of total new patient visits in 2019. This outcome adjusts for a substantial decrease in outpatient care during the pandemic. (2) Weekly number of new patient telehealth visits divided by weekly number of total new patient visits. Results: Among 4405 surgeons in the cohort, 2588 (58.8%) performed telehealth in any patient care context. Specifically for new patient visits, 1182 surgeons (26.8%) used telehealth. A total of 109 610 surgical new outpatient visits were identified during the pandemic. The median (interquartile range) age of telehealth patients was 46.8 (34.1-58.4) years compared with 52.6 (38.3-62.3) years for patients who received care in-person. Prior to March 2020, less than 1% (8 of 173â¯939) of new patient visits were conducted through telehealth. Telehealth use peaked in April 2020 (week 14) and facilitated 34.6% (479 of 1383) of all new patient visits during that week. The telehealth conversion rate peaked in April 2020 (week 15) and was equal to 8.2% of the 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volume. During period 2, a mean (SD) of 16.6% (12.0%) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 5.1% of 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volumes). During period 3, 3.0% (2168 of 71 819) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 2.5% of 2019 new patient visit volumes). Mean (SD) telehealth conversion rates varied by specialty with urology being the highest (14.3% [7.7%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Results from this study showed that telehealth use grew across all surgical specialties in Michigan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While rates of telehealth use have declined as in-person care has resumed, telehealth use remains substantially higher across all surgical specialties than it was prior to the pandemic.","Chao, Grace F; Li, Kathleen Y; Zhu, Ziwei; McCullough, Jeff; Thompson, Mike; Claflin, Jake; Fliegner, Maximilian; Steppe, Emma; Ryan, Andrew; Ellimoottil, Chad",JAMA surg.

DESIGN: A single-center, retrospective, observational study. SETTING: A newly built ICU in Tongji hospital (Sino-French new city campus), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-seven critical COVID-19 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into a myocardial injury group and nonmyocardial injury group according to the on-admission levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment, and clinical outcome were evaluated, stratified by the presence of myocardial injury on admission. Compared with nonmyocardial injury patients, patients with myocardial injury were older (68.4 ± 10.1 v 62.1 ± 13.5 years; pâ¯=â¯0.02), had higher prevalence of underlying CV disease (34.1% v 11.1%; pâ¯=â¯0.02), and in-ICU CV complications (41.5% v 13.9%; pâ¯=â¯0.008), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (20.3 ± 7.3 v 14.4 ± 7.4; pâ¯=â¯0.001), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (7, interquartile range (IQR) 5-10 v 5, IQR 3-6; p < 0.001).

The ability to attract, motivate and develop Talent management and retention of high performing employees is imperative for organisations to survive and thrive in today’s dynamic and volatile complex world of work. Studies reveal that employees’ intentions to stay or quit are influenced by the leadership behaviours of managers. Research purpose: The focus of this study was to identify the leadership behaviours that influence talent retention. Motivation for the study: To determine the leadership behaviour preferences of South African employees, as well as the extent to which these behaviours influence talent retention. Research approach/design and method: A quantitative research approach was adopted utilising a non-experimental comparative research design. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the nature of the underlying factor structure that emerged from the Leadership Behaviour Importance and Leadership Behaviour Experience scales respectively. Snowball convenience sampling was used, attracting 711 useable responses. Main findings: This study revealed that the retention of skilled, engaged employees requires leaders who can provide them with a sense of belonging, respect, empowerment, support their personal growth and development, and provide them with flexibility and freedom in executing their duties. Practical/managerial implications: Leaders need to demonstrate certain behaviours which include providing a sense of belonging, respect, empowerment, support for personal growth, flexibility and connecting at the human interface. This is important in an increasingly technology-driven world, and more recently, under the working conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is believed that the ability of leaders to connect at the human interface will continue to significantly influence talent retention, in the future. Contributions: This study will benefit future organisational leaders in better understanding the specific leadership behaviours that enhance talent retention and talent retention strategies.","Mey, Michelle R.; Poisat, Paul Stindt Carmen",SA Journal of Human Resource Management,330,30

High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality. RESULTS: We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone. AVAILABILITY: iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.

Research on young breast cancer survivors (diagnosed < 45 years old) are limited. METHODS: Young breast cancer survivors diagnosed between age 30 and 44, stage I-III, and treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital between 2012 and 2015 were included. Cardiovascular disease risk was estimated using excess heart age (calculated using age, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication, diabetes, smoking, body mass index) and examined at two time points: diagnosis and 2-year follow-up. Statistical analyses included within-group mean comparison tests and linear regression to examine predictors of excess heart age. RESULTS: A total of 152 young breast cancer survivors were included; 95 received anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, and 57 did not. Overall excess heart age was 4.2 at diagnosis and 5.4 years at 2-year follow-up (p = 0.08). Change in excess heart age from diagnosis to 2-year follow-up among those receiving or not receiving anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab was 4.3-4.4 years, p = 0.93; and 4.0-7.1 years, p < 0.01; respectively. Factors that predicted excess heart age included endocrine therapy (p = 0.049) and change from premenopausal to postmenopausal status (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Anthracyclines and trastuzumab were not predictors of excess heart age. Subclinical changes undetected by heart age may still occur. Future research is needed to evaluate heart age over longer follow-up and to develop a modified heart age tool, that incorporates treatment risk, that facilitates identification of high-risk cancer patients for early intervention in cardiac risk prevention.","Vo, Jacqueline B; Kenzik, Kelly M; Landier, Wendy; Raju, Dheeraj; Kirklin, James K; Meneses, Karen",Cancer causes control,330,24

METHODS: This prospective cross-over study quantitated the effects of wearing no mask (nm), a surgical mask (sm) and a FFP2/N95 mask (ffpm) in 12 healthy males (age 38.1 ± 6.2 years, BMI 24.5 ± 2.0 kg/m2). The 36 tests were performed in randomized order. The cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were monitored by ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. Ten domains of comfort/discomfort of wearing a mask were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: The pulmonary function parameters were significantly lower with mask (forced expiratory volume: 5.6 ± 1.0 vs 5.3 ± 0.8 vs 6.1 ± 1.0 l/s with sm, ffpm and nm, respectively; p = 0.001; peak expiratory flow: 8.7 ± 1.4 vs 7.5 ± 1.1 vs 9.7 ± 1.6 l/s; p < 0.001). The maximum power was 269 ± 45, 263 ± 42 and 277 ± 46 W with sm, ffpm and nm, respectively; p = 0.002; the ventilation was significantly reduced with both face masks (131 ± 28 vs 114 ± 23 vs 99 ± 19 l/m; p < 0.001). Peak blood lactate response was reduced with mask. Cardiac output was similar with and without mask. Participants reported consistent and marked discomfort wearing the masks, especially ffpm. CONCLUSION: Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.

Little is known about the dynamic changes in the patient immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and how different responses are correlated with disease severity and outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this prospective research. The demographic information, medical history, symptoms, signs and laboratory results were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. The leukocytes, lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were longitudinally collected. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients included, 17 suffered from severe disease. The severe patients tended be older (65.29 ± 12.33 years vs. 45.37 ± 18.66 years) and had a greater degree of underlying disease (41.18% vs. 24.56%), lower baseline lymphocyte counts [0.64 (0.46-0.95) × 109 vs. 1.27 (0.95-1.70) × 109], higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios [NLRs; 3.76 (3.15-5.51) vs. 2.07 (1.48-2.93)] and lower baseline eosinophil counts [0 (0-0.01) × 109 vs. 0.03 (0.01-0.06) × 109] than those in non-severe patients. The baseline helper T (Th) cells (335.47 vs. 666.46/µl), suppressor T(Ts) cells (158 vs. 334/µl), B cells (95 vs. 210/µl) and natural killer (NK) cells (52 vs. 122/µl) were significantly decreased in severe cases compared to that in non-severe cases. In addition, the baseline neutrophils were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and the baseline lymphocytes were negatively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. The dynamic change of T cells, Th cells and IFN-Î³ in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare sedative use between patients with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared with historical controls of non-COVID-19 ARDS who were admitted to 2 hospitals from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, and April 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, respectively. The primary outcome was median cumulative dose of propofol (µg/kg) at 24 hours after intubation. RESULTS: There were 92 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 37 patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS included. Within the first 24 hours of intubation, patients with COVID-19 ARDS required higher total median doses of propofol: 51 045 µg/kg (interquartile range, 26 150-62 365 µg/kg) versus 33 350 µg/kg (9632-51 455 µg/kg; P = 0.004). COVID-19 patients were more likely receive intravenous lorazepam (37% vs 14%; P = 0.02) and higher cumulative median doses of midazolam by days 5 (14 vs 4 mg; P = 0.04) and 7 of intubation (89 vs 4 mg; P = 0.03) to achieve the same median Richmond Analgesia-Sedation Scale scores. COVID-19 ARDS patients required more ventilator days (10 vs 6 days; P = 0.02). There was no difference in 30-day mortality.

Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Thachil, Jecko",J Thromb Haemost,330,1

Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to September 19, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of disease recurrence among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 3,644 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 15% (95% CI, 12% to 19%) patients was re-positive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 14% (95% CI, 11% to 17%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea.

Sertoli cells play a major role in fertility and induce spermatogenesis by protecting, nourishing, and supporting germ cells. It has been speculated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could directly affect the male reproductive system, and therefore heredity and fertility. The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV could confirm this hypothesis because both viruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as the receptor to enter human cells. ACE2 is expressed by Sertoli cells and other testicular cells, therefore COVID-19 has the potential to impair fertility by destroying Sertoli cells. This hypothesis should be evaluated and confirmed by monitoring fertility in patients with COVID-19.","Niazi Tabar, Amirreza; Sojoudi, Kiana; Henduei, Hannaneh; Azizi, Hossein",Zygote,330,10

Although in the case of uniform lockdown, a simple compartmental model would indicate instantaneous transition to decay of the epidemic, this is not the case when partially isolated active clusters remain with the potential to create a series of small outbreaks. We model this using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm based on a connected set of stochastic susceptible-infected-removed/recovered networks representing the locked-down majority population (in which the reproduction number is less than 1) weakly coupled to a large set of small clusters in which the infection may propagate. We find that the presence of such active clusters can lead to slower than expected decay of the epidemic and significantly delayed onset of the decay phase. We study the relative contributions of these changes, caused by the active clusters within the population, to the additional total infected population. We also demonstrate that limiting the size of the inevitable active clusters can be efficient in reducing their impact on the overall size of the epidemic outbreak. The deceleration of the decay phase becomes apparent when the active clusters form at least 5% of the population.","Khataee, Hamid; Kibble, Jack; Scheuring, Istvan; Czirok, Andras; Neufeld, Zoltan",Biophys J,330,16

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the correlates with the occurrence of PE as well as the association between PE and the risk of mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study on consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 7 Italian Hospitals. At admission, all patients underwent medical history, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 224 patients (mean age 69 ± 14, male sex 62%); PE was diagnosed in 32 cases (14%). Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3-11 days, 3 IQR 1-6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568-5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13-1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury (47% vs 28%, p = 0.033). At multivariable analysis, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE; HR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.66-0.98; p = 0.046) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP; HR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03-1.23; p = 0.008) resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence. Mortality rates (50% vs 27%; p = 0.010) and cardiogenic shock (37% vs 14%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PE as compared with non-PE patients. At multivariate analysis PE was significant associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: PE is relatively common complication in COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality risk. TAPSE and sPAP resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence in COVID-19 patients.","Scudiero, Fernando; Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Russo, Vincenzo; Citro, Rodolfo; Personeni, Davide; Cafro, Andrea; D039,; Andrea, Antonello; Attena, Emilio; Pezzullo, Salvatore; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Galasso, Gennaro; Pitì, Antonino; Parodi, Guido",Thromb Res,330,16

Here, we describe a screening pipeline for the discovery of efficacious SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. We screen a best-in-class drug repurposing library, ReFRAME, against two high-throughput, high-content imaging infection assays: one using HeLa cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the other using lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. From nearly 12,000 compounds, we identify 49 (in HeLa-ACE2) and 41 (in Calu-3) compounds capable of selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, most screen hits are cell-line specific, likely due to different virus entry mechanisms or host cell-specific sensitivities to modulators. Among these promising hits, the antivirals nelfinavir and the parent of prodrug MK-4482 possess desirable in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles, and both reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in an orthogonal human differentiated primary cell model. Furthermore, MK-4482 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model. Overall, we identify direct-acting antivirals as the most promising compounds for drug repurposing, additional compounds that may have value in combination therapies, and tool compounds for identification of viral host cell targets.","Bakowski, Malina A; Beutler, Nathan; Wolff, Karen C; Kirkpatrick, Melanie G; Chen, Emily; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh H; Riva, Laura; Shaabani, Namir; Parren, Mara; Ricketts, James; Gupta, Anil K; Pan, Kastin; Kuo, Peiting; Fuller, MacKenzie; Garcia, Elijah; Teijaro, John R; Yang, Linlin; Sahoo, Debashis; Chi, Victor; Huang, Edward; Vargas, Natalia; Roberts, Amanda J; Das, Soumita; Ghosh, Pradipta; Woods, Ashley K; Joseph, Sean B; Hull, Mitchell V; Schultz, Peter G; Burton, Dennis R; Chatterjee, Arnab K; McNamara, Case W; Rogers, Thomas F",Nat Commun,330,21

In our study we determine whether exists differences in cumulative incidence and severity of Covid-19 infection between lung cancer patients visiting our Medical Oncology department and the reference population of our center (320,000 people), in the current epicenter of the pandemic in Europe (Madrid, Spain). We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9 %) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3 %) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p < 0.0001). Dead lung cancer patients were elderly compared to survivors: 72 versus 64.5 years old (p = 0.12). Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improves the outcome of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients, detecting only 1/6 deaths between patients under this treatment versus others treatment, with statistical significance in the univariate and multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.04, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients have a higher mortality rate than general population. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment seems like a good treatment option. It is important to try to minimize visits to hospitals (without removing their active treatments) in order to decrease nosocomial transmission.","Rogado, Jacobo; Pangua, Cristina; Serrano-Montero, Gloria; Obispo, Berta; Marino, Almudena Martín; Pérez-Pérez, Mar; López-Alfonso, Ana; Gullón, Pedro; Lara, Miguel Ángel",Lung Cancer,330,0

Many hospitals had to re-organize to deal with the emergency, so that the non-core activities have been suspended or cancelled, raising management problems. The aim of this multicentre study is to report the epidemiological orthopaedic and traumatological data between COVID and pre-COVID era and to analyse patients’ needs and their management. Methods: We reported and compared traumatological and elective orthopaedic surgeries performed in three of the main hospital centres in Tuscany during COVID (March 2020) and pre-COVID (March 2019) era. We also reported the epidemiological data about the number of orthopaedic first aid visits at the main hub, analysing the main differences. For each centre, we reported the number, diagnosis, co-morbidities, treatment, hospital course, complications and outcomes of confirmed COVID 19 patients. We also indicated what kind of PPE were used by medical staff and patients at any visit. Results: The scheduled surgery drastically decreased in all the centres and the most of procedures were carried out for tumours, infections and implant mobilizations during the COVID time, delaying all the other ones. Trauma activities slightly decreased between the two time points: proximal femur fractures continued to engage our hospitals at the same pre-COVID volumes, while minor traumas drastically decreased. We report a decrease of 70.95% in orthopaedic first aid, with first-aid-visits/hospitalization ratio of 13.8 in the pre-COVID time vs 5.8 in the COVID time. A total of 5 confirmed COVID patients were treated for fractures and 4 of them healed without complications. We report just one case of death among COVID patients. All the medical staff members have worn the PPE and no one have developed COVID symptoms. Conclusions: The COVID-19 raised many important issues, such as the optimal management of patients requiring the treatment of conventional diseases during a pandemic. The flow of patients changes from one area to another during a pandemic and an integrated approach within the same geographical area could be useful to better allocate resources and manage the patients’ needs. The preventive measures put in place in our country seem to work, but this first experience with COVID-19 crisis highlighted the chronic problems of our health system and we believe that we have to “learn the lesson” to be better prepared in the future.","Giuntoli, Michele; Bonicoli, Enrico; Bugelli, Giulia; Valesini, Massimo; Manca, Mario; Scaglione, Michelangelo",J.

To identify the impact of plan implementation on epidemic mitigation, literature review was performed for the studies published from Egypt in the early stage of pandemic. In addition, data of COVID-19 patients February-July 2020 was obtained from the National Egyptian Surveillance system and studied to describe the epidemic situation in the early stage of the epidemic in Egypt. Lessons learned indicated that the single most important key to success in epidemic early-stage containment is the commitment of all partners to pre-developed and agreed upon preparedness plan.

This shift occurred following the Covid-19 crisis. The world uses digital e-learning to support the public health response to this pandemic. The study's objective was to determine the medical students' acceptance and perceptions of e-learning during the Covid-19 closure time in Jeddah. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was done among 340 medical students from King Abdulaziz University, 2020. A standardized, electronic, self-administered, Google Form data collection sheet was distributed. It included the E-learning acceptance measure (ElAM) containing three constructs, namely: tutor quality (TQ), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). The sheet also inquired about the students' perceptions of the benefits, enablers, and barriers to e-learning. Descriptive, inferential statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Blackboard and Zoom were the most preferred Learning Management Systems (LMS) by our medical students. The mean score of ElAM was 102.82 ± 24.102. Better achievers obtained significantly (P < 0.001) higher scores in all ElAM constructs. About three-fifths of the students confirmed that e-learning substituted classical on-campus learning and was an adaptable, and less time-consuming method. The educator's good e-learning skills, the subject, instructional design, interaction, motivation, and good LMS were agreed as enablers of e-learning. However, most students accepted that clinical teaching is the most challenging learning outcome and that exams could be affected by low internet quality. CONCLUSION: Medical students moderately accepted e-learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic closure time. More training of the students and tutors, better designing e-courses, more interaction, motivation, and blended learning are recommended.","Ibrahim, Nahla Khamis; Al Raddadi, Rajaa; AlDarmasi, Moroj; Al Ghamdi, Abdullah; Gaddoury, Mahmoud; AlBar, Hussain M; Ramadan, Iman Kamal",J Infect Public Health,330,33

METHODS: Weekly national survey of paediatricians with an open-ended questionnaire. RESULTS: During the 6-week study survey period, the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit received 33 reports about 55 instances where paediatricians believed care may have been compromised, about half (56%) relating to infants aged from birth to 6 weeks. Compromised care was for acute presentations in 75%, acute complications of a chronic illness in 14%, with 11% for chronic conditions. Paediatricians reported the outcome as moderately severe (short-term morbidity, increased length of stay, higher level of care) in 38 cases (69%) and in a further 4 (7%) as severe (potential to be life-threatening or result in permanent disability). CONCLUSION: Despite clear messaging, hospital avoidance and reduced access to primary and secondary care were associated with significant potential harm for children in New Zealand during a strict lockdown, with newborn infants disproportionately affected. During the implementation of interventions to eliminate community transmission of COVID-19, New Zealand paediatricians note the importance of face-to-face post-natal visits for newborns and primary care services for children with acute illness, to avoid preventable harm.","Duncanson, Mavis; Wheeler, Benjamin J; Jelleyman, Timothy; Dalziel, Stuart R; McIntyre, Peter",J. paediatr. child health,330,1

Herein, we report the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a multicenter study conducted in four cities in China excluding Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 478 patients transferred by emergency medical services to designated hospitals in four major cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan, and Nanning) were enrolled. We compared the characteristics of imported and indigenous cases and calculated the frequencies of fatal, severe, mild, and asymptomatic disease. The results were used to generate a pyramid of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 46.9 years and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (69.7%), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%), and headache (7.9%). Most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. Imported cases dominated during the early stages of the pandemic, but decreased from 1 February 2020 as indigenous cases rose sharply. Compared with indigenous cases, imported cases differed significantly in terms of sex (P = 0.002), severity of disease (P = 0.006), occurrence of fever (P < 0.001), family clustering (P < 0.001), history of contact (P < 0.001), and primary outcome (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Within the population studied, imported cases had distinct characteristics from those of indigenous cases, with lower fatality rates and higher discharge rates. New infections shifted from imported cases to local infection gradually, and overall infections have declined to a low level. We suggest that preventing import of cases and controlling spread within local areas can help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection spread.","Zhang, Jinjun; Yang, Shixiong; Xu, Yi; Qin, Xinyan; Liu, Jialiang; Guo, Jinjun; Tian, Sijia; Wang, Shaoping; Liao, Kai; Zhang, Ying; Ma, Yu; Chen, Yuguo",BMC Infect Dis,330,1

Amidst this global crisis, various controversies have been emerging about how to manage the virus, ranging from whether face masks should be required as a preventive measure to whether hydroxychloroquine is an appropriate treatment. There has been a barrage of contradictory claims related to these issues. However, in many cases, it is not possible for an individual to wait until consensus is reached before deciding on a course of action. Meanwhile, to avoid misplacing trust, trust must be well grounded. Conventional school science largely focuses on the trustworthiness of data and evidence, rather than that of the people making scientific claims. This failure to consider the human factor renders conventional school science inadequate for helping students make informed judgements about granting trust. Drawing on the literature in epistemic practice, this paper highlights four epistemic processes potentially useful for students to ground their trust, including (1) identifying whether recognition from peer reviewers has been obtained; (2) examining the credentials of those who claim expertise; (3) determining the level of expert consensus; and (4) identifying possible sources of bias. Through critical reflection on events related to the Covid-19 pandemic as examples, this paper examines how these epistemic processes inform judgement about the trustworthiness of people in terms of their competence and motives. The discussion highlights the need to develop students' capacity to identify expertise/ credentials, the nature of journals and of organisations when trust is assigned. This paper offers a frame for science educators on guiding students to place trust as a part of their decision-making process. The capability would be relevant to contexts beyond the Covid-19 pandemic.","Leung, Jessica S C; Cheng, Maurice M W",Cult Stud Sci Educ,330,1

Between December 2020 and January 2021, we conducted a follow-up online survey in Somalia to monitor adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Adherence was measured via a composite adherence score based on four measures (physical distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, and mouth covering when coughing/sneezing). We analyzed 4543 responses (mean age: 23.5 ± 6.4 years, 62.4% males). The mean adherence score during this survey was lower than the score during a similar survey in April 2020. A total of 76.8% of respondents were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Flu-like symptoms were more frequently reported in the current survey compared to previous surveys. Multiple logistic regression showed that participants who experienced flu-like symptoms, those in the healthcare sector, and those with higher adherence scores had higher odds for vaccine acceptability while being a female reduced the willingness to be vaccinated. In conclusion, our data suggest that the decreasing adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures may have caused increased flu-like symptoms over time.

Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued a structure-based design of peptidomimetic &#945;-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease-inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the &#945;-ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera.

Here we develop an automatic method for the detection of the internal structure of the clusters and their number, independently of the model that describes the dynamics of the phenomenon. It is substantially based on the difference of the log-likelihood $\delta {\cal LL}$, that is evaluated when all elements are connected and when they are grouped into clusters. As a function of the number of connected elements $\delta {\cal LL}$ presents a change of slope and a singularity which can be both used in cluster identification.

METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of 160 hip fractures operated upon between December 2019 and May 2020. Based on the date of declaration of national lockdown, the cohort was separated into two groups: 'pre-COVID time' (PCT), including 86 patients, and 'COVID time' (CT), consisting of 74 patients. All CT patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were stratified based on demographic characteristics. Outcome measures were 30-day complications, readmissions and mortality. A logistic regression model was run to evaluate factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Age, female/male ratio, body mass index and American Society of Anaesthesia score were similar between both groups (p > 0.05). CT patients had a higher percentage of Charlson &#8805; 5 and Rockwood Frailty Index &#8805; 5 scores (p < 0.05) as well as lower UCLA and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores (p < 0.05). This translated into a higher hemiarthroplasty/total hip arthroplasty ratio during CT (p = 0.04). Thromboembolic disease was higher during CT (p = 0.02). Readmissions (all negative for SARS-CoV-2) were similar between both groups (p = 0.34). Eight (10.8%) casualties were detected in the CT group, whereas no deaths were seen in the control group.

The virus responsible for COVID-9, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a spike glycoprotein (S protein) that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on host cell membranes to gain entry. Based on the full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM structure, we generated homology models of full-length ACE2 proteins from various species (gorilla, monkey, pig, bovine, sheep, cat, dog, mouse, and rat). Although these ACE2 molecules were found to share similar overall structures, their S-ACE2 interface residues differed. These differences likely result in variations in the ACE2 binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The highest affinities are predicted for human, gorilla, and monkey, while mouse and rat ACE2 are predicted to have the lowest affinities. Cat ACE2 is predicted to have a lower S protein affinity than dog ACE2. Although affinity is not the only factor that affects viral susceptibility, it is one of the most important factors. Thus, we believe that care should be taken with these animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among animal and human populations.","Ma, Cheng; Gong, Caixia",J. med. virol,330,29

However, the limited analytical accuracy of previously bioanalytical methods for teicoplanin has given rise to uncertainty due to the use of an external standard. In this study, an internal standard (IS), polymyxin B, was applied to devise a precise, accurate, and feasible HPLC-UV method. The deproteinized plasma sample containing teicoplanin and an IS of acetonitrile was chromatographed on a C18 column with an acidic mobile phase consisting of NaH2PO4 buffer and acetonitrile (78:22, v/v) by isocratic elution and detection at 220 nm. The linearity was in the range 7.8–500 mg/L calculated by the ratio of the teicoplanin signal to the IS signal. This analytical method, validated by FDA guidelines with ICH Q2 (R1), was successfully applied to analyze the plasma samples of patients in the intensive care unit for treating serious resistant bacterial infectious diseases, such as those by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The methods suggested the potential for use in routine clinical practice for therapeutic drug monitoring of teicoplanin, providing both improved accuracy and a wide range of linearity from lower than steady-state trough concentrations (10 mg/L) to much higher concentrations.","Lee, Jaeok Chung Eun-Kyoung Sung-Wook Kang Hwa-Jeong Lee Sandy-Jeong Rhie",Pharmaceutics,330,16

We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We characterize CpG content by a CpG force that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels. The CpG force, as the CpG content, is overall low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses; however it widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias and the pressure to lower CpG content.","Di Gioacchino, Andrea; Sulc, Petr; Komarova, Anastassia V; Greenbaum, Benjamin D; Monasson, Rémi; Cocco, Simona",Mol. biol. evol,330,20

As a result of foodservice closures, consumers indicated purchasing more groceries than normal. Consumers attempted to avoid shopping in stores, relying heavily on grocery delivery and pick-up services during the beginning of the pandemic when no clear rules were in place. Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe.

RESULTS: Six variables, including neutrophil (hazard ratio [HR] 1.088, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.0004-1.147], p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (HR 1.007, 95% CI [1.0026-1.011], p = 0.002), interleukin-6 (HR 1.001, 95% CI [1.0003-1.002], p = 0.005), D-dimer (HR 1.034, 95% CI [1.0111-1.057], p = 0.003), prothrombin time (HR 1.086, 95% CI [1.0369-1.139], p < 0.001), and myoglobin (HR 1.001, 95% CI [1.0007-1.002], p < 0.001), were identified and applied to develop a nomogram. The nomogram predicted 14-day and 28-day survival probabilities with reasonable accuracy, as assessed by the C-index (0.912) and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis showed relatively wide ranges of threshold probability, suggesting a high clinical value of the nomogram. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, prothrombin time, and myoglobin levels were significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Demonstrating satisfactory discrimination and calibration, this model could predict patient outcomes as early as on admission and might serve as a useful triage tool for clinical decision making.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Historic cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health Ministry. SETTING: Population-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects who sought medical attention for clinical suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: We measured the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia). RESULTS: 65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568 (17.66%), respectively. According to the PISYCS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87% between 4-7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1-3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4-7 days, 4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001). Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): <24 hours = 1.75 [1.55-1.98], p<0.001; 1-3 days = 1 (reference value); 4-7 days = 1.53 [1.37-1.70], p<0.001; >7 days = 1.67 [1.44-1.94], p<0.001. For pneumonia: <24 hours = 1.49 [1.39-1.58], p<0.001; 1-3 days = 1; 4-7 days = 1.48 [1.41-1.56], p<0.001; >7 days = 1.57 [1.46-1.69], p<0.001. LIMITATIONS: Using a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies. CONCLUSION: The PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern. Further studies are needed to corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, Dan; Buitano-Tang, Bruno; Martínez-Gil, Mercedes; Zaldívar-Pérez Pavón, Andrea; Talavera, Juan O",PLoS One,330,16

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","Wasserman, M; Ouslander, J G; Lam, A; Wolk, A G; Morley, J E; von Preyss-Friedman, S; Marco, N; Nazir, A; Haimowitz, D; Bessey, F",J Nutr Health Aging,330,20

As preventive medicine and health screening examinations are now becoming commonplace, the incidental detection of papillomacular bundle defect (PMBD) on fundus photography has been increasing. However, clinical significance of incidental PMBD has not been well documented to date. Thus, through long-term and longitudinal observation, we aimed to investigate the risk factors for the development and progression of PMBD and its predictive role associated with systemic diseases and glaucoma. Methods: This longitudinal study included subjects who had undergone standardized health screening. We retrospectively reviewed patients for whom PMBD had been detected in fundus photography and followed up for more than 5 years. For a comparative analysis, non-PMBD groups of age- and gender-matched healthy controls were selected. Results: A total of about 67,000 fundus photographs were analyzed for 8.0 years, and 587 PMBD eyes were found. Among them, 234 eyes of 234 patients who had had fundus photographs taken for more than 5 years were finally included. A total of 216 eyes (92.3%) did not progress during the 8.1 ± 2.7 years, whereas 18 eyes (7.7%) showed progression at 7.6 ± 2.9 years after initial detection. A multivariate logistic regression analysis using 224 non-PMBD healthy controls revealed low body mass index (BMI < 20 kg/m2), systemic hypertension, and sclerotic changes of retinal artery as the significant risk factors for the development of PMBD. Regarding PMBD progression, low BMI, concomitant retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) at non-PMB sites, optic disc hemorrhage, and higher vertical cup/disc ratio were individual significant risk factors. Conclusion: PMBD is associated with ischemic effects. Although the majority of PMBD do not progress, some of cases are associated with glaucomatous damage in a long-term way. PMBD might be a personalized indicator representing ischemia-associated diseases and a predictive factor for diagnosis and preventive management of glaucoma.","Baek, Sung Uk; Lee, Won June; Park, Ki Ho; Choi, Hyuk Jin",EPMA J,330,14

Historically, upper and lower respiratory illness has been cared for at home or in the ambulatory primary care setting. It is likely that patients experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms may first contact their primary care provider. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a representative sample of patients from the United States that regularly assesses their use of medical care services. We analyzed 2017 MEPS data to determine the number and proportion of patients who were seen in primary care or family medicine ambulatory settings or hospitalized for upper or lower respiratory illness or pneumonia. In a given year, 19.5 million patients are seen by primary care for an upper respiratory illness, 10.7 million patients for bronchitis, and 9 million for pneumonia. In contrast, 890,000 patients are hospitalized with pneumonia. Given that a primary etiology for respiratory illness in early 2020 was SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19), primary care practices likely were the site of first contact for most patients with COVID-19 illness. Unfortunately, there has been inadequate support for in-person and telehealth visits. Primary care clinicians reported serious shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing capacity. Inadequate reimbursement for telehealth visits coupled with decreased in-person visits put primary care practices at risk of layoffs and closure. Policies related to primary care payment, federal relief efforts, PPE access, testing and follow-up capacity, and telehealth technical support are essential so primary care can provide first contact and continuity for their patients and communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery.","Westfall, John M; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Jabbarpour, Yalda",J Am Board Fam Med,330,33

We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS: Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION: The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Harley, Jason M",J. contin. educ. health prof,330,29

METHODS: HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age.

The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways. Most coagulation events occurred in the intra-alveolar and not in the intra-vascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes. The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163+ macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and B-cells. The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothelium, pericytes or stromal cells. The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization.

We compared three groups based on immunosuppression regimen 7 months-to-1 year post transplant: (a) tacrolimus (Tac) + mycophenolic acid (MPA) + prednisone (Pred) (referent group, 77.7%); (b) Tac + MPA + Pred + HCQ (16.5%); or (c) other immunosuppression + HCQ (5.7%). Compared to the referent group, recipients treated with other immunosuppression + HCQ had a 2-fold increased risk of abnormal ECG or QT prolongation (18.9% vs. 10.7%; aHR,1.12 1.963.42 , p = .02) and ventricular arrhythmias (15.2% vs. 11.4%; aHR,1.00 1.813.29 , p = .05) in the >1-to-3 years post-transplant. Tac + MPA + Pred + HCQ was associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (13.5% vs. 11.4%; aHR,1.02 1.542.31 , p = .04) and pancytopenia (35.9% vs. 31.4%; aHR,1.03 1.311.68 , p = .03) compared to triple immunosuppression without HCQ. However, HCQ-containing regimens were not associated with an increased risk of death or graft failure. HCQ may be used safely in selected kidney transplant recipients in addition to their maintenance immunosuppression, although attention to arrhythmias is warranted.","Lentine, Krista L; Lam, Ngan N; Caliskan, Yasar; Alhamad, Tarek; Xiao, Huiling; Schnitzler, Mark A; Chang, Su-Hsin; Axelrod, David; Segev, Dorry L; McAdams-DeMarco, Mara; Kasiske, Bertram L; Hess, Gregory P; Brennan, Daniel C",Clin Transplant,330,16

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of symptoms, including fever, muscle pain, tiredness, cough, and difficulty breathing. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms and have a higher risk of physical deconditioning during their hospital stay. Physical therapists have an important role in supporting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 but also need to be aware of challenges when treating these patients. In line with international initiatives, this article aims to provide guidance and detailed recommendations for hospital-based physical therapists managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through a national approach in the Netherlands. METHODS: A pragmatic approach was used. A working group conducted a purposive scan of the literature and drafted initial recommendations based on the knowledge of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and current practice for physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with lung disease and patients admitted to the intensive care unit. An expert group of hospital-based physical therapists in the Netherlands provided feedback on the recommendations, which were finalized when consensus was reached among the members of the working group. RESULTS: The recommendations include safety recommendations, treatment recommendations, discharge recommendations, and staffing recommendations. Treatment recommendations address 2 phases of hospitalization: when patients are critically ill and admitted to the intensive care unit, and when patients are severely ill and admitted to the COVID ward. Physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 comprises elements of respiratory support and active mobilization. Respiratory support includes breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance techniques, and respiratory muscle strength training. Recommendations toward active mobilization include bed mobility activities, active range-of-motion exercises, active (assisted) limb exercises, activities-of-daily-living training, transfer training, cycle ergometer, pre-gait exercises, and ambulation.","Felten-Barentsz, Karin M; van Oorsouw, Roel; Klooster, Emily; Koenders, Niek; Driehuis, Femke; Hulzebos, Erik H J; van der Schaaf, Marike; Hoogeboom, Thomas J; van der Wees, Philip J",Phys Ther,330,25

Significant differences in mortality rates across US states and countries can be explained by population density, climate, exposure, and policy. Regions that were able to contain the disease early have seen fewer deaths and lower economic losses. Some developing countries initially imposed drastic, costly measures, perhaps motivated by political economy.

To limit the exposure of providers and patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages providers to use telehealth platforms whenever possible. Given the maternal mortality crisis in the United States and the compounding 2019 coronavirus disease public health emergency, continued access to quality preconception, prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are essential to the health and well-being of mother and baby. OBJECTIVE: This commentary explores unique opportunities to optimize virtual obstetric care for low-risk and high-risk mothers at each stage of pregnancy. METHODS: In this review paper, we present evidence-based literature and tools from first-hand experience implementing telemedicine in obstetric care clinics during the pandemic. RESULTS: Using the best evidence-based practices with telemedicine, health care providers can deliver care in the safest, most respectful, and appropriate way possible while providing the critical support necessary in pregnancy. In reviewing the literature, several studies endorse the implementation of specific tools outlined in this article, to facilitate the implementation of telemedicine. From a quality improvement standpoint, evidence-based telemedicine provides a solution for overburdened healthcare systems, greater confidentiality for obstetric services, and a personalized avenue for health care providers to meet maternal health needs in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, continued access to quality prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are essential to the health and well-being of mother and baby.","Markwei, M.; Goje, O.",Women&#039;s health,330,2

As such, MRI has also been widely used in preclinical research to investigate drug efficacy and pathogenic aspects in MS animal models. Keeping track of all published preclinical imaging studies, and possible new therapeutic approaches, has become difficult considering the abundance of studies. Moreover, comparisons between studies are hampered by methodological differences, especially since small differences in an MRI protocol can lead to large differences in tissue contrast. We therefore provide a comprehensive qualitative overview of preclinical MRI studies in the field of neuroinflammatory and demyelinating diseases, aiming to summarize experimental setup, MRI methodology, and risk of bias. We also provide estimates of the effects of tested therapeutic interventions by a meta-analysis. Finally, to improve the standardization of preclinical experiments, we propose guidelines on technical aspects of MRI and reporting that can serve as a framework for future preclinical studies using MRI in MS animal models. By implementing these guidelines, clinical translation of findings will be facilitated, and could possibly reduce experimental animal numbers.","Ineichen, Benjamin V; Sati, Pascal; Granberg, Tobias; Absinta, Martina; Lee, Nathanael J; Lefeuvre, Jennifer A; Reich, Daniel S",Neuroimage Clin,330,18

This study has therefore analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Northwestern China, an area with low population density. Methods: From January 21 to March 11, 2020, data from patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in areas of Northwestern China with lower population densities were retrospectively analyzed. Certain variables were categorized as numbers and percentages, with the ratio between resident patients (no history of going out during the epidemic) and imported patients representing the contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19. Hospitalization time was also calculated. Results: A total of 617 COVID-19 patients were reported in Northwestern China, and the morbidity and mortality rates of 0.000005 and 0.011, respectively. Further analysis showed that the morbidity was inversely proportional to population density and distance from Wuhan City. This study enrolled 473 confirmed cases; among these patients, there were 248 residents and 225 imported cases with a ratio of 1:1. The youngest and oldest patients were 1 and 94 years of age, respectively, with a median age of 42 years. Fifteen (3.2%) patients were children or infants. Two patients were pregnant, and one patient gave birth to a healthy baby with negative results during her disease course. About 17.3% of patients (82 cases) were healthy carriers without any symptoms during their disease course. One male patient (0.2%) had recurrence of a positive test result 4 days after discharge. The median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 2.0 to 43.0 days. Further analysis showed that age (P = 0.03) and severity status (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with hospitalization time. Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in the regions with a low population density were lower than those of the national average in China. All populations were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic patients with positive results should be taken seriously, and the hospitalization time of patients is associated with their age and severity status.","Zhu, Jianfei; Zhang, Qingqing; Jia, Chenghui; Wang, Wuping; Chen, Jiakuan; Xia, Yanmin; Wang, Wenchen; Wang, Xuejiao; Wen, Miaomiao; Wang, Hongtao; Zhang, Zhipei; Xu, Shuonan; Zhao, Jinbo; Jiang, Tao",Front Med (Lausanne),330,20

METHODS: All the Spanish nephrologists were invited to participate in this survey. Data on demographics, Covid-19 infection status, received vaccine doses and side effects were collected. Acceptance and side effects were analyzed for Covid-19 vaccination. Factors associated to vaccination were assessed and a multivariate adjusted model was constructed to determine independent predictors for Covid-19 vaccine side effects. RESULTS: A total of 708 nephrologists answered the survey (460 [65%] women, mean age 44±11 years). Six-hundred and eight (86%) had received the first dose and 513 (72%) were fully vaccinated. Most of the subjects (565, 93%) received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech®) vaccine. Among vaccinated nephrologists, 453 (75%) presented any side effect; the most frequent was local reaction (68%), followed by myalgia (44%), tiredness (39%) and headache (34%).

These kirana stores have been the lifeline of consumers across India during the Covid-19 outbreak which saw the closure of most of the other retail formats. While Covid-19 developed a new affiliation for kirana stores among consumers and provided new possibilities for these stores to expand their customer bases and product range, at the same time highlighted the gaps in their supply chain management. This paper would examine the role and assistance which technologies like digital and blockchain technologies can provide to these unorganized small-scale neighborhood kirana stores. Design/Methodology/Approach The methodology adopted in this study is the interpretivism approach of research. All the interpretations are drawn with the content analysis of relevant research, case studies, and industry reports. Findings Blockchain and digital technologies hold tremendous potential to transform retail omni-supply chains. Although blockchain is a nascent technology, it has huge potential to integrate back-end operations for the supply chain for these stores. However, RFID and other digital technologies have established evidence to manage and improve front-end operation for supply chain management at these stores. Research Limitations/Implications The limitation will arise in this study with the nonavailability of primary data and direct interaction with the people involved in the process. Sometimes the method used in the findings of the study may become the limitation when discussed by other researchers with a different method. Practical Implication This study will help the kirana stores and their supplier both to develop a competitive advantage and effective resource planning to ensure the distribution of their products to end consumers. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ahmad, I.; Dixit, S.",EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,330,26

Thus, our objective was to compare incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in students and staff in Massachusetts public schools among districts with different physical distancing requirements. State guidance mandates masking for all school staff and for students in grades 2 and higher; the majority of districts required universal masking. METHODS: Community incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 cases among students in grades K-12 and staff participating in-person learning, and district infection control plans were linked. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) for students and staff members in districts with &#8805;3 versus &#8805;6 feet of physical distancing were estimated using log-binomial regression; models adjusted for community incidence are also reported. RESULTS: Among 251 eligible school districts, 537,336 students and 99,390 staff attended in-person instruction during the 16-week study period, representing 6,400,175 student learning weeks and 1,342,574 staff learning weeks. Student case rates were similar in the 242 districts with &#8805;3 feet versus &#8805;6 feet of physical distancing between students (IRR, 0.891, 95% CI, 0.594-1.335); results were similar after adjusting for community incidence (adjusted IRR, 0.904, 95% CI, 0.616-1.325). Cases among school staff in districts with &#8805;3 feet versus &#8805;6 feet of physical distancing were also similar (IRR, 1.015, 95% CI, 0.754-1.365). CONCLUSIONS: Lower physical distancing policies can be adopted in school settings with masking mandates without negatively impacting student or staff safety.","van den Berg, Polly; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M; Jack, Rebecca S; Epshtein, Isabella; Nelson, Richard; Oster, Emily; Branch-Elliman, Westyn",Clin. infect. dis,330,16

In a recent series of articles, Manning and Fink [1-3] use national-level data to describe associations between case-fatality ratios and male and female finger ratios (2D:4D), a suggested measure of prenatal androgen exposure, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) allele and genotype frequencies. The authors suggest that 2D:4D is linked with ACE variant prevalence, and that higher male 2D:4D is associated with higher case fatality ratios, and point to 2D:4D as a useful prognostic measure for COVID-19 susceptibility. A critical review and robust Bayesian analysis of the hypothesis is described here, finding no conclusive evidence of COVID-19 mortality and 2D:4D, nor associations between 2D:4D and ACE1 allele or ACE2 genotype frequency. This absence of evidence is present for data taken from the second wave of COVID-19 in October 2020. Problematic theoretical grounding, individual-level conclusions drawn from national-level data, and issues with statistical inference in the original articles are discussed.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is perhaps one of the biggest threats to modern medicine; data show that 81% of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed in primary care. AIM: To identify where the perceived gaps in knowledge, skills, guidance and research around infections and antibiotic use lie from the general practitioner (GP) viewpoint. DESIGN AND SETTING: An online questionnaire survey. METHOD: The survey, based on questions asked of Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) members in 1999, and covering letter were electronically sent to GPs between May and August 2017 via various primary care dissemination routes. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-eight GPs responded. Suspected Infection in the elderly, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), surveillance of AMR in the community, leg ulcers, persistent cough and cellulitis all fell into the top six conditions ranked in order of importance that require further research, evidence and guidance. Acute sore throat, otitis media and sinusitis were of lower importance than in 1999. CONCLUSION: This survey will help the NHS, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and researchers to prioritise for the development of guidance and research for chronic conditions highlighted for which there is little evidence base for diagnostic and management guidelines in primary care. In contrast, 20 years of investment into research, guidance and resources for acute respiratory infections have successfully reduced these as priority areas for GPs.","Lecky, Donna M; Granier, Steve; Allison, Rosalie; Verlander, Neville Q; Collin, Simon M; McNulty, Cliodna A M",,330,12

We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS: Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenario 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS: Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","Mettler, Sofia K; Park, Jewel; Özbek, Orhun; Mettler, Linus K; Ho, Po-Han; Rhim, Hye Chang; Maathuis, Marloes H",Int. j. infect. dis,330,33

Its design and questionnaire were informed by three community gatherings organized by Refugee Council USA in the fall and winter of 2019, extensive input from an expert advisory group, and a literature review.This study finds that USRAP serves important purposes, enjoys extensive community support, and offers a variety of effective services. Overall, the survey finds a high degree of consensus on the US resettlement program’s strengths and objectives, and close alignment between its services and the needs of refugees at different stages of their settlement and integration. Because its infrastructure and community-based resettlement networks have been decimated in recent years, the main challenges of subsequent administrations, Congresses, and USRAP stakeholders will be to rebuild, revitalize, and regain broad and bipartisan support for the program. This article also recommends specific ways that USRAP’s programs and services can be strengthened. Among the study’s findings: 3 Most refugee respondents identified USRAP’s main purpose(s) as giving refugees new opportunities, helping them to integrate, offering hope to refugees living in difficult circumstances abroad, and saving lives. High percentages of refugees reported that the program allowed them to support themselves soon after arrival (92 percent), helped them to integrate (77 percent), and has a positive economic impact on local communities (71 percent). Refugee respondents also reported that the program encourages them to work in jobs that do not match their skills and credentials (56 percent), does not provide enough integration support after three months (54 percent), does not offer sufficient financial help during their first three months (49 percent), and reunites families too slowly (47 percent). Respondents identified the following main false ideas about the program: refugees pose a security risk (84 percent), use too many benefits and drain public finances (83 percent), and take the jobs of the native-born (74 percent). Refugee respondents reported using public benefits to meet basic needs, such as medical care, food, and housing. Non-refugee survey respondents believed at high rates that former refugees (69 percent) and refugee community advocate groups (64 percent) should be afforded a voice in the resettlement process. Non-refugee respondents indicated at high rates that the program’s employment requirements limit the time needed for refugees to learn English (65 percent) and limit their ability to pursue higher education (59 percent). Eighty-six percent of non-refugee respondents indicated that the Reception and Placement program is much too short (56 percent) or a little too short (30 percent). Respondents identified a wide range of persons and institutions as being very helpful to refugees in settling into their new communities: these included resettlement staff, friends, and acquaintances from refugees’ country of origin, members of places of worship, community organizations led by refugees or former refugees, and family members. Refugee respondents identified finding medical care (61 percent), housing (52 percent), and a job (49 percent) as the most helpful services in their first three months in the country. Refugees reported that the biggest challenge in their first year was to find employment that matched their educational or skill levels or backgrounds. The needs of refugees and the main obstacles to their successful integration differ by gender, reflecting at least in part the greater childcare responsibilities borne by refugee women. Refugee men reported needing assistance during their first three mo ths in finding employment (68 percent), English Language Learning (ELL) courses (59 percent), and orientation services (56 percent), while refugee women reported needing orientation services (81 percent) and assistance in securing childcare (64 percent), finding ELL courses (53 percent), and enrolling children in school (49 percent). To open-response questions, non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of men: digital literacy, (lack of) anti–domestic violence training, the need for more training to improve their jobs, the new public benefit rule, transportation to work, low wages, the need for more mental health services, cultural role adjustment, and lack of motivation. Non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of women: lack of childcare and affordable housing, the different cultural roles of women in the United States, lack of affordable driver’s education classes, a shortage of ELL classes for those with low literacy or the illiterate, digital literacy challenges, difficulty navigating their children’s education and school systems, transportation problems, poorly paying jobs, and lack of friendships with US residents. Non-refugee respondents report that refugee children also face unique obstacles to integration, including limited funding or capacity to engage refugee parents in their children’s education, difficulties communicating with refugee families, and the unfamiliarity of teachers and school staff with the cultures and backgrounds of refugee children and families. LGBTQ refugees have many of the same basic needs as other refugees — education, housing, employment, transportation, psychosocial, and others — but face unique challenges in meeting these needs due to possible rejection by refugees and immigrants from their own countries and by other residents of their new communities. Since 2017, the number of resettlement agencies has fallen sharply, and large numbers of staff at the remaining agencies have been laid off. As a result, the program has suffered a loss in expertise, institutional knowledge, language diversity, and resettlement capacity. Resettlement agencies and community-based organizations (CBOs) reported at high rates that to accommodate pre-2017 numbers of refugees, they would need higher staffing levels in employment services (66 percent), general integration and adjustment services (62 percent), mental health care (44 percent) and medical case management (44 percent). Resettlement agencies indicated that they face immense operational and financial challenges, some of them longstanding (like per capita funding and secondary migration), and some related to the Trump administration’s hostility to the program. Section I introduces the article and provides historic context on the US refugee program. Section II outlines the resettlement process and its constituent programs. Section III describes the CMS Refugee Resettlement Survey: 2020.

Limited data are available for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A retrospective case study was conducted in one designated hospital for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. Results: Out of the 74 children with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median age was 5.8 years, with no notable variation based on gender. All of the children had had direct exposure to at least one family member with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms were cough in 41 (55.4%) and fever in 38 (51.4%). Typical CT patterns of viral pneumonia were exhibited in 40 (54.1%) children, including ground-glass opacity and interstitial abnormalities. However, 17 (23.0%) children were classified as asymptomatic carriers, with neither symptoms nor radiological findings. Also, 68 (91.9%) children recovered fully and showed negative results on RT-PCR assay by nasopharyngeal swabs during our observation period. In contrast to the negative result for nasopharyngeal swab, 34% of the anal swabs showed a continued positive result. The mean hospitalization days of the children discharged after full recovery was 10.0 days. Conclusion: Within family clusters that had SARS-CoV-2 infection, children had mild or even asymptomatic illness. Although CT is highly sensitive, it should be avoided in follow-up of the disease in consideration of the radiological hazards and limited clinical benefits for mild illness in children. Furthermore, it is advocated that both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs should be confirmed negative for viral load prior to declaring full recovery so as to avoid oral-fecal transmission. Asymptomatic children with family clusters are potentially a little-known source of COVID-19. This therefore warrants an urgent reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.","Sun, Dan; Zhu, Feng; Wang, Cheng; Wu, Jing; Liu, Jie; Chen, Xue; Liu, Zhisheng; Wu, Zubo; Lu, Xiaoxia; Ma, Jiehui; Peng, Hua; Xiao, Han",Front.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of first and multiple CT imaging re-examination and blood glucose levels from 62 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were collected for a retrospective analysis to determine the correlation between glucose level and CT-based staging. RESULTS: Of the 62 COVID-19 patients, 48 cases of early stage and 14 cases of advanced stage were found in the CT data of the first diagnosis. These 62 cases were currently under follow-up (17-32 days): 18 cases in early stage-resorption stage, 25 cases in early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, 12 cases in advanced stage-resorption stage, 5 cases in early stage -advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage, and 2 cases in advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage. Among them, the CT of 14 patients with advanced stage at the first diagnosis showed multiple stage lesions (advanced stage + early stage) at the same time. Patients presented with statistically significant changes in blood glucose at early stage-resorption stage, early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, advanced stage-resorption stage, and early stage-advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p<0.05). However, no statistically significant alterations were observed in the glucose level of patients with advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of blood glucose is positively correlated with CT-based staging of COVID-19. Blood glucose is of great value in clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and in determining the stage and prognosis of this disease.","Xu, C-C; Ruan, X-Z; Chen, X-Q; Huang, Q-L; Zhao, Z-Y; Ru, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,330,26

Studies have attempted to understand and quantify such disruptions using crowdsourced mobility data sets. However, limited research has studied the justice issues of mobility data in the context of natural disasters. The lack of research leaves us without an empirical foundation to quantify and control the possible biases in the data. This study, using 2017 Hurricane Harvey as a case study, explores three aspects of mobility data that could potentially cause injustice: representativeness, quality, and precision. We find representativeness being a major factor contributing to mobility data injustice. There is a persistent disparity of representativeness across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic characteristics before, during, and after the hurricane's landfall. Additionally, we observed significant drops of data precision during the hurricane, adding uncertainty to locate people and understand their movements during extreme weather events. The findings highlight the necessity in understanding and controlling the possible bias of mobility data as well as developing practical tools through data justice lenses in collecting and analyzing data during disasters.","Deng, Hengfang; Wang, Qi",,330,29

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Hu, Xingxing; Tan, Weijun; Mazzone, Peter; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Han, Xiao-Zhen; Huang, Pingyue; Hu, Weihua; Dweik, Raed; Cheng, Zhenshun",,330,16

While early-life adversity and the short variant ('s') of the serotonin transporter gene's long polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) are suggested as interacting risk factors for affective disorders, no studies have examined whether their superposed risk effectuates neurogenic changes into adulthood. Similarly, it is not established whether reduced hippocampal volume in adolescence, variously identified as a marker and antecedent of affective disorders, anticipates diminished adult neurogenesis. We investigate these potential developmental precursors of neurogenic alterations using a bonnet macaque model. METHODS: Twenty-five male infant bonnet macaques were randomized to stressed [variable foraging demand (VFD)] or normative [low foraging demand (LFD)] rearing protocols and genotyped for 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms. Adolescent MRI brain scans (mean age 4.2y) were available for 14 subjects. Adult-born neurons were detected post-mortem (mean age 8.6y) via immunohistochemistry targeting the microtubule protein doublecortin (DCX). Models were adjusted for age and weight. RESULTS: A putative vulnerability group (VG) of VFD-reared 's'-carriers (all 's/l') exhibited reduced neurogenesis compared to non-VG subjects. Neurogenesis levels were positively predicted by ipsilateral hippocampal volume normalized for total brain volume, but not by contralateral or raw hippocampal volume. LIMITATIONS: No 's'-carriers were identified in LFD-reared subjects, precluding a 2×2 factorial analysis. CONCLUSION: The 's' allele (with adverse rearing) and low adolescent hippocampal volume portend a neurogenic deficit in adult macaques, suggesting persistent alterations in hippocampal plasticity may contribute to these developmental factors' affective risk in humans.","Schoenfeld, Eric M; Gupta, Nishant K; Syed, Shariful A; Rozenboym, Anna V; Fulton, Sasha L; Jackowski, Andrea P; Perera, Tarique D; Coplan, Jeremy D",J Affect Disord,330,16

There has been a surge in QA datasets that have been proposed to challenge natural language processing models to improve human and existing model performance. Many pre-trained language models have proven to be incredibly effective at the task of extractive question answering. However, generalizability remains as a challenge for the majority of these models. That is, some datasets require models to reason more than others. In this paper, we train various pre-trained language models and fine-tune them on multiple question answering datasets of varying levels of difficulty to determine which of the models are capable of generalizing the most comprehensively across different datasets. Further, we propose a new architecture, BERT-BiLSTM, and compare it with other language models to determine if adding more bidirectionality can improve model performance. Using the F1-score as our metric, we find that the RoBERTa and BART pre-trained models perform the best across all datasets and that our BERT-BiLSTM model outperforms the baseline BERT model.","Pearce, Kate; Zhan, Tiffany; Komanduri, Aneesh; Zhan, Justin",,330,1

This manuscript provides a detailed description of the coronavirus disease 2019 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry development, governance structure, and data collection, and insights into new ways of rapidly establishing global research collaborations to meet urgent research needs. METHODS: We use previously published recommendations for best practices for registry implementation and describe the development of the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry in terms of these steps. We identify how and why these steps were adapted or modified. In Phase 1 of registry development, the purpose of the registry and key stakeholders were identified on online platforms, Twitter and Slack. Phase 2 consisted of protocol and data collection form development, team building and the implementation of governance and policies. RESULTS: All key steps of the registry development best practices framework were met, though with the need for adaptation in some areas.

However, there is little literature relating to the relationship between finance and transformation. To fill the gap, the framework ""resource-function-transformation-cost"" was proposed to explain the relationship between transformation and cost structure change by combining resource-based theory and function analysis. A case study of Shanghai Sheshan National Forest Park (SNFP) tested the framework and further revealed that (a) transformation happened because of the recombination of resources, followed by the change of functions, leading to capital expenditure being more prominent during the early stages and management costs more so in the latter stage. Further, we conclude that the elasticity of the cost structure is low;(b) the structure of functions tended to be stable over the years;and (c) the cost structure of the management, production and business, and tourism and leisure functions did not change much, while that of ecological protection functions changed significantly from capital expenditure to management costs.","Liu, J.

Studies have revealed inequalities along social determinants of health, but little investigation was conducted surrounding geographic concentration within cities. We quantified social determinants of geographic concentration of COVID-19 cases across sixteen census metropolitan areas (CMA) in four Canadian provinces. MethodsWe used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data (income, education, visible minority, recent immigration, suitable housing, and essential workers) and the corresponding share of cases. Heterogeneity was visualized using Lorenz (concentration) curves. ResultsGeographic concentration was observed in all CMAs (half of the cumulative cases were concentrated among 21-35% of each citys population): with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario CMAs (Gini coefficients, 0.32-0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23-0.36), Manitoba (0.32), and Quebec (0.28-0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income, education attainment, and suitable housing; and higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across CMAs was concentration by proportion visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinants varied across CMAs. InterpretationThe feature of geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases was consistent across CMAs, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically-prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to SARS-CoV-2s resurgence.","Xia, Yiqing; Ma, Huiting; Moloney, Gary; García, Héctor A.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;-interactions, on the &#960;-overlap between calamitic &#960;-conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen-bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;-disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N-H···O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;-interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H-type spectroscopic aggregates in solid-state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;-conjugated materials in the solid-state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.","Özen, Bilal; Tirani, Farzaneh Fadaei; Schenk, Kurt; Lin, Kun-Han; Scopelliti, Rosario; Corminboeuf, Clémence; Frauenrath, Holger",Chemistry,330,2

However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood. Among “classical' ARDS cohorts, previous studies established two predominant biological phenotypes - patients with and without evidence of a hyperinflammatory response - with important prognostic and therapeutic implications. The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. Methods We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. Classdefining variables included demographic features, respiratory parameters, hematologic and inflammatory biomarkers, and markers of end-organ function. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen levels, which were available for n = 53 and n = 189 patients, respectively, were incorporated post-hoc. Results We identified two distinct latent classes representing 74.4% (Class 1, n = 193) and 26.6% (Class 2, n = 70) of the cohort, respectively. Posterior probability of class assignment was high (median 98.2%, IQR [98.0%, 100%]). To understand each class's distinguishing biological features, we compared the standardized mean of the continuous class-defining variables (Fig. 1A). The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 26.6%) demonstrated increased markers of vascular dysregulation, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). There was little distinction according to respiratory parameters. The class 2 phenotype was characterized by significantly decreased fibrinogen and increased IL- 6 compared to Class 1 (Fig. 1B), even though these variables were not used in the statistical inference. Furthermore, the 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (40.0% vs. 23.3%, OR 2.3, 95% CI [1.3, 4.1]). Conclusion We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with shortterm mortality risk. The class 2 phenotype exhibited prominent signatures of vascular dysregulation, suggesting that vascular dysfunction may play an important role in the clinical progression of severe COVID-19-related disease.","Ranjeva, S.; Pinciroli, R.; Hodell, E.; Xu, X.; Deng, H.; Mueller, A.; Hardin, C.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 457 patients admitted for delivery at term in our hospital, between 1 April 2020 and 31 December 2020 were studied. There were 46 positive and 411 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Their values for RT-PCR, ABO, and Rh blood group analyses, which were determined upon admittance, were studied. Results: A slightly higher percentage of infected pregnant patients at term belonged to the A blood group compared with the percentage belonging to the other blood groups; this was also true for the healthy control group. For the Rh-negative pregnant patients at term, the odds of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 was OR = 1.22 compared with Rh-positive patients where OR = 1. In our study, the highest risk was found among BIII Rh-negative pregnant patients at term (OR = 3). None of the above differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: No significant difference was found between the percentage of ABO or Rh blood groups in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients when compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p = 0.562).","Covali, Roxana; Socolov, Demetra; Pavaleanu, Ioana; Carauleanu, Alexandru; Boiculese, Vasile Lucian; Socolov, Razvan",Medicina (Kaunas),330,7

Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the concept applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis. We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression and demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the edge devices.","Obukhov, Anton; Rakhuba, Maxim; Georgoulis, Stamatios; Kanakis, Menelaos; Dai, Dengxin; Gool, Luc Van",,330,2

Frailty has been proposed for risk stratification in COVID-19 with limited evidence. Cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, diabetes and raised BMI have been associated with increased COVID-19 risk. We sought to test if non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk had reduced COVID-19, to inform targeted shielding policies. Methods Fried and Rockwood frailty were ascertained at UK Biobank baseline (2006-2010) and electronic frailty index(eFI) in primary care data to 2017*. A cardiovascular disease risk score(CRS) consisting of smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose and physical activity was estimated at baseline. Frailty (baseline and eFI;eFI alone) and CRS were tested in logistic models against COVID-19 status and COVID-19 mortality to 14th June 2020 adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. Results N=269,164 UKB participants aged ≥65 at baseline (≥75years in 2020). 13.9% of COVID-19 positive were non-frail with low baseline CRS versus 41.8% frail with moderate/high CRS. Being non-frail and having low CRS were independently associated with reduced COVID-19. The composite of non-frail with low CRS compared to frail with moderate/high CRS had significantly reduced COVID-19 risk (composite non-frail with low CRS HR 0.61;95% CI 0.45-0.84;p=0.0023;eFI non-frail with low CRS HR 0.16;95%CI 0.07-0.36;p value=9.9x10-6) and COVID-19 mortality (composite non-frail HR 0.28;95% CI 0.10-0.82;pvalue=0.02;eFI non-frail 0.07;95% CI 0.02-0.28;pvalue=0.00014). Conclusion These results show that the COVID-19 risk in non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk was up to 84% lower than in those who were frail with cardiovascular risk factors. This could contribute to future work on stratification of shielding risk in older adults in future COVID-19 surges. *Planned data updates prior to the conference should enable updates to 2020.","Masoli, J.; Atkins, J.; Delgado, J.; Pilling, L.; Melzer, D.",Age and Ageing,330,33

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of dental evacuation systems in reducing aerosols during oral prophylactic procedures in a large clinical setting. METHODS: This was a single-center, controlled clinical trial using a split-mouth design. A total of 93 student participants were recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Aerosol samples were collected on blood agar plates that were placed around the clinic at 4 treatment periods: baseline, high-volume evacuation (HVE), combination (HVE and intraoral suction device), and posttreatment. Student operators were randomized to perform oral prophylaxis using ultrasonic scalers on 1 side of the mouth, using only HVE suction for the HVE treatment period and then with the addition of an intraoral suction device for the combination treatment period. Agar plates were collected after each period and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were determined using an automatic colony counter. RESULTS: The use of a combination of devices resulted in significant reductions in CFUs compared with the use of the intraoral suction device alone (P < .001). The highest amounts of CFUs were found in the operating zone and on patients during both HVE and combination treatment periods. CONCLUSIONS: Within limitations of this study, the authors found significant reductions in the amount of microbial aerosols when both HVE and an intraoral suction device were used.

Overall, ~50% of participants affirmed that the workshops were useful to improve time management, organize tasks and adapt to the new study modality imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 60% of the students found the application of the provided tools during the interventions (SMART and COMPASS) useful to determine personal values and set a proper mindset for coping with distance learning. Further, 93.3% of the respondents applied the SMART strategy learned to set goals at least once during the confinement time. These findings were also seen in the thematic analysis. Conclusions: Overall, most of the students found the workshops useful and were able to practice what they had learned during this pandemic lockdown. Medical schools and higher education institutions should evaluate the possibility of formally including study habit preparation for undergraduates' students in order to provide resilience and successful academic adaptation during an ever-changing world.","Tobar, Claudia; Garcés, María Sol; Crespo-Andrade, María C; Sisa, Ivan",Med Sci Educ,330,24

Since then, many vaccines were rushed into testing, bypassing animal experimentations, with more than 200 pharma companies in different countries declaring the development of different vaccines, each with their own strategy for generating immunity, despite the arguments of many infectious disease experts that 18 months for a first vaccine is an incredibly aggressive schedule because it takes an average of 10 years to develop a vaccine. Ten vaccine candidates have already entered phase 3 clinical trials in humans. These vaccines rely on different types of technology, the most innovative of which use the genetic material messenger RNA. Many provocative questions and genuine concerns have been raised, such as short durations of efficacy and safety follow-ups, lack of identified correlates of protection, morbidity and mortality cases reported shortly after vaccination, uncertainties regarding the risk of enhanced disease on exposure to the virus in the long-term, the possibility of viral transmission after vaccination, the reported reduced efficacies of these vaccines against new variants, the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in the previously excluded subgroups (such as children, pregnant women, the frail elderly high-risk population, and immunocompromised individuals), the unknown risk of immunogenicity-induced autoimmune diseases, cancer and chronic inflammation, the risk of genome transformation (mainly in the presence of reverse transcriptase), and finally the potential coercion that may be imposed by either public or private sectors on citizens to receive the vaccine. Many plausible questions are apparent, with no clear and convincing answers.","Barbari, Antoine",Exp Clin Transplant,330,21

Many countries limited the delivery of elective surgery. To date, COVID-19's impact on elective surgery in LMICs has been unquantified. We use operative data from a large international non-government cleft organization to compare case volume for 2019 and 2020 to quantify the impact of COVID-19. Methods: Smile Train supports a partner network of over 1100 partners globally to deliver treatment to children with cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP). Treatment data is documented into a proprietary digital platform, Smile Train Express. We compared monthly treatment data for 2019 to 2020, by country, and by World Bank Income group to describe the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on CLP surgery in LMICs. Results: Our analysis shows 25,444 (31.4%) fewer primary operations performed between January and December 2020 than in the same period in 2019 with the most significant decline in procedures observed in April 2020. Many countries resumed elective surgery for CLP procedures from May onward and volume approximated that of pre-pandemic baseline by November of 2020. Conclusions: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on health systems and service delivery across the world. We find that this is evident in the delivery of CLP surgery in LMICs. The impact is characterized by a dramatic decrease in surgery rates in April of 2020 with a recovery of surgical volume from July 2020 onwards. The rate of surgical rate recovery is consistent across World Bank Income groups.","Vander Burg, R.; Agrawal, K.; Desai, P.; Desalu, I.; Donkor, P.",Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery - Global Open,330,26

As a result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of financial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty. Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long run.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases were searched using a search strategy tailored to each database. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used for the studies' qualitative assessment. The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I2) measure. RESULTS: In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769;95% CI :0.563-1.050;p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078;95% CI: 0.908-1.279;p= 0.392). However, remdesivir had a significant effect on clinical improvement at day 14 compared to placebo/control (OR= 1.447;95% CI: 1.005-2.085;p= 0.047) and reduced serious adverse events (RR= 0.736;95% CI: 0.611-0.887;p= 0.001). CONCLUSION: Remdesivir has positive effects on clinical improvement, and reduction of the risk of serious adverse events. However, it does not influence the mortality at day 14 of treatment.","Tasavon Gholamhoseini, M.; Yazdi-Feyzabadi, V.; Goudarzi, R.; Mehrolhassani, M. H.",J Pharm Pharm Sci,330,6

High hospitalization levels due to the pandemic outbreak have caused the intensive care units to work above capacity. PURPOSE: A data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling approach was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of regions (i.e. city, country or clinical commissioning groups) against the pandemic outbreak. The objective is to enable related authorities better manage the struggle against the outbreak and put in place the emergency action plans immediately. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DEA method was used to measure the efficiency scores of countries. Super efficiency DEA method was also applied to countries based on the level of efficiencies they have achieved. Sixteen countries were selected that have been facing with Covid19 pandemic outbreak for at least 5 consecutive weeks after their 100th confirmed case. RESULTS: A total of 80 DEA models were developed, that is, 16 DEA models for each week. The percentage of efficient countries decreased dramatically over time, from 43.75% in the first week to 25% in the fifth week. Unlike most European countries, China and South Korea increased their effectiveness after first week of implementing all the necessary measures. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light into better understanding the effectiveness of policies adopted by countries and their management strategy in dealing with Covid19 pandemic. Our model will enable political leaders to identify inadequate policies as quickly as possible and learn from their peers for more effective decisions.","Ordu, Muhammed; Kirli Akin, Hediye; Demir, Eren",Int. j. health plann. manage,330,1

METHODS: Participants (n=866,192; 33.6+7.4kg/m2 ) who joined a digital weight management program (WW) in the first 30-weeks of 2020 (COVID-19 cohort) were compared to participants (n=624,043; 33.1+7.2kg/m2 ) who joined the same program during the same time period in 2019 (Control cohort). Weight change (%) and self-monitoring over the first 4-weeks of enrollment were compared between the cohorts. Significance was defined as meeting the criteria for a small effect (d>0.2) RESULTS: Over the 30-week enrollment period, the COVID-19 cohort experienced significantly less weight loss than the Control cohort but only for 7-weeks of enrollments. The COVID-19 cohort also had fewer days of food tracking, but only for 3 weeks of enrollments. There were no differences in the self-monitoring of weight and activity at any time between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Over a 30-week enrollment period, COVID-19 had negative effects on both weight loss and food self-monitoring, but the effects were short-lived. Those participating in evidence-based weight management programs can expect similar levels of initial weight loss as those experienced pre-pandemic.","Bullard, Tiffany; Medcalf, Adam; Rethorst, Chad; Foster, Gary D",Obesity (Silver Spring),330,16

Public authorities have therefore had the difficult task of sustaining such protective but stressful behaviour. Evidence shows that besides egoistic drives, the motivation for self-isolation behaviour could be altruistic. However, the type and role of prosocial motivation in the current pandemic is underestimated and its interaction with risk exposure and psychological distress is largely unknown. Here we show that affective empathy for the most vulnerable predicts acceptance of lockdown measures. In two retrospective studies, one with a general population and one with COVID-19 positive patients, we found that (1) along with health risk exposure, affective empathy is a predictor of acceptance of lockdown measures (2) social covariates and psychological distress have no significant impact. Our results support the need to focus on altruistic behaviours while informing the public instead of on fear-inducing messages.","Petrocchi, Serena; Bernardi, Sheila; Malacrida, Roberto; Traber, Rafael; Gabutti, Luca; Grignoli, Nicola",Sci Rep,330,30

This is an uncommon condition, with the potential for missed diagnosis and potential harm to the patient. CASE REPORT The patient was an elderly woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Of note, she had recently recovered from COVID-19. Because the woman presented with right-sided weakness and pain in the back of her neck, the stroke team was activated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her neck revealed a very subtle hyperdensity, which on further investigation was found to be an acute epidural hematoma at C2-C3 space through the C6 vertebra. While awaiting surgery, the patient had spontaneous improvement of her right-sided weakness and her condition eventually was managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is an uncommon condition, and a high index of suspicion is required to accurately diagnose and appropriately manage it. In the case presented here, the hematoma was subtle on the CT scan, and the patient's weakness easily could have been misdiagnosed as an ischemic stroke. That may have resulted in administration of thrombolytics, potentially causing significant harm. In addition, the patient had recently recovered from COVID-19 disease, which may or may not be incidental. Further observation will be required to determine if there is a spike in similar cases, which may be temporally associated with the novel coronavirus.","Lim, Shawn Wen-Yang; Wong, Evelyn",Am J Case Rep,330,6

In this study, we investigated infection rates, clinical characteristics, occupational exposure and household transmission among all symptomatic HCWs screened by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR between 17 March (French lockdown) and 20 April. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was proposed to symptomatic (new cough or dyspnoea) HCWs at Creteil Hospital in one of the Parisian suburbs most severely affected by COVID-19. Data on occupational profile, living situation and household, together with self-isolation and mask use at home were collected, as well as the number of cases in the household. RESULTS: The incidence rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 5% (110/2188). A total of 110 (35%) of the 314 HCWs tested positive and 9 (8%) were hospitalised. On multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with positive RT-PCR were occupational profile with direct patient facing (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 8.8), p<0.03), and presence of anosmia (OR 5.7, 95% CI 3.1 to 10.6), p<0.0001). Being a current smoker was associated with negative RT-PCR (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7), p=0.005). Transmission from HCWs to household members was reported in 9 (14%) cases, and 2 deaths occurred. Overall, self-isolation was possible in 52% of cases, but only 31% of HCWs were able to wear a mask at home. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report infection rates among HCWs during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France and the lockdown period, highlighting the risk related to occupational profile and household transmission.","Krastinova, Evguenia; Garrait, Valérie; Lecam, Marie-Thérèse; Coste, André; Varon, Emmanuelle; Delacroix, Isabelle; Si Ali, Amine; Jung, Camille; Smati, Mounira; Cherbit, Muriel; Maître, Bernard; Pairon, Jean-Claude; Andujar, Pascal",Occup. environ. med,330,16

We compared the learning outcomes of standard in-person CPR training (ST) with alternative methods of training such as hybrid or online-only training (AT) on CPR performance, quality, and knowledge among laypersons with no previous CPR training. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles from January 1995 to May 2020. Covidence was used to review articles by two independent researchers. Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess quality of the manuscripts. RESULTS: Of the 978 articles screened, twenty met the final inclusion criteria. All included studies had an experimental design and moderate to strong global quality rating. The trainees in ST group performed better on calling 911, time to initiate chest compressions, hand placement and chest compression depth. Trainees in AT group performed better in assessing scene safety, calling for help, response time including initiating first rescue breathing, adequate ventilation volume, compression rates, shorter hands-off time, confidence, willingness to perform CPR, ability to follow CPR algorithm, and equivalent or better knowledge retention than standard teaching methodology. CONCLUSION: AT methods of CPR training provide an effective alternative to the standard in-person CPR for large scale public training.","Ali, Daniyal Mansoor; Hisam, Butool; Shaukat, Natasha; Baig, Noor; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock; Epstein, Jonathan L; Goralnick, Eric; Kivela, Paul D; McNally, Bryan; Razzak, Junaid",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,330,16

CoVs are a large group of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which encode large replicase polyproteins that are processed by viral peptidases to generate the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) that mediate viral RNA synthesis. Papain-like peptidases (PLPs) and chymotrypsin-like cysteine 3C-like peptidase are essential for coronaviral replication and represent attractive antiviral drug targets. Furthermore, CoVs utilize the activation of their envelope spike glycoproteins by host cell peptidases to gain entry into cells. CoVs have evolved multiple strategies for spike protein activation, including the utilization of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. In this review, viral and host peptidases involved in CoV cell entry and replication are discussed in depth, with an emphasis on papain-like cysteine cathepsins. Furthermore, important findings on cysteine peptidase inhibitors with regard to virus attenuation are highlighted as well as the potential of such inhibitors for future treatment strategies for CoV-related diseases.","Pislar, Anja; Mitrovic, Ana; Sabotic, Jerica; Pecar Fonovic, Ursa; Perisic Nanut, Milica; Jakos, Tanja; Senjor, Emanuela; Kos, Janko",PLoS Pathog,330,16

Environmental conditions, behaviors, and social determinants of health account for 80 percent of overall health outcomes. With shortages of clinical providers stressing an already burdened healthcare system, Community Health Workers (CHWs) can bridge healthcare gaps by addressing these nonmedical factors influencing health. This paper details how a comprehensive training model equips CHWs for workforce readiness so they can perform at the top of their practice and profession and deliver well-coordinated client/patient-centered care. Methods: Literature reviews and studies revealed that training CHWs alone is not sufficient for successful workforce readiness, rather CHW integration within the workforce is needed. Consequently, this comprehensive training model is developed for CHWs with varying skill levels and work settings, and supervisors to support organizational readiness and CHW integration efforts. A systematic training program development approach along with detailed implementation methods are presented. Continuing education sessions to support CHW practice and Organizational Readiness Training for supervisors, leadership and team members directly engaged with CHWs in the workplace are also discussed. CHWs were involved in all phases of the research, development, implementation, and actively serve in evaluations and curriculum review committees. Results: Components of the comprehensive training model are presented with an emphasis on the core CHW training. Two CHW training tracks are offered using three delivery modalities. Process measures with student learning objectives, outcome measures developed using the Kirkpatrick model to capture attitude, perceptions, knowledge acquisition, confidence, behavior, and overall experience, and impact stories by two CHWs are presented. Lessons learned from the implementation of the training program are discussed in three categories: Practice-driven curricula, student-centered training implementation, and adaptations in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This comprehensive training model recognizes that training CHWs in a robust training program is key as the demand for well-rounded CHWs increases. Furthermore, a comprehensive training program must include training for supervisors, leadership, and team members working directly with CHWs. Such efforts strengthen the CHW practice and profession to support the delivery of well-coordinated and holistic client/patient-centered care.","Lee, Lily K; Ruano, Elizabeth; Fernández, Pamela; Ortega, Silvia; Lucas, Carlos; Joachim-Célestin, Maud",Front Public Health,330,26
401220,401220,401220,Rebirth in a COVID hospital: a point of view,16.095821,6.018355,2021,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. This receptor is avidly expressed in the pancreatic islets, suggesting the virus may target β-cell function. 17% of adults with COVID-19 have evidence of pancreatic injury. There is a direct relation between insulin resistance and COVID-19 severity and mortality with patients with higher insulin resistance presenting with higher inflammatory response. Fulminant type 1 diabetes (fT1D) has abrupt onset of symptoms with insulinopenia without evidence of autoimmunity, usually preceded by viral illness. Clinical case: A 12-year-old Hispanic male presented with a week history of polyuria, polydipsia, headache, and fatigue but no weight loss, fever, cough, anosmia, or diarrhea. Laboratory testing revealed new onset diabetes with DKA with HbA1C 11.3%, blood pH 7.04, glucose 381 mg/dL, C-peptide 0.6 ng/mL, β-hydroxybutyrate 8.2 mmol/L, and a positive nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but no elevation of inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR and ferritin). There was evidence of mild pancreatic injury (lipase 179 U/L, n:15-110 U/L), and all autoantibodies for autoimmune diabetes were negative. He was pubertal (Tanner 3), non-obese (BMI Z score -0.3) and without acanthosis nigricans. Past medical and family history were non-contributory. He was treated with IV insulin at 0.1 u/kg/h until DKA resolved within 24 h then transitioned to subcutaneous insulin at 1 u/kg/day. He did not have signs of systemic inflammatory response, need for respiratory support, or glucocorticoids but had persistent hyperglycemia prompting an increase of insulin dosing and resumption of IV insulin. His insulin requirements continued to increase up to 4 u/kg/d with sustained hyperglycemia indicative of an exceptional state of insulin resistance. On Day 6 of admission metformin was initiated, on Day 9 insulin requirements declined and he was discharged on an insulin regimen close to 1.5 u/kg/d. Eventually metformin was discontinued on Day 20 after diagnosis without rebound in insulin requirements. On Day 28 he had improved glycemic control (HbA1c 8.8%) at insulin doses more appropriate for his age and pubertal status (0.9 u/kg/d). Clinical lessons: We report a case of autoantibody negative diabetes with pancreatic injury and marked insulin resistance unrelated to systemic inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. The clinical presentation was reminiscent of fT1D with the exception of exceptional insulin resistance. This is perhaps a novel form of diabetes mellitus not otherwise classified. Although the pathophysiology remains obscure, it is plausible that it is mediated by direct islet injury. Notably, there was a discordance between the severity of illness and insulin resistance suggesting an intrinsic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on glucose hemostasis.","Martinez, Alfonso Hoyos Hicks Kelly Anne Moorjani Tracy Patel Bell Jennifer Lin Yuezhen",Journal of the Endocrine Society,330,1

METHODS: Forty departments shared their data on acute and elective thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures between January and May 2020 and January and May 2019 in Europe, Asia and the USA. Admission rates as well as delay from onset of symptoms to referral were compared. RESULTS: No differences in the number of acute thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures were observed between 2020 and the reference period in 2019 [incidence rates ratio (IRR): 0.96, confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.04; P = 0.39]. Also, no difference in the time interval from acute onset of symptoms to referral was recorded (<12 h 32% vs > 12 h 68% in 2020, < 12 h 34% vs > 12 h 66% in 2019 P = 0.29).

Within this framework, it is crucial to ensure no disruption to essential oncological services and guarantee the optimal care.This is a structured proposal for the management of lung cancer, comprising three levels of priorities, namely: tier 1 (high priority), tier 2 (medium priority) and tier 3 (low priority)-defined according to the criteria of the Cancer Care Ontario, Huntsman Cancer Institute and Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.The manuscript emphasises the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and reconsiders all steps from diagnosis, staging and treatment.These recommendations should, therefore, serve as guidance for prioritising the different aspects of cancer care to mitigate the possible negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of our patients.As the situation is rapidly evolving, practical actions are required to guarantee the best patients' treatment while protecting and respecting their rights, safety and well-being. In this environment, cancer practitioners have great responsibilities: provide timely, appropriate, compassionate and justified cancer care, while protecting themselves and their patients from being infected with COVID-19. In case of shortages, resources must be distributed fairly. Consequently, the following recommendations can be applied with significant nuances, depending on the time and location for their use, considering variable constraints imposed to the health systems.

We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Twenty-nine patient files were investigated in group 1 and group 2 was created with 52 consecutive patients with COVID-19 having age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, and disease course. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of inhospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in the group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay, and transferred to intensive care unit were found to be statistically significantly higher in the group 1. In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared with consecutive patients with COVID-19 presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters.","Ikitimur, Hande; Borku Uysal, Betul; Cengiz, Mahir; Ikitimur, Baris; Uysal, Harun; Ozcan, Erkan; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Seyhan, Serhat; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",J. med. virol,330,32

This forced university to transition from face-to-face education to virtual distance education. This was prior to them having any information on the digital tools that lecturers and students have access to, for the teaching-learning process. Faced with this situation, this study seeks to identify the knowledge, use and ways of the learning of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), before and during the emergency. A total of 126 students and 48 lecturers from a private university in Lima were surveyed virtually. The results showed that there were no substantial changes in the knowledge and use of ICT, in both groups, except for the videoconference platform, which was established by the university for the development of the classes. Likewise, it was found that lecturers improved their self-evaluation during the emergency. On the other hand, ICT learning occurred basically on the lecturers and students' own initiative and in a self-taught way, especially for students, with a low incidence of formal courses within the university. These results show that both lecturers and university students were not prepared to face the use of digital tools for the teaching-learning environment which was required for them in the context of this health emergency. © 2020 ACM.","Bardales Mendoza, O.; Fernandez Bringas, T.; Saavedra Bendezú, L.",ACM Int.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results.

Textual sentiment classification harnesses the full computational potential of deep learning models. Typically, these research works are carried either with a popular open-source data corpus, or self-extracted short phrase texts from Twitter, Reddit, or web-scrapped text data from other resources. Rarely do we see a large amount of data on a current ongoing event is being collected and cultured further. Also, an even more complex task would be to model the data from a currently ongoing event, not only for scaling the sentiment accuracy but also for making a predictive analysis for the same. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for achieving sentiment evaluation accuracy by using a deep neural network on live-streamed tweets on Coronavirus and future case growth prediction. We develop a large tweet corpus exclusively based on the Coronavirus tweets. We split the data into train and test sets, alongside we perform polarity classification and trend analysis. The refined outcome from the trend analysis helps to train the data to provide an incremental learning curvature for our neural network, and we obtain an accuracy of 90.67%. Finally, we provide a statistical-based future prediction for Coronavirus cases growth. Not only our model outperforms several previous state-of-art experiments in overall sentiment accuracy comparison for similar tasks, but it also maintains a throughout performance stability among all the test cases when tested with several popular open-source text corpora.","Das, Sourav; Kolya, Anup Kumar",Evol Intell,330,29

In this study, data were collected from a national sample of 1141 participants from the United States to examine how beliefs and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been shaped by sociopolitical characteristics. The relationships between social predictors; perceived severity, knowledge, and fear of the virus; and health behaviors were tested using path analysis. Social characteristics significantly predicted perceived severity, knowledge, and fear, as well as health behaviors, even after controlling for an objective indicator of the risk of contracting the virus. Our findings suggest that perceptions and knowledge of the virus, especially believing that the virus poses a serious threat to one's individual health, are important determinants of behavior, but also that perceptions and knowledge are strongly driven by social and cultural factors above and beyond political affiliation.","Franz, Berkeley; Dhanani, Lindsay Y",J. behav. med,330,16

This study aimed to analyse the spatial characteristics, distribution, and influence of nitrogen forms in two different river catchments situated in eastern China. Using sequential extraction methods, the study divided sediment nitrogen into four forms, namely, an ion-exchangeable form (IEF-N), weak acid-extractable form (WAEF-N), strong alkali-extractable form (SAEF-N), and strong oxidant-extractable form (SOEF-N). The results for the two catchments showed significant differences in the physicochemical properties as well as variations in space. The mean proportion of total transferable nitrogen (TTN) in the Anhe, Suihe, Dongtiaoxi, and Xitiaoxi rivers accounted for 50.64%, 32.87%, 34.63%, and 40.45%, respectively. The results also revealed a higher total TTN in the Hongze watershed than in the Tiaoxi watershed. The order of mean TTN in sediments from the Hongze watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > IEF-N > WAEF-N, whereas that for the Tiaoxi watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > WAEF-N > IEF-N.

This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) may be the primary factor related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum and the risk for mortality, as subclinical nutritional deficiencies may be unmasked by any significant increase in oxidative stress. NAD+ levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19. Further consumption of NAD+ in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1. This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD+ and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically. The significance of this, if proven, has far-reaching consequences in the management of COVID-19 especially in third world countries, where resources and finances are limited.","Miller, R; Wentzel, A R; Richards, G A",Med Hypotheses,330,16

METHODS: Nationwide retrospective case-control study was conducted to compare the effect of HCQ and LPV/r on viral shedding duration among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 using the reimbursement data of National Health Insurance Service. After propensity score matching (PSM), multivariate analysis was conducted to determine statistically significant risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Overall, 4197 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were included. Patients were categorized into three groups: LPV/r (n = 1268), HCQ (n = 801), and standard care without HCQ or LPV/r (controls, n = 2128). The median viral shedding duration was 23 (IQR 17-32), 23 (IQR 16-32), and 18 (IQR 12-25) days in the LPV/r, HCQ, and control groups, respectively. Even after PSM, the viral shedding duration was not significantly different between LPV/r and HCQ groups: 23 (IQR, 17-32) days versus 23 (IQR, 16-32) days. On multivariate analysis, old age, malignancy, steroid use, and concomitant pneumonia were statistically significant risk factors for prolonged viral shedding. CONCLUSION: The viral shedding duration was similar between HCQ and LPV/r treatment groups.

A significantly higher number (p = 0.0013) of patients were administered steroids at some point during the treatment. Conclusion: Despite the limited sample size, it is evident that there is a significant increase in the incidence of angioinvasive maxillofacial fungal infections in diabetic patients treated for SARS-CoV-2 with a strong association with corticosteroid administration.","Moorthy, Aditya; Gaikwad, Rohith; Krishna, Shreya; Hegde, Raghuraj; Tripathi, K K; Kale, Preeti G; Rao, P Subramanya; Haldipur, Deepak; Bonanthaya, Krishnamurthy",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,330,20

In this context, we launched a study to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the socio-economic impact of the spring outbreak in the population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-19 related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test. These associations were measured with univariate and multivariate analyses using a hybrid tree-based regression model. RESULTS: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. Approximately 8% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-19 related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyses adjusted on exposure factors showed that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were gender and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-19 related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.","Jantzen, Rodolphe; Noisel, Nolwenn; Camilleri-Broët, Sophie; Labbé, Catherine; Malliard, Thibault de; Payette, Yves; Broët, Philippe",BMC Infect Dis,330,14

Sofía is a Mexican health care and technology startup that implemented an app-based telemedicine program during this pandemic in Mexico. Materials and Methods: The telemedicine program included on-demand video consultations with internal medicine specialists from March to September 2020. In the following study, we present a descriptive analysis of all the patients in the telemedicine program, called Coronaid. Results: 2,585 video consultations were conducted for a total of 1,545 patients and 44.4% of these were associated with respiratory symptoms. Of all patients, 46% were female and the mean age was 34 years, 52.2% were overweight or obese, and 25% presented at least one comorbid condition. Aside from respiratory complaints, the most common chief complaints were associated with gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and genitourinary symptoms. Patient satisfaction after video consultation services was >80%. Discussion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an application-based telemedicine program had a high patient satisfaction rate in a significant sample of young patients, which can be attributed to the accessibility of the medical services and widespread use of smartphones in this patient demographic. Conclusion: Telemedicine has proven to be a useful, safe, and effective tool to improve patients' health, which has been boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of mobile applications and video consultation services can encourage patients to improve their health and prevent complications in the short and long terms.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, Dan; Rocha-Haro, Andrea; Canales-Albarrán, Sofía Jimena; Núñez-García, Edgar; León-Mayorga, Yasshid",Telemed. j. e. health,330,23

Detection of the viral RNA through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal or throat sample is the preferred method of diagnosis. Recent evidence has suggested that COVID-19 patients can shed the SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks. Herein, we report six cases of COVID-19 who had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 on repeat RT-PCR testing reaching up to 9 weeks. The spectrum of cases described ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A full understanding of the virus's transmission dynamics needs further research. Prolonged viral shedding currently has unclear implications on the management and isolation decisions-the role of the cycle threshold (Ct) value in guiding therapeutic decisions is yet to be clarified. More data on the relationship between Ct values and viral cultivation are needed, especially in patients with prolonged viral shedding, to understand the virus's viability and infectivity.","Alsaud, Arwa E; Nair, Arun Prabhakaran; Matarneh, Ahmad S; Sasi, Sreethish; El Hassan, Rania; Khan, Fahmi; Coyle, Peter; Abu Khattab, Mohamed; Mohamed, Mouhand F H",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,330,16

DESIGN: Multilevel study. SETTING: A national survey was conducted by Qualtrics from August 24 to September 11, 2020. The state-level variables were constructed on data from multiple sources. SUBJECTS: 2,440 respondents 18 years and older from all 50 states and D.C. MEASURES: The outcome variable is the public response to COVID-19 measured by threat perception, behavioral adjustment, and policy support. The predictors include individual-level sociodemographic factors and state-level indicators about public health conditions, political context, and economic recovery. ANALYSIS: Multilevel structural equation modeling is used for statistical estimation. RESULTS: People from states with more COVID-19 cases (ß = 0.020, p < 0.1), mandatory face mask policies (ß = 0.069, p < 0.05), and liberal governments (ß = 0.002, p < 0.05) are more likely to respond while people from states whose economies have recovered closer to the pre-pandemic level are less likely to do so (ß = -0.005, p < 0.05). Regarding individual-level predictors, older people (ß = 0.005, p < 0.001) and people with better education (ß = 0.029, p < 0.01), leaning toward the Democrat Party (ß = 0.066, p < 0.001) and liberal political ideology (ß = 0.094, p < 0.001), and have stronger generalized trust (ß = 0.033, p < 0.001) are more likely to respond than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: Differences in the public response to the pandemic stem from variations in individual characteristics and contextual factors of states where people live. These findings contribute to the rapidly growing literature and have implications for public health policies.","Hao, Feng; Shao, Wanyun",Am J Health Promot,330,14

As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students' willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89, p = 0.002)-when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students' willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own's health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Lazarus, Gilbert; Findyartini, Ardi; Putera, Azis Muhammad; Gamalliel, Nico; Nugraha, David; Adli, Imam; Phowira, Jason; Azzahra, Lyanna; Ariffandi, Bagas; Widyahening, Indah Suci",BMC Med Educ,330,10

Traditionally, residency and fellowship training program applications involve in-person interviews conducted on-site, with only a minority of programs offering interviews remotely via a virtual platform. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is anticipated that most interviews will be conducted virtually for the 2021 application cycle, and possibly beyond. Therefore, GME training programs need to prepare for the transition to virtual interviews using evidence-based practices. At the University of California, San Francisco, a multidisciplinary task force was convened to review existing literature about virtual interviews and determine best practices. This article summarizes these findings, first discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the virtual interview format and then providing evidence-based best practices for GME training programs. Specifically, the authors make the following recommendations: develop a detailed plan for the interview process, consider using standardized interview questions, recognize and respond to potential biases that may be amplified with the virtual interview format, prepare your own trainees for virtual interviews, develop electronic materials and virtual social events to approximate the interview day, and collect data about virtual interviews at your own institution.

the world have infected with the COVID-19 virus The SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in the human upper respiratory tract Infected people produce large amounts of the virus in their upper respiratory tract during an introductory period, which leads to more spread of the virus to other people The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces However, the rapid spread of the disease suggests that other routes, such as airborne transmission, may play a role Several research studies have been performed to evaluate the possible transmission of the virus through the air Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, recent work has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places Experience and knowledge of the mechanism of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV also support this hypothesis During COVID-19 pandemic, while the hospitals can be one of the most important centers in providing health care services, due to the inappropriate air ventilation and purification system, high traffic of people;some of them have been introduced themselves as one of the most high-risk sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission The present study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 in the air and surfaces of ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals in Tehran So that, in addition to determining the possibility of inhalation and contact exposure in ICU, which is the main ward for presenting special medical care to patients with severe acute respiratory infections, it aimed to assess a hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission Methods: This cross-sectional experimental study was performed on April 29, 2020 in the Covid-19 ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals, Tehran, Iran The area of ward was 50 m2 and has seven beds, all of which were occupied at the time of sampling, and five medical staff were involving there All patients were equipped with oxygen masks and all the staff used all conventional personal protective equipment such as Honeywell-75FFP100NL respirators On average, surface disinfection was performed three times a day The general ventilation system included the ceiling diffuser to supply fresh air into the room and wall-mounted exhaust vent and did not use natural ventilation (such as opening the window) It should be noted that the exhaust system did not work well at the time of sampling This study was carried out in two phases including surface and air sampling Impinger method was applied to air sampling Thus, at a distance of 1 5 to 1 8 meters from the ground, the air of the ICU ward was passed through a sampling pump with an flow rate of 1 5 l/min into the porous midget impeller-30 ml containing 15 ml of virus transmission medium (PVTM) for 45 minutes To reverse the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, the reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reaction method was used Sampling of surfaces was done with the help of swabs impregnated with the solution of the Viral Transport Medium from a certain area (25 cm2) from the desired part and putting it inside the vial containing the transfer medium (protein stabilizer, antibiotic and buffer solution) They are also were analyzed by RT-PCR technique Prior to sampling, all laboratory equipment used was sterilized and autoclaved using a 70% alcohol solution according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol The air sampling was done at a distance of 1 5 to 2 meters from the patient's bed The devices used to measure temperature, humidity and air velocity were multi-purpose anemometer (China BENETE, GM8910,) and air pressure, digital barometer (AIRFLOW, DB2, USA) The mean parameters of weather conditions included: air temperature 24 ° C, humidity 35%, air pressure 1005 mb and air velocity of 0 09 m / s Results: Of the ten air samples, 6 were positive (60%), with the highest RNA concentrations observed at the point between beds 6 and 7 (3913 copies per ml) Most of the reported negative air samples were from the middle of the ward, which was further away from the patients' beds The mean RNA concentration of the virus was obtained 820 ± 2601 copies per milliliter In addition, of ten samples taken from different surfaces of the ward, 4 samples were positive (40%) and the highest concentration (8318 copies per ml) was related to the table next to bed number 3 All positive samples were observed close to the patient's bed, and the mean RNA concentration of the virus was 3227 ± 3674 copies per milliliter Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that the virus was present in the inhaled air of the ward and its surfaces, especially in areas close to the bed of patients These findings underscore the airborne transmission of the virus along with other ways of transmission, such as person-to-person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces Due to the environmental pollution of the studied ICU ward to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the effective implementation of air isolation methods such as the use of respiratory protection equipment (N95 mask) and powered air-purifying respirator as well as ensuring the correct function of hospital ventilation systems and improving it, is essential for the protection of health care staff Health care workers need to be continuously monitored and screened from a COVID-19 perspective, and infection prevention and control protocols (IPCs), such as respiratory protection, regular cleaning of the environment, and effective disinfection of areas have been implemented In the case of the virus, the spread of the disease through both direct methods (drops and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) has almost been proven, which reaffirms the need for precautionary measures regarding airborne isolation against the virus It has been suggested that in order to more accurately assess the transmission behavior of the virus, similar studies but longitudinal ones have been done from the admission to discharge of the patients in different wards of

They can prolong QT interval, cause torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death. We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study. One hundred seventy-two confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study, hospitalized at Babol University of Medical Sciences hospitals between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment. Results: 83.1% of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs. 16.9% of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine. The mean age of patients was 59.2 ± 15.4.The mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group, but it had no significant statistical difference (462.5 ± 43.1 milliseconds vs. 464.3 ± 59.1 milliseconds; p = 0.488). Generally, 22.1% of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment. Male gender, or baseline QTc &#8805; 450 milliseconds, or high-risk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval. Due to QTc prolongation, fourteen patients did not continue therapy after four days. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients treated by hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome. The numbers of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasize careful cardiac monitoring during therapy, especially in high-risk patients.","Eftekhar, Seyed Parsa; Kazemi, Sohrab; Barary, Mohammad; Javanian, Mostafa; Ebrahimpour, Soheil; Ziaei, Naghmeh",Cardiovasc Ther,330,22

For example, the outbreak in Beijing or Guangzhou would result in a $\sim$90% increase of COVID-19 cases at the end of the Chinese New Year holiday. After the implementation of a series of control measures, human mobility had experienced substantial changes toward containing the spread of COVID-19.

Methods: Clinical studies on effectiveness and safety of CHM for COVID-19 were included. We summarized general characteristics of included studies, evaluated methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), analyzed the use of CHM, estimated the effectiveness and safety of CHM. Results: A total of 58 clinical studies were identified including RCTs (17.24%, 10), non-randomized controlled trials (1.72%, 1), retrospective studies with a control group (18.97%, 11), case-series (20.69%, 12) and case-reports (41.38%, 24). No high methodological quality RCTs were identified. The most frequently tested Chinese patent medicine, Chinese herbal medicine injection or prescribed herbal decoction were: Lianhua Qingwen granule/capsule, Xuebijing injection and Maxing Shigan Tang.

In addition, compared with conventional western therapy, CHM plus conventional western therapy had potential advantages in increasing the resolution rate and shortening the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improving the negative conversion rate of nucleic acid test, and increasing the number of patients with inflammatory disappearance or shortening the time from receiving treatment to beginning of inflammation disappearance. For adverse events, pooled data showed that there was no statistical difference between the CHM and the control groups. Conclusion: Current low certainty evidence suggests that there may be a tendency that CHM plus conventional western therapy is superior to conventional western therapy alone.

The beginning of the disease was in the Chinese city of Wuhan and then it has been spread and became a global epidemic. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease is absolutely necessary to control the epidemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to present a review of the contribution of machine learning (ML) and IoT to confront the epidemic. METHODS: Diagnosis using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a definite diagnosis, but this method takes time, while a diagnosis using a computed tomography (CT) scan is a faster approach to diagnosis. However, a large number of patients need a CT scan, which puts a lot of pressure on the radiologist so visual fatigue may lead to diagnostic errors so there is an urgent need for additional solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an efficient tool to combat COVID-19 disease. Computer scientists have been developing many systems to handle this epidemic. RESULTS: It was found that ML is an efficient and powerful AI technology that can be used for trustworthy COVID-19 detecting and diagnosis from X-ray and CT images and it can be a potential method for diagnosis in the radiology department. In addition, ML can be used in segmentation, prediction purposes for COVID-19. Furthermore, ML can effectively support drug discovery procedure and can reduce clinical failures. CONCLUSION: IoT has a significant role in monitoring an individual's health and COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper also highlights the challenges of employing ML and intelligent IoT for fighting COVID-19. t © 2021 Chinmay Chakraborty et al., licensed to EAI.","Chakraborty, C.; Abougreen, A.

Nevertheless, community spread of COVID-19 has still occurred. We aimed to assess the settings where COVID-19 transmission occurred and determine the fraction of transmission events that occurred in settings where masks are not usually worn. METHODS: we reviewed detailed information provided by the Hong Kong Department of Health on local COVID-19 cases diagnosed up to 30 September 2020 to determine the most likely settings in which transmission occurred. We classified them in probably mask-on or mask-of and compared the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in these settings. RESULTS: among the 2425 cases (65.3%, 2425/3711) with information on transmission setting, 77.6% of the transmission occurred in household and social settings where face masks are not usually worn. Infections that occurred in mask-on settings were more likely to be asymptomatic (adjusted odds ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.68). CONCLUSIONS: we conclude that universal mask-wearing can reduce transmission, but transmission can continue to occur in settings where face masks are not usually worn. The higher proportion of asymptomatic cases in mask-on settings could be related to a milder disease presentation or earlier case detection.","Martín-Sánchez, Mario; Lim, Wey Wen; Yeung, Amy; Adam, Dillon C; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Lau, Eric H Y; Wu, Peng; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J",J. infect,330,16

Soon after, stay-at-home orders were initiated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a 7-week lockdown on maxillofacial trauma volume at TriStar Skyline Medical Center, a level II trauma center in Nashville, Tennessee. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The investigator designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of patients who presented for evaluation of maxillofacial trauma between March 23 and May 11 in the years 2019 and 2020. The primary predictor variable was evaluation of injures during the 2020 lockdown period or the same control period in 2019. The primary outcome variable was injury volume. Additional variables including demographic information, etiology, anatomic location, and initial disposition were evaluated. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed, with statistical significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: The study sample showed a 35.6% reduction in patients seen during the 2020 lockdown (n = 38) compared with 2019 (n = 59, P = .15). The proportion of male to female trauma patients increased during the lockdown period from 6.6:1 (n = 33 male, n = 5 female) in 2020 compared with 2.3:1 (n = 41 male, n = 18 female) in 2019 (P = .049). The number of assaults decreased by 65.2% (P = .22). The percentage of patients seen on an outpatient basis decreased from 27.1% (n = 16) to 5.3% (n = 2, P = .007) during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: The initial 7-week lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decrease in patients with maxillofacial trauma. The effect of the stay-at-home orders with resultant social distancing, has shown a decrease in maxillofacial trauma due to interpersonal violence.","Press, Steven G",J. oral maxillofac. surg,330,20

Influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on our day-case mastectomy pathway,16.245451,6.159385,2021,"Pinkeye is an economically important ocular disease occurring in all cattle producing areas of Australia. This study was undertaken to estimate the frequency of occurrence of the disease in Australia and treatment costs of the disease to the cattle industry using the sales of popular pinkeye medications as a surrogate indicator. Monthly sales data for Orbenin® Eye Ointment, Opticlox® Eye Ointment and Terramycin® Pinkeye Aerosol were analysed. We first estimated the number of cattle that can be treated with a syringe or a can and then using the data of sales of these pinkeye medications and the total cattle population of Australia, estimated the incidence of pinkeye. Probability distributions were used to include uncertainty around the estimates. Costs to producers were estimated based on retail prices of these medications. The results indicated that 732,864 syringes of Orbenin® Eye Ointment, 134,800 syringes of Opticlox® Eye Ointment and 27,755 cans of Terramycin® Pinkeye Aerosol are sold in Australia per year. Based on some assumptions of the number of cases treated by these drugs and number of cases left untreated, the number of cattle affected by pinkeye each year in Australia was estimated to be 2.80 million (95 % PI: 1.76, 4.65) or 10.25 % (95 % PI: 6.43, 16.97) of the entire Australian cattle herd. The cattle industry is expected to lose AU$ 9.67 million (95 % PI: 8.56, 13.11) each year just considering the cost of these three drugs. The results suggest that losses due to pinkeye in the Australian cattle industry are considerably higher than previously thought and should be used to inform the development of disease prevention and control policies.","Kneipp, Mac; Govendir, Merran; Laurence, Michael; Dhand, Navneet K",Prev Vet Med,330,16

In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.

However, diagnosis of borderline PM hypertrophy with TTE is not always feasible due to cumbersome interpretation of different PM diameters and the absence of precise normal ranges in the literature. The objective of this study was to obtain TTE normal cutoff values and to describe convenient indexes of PM dimensions. METHODS: Healthy volunteers with normal electrocardiogram were included for TTE assessment. Vertical (Vd) and horizontal (Hd) PM diameters were measured to obtain maximum diameter (Md) and areas of the anterolateral PM (APM) and posteromedial PM (PPM) to obtain PM total area (PMTA). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were screened, and 6 (7.3%) with bifid PM were excluded from analysis. APM and PPM had similar Vd (APM: 8.3 ± 1.2, PPM: 7.9 ± 1.1 mm2 , P = NS) and Hd (APM: 8.2 ± 1.3, PPM: 8.3 ± 1.2 mm2 , P = NS). Finally, Md (9 ± 1.2 mm; P95 = 11 mm) and PMTA (106.5 ± 24.2 mm2 ; P95 = 150.8 mm2 ) were obtained. Correlation between PMTA and Md was positive (P < .001), and out-of-range values for Md and PMTA were similar (2.6% vs 5.3%); there was excellent agreement between both indexes (K = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Maximum diameter and PMTA are convenient indexes to describe PM dimensions. However, given the high equivalence between both indexes, we propose the use of Md due to its simplicity and ease of calculation. Our findings suggest that patients with any PM diameter &#8805;12 mm should be considered abnormal.","Diaz Babio, Gonzalo; Vera Janavel, Gustavo L; Carrero, Celeste; Masson Juarez, Gerardo; Mezzadra, María; Constantin, Ivan; Garcia Botta, Teresa; Stutzbach, Pablo",Echocardiography,330,1

While AMI therapy improves blood flow during surgery, reperfusion-induced injury may also occur, leading to secondary cardiac damage or even death. Here, we investigated miR-129-5p in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, to explore reperfusion-related molecular mechanisms in myocardium. We used Sprague Dawley rats to establish a myocardial I/R model, with agomiR-129-5p injection, and used rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2) treated with anoxia-reoxygenation (A/R) to mimic myocardial I/R injury in vitro. A dual-luciferase reporter assay determined miR-129-5p binding to high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in H9c2 cells. We showed that exogenous miR-129-5p restored cardiac function indices, alleviated cardiac injury, relieved inflammatory effects and reduced infarct size and cell apoptosis in rat myocardium after I/R treatment. Elevated miR-129-5p induced a reduction in HMGB1 expression in rat I/R myocardium. miR-129-5p also targeted HMGB1, and negatively regulated its expression in H9c2 cells. Moreover, miR-129-5p overexpression in the cardiomyocytes reduced cell apoptosis and recovered cell viability after A/R injury, which was reversed by subsequent HMGB1 overexpression. These findings suggest miR-129-5p plays a cardioprotective role in ameliorating myocardial I/R injury in rats, by negatively targeting HMGB1. This mechanism provides new insights into the treatment of myocardium reperfusion-related damage.","Xing, Jingxian; Liu, Junyan; Liu, Juan; Xu, Zesheng",Gen Physiol Biophys,330,24

However, almost no studies focused on cold warning systems to prevent those health effects. For Nordic regions, like the province of Quebec in Canada, winter is long and usually very cold with an observed increase in mortality and hospitalizations throughout the season. However, there is no existing system specifically designed to follow in real-time this mortality increase throughout the season and to alert public health authorities prior to cold waves. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to establish a watch and warning system specifically for health impacts of cold, applied to different climatic regions of the province of Quebec. METHODOLOGY: A methodology previously used to establish the health-heat warning system in Quebec is adapted to cold. The approach identifies cold weather indicators and establishes thresholds related to extreme over-mortality or over-hospitalization events in the province of Quebec, Canada. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The final health-related thresholds proposed are between (-15 °C, -23 °C) and (-20 °C, -29 °C) according to the climatic region for excesses of mortality, and between (-13 °C, -23 °C) and (-17 °C, -30 °C) for excesses of hospitalization. These results suggest that the system model has a high sensitivity and an acceptable number of false alarms. This could lead to the establishment of a cold-health watch and warning system with valid indicators and thresholds for each climatic region of Quebec. It can be seen as a complementary system to the existing one for heat warnings, in order to help the public health authorities to be well prepared during an extreme cold event.","Yan, Bixun; Chebana, Fateh; Masselot, Pierre; Campagna, Céline; Gosselin, Pierre; Ouarda, Taha B M J; Lavigne, Éric",Sci Total Environ,330,31

One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","Lu, Qing-Bin",,330,0

In Spain, the heterogeneous distribution of the virus infection and the different health strategies have conditioned the morbidity and fatality rate. The aim of this study was to analyse the lethality of the infection by sex and age range in the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To perform the analysis, data were extracted from the Ministry of Health, Regional and Public Health Departments of the different AC. The infected population was estimated from the results of the ENE-COVID19 and the population registered on 1 January 2020 (INE) for the validity of the IgG antibody test with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The case fatality rate (TL) (deaths/1000 estimated infected) by sex and age (<20years, 20-64 and &#8805;65years) was calculated for each AC. The standardized case fatality ratio (REL) was calculated by the exact method (EPIDAT). RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain was 6% (range, 1.4% [Ceuta] -14.1% [Community of Madrid]). The TL in Spain was 9,6/1000, ranged per AC from 1/1000 in Melilla to 26.6/1000 in La Rioja, with no correlation between case fatality and prevalence of infection. The TL was higher in men (10.2/1000, ratio 1.17 with respect to women), except in Cataluña (ratio 0.92), and especially high in those over 64years of age in La Rioja (143.5/1000), Asturias (69.2/1000) and Basque Country (46.6/1000). Overall excess REL was found to be over 30% in La Rioja (2.91; 95%CI: 2.36-3.57), Asturias (1.51; 95%CI: 1.27-1.80), Basque Country (1.42; 95%CI: 1.31-1.54) and Extremadura (1.37; 95%CI: 1.20-1.57) and in those over 64 years in Madrid and the Canary Islands. CONCLUSIONS: SARs-CoV-2 virus infection has been very unevenly distributed in the different ACs, with notably differences in TL between ACs, particularly high in La Rioja, Asturias and the Basque Country. Is important to study the excess in TL the population over 64years of age in the ACs of Madrid and the Canary Islands.","Martín-Sánchez, V; Barquilla-García, A; Vitelli-Storelli, F; Segura-Fragoso, A; Ruiz-García, A; Serrano-Cumplido, A; Olmo-Quintana, V; Calderón-Montero, A",Semergen,330,16

Provided this, we develop a closed-form inference for an over-dispersed Poisson regression, especially for (over-dispersed) Bayesian Poisson wherein the exact inference is unobtainable. The approach is derived via mode-based log-Gaussian approximation. Unlike closed-form alternatives, it remains accurate even for zero-inflated count data. Besides, our approach has no arbitrary parameter that must be determined a priori. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closed-form alternatives and as small as the usual Poisson regressions. We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects. The developed method was applied for analyzing COVID-19 data in Japan. This result suggests that influences of pedestrian density, age, and other factors on the number of cases change over periods.","Murakami, Daisuke; Matsui, Tomoko",,330,16

Pregnancy and birthing services are obviously facing challenges during the current emergency, but we argue that a blanket ban on MRCS is both inappropriate and disproportionate. In this paper, we highlight the importance of MRCS for pregnant people's health and autonomy in childbirth and argue that this remains crucial during the current emergency. We consider some potential arguments-based on pregnant people's health and resource allocation-that might be considered justification for the limitation of such services. We demonstrate, however, that these arguments are not as persuasive as they might appear because there is limited evidence to indicate either that provision of MRCS is always dangerous for pregnant people in the circumstances or would be a substantial burden on a hospital's ability to respond to the pandemic. Furthermore, we argue that even if MRCS was not a service that hospitals are equipped to offer to all pregnant persons who seek it, the current circumstances cannot justify a blanket ban on an important service and due attention must be paid to individual circumstances.","Romanis, Elizabeth Chloe; Nelson, Anna",J Med Ethics,330,16

To identify ISPs' causal effect, I use the variation in their introductions' timing across countries and implement a difference-in-difference and multi-event analysis method. I find that ISPs led to a 4.4-8.29 percentage points reduction in workplace mobility and a 6.6-11.6 percentage points reduction in job search effort levels. They also caused a 21.8-47.7 and 17.1-29.7 percentage points reduction in the COVID-19 case growth rate and COVID-19 mortality growth rates, respectively. Using the event analysis estimates, I simulated the counterfactual job search effort, workplace mobility, and the number of COVID-19 cases and mortality without income support programs.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed the POGTTs of 26,242 pregnant women in Queensland, Australia, performed between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2015. A receiver operator characteristics (ROC) assessment was undertaken to indicate the FBG level that most effectively identified women at low risk of an abnormal result. RESULTS: There were 3,946 (15.0%) patients having GDM with 2,262 (8.6%) having FBG &#8805; 5.1mmol/l. The ROC identified FBG levels >4.6mmol/l having the best specificity (77%) and sensitivity (54%) for elevated 1 and/or 2hr BGLs. There were 19,321 (73.7%) women having FBG < 4.7mmol/l with a prevalence of GDM of 4.0%, less than 1/3rd the overall rate. Only 4,638 (17.7%) women having FBGs from 4.7-5.0mmol/l would require further evaluation to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This contemporary study of women across the state of Queensland, Australia suggests the FBG can be used effectively to define glucose tolerance in pregnancy, minimising their contact with pathology laboratories and potential exposure to the corona virus. This analysis, used in conjunction with outcome data from the HAPO study, provides reassurance to women and their health professionals that FBG < 4.7mmol/l has both a low rate of abnormal glucose tolerance and minimal adverse pregnancy-associated complications.","d039,; Emden, Michael; McLeod, Donald; Ungerer, Jacobus; Appleton, Charles; Kanowski, David",PLoS One,330,16

Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results: The PubMed electronic database was systematically searched for relevant articles linking TB, influenza, and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (focusing on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions: Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead. The trial is registered with NCT04327206, NCT01829490, and NCT04121494.","Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Grigorescu, Cristina; Pavel, Cristina-Alice; Artene, Bogdan; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Cernomaz, Andrei; Burlacu, Alexandru",Can Respir J,330,10

We identified SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals with RBD-binding IgA antibodies at their mucosal surfaces. Conversely, neutralising monoclonal anti-RBD antibodies recognised distinct commensal bacterial species. Some of these bacteria, such as Streptococcus salivarius, induced a cross-reactive anti-RBD antibodies upon supplementation in mice. Conversely, severely ill COVID-19 patients showed reduction of Streptococcus and Veillonella in their oropharynx and feces and a reduction of anti-RBD IgA at mucosal surfaces.

Recent work has helped to illuminate much about the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, which determines host- and tissue-specific tropism, pathogenicity, and zoonotic transmission. Here we discuss current findings on the factors governing SARS-CoV-2 entry. We first reviewed key features of the viral spike protein (S) mediating fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane through binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We then examined the roles of host proteases including transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsins in processing S for virus entry and the impact of this processing on endosomal and plasma membrane virus entry routes. We further discussed recent work on several host cofactors that enhance SARS-CoV-2 entry including Neuropilin-1, CD147, phosphatidylserine receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, sialic acids, and C-type lectins. Finally, we discussed two key host restriction factors, i.e., interferon-induced transmembrane proteins and lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus E, which can disrupt SARS-CoV-2 entry. The features of SARS-CoV-2 are presented in the context of other human coronaviruses, highlighting unique aspects.

The study revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However, after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S. states and for all the studied statistics.

Social isolation stress (SIS) is associated with vulnerability to oxidative stress and reduced mitochondrial activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of free access to a running wheel for 21 days on the various markers of the cellular redox/antioxidant status as well as mitochondrial function of mice subjected to SIS or maintained in groups of 3 in the homecage. SIS increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels in the cerebral cortex, and PA intervention was not able to reverse such alteration. PA reduced TBARS levels in the liver of grouped mice and gastrocnemius of socially isolated mice. PA increased nonprotein thiol (NPSH) levels in the cerebral cortex of grouped mice. Furthermore, socially isolated mice presented lower glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the cerebellum and gastrocnemius, and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the cerebral cortex and liver. By contrast, SIS induced higher GPx activity in the cerebral cortex and heart. PA reduced GPx (cerebral cortex) and GR (cerebral cortex and liver) activities of socially isolated mice. SIS caused higher activity of mitochondrial complexes I and II in the cerebral cortex, and the PA paradigm was not able to alter this effect. Interestingly, the PA produced antidepressant-like effect at both SIS and control groups. In conclusion, the results showed the influence of SIS for the effects of PA on the antioxidant status, but not on the mitochondrial function and emotionality.","Cunha, Mauricio P; Machado, Daniele G; Mancini, Gianni; Glaser, Viviane; de Paula Martins, Roberta; de Bem, Andreza F; Latini, Alexandra; Dafre, Alcir L; Rodrigues, Ana Lúcia S",Pharmacol Biochem Behav,330,32

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95\% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.","Chaisemartin, Cl'ement de; Chaisemartin, Luc de",,330,16

The new coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)) can cause multiple organ damage, mainly to lung tissue, and induce inflammation in the body. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the changes of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in patients with COVID-19 and assess its value in the evaluation and prognosis of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper is a cross-sectional retrospective study. Eighty-six severe COVID-19 patients, 132 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 76 healthy individuals (control group) were recruited to measure triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using enzyme-coupled colorimetry. RESULTS: The serum HDL-C level in COVID-19 group was 1.02 ±0.28 mmol/L which was significantly lower than in control group (1.52 ±0.55 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). In addition, the serum HDL-C level in severe COVID-19 group was 0.83 ±1.67 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than that in non-severe COVID-19 group (1.15 ±0.27 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in HDL levels in patients with COVID-19 can reflect the severity of the disease and have a clinical significance in establishing the prognosis.","Huang, Shipeng; Zhou, Congyang; Yuan, Zheng; Xiao, Hui; Wu, Xiaoping",Adv Clin Exp Med,330,24

Nearly the entire human physiological system can get disrupted by the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which exemplifies the significance of discovering a potential drug target. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. This review discusses the potential for bitter taste receptors to act as drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and the use of existing bitter agonists to restore T2R function.","Kumar, S A; Cheng, Weyland",Pharmazie,330,26

The aim of this study was to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to October 31th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action was applied. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, and may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent reports available regarding the host-pathogen interaction, morphological and genomic structure of the virus, and the diagnostic techniques as well as the available potential therapeutics against COVID-19.","Singh, Satarudra Prakash; Pritam, Manisha; Pandey, Brijesh; Yadav, Thakur Prasad",J Med Virol,330,16

METHODS: Using open and axial coding, we identified N = 1,902 thematic units (M = 2.64, SD = .701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic issues, routine, COVID rules and adjustment, contraction/exposure to COVID, technology, and future plans. RESULTS: Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%) but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical (13.2%) health and friend (11.4%) domains. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should focus on helping adolescents cultivate academic skills needed during school closures, providing mental/physical health resources and helping them navigate peer relationships-especially given ongoing remote education and social distancing due to the pandemic.","Scott, Samantha R; Rivera, Kenia M; Rushing, Ella; Manczak, Erika M; Rozek, Christopher S; Doom, Jenalee R",J. adolesc. health,330,26

We enrolled 232 patients with COVID-19, aged &#8805;60 y, in Zhejiang province from January 17 to March 3, 2020. Primary outcomes were evaluated until April 13. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. Twenty-nine (12.5%) patients progressed to critical illness. Age, shortness of breath, comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, higher NLR, lower albumin levels, and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity were associated with progression. In the multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.121, confidence interval [CI] 1.070-1.174, P<0.001), heart disease (HR 2.587, CI 1.156-5.787, P=0.021), higher NLR (HR 1.136, CI 1.094-1.180, P < 0.001), and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity (HR 4.518, CI 1.906-10.712, P<0.001) remained critical illness predictors. The NLR was independently associated with progression to critical illness; the relationship was significant and graded (HR: 1.16 per unit; 95% CI: 1.10-1.22; P for trend < 0.001).

Moreover, combining PTCY with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may help to reduce GVHD incidence. In this study, early immune reconstitution, especially of T and NK cell compartments, was compared after both types of transplant (PTCY versus PTCY + ATG) investigate their influence on patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 58 adults who received a reduced intensity conditioning to PBSC h-HSCT with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetyl + PTCY (n = 32) or PTCY + ATG (n = 26) as GVHD prophylaxis. Both groups shared similar characteristics except for the median number of CD3+ T cells infused, significantly higher for PTCY + ATG patients. Blood samples from all patients were collected three times a week from day 0 until day 30 then at day 60 and day 90/100 to evaluate T and NK cells reconstitution by flow cytometry. The results show that PTCY + ATG versus PTCY alone significantly limits the occurrence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD after reduced intensity conditioning PBSC h-HSCT, perhaps because of the combined effect of T and NK cell reconstitution. Indeed, although a slower T cell reconstitution with PTCY + ATG may limit GVHD occurrence, the quicker reconstitution of some NK cell subtypes may help with avoiding relapse. Larger prospective studies are needed to better determine which NK cell subsets may influence the incidence of relapse after h-HSCT and optimize donor selection.","Makanga, Dhon Roméo; Guillaume, Thierry; Willem, Catherine; Legrand, Nolwenn; Gagne, Katia; Cesbron, Anne; Gendzekhadze, Ketevan; Peterlin, Pierre; Garnier, Alice; Le Bourgeois, Amandine; Béné, Marie C; Chevallier, Patrice; Retière, Christelle",J. immunol,330,16

As communities shut down to reduce disease spread, all aspects of life have been altered, including sleep. This study investigated changes in sleep patterns and correlates of sleep health in a global sample and examined relationships between sleep health and psychological distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTINGS: Online survey distributed between April 19 and May 3, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Total 6882 participants (18-94 years) across 59 countries. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep health (RU-SATED), demographics, pandemic-related factors, mood. RESULTS: More than half the sample shifted their sleep toward later bed- and wake-times, and more than a third reported increased sleep disturbances during the pandemic. Older age, being partnered, and living in a higher income country were associated with better sleep health, while a stricter level of quarantine and pandemic-related factors (being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties transitioning to working from home) were associated with poorer sleep health. Domestic conflict was the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health. Poorer sleep health was strongly associated with greater depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants from Latin America reported the lowest sleep health scores. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated factors have impacted sleep health on a global level. While our data are correlational, sleep health is strongly linked with mental health and could play a protective role against developing mental distress during pandemic-related isolation. Sleep health should be incorporated into public health messages aimed at helping people cope with the effects of a pandemic to maintain optimal mental and physical health.","Yuksel, Dilara; McKee, Grace B; Perrin, Paul B; Alzueta, Elisabet; Caffarra, Sendy; Ramos-Usuga, Daniela; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; Baker, Fiona C",Sleep Health,330,16

Several studies identified crucial barriers such as insufficient financial reimbursement. In contrast to the barriers-account, we assume that low implementation readiness of GPs may be less attributed to external barriers but rather more so to inherent characteristics of SBI. To test our assumption, we conducted a vignette study assessing the GPs' readiness to implement SBI in comparison to a pharmacological intervention also designed for the treatment of excessive drinkers in relation to standard or above-standard financial reimbursement. According to our hypothesis GPs should be less ready to implement SBI regardless of financial reimbursement. METHODS: A convenience sample of GPs was recruited to answer the questionnaire. To assess the GPs' implementation readiness a 4-item 6-point Likert scale was developed and pretested. RESULTS: One hundred forty GPs completed the questionnaire. GPs were more ready to implement the pharmacological intervention than SBI, F(1,132) = 27.58, p > .001 (main effect).

We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission. FINDINGS: 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5·0 years (IQR 0·5-12·0) and a sex ratio of 1·15 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2-11, range 1-34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 5·06, 95% CI 1·72-14·87; p=0·0035), male sex (2·12, 1·06-4·21; p=0·033), pre-existing medical conditions (3·27, 1·67-6·42; p=0·0015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10·46, 5·16-21·23; p<0·0001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir-ritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 0·69%, 95% CI 0·20-1·82); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

Aims Evaluate uses of teledentistry within Newcastle Dental Hospital's Paediatric Dentistry New Patient Service. Establishes potential roles of teledentistry within paediatric dentistry and advantages and disadvantages of this service method. Methods Service evaluation of 653 new patient teledentistry appointments at Newcastle Dental Hospital across a one-month period (13 May- 12 June 2020).Discussion By implementing a telephone consultation as the first point of contact with our team, we were able to reduce the number of face-to-face appointments required by over a third. Teledentistry can be used for numerous applications within paediatric dentistry including initial triage, remote assessment, reinforcement of prevention, implementing initial management and building rapport. Conclusion Teledentistry is an emerging field and has the potential to improve patient journeys, reduce waiting lists and reduce unnecessary face-to-face attendances which is especially important both within and beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic to maximise safety and minimise inconvenience for both parent and child.

However, whether the increasing prevalence of this variant reflects a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains unknown. Here we use isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants to demonstrate that the variant that contains S(D614G) has enhanced binding to the human cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the D614G substitution in S results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, and provides a real competitive advantage in vivo-particularly during the transmission bottleneck. Our data therefore provide an explanation for the global predominance of the variant that contains S(D614G) among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are currently circulating.","Zhou, Bin; Thao, Tran Thi Nhu; Hoffmann, Donata; Taddeo, Adriano; Ebert, Nadine; Labroussaa, Fabien; Pohlmann, Anne; King, Jacqueline; Steiner, Silvio; Kelly, Jenna N; Portmann, Jasmine; Halwe, Nico Joel; Ulrich, Lorenz; Trüeb, Bettina Salome; Fan, Xiaoyu; Hoffmann, Bernd; Wang, Li; Thomann, Lisa; Lin, Xudong; Stalder, Hanspeter; Pozzi, Berta; de Brot, Simone; Jiang, Nannan; Cui, Dan; Hossain, Jaber; Wilson, Malania M; Keller, Matthew W; Stark, Thomas J; Barnes, John R; Dijkman, Ronald; Jores, Joerg; Benarafa, Charaf; Wentworth, David E; Thiel, Volker; Beer, Martin",Nature,330,16

We report a retrospective descriptive study of the clinical course and maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-centre, retrospective study performed in a tertiary care hospital for pregnant women with COVID-19 in India. The medical records of all women who delivered in the COVID facility from May 5, 2020, to June 5, 2020, were reviewed independently. Data extracted from the records included demographic characteristics, obstetric details, comorbidities, disease severity, investigations, management, and information on neonates (birthweight, Apgar score, and perinatal complications). RESULTS: Among 348 women tested for SARS-CoV-2, 57 women (16.3%) were confirmed as positive based on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal specimen. Most women (45; 78.9%) had a mild infection with favourable maternal-fetal outcomes. Three maternal deaths were associated with comorbidities. Five neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, remained hemodynamically stable, and were subsequently discharged. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 had mild disease and recovered with good perinatal outcomes. Women with comorbidities may have an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The cycle threshold signifying the viral load and degree of infectivity can modify management during pregnancy. Long-term outcomes and the potential mother-to-child vertical/horizontal transmission need further study.","Bachani, Sumitra; Arora, Renu; Dabral, Anjali; Marwah, Sheeba; Anand, Pratima; Reddy, K Sravani; Gupta, Nitesh; Singh, Balwinder",J. obstet. gynaecol.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the immunological phenotype of patients are associated with duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19. Method: In this single-center study, 69 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively. Immunological parameters including counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of circulating cytokines and cytokine receptors were screened for their association with disease severity, survival and duration of illness of COVID-19. Results: Our data confirmed previous results that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and circulating levels of IL-6 represent prominent biomarker for the prediction of disease severity and survival of COVID-19. However, this study shows for the first time that duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19 is positively associated with serum levels of IL-8 (P=0.004) and soluble IL-2R&#945; (P=0.025).

The treatment of these patients poses unique and significant challenges to health care providers requiring changes in existing protocols. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old COVID-19 positive patient developed sudden onset left hemiparesis secondary to an acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score = 11). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed under a new protocol specifically designed to maximize protective measures for the team involved in the care of the patient. Mechanical Thrombectomy was performed successfully under general anesthesia resulting in TICI 3 recanalization. With regards to time metrics, time from door to reperfusion was 60 mins. The 24-h NIHSS score decreased to 2. Patient was discharged after 19 days after improvement of her pulmonary status with modified Rankin Scale = 1. CONCLUSION: Patients infected by COVID-19 can develop LVO that is multifactorial in etiology. Mechanical thrombectomy in a COVID-19 confirmed patient presenting with AIS due to LVO is feasible with current mechanical thrombectomy devices. A change in stroke workflow and protocols is now necessary in order to deliver the appropriate life-saving therapy for COVID-19 positive patients while protecting medical providers.","Mansour, Ossama Yassin; Malik, Amer M; Linfante, Italo",BMC Neurol,330,32

In theory, it is an ideal way of meat production, humane to the animals and sustainable for the environment, while keeping the same taste and nutritional values as traditional meat and having additional benefits such as controlled fat content and absence of antibiotics and hormones used in the traditional meat industry. However, in practice, there is still a number of challenges, such as those associated with the upscale of cultured meat (CM). CM food safety monitoring is a necessary factor when envisioning both the regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This includes extensive development of the sensitive and specific analytical devices i.e., sensors to enable reliable food safety monitoring throughout the whole future food supply chain. In addition, advanced monitoring options can help in the further optimization of the meat cultivation which may reduce the currently still high costs of production. This review presents an overview of the sensor monitoring options for the most relevant parameters of importance for meat cultivation. Examples of the various types of sensors that can potentially be used in CM production are provided and the options for their integration into bioreactors, as well as suggestions on further improvements and more advanced integration approaches.

It possesses a wide spectrum of biological activities, thus suggesting a role in disease prevention and health promotion. The present review aimed to uncover the bone-sparing effects of quercetin and its mechanism of action. Animal studies have found that the action of quercetin on bone is largely protective, with a small number of studies reporting negative outcomes. Quercetin was shown to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, osteoblast apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response while promoting osteogenesis, angiogenesis, antioxidant expression, adipocyte apoptosis and osteoclast apoptosis. The possible underlying mechanisms involved are regulation of Wnt, NF-&#954;B, Nrf2, SMAD-dependent, and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. On the other hand, quercetin was shown to exert complex and competing actions on the MAPK signalling pathway to orchestrate bone metabolism, resulting in both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on bone in parallel. The overall interaction is believed to result in a positive effect on bone. Considering the important contributions of quercetin in regulating bone homeostasis, it may be considered an economical and promising agent for improving bone health. The documented preclinical findings await further validation from human clinical trials.","Wong, Sok Kuan; Chin, Kok-Yong; Ima-Nirwana, Soelaiman",,330,16

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.","Dulek, Daniel E; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C; Tribble, Alison C; Connelly, James A; Loi, Michele M; El Chebib, Hassan; Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan; Otto, William R; Diorio, Caroline; Keim, Garrett; Walkovich, Kelly; Jaggi, Preeti; Girotto, Jennifer E; Yarbrough, April; Behrens, Edward M; Cron, Randy Q; Bassiri, Hamid",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,330,7

We have investigated the relationship between the disease severity in COVID-19, and the PNI and SII scores in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study included 118 hospitalised patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients were divided into two groups as those who were hospitalised at the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had been internalised at the clinic (non-ICU). RESULTS: Of the 118 patients, 50.8% were male. The mean age was 57.7 ± 17.5 years in non-ICU patients and 70.3 ± 11.7 years in ICU patients and the difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The lymphocyte count and the albumin levels were significantly lower in ICU patients (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The PNI score was significantly lower in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (P < .001). The SII score was found to be significantly higher in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (P < .001). The value of PNI and SII scores in prediction of the disease severity in COVID-19 was evaluated with the ROC analysis (PNI: AUC = 0.796, 95%CI: 0.715-0.877, P < .001; SII: AUC =0.689, 95% CI: 0.559-0.819, P=.004). When the cut-off value was taken as &#8804;36.7 for the PNI score, it was found to have 73.4% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was 4.4 times higher. When the cut-off value was taken as &#8805;813.6 for SII score, it was found to have 70.8% sensitivity and 66.0% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was six times higher. CONCLUSION: The PNI and the SII scores are independent predictors of the prognosis and the disease severity in COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation at the ICU.","Nalbant, Ahmet; Demirci, Taner; Kaya, Tezcan; Aydin, Ayhan; Altindis, Mustafa; Güçlü, Ertugrul",Int J Clin Pract,330,20

The lockdown or quarantine measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has caused the interruption in ongoing care and access to medical care including to patients with existing neurological conditions. Besides the passivity, isolation, and withdrawal, patients with neurodegenerative diseases experience difficulties in communication due to a limited access to leisure opportunities and interaction with friends and relatives. The communication difficulties may exacerbate the burden on the caregivers. Therefore, assistive-technologies may be a useful strategy in mitigating challenges associated with remote communication. The current paper presents an overview of the use of assistive technologies using virtual reality and virtual body ownership in providing communication opportunities to isolated patients, during COVID-19, with neurological diseases and moderate-to-severe communication difficulties. We postulate that the assistive technologies-based intervention may improve social interactions in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and acquired brain injury-thereby reducing isolation and improving their quality of life and mental well-being.","Stasolla, Fabrizio; Matamala-Gomez, Marta; Bernini, Sara; Caffò, Alessandro O; Bottiroli, Sara",Front Public Health,330,20

However, there is limited information about this disease in children and adolescents. Only a few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported so far. Since the immune responses of children are different from adults, their clinical findings and therapeutic responses may differ. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a 12-year-old girl with abdominal pain in Iran. Case Presentation: A 12-year-old girl with a history of cold, dry cough, sore throat, fever, and left-sided abdominal pain was referred to the Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, on March 7, 2020. The chest X-ray indicated air space opacification in the right lower lobe and faint ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung. A subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated blialteral patchy lower lobe consolidations. The patient's oropharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, based on the result of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. The patient's clinical status was improved, and she was discharged five days after admission (March 11, 2020). Conclusion: Since the number of infected cases with COVID-19 is growing rapidly in Iran, early detection and management of infected cases are highly recommended for preventing the disease transmission and reducing the rate of infection.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Rostamyan, Maryam; Aziz-Ahari, Alireza; Pourakbari, Babak; Ghaffari, Mohammad; Mamishi, Setareh",Tanaffos,330,23

Study findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19-related anxiety, and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. However, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited, and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the experiences of Reddit users worldwide who post in eating disorder (ED)-related discussion forums describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. METHODS: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. RESULTS: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors. Feelings of isolation, frustration, and anxiety were common. Many individuals used Reddit forums to share personal experiences, seek advice, and offer shared accountability. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit discussion forums have provided a therapeutic community for individuals to share experiences and provide support for peers with ED during a period of increased psychiatric distress. Future research is needed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behavior and to evaluate the role of social media discussion forums in mental health treatment, especially during periods of limited treatment access.","Nutley, Sara K; Falise, Alyssa M; Henderson, Rebecca; Apostolou, Vasiliki; Mathews, Carol A; Striley, Catherine W",JMIR Ment Health,330,20

However, the newly described multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiac complications. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical course and cardiac testing results in pediatric patients hospitalized with MIS-C at 2 large hospital systems in the New York City metropolitan area over a 3-month period. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients (median age 2.8 years) in the study cohort, 24 (73%) had at least one abnormality in cardiac testing: abnormal electrocardiogram (48%), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (43%), abnormal echocardiogram (30%), and/or elevated troponin (21%). Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram abnormalities all resolved by the 2-week outpatient follow-up cardiology visit. CONCLUSION: While 73% of pediatric patients with MIS-C had evidence of abnormal cardiac testing on hospital admission in our study, all cardiac testing was normal by outpatient hospital discharge follow-up. Cardiac screening tests should be performed in all patients diagnosed with MIS-C given the high rate of abnormal cardiac findings in our study cohort.","Minocha, Prashant K; Phoon, Colin K L; Verma, Sourabh; Singh, Rakesh K",Clin Pediatr (Phila),330,6

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) significantly affected the health care systems in the world. The disease was accepted as COVID-19 pandemic by WHO. Diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection requires multidisciplinary management and there are currently many ongoing studies for possible vaccination and antiviral therapies for the treatment. The major symptoms are known to be high fever and dry cough. Moreover, new symptoms like olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are defined. The epithelium of upper respiratory tract and related cavities (ear, paranasal sinuses) are known to be reservoir for COVID19 virus. Therefore, otorhinolaryngology physicians are one of the highest risk groups for nosocomial transmission. The pandemic altered standard daily working schedule of otorhinolaryngology physicians in the world. Elective operations such as rhinologic and otological surgeries are suspended, and novel prevention strategies were developed to prevent nosocomial transmission during physical examination and surgery. However, the treatment of emergency diseases like deep neck infections, epistaxis, tracheostomy, and head and neck cancers are still going on as expected.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of the MSMR in the surgical community as an international educational tool during pandemic confinement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational, analytic, and transversal study was designed. An 11-item survey was sent to all the 1,513 attendees who completed at least 60% of course attendance during 2 days. Descriptive and analytic statistics were performed. The impact was measured by considering answers to questions 6 to 9 and 11 (course usefulness, microsurgery interest increase, desire to pursue a microsurgical career, attendance to in-person conferences, and overall score, respectively). RESULTS: A total of 1,111 (73.4%) of eligible subjects were included. In total, 55.8% were plastic surgery residents. After the course, 98.9% would pursue a career in reconstructive microsurgery, and 45% would stop attending in-person conferences. The overall score of the event was 9.06 ± 0.9 (from 0 to 10) regardless of the current training status. CONCLUSION: The MSMR was a high impact course and has established a paradigm shift that will lead to an evolution in plastic surgery learning.","Santamaría, Eric; Nahás-Combina, Luciano; Altamirano-Arcos, Carlos; Vargas-Flores, Edgar",J. reconstr. microsurg,330,16

Yet, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters, such as age, sex, and health conditions, are not clearly driving the superspreading phenomenon. In this commentary we discuss what is known and what is not known about coronavirus superspreader transmission and explore whether characteristics of the virion, the donor, or the environment contribute to this phenomenon.","Lakdawala, Seema S; Menachery, Vineet D",Trends microbiol,330,14

However, commercially available sEMG electrodes are not optimized for the head and neck area, have rigid form, and are mostly available in large medical centers. We developed an ultrathin, soft, and flexible sEMG patch, specifically designed to conform to the submental anatomy and which will be ultimately incorporated into a telehealth system. To validate this first-generation sEMG patch, we compared its safety, efficiency, and signal quality in monitoring submental muscle activity with that of widely used conventional sEMG electrodes. Method A randomized crossover design was used to compare the experimental sEMG patch with conventional (snap-on) sEMG electrodes. Participants completed the same experimental protocol with both electrodes in counterbalanced order. Swallow trials included five trials of 5- and 10-ml water. Comparisons were made on (a) signal-related factors: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), baseline amplitude, normalized mean amplitude, and sEMG burst duration and (b) safety/preclinical factors: safety/adverse effects, efficiency of electrode placement, and satisfaction/comfort. Noninferiority and equivalence tests were used to examine signal-related factors. Paired t tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine safety/preclinical factors. Results Forty healthy adults participated (24 women, M age = 67.5 years). Signal-related factors: SNR of the experimental patch was not inferior to the SNR of the conventional electrodes (p < .0056). Similarly, baseline amplitude obtained with the experimental patch was not inferior to that obtained with conventional electrodes (p < .0001). Finally, normalized amplitude values were equivalent across swallows (5 ml: p < .025; 10 ml: p < .0012), and sEMG burst duration was also equivalent (5 ml: p < .0001; 10 ml: p < .0001). Safety/preclinical factors: The experimental patch resulted in fewer mild adverse effects. Participant satisfaction was higher with the experimental patch (p = .0476, d = 0.226). Conclusions Our new wearable sEMG patch is equivalent with widely used conventional sEMG electrodes in terms of technical performance. In addition, our patch is safe, and healthy older adults are satisfied with it. With lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to develop optimal swallowing telerehabilitation devices are more urgent than ever. Upon further validation, this new technology has the potential to improve rehabilitation and telerehabilitation efforts for patients with dysphagia.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells from 8 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. We identified antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2; this activity correlates with competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. Unexpectedly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the infected plasma did not cross-react with the RBDs of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), although there was substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric spike proteins. Analysis of the crystal structure of RBD-bound antibody revealed that steric hindrance inhibits viral engagement with ACE2, thereby blocking viral entry. These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are largely viral-species-specific inhibitors.

In the latter, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals comprised 5.37% in March and 11.42% in June 2020. Several viral co-infections were observed for SARS-CoV-2. Rhinoviruses accounted for the largest proportion of co-infections (7.91% of samples were SARS-CoV-2-positive); followed by respiratory syncytial virus (7.03%); adenoviruses (4.84%); metapneumoviruses (3.29%); parainfluenza viruses (2.42%); enterovirus D68 (1.10%) and other viruses (entero-, echo-, parecho-) (<1%). Average SARS-CoV-2 case fatality rate in the group of 12 537 individuals was determined to be 0.6% (in contrast to official Russian government statistics of 1.5% mortality).

A retrospective observational cohort study of all children (0-15 years) attending for urgent care across Oxfordshire, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, compared to matched dates in 2015-2019, across two paediatric hospitals providing secondary care, including one with tertiary services. Our outcome measures were changes in numbers of patients attending and inpatient diagnoses (using ICD-10 classification) during the first 2020 lockdown, compared with the previous 5 years, were used. We found that total Emergency Department (ED) attendances (n = 4030) and hospital admissions (n = 1416) during the first UK lockdown were reduced by 56.8% and 59.4%, respectively, compared to 2015-2019 (5-year means n = 7446.8 and n = 2491.6, respectively). Proportions of patients admitted from ED and length of stay were similar across 2015-2020. ICD-10 diagnoses in lockdown of 2020 (n = 2843) versus matched 2015-2019 dates (n = 19,946) demonstrated significantly greater neoplasm diagnoses (p = 0.0123). Of diagnoses 'missing' in lockdown, 80% were categorised as infectious diseases or their sequelae and 20% were non-specific pains/aches/malaise and accidental injury/poisonings.Conclusions: Pandemic public health measures significantly altered paediatric presentations. Oxfordshire hospitals had a 58% reduction in ED attendances/inpatient admissions, with 'missing' diagnoses predominantly infection-related illnesses. These are likely driven by a combination of the following: (1) public health infection control measures successfully reducing disease transmission, (2) parents/carers keeping mild/self-limiting disease at home, and (3) pandemic-related healthcare anxieties. Prospective studies are needed to ensure referral pathways identify vulnerable children, those with social concerns, and avoid delayed presentation. What is Known: â¢ Significant reductions of paediatric ED attendances and inpatient admissions are reported globally, throughout national and regional lockdowns for COVID-19. â¢ Previous studies (supplemental table 5) examined only ED diagnoses or specific inpatient diagnoses during lockdown periods, demonstrating reductions of infectious diseases, accidents/injuries, and safeguarding referrals. What is New: â¢ Using ICD-10 coding, robustly controlling for five historical years and adopting a hypothesis-independent analysis, demonstrating 80% of 'missing' inpatient diagnoses during national COVID-19 lockdown were infectious diseases or its sequelae, the remainder being non-specific aches/pains/malaise and accidental injuries/poisonings. â¢ Greater numbers of neoplasms and other specific diagnoses were detected during lockdown, including greater documentation of co-morbidities and incidental findings.","Charlesworth, James E G; Bold, Rhian; Pal, Rani",Eur. j. pediatr,330,16

We then crowd-sourced over 800 survey responses to measure how credibility was influenced by changing the perceived race. We evaluate the effect of showing a still image of a Black person versus a still image of a White person using the same audio clip for each survey. We also test the effect of showing either an original video or an altered video where the appearance of the person in the original video is modified to appear more White. We measure credibility as the percent of participant responses who believed the speaker was telling the truth. We found that changing the race of a person in a static image has negligible impact on credibility. However, the same manipulation of race on a video increases credibility significantly (61\% to 73\% with p $<$ 0.05).

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients due to their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and their direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30th 2020 and included any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with Janus kinase-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. RESULTS: Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39, p< 0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26, p< 0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68-48.54, p< 0.00001) when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.85, p< 0.05), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Janus kinase-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes in terms of mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes in regard to mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional well-conducted RCTs are needed to further elucidate the relationship between clinical outcomes and Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons in COVID-19 patients.","Walz, Lucas; Cohen, Avi J; Rebaza, Andre P; Vanchieri, James; Slade, Martin D; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Sharma, Lokesh",BMC Infect Dis,330,22

HYPOTHESIS: PVCs may increase the adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes in pregnant women. METHODS: Six thousand one hundred and forty-eight pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in our center between 2017 and 2019 in the study. The average PVC burden was determined by calculating the number of PVCs in total beats. Those who had a PVC burden >0.5% were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of adverse fetal or neonatal events. The adverse outcomes were compared between the groups to assess the impact of PVCs on pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.68%) women with a PVC burden >0.5% were recorded. Among them, 17 adverse events (12 cases) were documented, which was significantly higher than that among women without PVCs (11.65% vs. 2.93%, p < .01). The median PVC burden among pregnant women with PVCs was 2.84% (1.02%-6.1%). Furthermore, compared with that of the women without adverse events, the median PVC burden of women with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes was significantly higher (9.02% vs. 2.30%, p < .01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that not the LVEF, heart rate and bigeminy, but only the PVC burden was associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs (OR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.11-1.61], p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent PVCs have adverse effects on pregnancy, and the PVC burden might be an important factor associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs.","Lin, Jing; Qian, Yanxia; Chen, Qiushi; Zhang, Mingming; Chen, Yaoxi; Xu, Ruijie; Chen, Jingxian; Shi, Yukang; Yang, Shunxin; Luo, Xinyi; Ding, Qiang; Wu, Xin; Wang, Junhong",Clin. cardiol,330,26

However, it is not clear whether the effect of these genetic factors is independent of the risk due to more established non-genetic demographic and metabolic risk factors such as male sex, poor cardiometabolic health, and low socioeconomic status. We sought to identify interactions between genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors influencing COVID-19 severity via a genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank. Of 378,051 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, 2,402 were classified as having experienced severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Exposures included sex, cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity and type 2 diabetes [T2D], tested jointly), and multiple deprivation index. Multiplicative interaction was tested using a logistic regression model, conducting both an interaction test and a joint test of genetic main and interaction effects. Five independent variants reached genome-wide significance in the joint test, one of which also reached significance in the interaction test. One of these, rs2268616 in the PGF gene, showed stronger effects in males and in individuals with T2D. None of the five variants showed effects on a similarly-defined phenotype in a lookup in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. These results reveal potential additional genetic loci contributing to COVID-19 severity and demonstrate the value of including non-genetic risk factors in an interaction testing approach for genetic discovery.","Westerman, Kenneth E; Lin, Joanna; Sevilla-Gonzalez, Magda; Tadess, Beza; Manning, Alisa K; Marchek, Casey J",,330,13

In the present study, two spices, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum verum, been identified as excellent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) sources that play significant role in the regulation of cell signal transduction and developmental processes in plants as well as animals, being lucrative and potential targets for pharmacological modulation. PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70°C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Mn2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics. In addition to these properties, the thermostability of PTPases from two spices enhances their significance in industries with therapeutically vital products. Although the source of PTPases is culinary spices, further studies are required to establish the utilization of PTPases as nutraceuticals and in therapeutic formulations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: For a healthy lifestyle, awareness needs to be created by humankind towards food habits to minimize illnesses. Numerous studies have explored the consumption of nutraceutical products acts as a natural barrier and immune booster for various human ailments including SARS-COV-2. PTPases play important roles in regulating intracellular signaling and, ultimately, biological function along with their structural features. The importance of PTPases and their inhibitors has been implicated in various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Further investigations need to be undertaken to explore the therapeutic properties of PTPases in both in vivo and in vitro for their clinical significance.","Selvaraj, Kanagarethinam; Katare, Deepshikha Pande; Chand, Subhash; Chaudhary, Nidhee",J Food Biochem,330,24

Over 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 MERS-related deaths have been reported from 27 countries. MERS-CoV has been associated with a high case fatality rate, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions. Despite the fatal nature of MERS-CoV infection, a comprehensive study to explore its evolution and adaptation in different hosts is lacking. We performed codon usage analyses on 4751 MERS-CoV genes and determined underlying forces that affect the codon usage bias in the MERS-CoV genome. The current analyses revealed a low but highly conserved, gene-specific codon usage bias in the MERS-CoV genome. The codon usage bias is mainly shaped by natural selection, while mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor affecting codon usage in some genes. Other contributory factors included CpG dinucleotide bias, physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins and gene length. Results reported in this study provide considerable insights into the molecular evaluation of MERS-CoV and could serve as a theoretical basis for optimizing MERS-CoV gene expression to study the functional relevance of various MERS-CoV proteins. Alternatively, an attenuated vaccine strain containing hundreds of silent mutations could be engineered. Codon de-optimization will not affect the amino acid sequence or antigenicity of a vaccine strain, but the sheer number of mutations would make viral reversion to a virulent phenotype extremely unlikely.","Hussain, Snawar; Shinu, Pottathil; Islam, Mohammed Monirul; Chohan, Muhammad Shahzad; Rasool, Sahibzada Tasleem",Evol.

This paper aims to propose a spatio-temporal model for quantifying compliance with the US COVID-19 mitigation policies at a regional level. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with short-term predictions. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among state clusters in the US and human mobilities on the transmission of COVID-19. The model can help inform policymakers as they decide how to react to future outbreaks.","Yamamoto, Nao; Jiang, Bohan; Wang, Haiyan",,330,16

Se aplicó una encuesta de la Organización Mundial de la Salud adaptada al contexto local. Se incluyeron preguntas abiertas para indagar sentimientos de las personas frente al COVID-19, y se realizó un análisis de contenido. Como resultados se advierte que la población encuestada siente incertidumbre, miedo y angustia, pero también emerge un sentimiento de responsabilidad y cuidado frente al COVID-19. Así mismo se destacan sentimientos positivos para la sociedad como una valoración de la interdependencia social. Los resultados arribados señalan que el impacto en la salud mental es desigual según el género, el nivel educativo alcanzado y el confort percibido en el hogar. El estudio permite concluir que las dimensiones emocionales y vinculares de las personas resultan aspectos centrales ante la pandemia del COVID-19 en Argentina. Es recomendable que estas dimensiones, así como y su impacto subjetivo y social diferencial entre los diversos grupos poblacionales, sean consideradas en la planificación de políticas para afrontar el COVID-19.","Johnson, María Cecilia; Saletti-Cuesta, Lorena; Tumas, Natalia",Ciênc.

In the TOGETHER randomized platform clinical trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine vs. placebo in preventing either extended emergency room observation or hospitalization due to COVID-19. Herein, we report the preliminary findings. MethodsThis placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization using intention to treat. Modified intention to treat (mITT) explored patients receiving at least 24 hours of treatment before a primary outcome event. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. FindingsThe study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval [95% BCI]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. Findings were similar for the mITT analysis (RR0.68, 95% BCI : 0.50- 0.91). We found no significant relative effects between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups on viral clearance at day 7 (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI]: 0.53 - 1.07), mortality (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.30), time to death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58 - 1.08), days hospitalized (Mean Difference (MD) 1.22 days; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.53), number of days ventilated (MD 1.10; 95% CI: 0.70 - 1.73) or other secondary outcomes. Data capturing all 28 days of follow-up will be reported after August 26th, 2021. InterpretationTreatment with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) among high-risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID-19, reduced the need for extended emergency room observation or hospitalization.

The role of imaging has evolved during the pandemic, initially with CT as alternative and possibly superior test compared to RT-PCR, to a more limited role based on specific indications. Several classification and reporting schemes were developed for chest imaging early during the pandemic for patients with suspected COVID-19 to aid in triage when the availability of RT-PCR testing was limited and its performance unclear. Interobserver agreement for categories with findings typical of COVID-19 and those suggesting an alternative diagnosis is high across multiple studies. Furthermore, some studies looking at the extent of lung involvement on chest radiography and CT showed correlations with critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation. In addition to pulmonary manifestations, cardiovascular complications such as thromboembolism and myocarditis have been ascribed to COVID-19, sometimes contributing to neurologic and abdominal manifestations. Finally, artificial intelligence has shown promise in both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia both with respect to radiography and CT.","Kanne, Jeffrey P; Bai, Harrison; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Haramati, Linda B; Kallmes, David F; Little, Brent P; Rubin, Geoffrey; Sverzellati, Nicola",Radiology,330,16

METHODS: Our search was including original articles, reviews, guidelines, letters to the editor, comments on guidelines, and editorials, regarding the male reproductive system. We used the words SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, ""2019 ncov,"" testis, sperm, male factor infertility, fertility treatment, semen, assisted reproductive technology (ART), sexual transmission, and ACE2. RESULTS: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, ""Bioinformatics Analysis"" suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since ""Pseudo Time Analysis"" has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. ""Gene Ontology"" (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question. CONCLUSION: There is a concern that male fertility may be disturbed after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, follow-up of the reproductive functions and male fertility may be necessary in recovered cases, especially in aged men.","Moshrefi, Mojgan; Ghasemi-Esmailabad, Saeed; Ali, Jaffar; Findikli, Necati; Mangoli, Esmat; Khalili, Mohammad Ali",J Assist Reprod Genet,330,25

In most countries, containment has already started (on 17 March 2020 in France), and self-quarantine and social distancing are reducing viral contamination and saving lives. However, these considerations may only be the tip of the iceberg; most resources are dedicated to the struggle against COVID-19, and this unprecedented situation may compromise the management of patients admitted with cardiovascular conditions. AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on cardiovascular admissions in France. METHODS: We asked nine major cardiology centres to give us an overview of admissions to their nine intensive cardiac care units for acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure, before and after containment measures. RESULTS: Before containment (02-16 March 2020), the nine participating intensive cardiac care units admitted 4.8±1.6 patients per day, versus 2.6±1.5 after containment (17-22 March 2020) (rank-sum test P=0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm here, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number of cardiovascular admissions after the establishment of containment. Many hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, but we feel it is time raise the alarm about the risk for patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease, who may suffer from lack of attention, leading to severe consequences (an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths, heart failure, etc.). Similar consequences can be feared for all acute situations, beyond the cardiovascular disease setting.","Huet, Fabien; Prieur, Cyril; Schurtz, Guillaume; Gerbaud, Edouard; Manzo-Silberman, Stéphane; Vanzetto, Gerald; Elbaz, Meyer; Tea, Victoria; Mercier, Grégoire; Lattuca, Benoît; Duflos, Claire; Roubille, François",Arch Cardiovasc Dis,330,16

Although many approaches are being investigated to address this issue, nowaday there are no vaccines available and there is little evidence supporting the efficiency of potential therapeutic agents. Moreover, the high mutation rate of this virus heavily affects the understanding of its evolution and diffusion mechanisms, and, in turn, the development of effective solutions. In this study, two novel algorithms are provided for finding out recurrent patterns of nucleotide subsequences of different SARS-CoV-2 genomes as a unique signature capable of identifying the most peculiar features of the pathogen. In particular, we provide several subsequence patterns related to the Spike glycoprotein, which is believed to be the main target for developing effective drugs and vaccines against the COVID-19 disease because of its role in the entrance of coronaviruses into host cells. The experimental results, obtained by analyzing 5000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, have shown that the extracted patterns are able to recognize the Spyke protein in the 99.35% of the considered genomes. In addition, such patterns have proven to be highly discriminating with respect to other pathogenic genomes, such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Nipah, and the streptococcus bacteria.

METHODS: We used population data from the Institut National D'Études Démographiques on cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 from February to June 2020 in 10 European regions: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. For each region, we calculated cumulative mortality rates stratified by age and sex and corresponding relative risks for men vs. women. RESULTS: The relative risk of dying from COVID-19 was higher for men than for women in almost all age groups in all regions. The overall relative risk ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.01-1.23) in Portugal to 1.54 (95% CI 1.49-1.58) in France. In most regions, sex differences increased until the ages of 60-69 years, but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at age 80+ years. CONCLUSION: Despite variability in data collection and time coverage among regions, the study showed an overall similar pattern of sex differences in COVID-19 mortality in Europe.","Ahrenfeldt, Linda Juel; Otavova, Martina; Christensen, Kaare; Lindahl-Jacobsen, Rune",Wien. klin.

Traditional methods of diagnosis include demonstration of acid fast bacilli on endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma on the biopsy or positive gene Xpert on the biopsy, but they are positive in small percentage of cases only missing diagnosis in many cases. Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) alone is not taken for diagnosis due to high false positivity. Diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy can detect many cases by direct demonstration of TB lesions. Composite reference standard is a useful method to diagnose FGTB. This review discusses various diagnostic modalities including endometrial or peritoneal biopsy to detect acid fast bacilli on microscopic or culture or epithelioid granuloma, role of PCR, role of radiological imaging (hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI and PET-CT scan) and role of endoscopic techniques (laparoscopy and hysteroscopy) in diagnosis of FGTB including role of composite reference standard. The International and National studies highlight the role of composite reference standard and its components like demonstration of AFB on microscopy or culture of endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma or gene Xpert or PCR or latest tests like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) test and other newer molecular methods like Xpert Ultra for diagnosis of FGTB. It also detects role of endoscopy in FGTB and role of diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis of FGTB. Treatment is with four primary drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) for two months followed by three drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol) daily orally for 4 months for drug sensitive FGTB. Shorter Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen is given for Rifampicin resistant (RR)/MDR confined to only FGTB while longer all oral regimen is given for RR/MDR with or without additional drug resistance, HIV seropositives with FGTB or involvement of other sites or pulmonary TB (PTB) along with FGTB. Composite reference standard which combines various diagnostic modalities is a useful strategy to diagnose FGTB.","Sharma, Jai Bhagwan; Sharma, Eshani; Sharma, Sangeeta; Singh, Janmeeta; Chopra, Namita",Indian J Tuberc,330,1

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coinfections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them. We must remain alert to any clinical subtleties so as to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and stay one step ahead of COVID-19.","Martínez Orozco, José Arturo; Sánchez Tinajero, Ángel; Becerril Vargas, Eduardo; Delgado Cueva, Andrea Iraís; Reséndiz Escobar, Héctor; Vázquez Alcocer, Eduardo; Narváez Díaz, Luis Armando; Ruiz Santillán, Danna Patricia",Am J Case Rep,330,16

Since the coronavirus pandemic has affected sales and people’s attitudes towards car-sharing, which brought both opportunities and challenges to the platform and changed the operating mode of manufacturers, some traditional manufacturers have motivated to cooperate with third-party platform. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to examine the pricing decisions and optimal mode selection of manufacturer under the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the supply chain consists of a manufacturer and a third-party sharing platform. We analyze three scenarios including no sharing, customers-to-customers, and mixed sharing, then employ a game theoretic approach to get equilibrium solutions and analytically derive the optimal mode choice. Our analysis shows that when the operation and maintenance cost is low, manufacturer will join the third-party platform, and the sharing price increase in operation and maintenance cost, while the selling price decrease in operation and maintenance cost. When the value perception factor less than the threshold, the manufacturer will retain sales channel, and the selling demand decrease in value perception factor in the growing market, the sharing demand has the same trend, vice versa. Furthermore, we find that if the operation and maintenance cost is low and value perception factor is high, mixed sharing is the best choice for the manufacturer, while the manufacturer will choose no car-sharing when the value perception factor is relatively low.","Mao, Zhenzhen Zhang Weisi Yang Bin Zhang Tao",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,330,1

To make video review more efficient, we implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect surgical workflow and technical approaches. METHODS: Participants (N = 200) performed a simulated open bowel repair. The operation included two major phases: (1) Injury Identification and (2) Suture Repair. Accordingly, a phase detection algorithm (MobileNetV2+GRU) was implemented to automatically detect the two phases using video data. In addition, participants were noted to use three different technical approaches when running the bowel: (1) use of both hands, (2) use of one hand and one tool, or (3) use of two tools. To discern the three technical approaches, an object detection (YOLOv3) algorithm was implemented to recognize objects that were commonly used during the Injury Identification phase (hands versus tools). RESULTS: The phase detection algorithm achieved high precision (recall) when segmenting the two phases: Injury Identification (86 ± 9% [81 ± 12%]) and Suture Repair (81 ± 6% [81 ± 16%]). When evaluating three technical approaches in running the bowel, the object detection algorithm achieved high average precisions (Hands [99.32%] and Tools [94.47%]). The three technical approaches showed no difference in execution time (Kruskal-Wallis Test: P= 0.062) or injury identification (not missing an injury) (Chi-squared: P= 0.998). CONCLUSIONS: The AI algorithms showed high precision when segmenting surgical workflow and identifying technical approaches. Automation of these techniques for surgical video databases has great potential to facilitate efficient performance review.","Mohamadipanah, Hossein; Kearse, LaDonna; Witt, Anna; Wise, Brett; Yang, Su; Goll, Cassidi; Pugh, Carla",J Surg Res,330,1

Methods: Between June 2017 and August 2019, 17 patients with recurrent patellar dislocation with FAA&#8805;30° were treated with DDFO and MPFL reconstruction. There were 5 males and 12 females, aged 14-22 years, with an average of 17.7 years. The patella dislocated for 2 to 8 times (mean, 3.6 times). The disease duration was 2-7 years (mean, 4.6 years). The patellar apprehension tests were positive. Preoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and Kujala score were 4.2±1.1, 47.8±8.1, 3.6±1.1, and 56.8±5.7, respectively. FAA, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), lateral patella displacement (LPD), tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance (TT-TG) were (34.9±3.4)°, (85.8±3.0)°, (13.7±3.8) mm, and (23.1±2.1) mm, respectively. Results: All incisions healed by first intention, and there was no complications such as knee stiffness, infection, and re-dislocation of the patella. All patients were followed up 13-25 months, with an average of 17.7 months. The imaging review showed that 1 case of osteotomy did not union, and achieved satisfactory results after the secondary revision and strengthening fixation; the osteotomies of other patients healed completely after 3 to 4 months of operation. The patellar apprehension tests were negative. At last follow-up, the FAA, mLDFA, LPD, and TT-TG were (15.6±2.7)°, (83.0±2.1)°, (5.0±2.6) mm, and (20.5±2.5) mm, respectively; the VAS score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and Kujala score were 2.4±1.4, 93.4±7.8, 6.8±1.5, and 89.0±8.0, respectively. There were significant differences in the above indicators between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05).

It also examines how responsible behavior among tourists has been triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, drawing on a planned behavior perspective by concentrating on the tourist contribution to sustainable tourism, responsible tourism behavior is investigated by means of 19 semi-structured interviews. The study found that tourists are not only sensitive to sustainability but that they also behave responsibly both on site and in their travel choices. At the same time, tourists pass the buck to suppliers and providers by requesting rules, information and opportunities for responsible tourism to be created. In this regard, implications for theory and practice can be derived by informing suppliers and providers about their requested responsibilities, as well as by adding a crisis perspective to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).","Eichelberger, Sarah Heigl Manuela Peters Mike Pikkemaat Birgit",Sustainability,330,6

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998-1.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68-7.70, p-value<0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65-4.25, p-value<0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection.","Hastie, Claire E; Mackay, Daniel F; Ho, Frederick; Celis-Morales, Carlos A; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Jani, Bhautesh D; Welsh, Paul; Mair, Frances S; Gray, Stuart R; O039,; Donnell, Catherine A; Gill, Jason Mr; Sattar, Naveed; Pell, Jill P",Diabetes Metab Syndr,330,29

In hospitals, there has been a drastic increase in the use of salbutamol pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), as well as salbutamol Diskus, leading to a decline in availability and causing interruptions in the supply chain. Patients with asthma are at higher risk of respiratory complications if they are infected with COVID-19. Salbutamol, a short-acting ß-agonist (SABA), could be a life-saving medication during critical conditions. Other short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), such as ipratropium pMDI, and combinations of SABA/SAMA, such as Combivent Respimat, are also starting to have supply issues. With the ongoing pandemic, hospitals need to consider conservation strategies to facilitate resource-efficient salbutamol delivery and reduce their waste. In this current opinion, we demonstrate several strategies for avoiding pMDI wastage that can be adopted in both the hospital and community settings. These strategies include reprocessing used or expired pMDIs, using intravenous salbutamol and other short acting inhalers when available, and prescribing maintenance inhalers to prevent over usage of salbutamol pMDIs. We also highlight the important role of physicians and pharmacists in optimizing medication therapies to ensure adequate supplies.","Elbeddini, Ali; Tayefehchamani, Yasamin; Yang, Lucy",Drugs Ther Perspect,330,16

These stars are compiled from the literature, and the majority (~95%) have 6D phase-space information. We pay particular attention to systematic effects, such as the dynamical influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the effect of unrelaxed substructure. The LMC biases the (pre-LMC infall) halo mass estimates towards higher values, while realistic stellar halos from cosmological simulations tend to underestimate the true halo mass. After applying our method to the Milky Way data we find a mass within 100 kpc of M(<100 kpc) = 6.31 +/- 0.32 (stat.) +/- 1.26 (sys.) x 10^11 M_Sun. For this estimate, we have approximately corrected for the reflex motion induced by the LMC using the Erkal et al. model, which assumes a rigid potential for the LMC and MW. Furthermore, stars that likely belong to the Sagittarius stream are removed, and we include a 5% systematic bias, and a 20% systematic uncertainty based on our tests with cosmological simulations. Assuming the mass-concentration relation for Navarro-Frenk-White haloes, our mass estimate favours a total (pre-LMC infall) Milky Way mass of M_200c = 1.05 +/- 0.25 x 10^12 M_Sun, or (post-LMC infall) mass of M_200c = 1.20 +/- 0.25 x 10^12 M_Sun when a 1.5 x 10^11 M_Sun mass of a rigid LMC is included.","Deason, Alis J.; Erkal, Denis; Belokurov, Vasily; Fattahi, Azadeh; G'omez, Facundo A.; Grand, Robert J.

OBJECTIVE: To describe our endovascular experience in a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 who presented with large vessel occlusions, and to describe unique findings in this population. METHODS: Mechanical thrombectomy was performed on five consecutive patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusions. A retrospective study of these patients was performed. Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Clot fragmentation and distal emboli to a new vascular territory were seen in two of five (40%) patients, and downstream emboli were seen in all five (100%) patients. Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion. CONCLUSION: Our series of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated coagulation abnormalities, and compared with our previous experience with mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion, this group of patients were younger, had tandem or multiple territory occlusions, a large clot burden, and a propensity for clot fragmentation. These patients present unique challenges that make successful revascularization difficult.","Wang, Arthur; Mandigo, Grace K; Yim, Peter D; Meyers, Philip M; Lavine, Sean D",J Neurointerv Surg,330,16

With the monthly data of WTI oil price, China's fiscal policy uncertainty (FPU) index and monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) index from January 2000 to August 2020, this paper detailedly investigates how China's FPU and MPU respond to global oil price volatility in different oil price volatility regimes and time scales. The empirical results expose that: (1) China's FPU and MPU volatility would positively respond to WTI volatility in the low oil price volatility regime, while in the high oil price volatility regime, the FPU response is insignificant and MPU response is only significant and negative in the scale 3–4 (8–16 and 16–32 months);(2) Only in the middle-long term of low oil price volatility regime will the WTI volatility significantly respond to China's FPU and MPU volatility;and (3) The FPU and MPU volatility responses are more violent in high oil price volatility regime.

While pouch migration is a common phenomenon after sleeve gastrectomy, it has hardly been documented after RYGB so far. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to correlate the diagnostic performance of gastroscopy of the gastroesophageal junction with 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) during postoperative care of patients revised due to weight regain after RYGB, with particular attention to intrathoracic pouch migration (ITM) and pouch volume. SETTING: University Hospital Setting, Austria. METHODS: Thirty RYGB patients that were revised owing to weight regain (median age 37.5 yr) before December 2017 were included in this prospective study. CT findings were correlated with gastroscopy regarding pouch size and ITM. Pouch distention was achieved with both oral contrast and effervescent granules. All patients had CT and gastroscopy on the same day. In addition, patients were evaluated for reflux disease based on clinical history. RESULTS: ITM was found in 20 of 30 (66.7%) patients in CT, whereas gastroscopy did not correctly identify any herniation. In 16 of 28 (57.1%) patients pouch measurements at gastroscopy and CT showed a difference <40%. In 2 patients, pouch distention was not sufficient for CT volumetry. The intraclass correlation coefficient proved to be .594. Symptomatic reflux was present in 10 of 30 (33.3%) patients, 5 of whom had ITM. CONCLUSION: ITM is an underreported finding after revised RYGB and missed in gastroscopy. In terms of pouch volume, 3-dimensional-CT volumetry demonstrated only moderate agreement with gastroscopy.","Arnoldner, Michael A; Felsenreich, Daniel M; Langer, Felix B; Weber, Michael; Mang, Thomas; Kulinna-Cosentini, Christiane; Prager, Gerhard",Surg. obes. relat. dis,330,2

We describe the trends of the age and gender stratified outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe illness at the largest dedicated tertiary care COVID-19 government hospital in New Delhi, India. A retrospective cohort study through secondary data analysis from in-patient hospital data of patients admitted from April 1 to November 15, 2020 was conducted. The data of 10,314 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 was analyzed, of which 8899 (86.28%) were discharged after recovery, and 1415 (13.72%) died. The mean (SD) age of the hospitalized patients was 46.43 (18.74) years (n = 10,309) including 6031 (58.50%) male and 4278 (41.50%) female patients (n = 10,309). On bivariate analysis, increasing age was associated with significantly higher odds of mortality in both gender (p < .001). The mortality rate in female patients was lower (11.92%) compared with male patients (15.75%) (p = .675). However, elderly women had the highest odds of mortality (p < .001), indicating the possible role of delayed health seeking behavior, secondary to familial, and social neglect. Mortality in the patients with COVID-19 also occurred early after admission suggesting rapid deterioration, delayed reporting by patients, or their late referral from other health facilities. However, the overall statewide recovery rate showed steady improvement since the onset of the pandemic. In contrast, the recovery rate among the moderate-severe cases that were hospitalized at this tertiary care center during the same period reflected a lower nonspecific zigzag pattern indicating limited effectiveness of the COVID-19 treatment regimens.","Malhotra, Vikas; Basu, Saurav; Sharma, Nandini; Kumar, Suresh; Garg, Sandeep; Dushyant, Kumar; Borle, Amod",J Med Virol,330,21

Care during the confinement became a central feature of everyday life and often took a virtual turn, both among families and friends as well as in the distanced workplace. Yet meaningful caregiving from the organizations in times of economic uncertainty was mostly lacking and passed on to individual employees who felt a moral and gendered obligation to substitute for the corporate carelessness. The conflicts of care that emerged out of this situation came at the cost of self-care. We argue that, although the women in our study are mostly privileged, there is a surprising amount of suffering that took place.

Almost every discovery or status conference before the court - even before judges who demand meaningful conversations with the lawyers about the issues, like what discovery may be needed, what motions are likely, and what schedule should be tailored to the case - can be held more easily via videoconference, with very little sacrifice in the quality of the exchange. Because nearly all federal courts have conducted some proceedings during the pandemic via videoconference, the learning curve for many lawyers and courts alike is now fairly flat.11 Reliance on videoconference technology for these kinds of tasks benefits judges, lawyers, and clients. Imagine: no more air travel, car rental, and hotel room for a routine Rule 26(f) initial disclosure conference;no more traffic, courthouse parking, metal detectors, and thick briefcases for a status conference.

Despite improved availability and coverage of home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (HBPM, ABPM), both are infrequently used to confirm diagnoses. We used the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework, a multi-step process for mapping barriers to theory-informed behavior change techniques, to develop a multi-component implementation strategy for increasing out-of-office BP testing for hypertension diagnosis. Informed by geographically diverse provider focus groups (n = 63) exploring barriers to out-of-office testing and key informant interviews (n = 12), a multi-disciplinary team (medicine, psychology, nursing) used rigorous mixed methods to develop, refine, locally adapt, and finalize intervention components. The purpose of this report is to describe the protocol of the Effects of a Multi-faceted intervention on Blood pRessure Actions in the primary Care Environment (EMBRACE) trial, a cluster randomized control trial evaluating whether a theory-informed multi-component strategy increased out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis. METHODS/DESIGN: The EMBRACE Trial patient sample will include all adults &#8805; 18 years of age with a newly elevated office BP (&#8805; 140/90 mmHg) at a scheduled visit with a primary care provider from a study clinic. All providers with scheduled visits with adult primary care patients at enrolled ACN primary care clinics were included. We determined that the most feasible, effective implementation strategy would include delivering education about out-of-office testing, demonstration/instruction on how to perform out-of-office HBPM and ABPM testing, feedback on completion rates of out-of-office testing, environmental prompts/cues via computerized clinical decision support (CDS) tool, and a culturally tailored, locally accessible ABPM testing service. We are currently comparing the effect of this locally adapted multi-component strategy with usual care on the change in the proportion of eligible patients who complete out-of-office BP testing in a 1:1 cluster randomized trial across 8 socioeconomically diverse clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The EMBRACE trial is the first trial to test an implementation strategy for improving out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis. It will elucidate the degree to which targeting provider behavior via education, reminders, and decision support in addition to providing an ABPM testing service will improve referral to and completion of ABPM and HBPMs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov , NCT03480217 , Registered on 29 March 2018.","Moise, Nathalie; Phillips, Erica; Carter, Eileen; Alcantara, Carmela; Julian, Jacob; Thanataveerat, Anusorn; Schwartz, Joseph E; Ye, Siqin; Duran, Andrea; Shimbo, Daichi; Kronish, Ian M",Implement Sci,330,24

Due to the rapid spread and immense number of affected individuals worldwide, cost-effective, globally available, and safe options with minimal side effects and simple application are extremely warranted. This review will therefore discuss the potential of zinc as preventive and therapeutic agent alone or in combination with other strategies, as zinc meets all the above described criteria. While a variety of data on the association of the individual zinc status with viral and respiratory tract infections are available, study evidence regarding COVID-19 is so far missing but can be assumed as was indicated by others and is detailed in this perspective, focusing on re-balancing of the immune response by zinc supplementation. Especially, the role of zinc in viral-induced vascular complications has barely been discussed, so far. Interestingly, most of the risk groups described for COVID-19 are at the same time groups that were associated with zinc deficiency. As zinc is essential to preserve natural tissue barriers such as the respiratory epithelium, preventing pathogen entry, for a balanced function of the immune system and the redox system, zinc deficiency can probably be added to the factors predisposing individuals to infection and detrimental progression of COVID-19. Finally, due to its direct antiviral properties, it can be assumed that zinc administration is beneficial for most of the population, especially those with suboptimal zinc status.","Wessels, Inga; Rolles, Benjamin; Rink, Lothar",Front Immunol,330,27

We show that when the resulting signal-to-noise ratios are used to discriminate the deformation estimates based on their quality, as done for buoy records, the spatio-temporal scaling exponents for the mean total deformation rate increase, especially at smaller scale, such that a space-time coupling of the scaling $-$ which is otherwise absent $-$ emerges from the RGPS deformation data set, in accord with previous analyses performed with buoy observations. We also show that the pre-processing method used to reduce the effects of irregular sampling of the Lagrangian deformation fields can significantly impact the value of the deformation statistics and could possibly explain part of previous discrepancies between deformation statistics obtained with buoy records and large-scale SAR imagery. Specifically, we show that spurious lines of deformation appear when interpolating RGPS trajectories presenting temporal sampling inconsistencies. In the context of using observed sea-ice deformation statistics to constrain and improve the performance of sea-ice models, high confidence in the observed deformation field statistics is necessary. Using appropriate, well-documented, methods to derive the set of statistics to be reproduced by models therefore becomes crucial.","Bouchat, Amélie; Tremblay, Bruno",J. Geophys. Res. Oceans,330,19

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective autopsy study. SETTING: Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS: 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS: Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts. Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients. Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients. Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis. Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes. Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile. LIMITATION: The sample was small. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory and imaging studies, and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

Turkey declared the first case relatively late compared to Asian and European countries on March 11, as the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Turkey. In this study, we aimed to determine patients' outcomes in 50 surgeries done in the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 50 patients who underwent surgeries during the incubation period of CoVid-19 at Istinye University Gaziosmanpasa Medical Park Hospital in Istanbul, from March 2 to April 11, 2020. RESULTS: The age of 50 patients range was 21 to 73, and the median age was 43.32 (64%) patients were women. The median length of hospital stay is 2.6 days (1-21). Operations at various difficulty levels were also performed on patients with co-morbidities. No complication or mortality was observed except for 1 patient, and the ICU requirement of that patient was also due to high energy trauma.

Through aqueous hydration of dry, uniform thin-films of amphiphilic polymer and PBF species deposited on Teflon, self-assembled polymersomes are readily generated incorporating the hydrophobic fluorophores in prescribed molar ratios within their membranes. The size-dependent spectral properties of the PBFs allow for ready optical verification ( steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy) of the extent of vesicle membrane loading and enable delineation of intermembranous molecular interactions. The resultant effects of PBF membrane-loading on polymersome thermodynamic and mechanical stability are further assessed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and micropipet aspiration, respectively. We demonstrate that polymersomes can be loaded at up to 10 mol/wt% concentrations, with hydrophobic molecules that possess sizes comparable to those of large pharmaceutical conjugates ( ranging 1.4-5.4 nm in length and = 0.7-5.4 kg mol), without significantly compromising the robust thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities of these synthetic vesicle assemblies. Due to membrane incorporation, hydrophobic encapsulants are effectively prevented from self-aggregation, able to be highly concentrated in aqueous solution, and successfully shielded from deleterious environmental interactions. Together, these studies present a generalized paradigm for the generation of complex multi-functional materials that combine both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents, in mesoscopic dimensions, through cooperative self-assembly.","Ghoroghchian, P Peter; Lin, John J; Brannan, Aaron K; Frail, Paul R; Bates, Frank S; Therien, Michael J; Hammer, Daniel A",Soft Matter,330,4

However, the ceaseless increase in the use of online resources and governments’ responsibilisation approach to cybercrime prevention has created an ecosystem, which necessitates the empowerment of individuals. By introducing the concept of internal spheres of protection, the purpose of this paper is to show how traditionally public responsibilities require increased facilitation by individuals to adequately safeguard what they value.Design/methodology/approachThis is a brief conceptual paper, which recasts the individual’s role in cybercrime prevention through a critique of the routine activity theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979) and explains how responsibilisation (Garland, 1996) has created an unavoidable need to provide individuals with the knowledge and tools required to avoid online victimisation.FindingsIn the context of cybercrime, criminological theories that are limited in considering the individual both as the target of crime and the person likeliest to prevent it are quickly becoming outdated. Public authorities either cannot intervene or are moving away from intervening on citizens’ behalf to effectively stymie the pressure from cybercriminals. Thus, there is a need of an approach that starts with individuals and their value-based motivations.Originality/valueThe concept of internal spheres of protection is a novel way of looking at cybercrime prevention. The internal spheres are based on individuals’ values, and the value of security in particular, and take cyber-knowledge as a point of departure towards safeguarding such values, i.e. through risk-decreasing actions and the use of relevant tools.","Kikerpill, Kristjan",Kybernetes,330,24

For this reason, public health interventions have sought to constrain unrepeated or recurrent gatherings to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unfortunately, the range of different types of gatherings hinders specific guidance from setting limiting parameters (e.g. total size, number of cohorts, the extent of physical distancing). Methods: We used a generic modelling framework, based on fundamental probability principles, to derive simple formulas to assess introduction and transmission risks associated with gatherings, as well as the potential efficiency of some testing strategies to mitigate these risks. Results: Introduction risk can be broadly assessed with the population prevalence and the size of the gathering, while transmission risk at a gathering is mainly driven by the gathering size. For recurrent gatherings, the cohort structure does not have a significant impact on transmission between cohorts. Testing strategies can mitigate risk, but frequency of testing and test performance are factors in finding a balance between detection and false positives. Conclusion: The generality of the modelling framework used here helps to disentangle the various factors affecting transmission risk at gatherings and may be useful for public health decision-making.","Champredon, D.; Fazil, A.; Ogden, N.

This research provides quantitative molecular understanding of the role of the DES thickness and also the type of solid support in CO2 sorption and diffusion using molecular dynamics simulations. In general, the proposed model based on supported DESs immobilized on different supports was developed to correlate the solubility of CO2 in DESs based on choline chloride. The simulated systems illustrate that CO2 molecules mainly accumulate at the gas/DES interface in short times, whereas diffusion of CO2 to the bulk DESs is slower as the thickness of the immobilized DES increases. In addition, the CO2 absorption capacity of both DESs coated on the TiO2 surface is larger than that on the graphite surface. Structural and dynamic characteristics were determined using density profiles, distribution functions, orientational analysis, and mean-square displacements. We further demonstrate the effective interaction parameters associated with CO2 capture by DESs via density functional theory.","Heydari Dokoohaki, Maryam; Zolghadr, Amin Reza",J. phys. chem.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with students living on or near the UC Berkeley campus from June 1st through August 18th, 2020 with the goal of providing guidance for campus reopening in the safest possible manner. In this cohort, we piloted an alternative testing model to provide access to low-barrier, high-touch testing and augment student-driven testing with data-driven adaptive surveillance that targets higher-risk students and triggers testing notifications based on reported symptoms, exposures, or other relevant information. A total of 2,180 students enrolled in the study, 51% of them undergraduates. Overall, 6,247 PCR tests were administered to 2,178 students over the two-month period. Overall test positivity rate was 0.9%; 2.6% of students tested positive. Uptake and acceptability of regular symptom and exposure surveys was high; 98% of students completed at least one survey, and average completion rate was 67% (Median: 74%, IQR: 39%) for daily reporting of symptoms and 68% (Median: 75%, IQR: 40%) for weekly reporting of exposures. Of symptom-triggered tests, 5% were PCR-positive; of exposure-triggered tests, 10% were PCR-positive. The integrated study database augmented traditional contact tracing during an outbreak; 17 potentially exposed students were contacted the following day and sent testing notifications. At study end, 81% of students selected their desire ""to contribute to UC Berkeley's response to COVID-19"" as a reason for their participation in the Safe Campus study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the synergy created by bringing together a student-friendly, harm reduction approach to COVID-19 testing with an integrated data system and analytics. We recommend the use of a confidential, consequence-free, incentive-based daily symptom and exposure reporting system, coupled with low-barrier, easy access, no stigma testing. Testing should be implemented alongside a system that integrates multiple data sources to effectively trigger testing notifications to those at higher risk of infection and encourages students to come in for low-barrier testing when needed.","Packel, Laura; Reingold, Arthur; Hunter, Lauren; Facente, Shelley; Li, Yi; Harte, Anna; Nicolette, Guy; Urnov, Fyodor D; Lu, Michael; Petersen, Maya",PLoS One,330,22

Currently, it has been revealed that patients with underlying disease, especially those with kidney disease are more prone to develop complications. Some studies associate kidney transplantation as a risk factor for COVID-19 progression; however, epidemiologic data that demonstrate this are amazingly rare. Considering the importance of the topic, we report on six kidney transplant recipients (median age 47 [41-55]) with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. The most common admission presentations were fever (83.3%), dyspnea, and myalgia. At baseline, immunosuppressive therapy was ceased, prednisolone dose was increased, and all patients received antiviral treatment including hydroxychloroquine and umifenovir. After a median follow-up of 11.5 days from admission, six patients (100%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), 50% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and two patients (33.3%) deceased as a result of deterioration in respiratory status. Overall, these findings demonstrate that respiratory involvement may be a risk indicator of in-hospital mortality in kidney recipients with COVID-19. In addition, AKI development in kidney recipients with COVID-19 is of utmost importance given the higher AKI occurrence in these patients compared with others. Therefore, more intensive attention should be paid to kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19.","Rahimzadeh, Hormat; Keykhaei, Mohammad; Razeghi, Effat; Zivari, Ensieh; Mansouri, Ensieh Sadat",CEN case reports,330,29

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined the condition as ""Coronavirus 2019 Disease"" (COVID-19). In February, its presence was confirmed in South America and Ecuador. On March 11th, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. This condition mainly afflicts the respiratory system. However, reports of neurological manifestations in confirmed COVID-19 p atients have recently emerged. Methods. Multiple databases were reviewed, the information was extracte d and analyzed independently by 3 authors. Results. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were identified. Including: myalgia, headache, altered mental status, cerebrovascular events, dizziness, hypogeusia, hyposmia, neuropathic pain, visual impairment, ataxia, seizures, Central Hypoventilation Syndrome, encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), meningitis and encephalitis.Conclusion. COVID-19 is associated with neurological involvement. It is most frequently observed in cases that are severe, atypical, and with comorbidities. Health care providers and neurologists alike, must remain alert and keep high suspicion of severity when these manifestations are present. Timely recognition might help initiate early treatment and isolation, preventing clinical decline and viral spread.","Moreno-Zambrano, D.; Arévalo-Mora, M.; Freire-Bonifacini, A.; García-Santibanez, R.; Santibáñez-Vásquez, R.",Revista Ecuatoriana de Neurologia,330,6

The study aims to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies implemented to effectively prevent the invasion and spread of the virus. METHOD: Conduct a status analysis in accordance with the Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) 4-step model, construct a response workflow, confirm the failure mode and potential causes, perform hazard matrix analysis and decision tree analysis, and formulate risk control management measures. RESULTS: For the 4 main processes and 9 subprocesses of the accompanying carers and contract caregivers entering the hospital, 26 potential failure modes and 42 potential causes of failure were analyzed. Following implementing improvement measures including strategies targeting the accompanying person, mitigation workflow failure rates decreased from 42 to 13 items, the pass rate for the maximum body temperature cutoff increased from 53.1% to 90.8%, and the compliance rate of hand washing increased from 89.5% to 100%. CONCLUSION: The HFMEA model can effectively implement preventive risk assessment and workflow management of high-risk medical procedures. The model can adjudicate the health of hospital visitors during the epidemic/pandemic, provide epidemic/pandemic education training and preventive measure health education guidance for hospital visits, and improve their epidemic prevention cognition. When combined, these strategies can prevent nosocomial infection to achieve the best anti-epidemic effect.","Tiao, Chi-Hui; Tsai, Ling-Chin; Chen, Li-Chin; Liao, Yu-Mei; Sun, Li-Chen",,330,1

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and to explore risk factors of death, critical care admission, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a high-altitude population living in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: We conducted a concurrent cohort study of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from electronic records. Univariate and multivariable methods were performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and outcomes at 28 days of follow-up. Results: 377 adults (56.8% male) were included in the study, of whom 85 (22.6%) died. Nonsurvivors were older on average than survivors (mean age, 56.7 years [SD 15.8] vs. 70.1 years [SD 13.9]; p &#8804; 0.001) and more likely male (28 [32.9%] vs. 57 [67.1%]; p=0.029). Most patients had at least one underlying disease (333 [88.3%]), including arterial hypertension (149 [39.5%]), overweight (145 [38.5%]), obesity (114 [30.2%]), and diabetes mellitus (82 [21.8%]). Frequency of critical care admission (158 [41.9%]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (123 [32.6%]) was high. Age over 65 years (OR 9.26, 95% CI 3.29-26.01; p &#8804; 0.001), ICU admission (OR 12.37, 95% CI 6.08-25.18; p &#8804; 0.001), and arterial pH higher than 7.47 (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.74; p=0.01) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: In this study of in-hospital patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia living at high altitude, frequency of death was similar to what has been reported. ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation were high. Risk factors as older age, ICU admission, and arterial pH were associated with mortality.","Galindo, Javier Leonardo; Lutz, Juan Ricardo; Izquierdo, María Alejandra; Parra, Katherine; Prieto, Lina María; Carrillo, Jorge Alberto",Can Respir J,330,2

Several substitutions at isoleucine 38 in PA protein (e.g., PA-I38T) have been associated with decreased baloxavir susceptibility in vitro and in vivo. In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and pyrosequencing have been used by CDC and U.S. Public Health Laboratories to monitor drug susceptibility of influenza viruses. Here we described an improved pyrosequencing assay for detecting influenza A viruses carrying substitutions at PA-38. Cyclic and customized orders of nucleotide dispensation were evaluated, and pyrosequencing results were compared to those generated using NGS. Our data showed that the customized nucleotide dispensation has improved the pyrosequencing assay performance in identification of double mixtures (e.g., PA-38I/T); however, identification of PA-38 variants in triple mixtures remains a challenge. While NGS analysis indicated the presence of PA-I38K in one clinical specimen and isolate, our attempts to detect this mutation by pyrosequencing or recover the virus carrying PA-I38K in cell culture were unsuccessful, raising a possibility of a rarely occurring sequencing error. Overall, pyrosequencing provides a convenient means to detect baloxavir resistant influenza viruses when NGS is unavailable or a faster turnaround time is required.","Patel, Mira C; Mishin, Vasiliy P; De La Cruz, Juan A; Chesnokov, Anton; Nguyen, Ha T; Wilson, Malania M; Barnes, John; Kondor, Rebecca J G; Wentworth, David E; Gubareva, Larisa V",Antiviral Res,330,29

However, robust data to support this from large-scale seroepidemiological studies are lacking. We report a longitudinal seroprevalence analysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, with baseline sampling prior to large-scale practice reopening in July 2020 and follow-up postimplementation of new public health guidance on infection prevention control (IPC) and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). In total, 1,507 West Midlands DCPs were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence was determined using a combined IgGAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the cohort followed longitudinally for 6 mo until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United Kingdom and vaccination commencement. Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3%, compared to estimates in the regional population of 6% to 7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3- and 6-mo follow-up and conferred a 75% reduced risk of infection. Nonwhite ethnicity and living in areas of greater deprivation were associated with increased baseline seroprevalence. During follow-up, no polymerase chain reaction-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. After vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in those individuals who were seropositive at baseline. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to enhanced PPE was significantly higher in DCPs than the regional population. Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 mo after initial sampling and 9 mo from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech 162b vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.","Shields, A M; Faustini, S E; Kristunas, C A; Cook, A M; Backhouse, C; Dunbar, L; Ebanks, D; Emmanuel, B; Crouch, E; Kröger, A; Hirschfeld, J; Sharma, P; Jaffery, R; Nowak, S; Gee, S; Drayson, M T; Richter, A G; Dietrich, T; Chapple, I L C",J Dent Res,330,16

Through a process of expert consultation, we identified and categorised, into 19 themes and 70 sub-themes, the ways in which biodiversity and its conservation has been or could be impacted by the pandemic globally; nearly 60% of which were broadly negative in impact. Subsequently, we created a compendium (see Supporting Information) of all themes and sub-themes, each with explanatory text, and in August 2020 a diverse group of experienced conservationists with expertise from across sectors and geographies assessed each sub-theme for its likely impact on biodiversity conservation globally. The 9 sub-themes ranked highest were all negative in impact. These were, in rank order: governments side-lining the environment during their economic recovery, reduced wildlife-based tourism income, increased habitat destruction, reduced government funding, increased plastic and other solid waste pollution, weakening of pro-nature regulations and their enforcement, increased illegal harvest of wild animals, reduced philanthropy, and threats to survival of conservation organisations. In combination, these impacts present a worrying future of increased threats to biodiversity conservation but reduced capacity to counter them. The highest-ranking positive impact, at 10, was the beneficial impact of wildlife trade restrictions. More optimistically, amongst impacts ranked 11 to 20, 6 were positive and 4 were negative. We hope our assessment will draw attention to the impacts of the pandemic, improving the conservation community's ability to respond to them in the future.

However, few studies have investigated the role of diet-alone interventions in improving individuals' weight gain by taking AAPs. In closed management mental hospitals of China, family members are allowed to bring food to patients regularly, causing patients to have caloric intake added to their 3 daily meals. However, during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing food to the hospital was temporarily prohibited in mental health institutions in China to prevent the spread of the virus. This study sought to compare the body weight and body mass index (BMI) changes of patients taking olanzapine or clozapine undergoing diet-alone interventions caused by this prohibition. METHODS: A retrospective self-controlled study was conducted on 90 patients with schizophrenia from a single-center treated with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy, or combined with aripiprazole or ziprasidone which has a small metabolic impact. A paired-samples t-test was used to compare the changes in body weight and BMI before and after the 3-month prohibition, and general linear regression was used to analyze the effects of gender, age, disease course, duration of drug exposure, and equivalent dose on the BMI improvement. Also, the percentage of people who lost weight and that of individuals who lost 5% of their pre-prohibition body weight were calculated. RESULTS: Paired-samples t-test showed that after 3-month prohibition, the patients' body weight (71.68±6.83 vs. 66.91±7.03, P<0.001) and BMI (26.43±2.11 vs. 24.63±1.81, P<0.001) decreased significantly. Weight loss rate accounted for 99.1%, and weight loss of 5% from the pre-prohibition body weight accounted for 71.8%. General linear regression showed that the duration of drug exposure (ß =-0.678, P<0.001) was significantly and negatively correlated with the BMI changes.

By understanding and mitigating user concerns and tradeoffs. This document provides a framework for considering the user-relevant components of COVID apps and corresponding user tradeoffs related to these apps. Specifically, we enumerate user tradeoffs related to data collection, data quality, identifier/data encryption, privacy invasion, mobile costs, user agency, benefits from app use, and app transparency. We break down which tradeoffs are relevant for which contact tracing implementations (centralized vs. decentralized, location- vs. proximity-based).

METHODS: This was a proof-of-concept study from a tertiary eye care center in Oakville, Canada. All participants underwent the N95 Qualitative Fit Test with a custom mask fitter secured over an American Society for Testing and Materials Level 3 face mask. Participants answered a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire on comfort, ease of use, and feasibility of the custom mask fitter, as well as comfort of a regular face mask. RESULTS: Twenty participants were recruited. Of the 20 recruited, 18 (90%) successfully passed the fit test. The median scores for comfort, ease of use, and everyday feasibility for the custom mask fitter were 3.5, 4.5, and 3, respectively, whereas the median score for comfort of a regular face mask was 8.5. CONCLUSION: A reusable, low-cost, 3D-printed custom mask fitter is a potential effective alternative to an N95 respirator among eye care professionals but may require improvement in its design and comfort.

All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the ""down"" conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt the receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. We further identified critical residues in the RBD underlying different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes. These results collectively indicate that tight RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient infection.","Zhang, Shuyuan; Qiao, Shuyuan; Yu, Jinfang; Zeng, Jianwei; Shan, Sisi; Tian, Long; Lan, Jun; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",Nat Commun,330,16

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of recently published studies examining ultrasound-guided diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques for the brachial plexus (BP) to favor their preferent use in patients at risk of respiratory function compromise. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 18 months, study findings on various diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques have demonstrated comparable block analgesic effectivity with a variable extent of phrenic nerve paralysis. The impact of hemi-diaphragmatic function impairment on clinical outcomes is yet to be established. SUMMARY: Existing diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus regional anesthesia techniques used for shoulder and clavicle surgery may help minimize pulmonary complications by preserving lung function, especially in patients prone to respiratory compromise. Used as an anesthetic technique, they can reduce the risk of exposure of healthcare teams to aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs), albeit posing an increased risk for hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and obtaining opioid-sparing analgesia without jeopardizing efficacy should be prioritized goals of regional anesthesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cubillos, Javier; Girón-Arango, Laura; Muñoz-Leyva, Felipe",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,330,26

The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 µM around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on ß-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 193±23 µM), and the inhibition became weaker on ß-glucuronidase and &#945;-rhamnosidase (IC50>500 µM). The consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the inhibition of darunavir on the activity of ß-glucosidase and ß-glucuronidase may be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and &#945;-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients with Covid-19.","Dai, Tianming; Wang, Min; Wang, Pengzhen; Dai, Libing; Dai, Renke; Meng, Qingqi",Pharmazie,330,16

This infectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000 counties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering and complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex spacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction or smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the propagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a generative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We further adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn the model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover, the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more scalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning performance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social distancing policy based on the learned generative model.","Li, Shuang; Wang, Lu; Chen, Xinyun; Fang, Yixiang; Song, Yan",,330,16

Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes. Whole body FDG-PET for staging of breast cancer requires specific attention to physiologic variants of FDG distribution and a careful comparison with co-registered anatomical imaging. The most important pitfalls are related to inflammatory changes including sarcoidosis, sarcoid like reactions, and other granulomatous diseases as well as secondary neoplastic processes.","Kikano, Elias George; Avril, Stefanie; Marshall, Holly; Jones, Robert Stanley; Montero, Alberto J; Avril, Norbert",Semin. nucl. med,330,24

The Association of American Medical Colleges has established strong recommendations for transitioning to virtual interviews for the 2020-2021 residency application cycle. The transition to virtual interviews is a double-edged sword and is bound to cause anxiety among senior medical students. Although such interviews serve as an opportunity to minimize expenditure and maximize flexibility, convenience, and time utilization, they come at the potential cost of sacrificing the ability to assess applicants and residency programs. Through this article, we discuss the pros and cons of the virtual interview process and offer suggestions for applicants and programs to optimize this experience. We will also elaborate on the possibility of magnified disparity in the number of interviews between applicants as a result of the lack of time and cost limitation. The Association of American Medical Colleges should strongly consider limiting the number of interviews an applicant can attend in each specialty, to avert this imminent effect.","Asaad, Malke; Rajesh, Aashish; Kambhampati, Praneeth V; Rohrich, Rod J; Maricevich, Renata",Ann. plast. sur,330,20

We further examined whether adding a synthetic amendment impacts the microbial ecosystem in the composted materials. Three mixing ratios were used to investigate composting performance: no synthetic amendment (T0), 5% synthetic amendment (T1), and 10% synthetic amendment (T2) (T1 and T2 were measured as a wet weight ratio). There were no significant differences in the fundamental characteristics between composting products in T0 and T1. The moisture content of composting material in T0, T1, and T2 significantly decreased from a baseline of approximately 65% to 35.5%, 37.3%, and 55.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the germination index significantly increased to 111.6%, 155.6%, and 62.3%, respectively. When an optimal proportion of synthetic amendment was added, T1 showed high degree of humification, lignocellulase activities, and effective biodegradation. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in all treatment groups. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis, starch, and sucrose metabolism were among the primary pathways in predicted functions.

In the present study, we performed an integrated analysis of metabonomics, proteomics and lipidomics to establish a scientific research system on the underlying mechanism of TCMs, and Schisandra lignan extract (SLE) was selected as a model TCM. In metabonomics, several metabolic pathways were found to mediate the liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP), and SLE could regulate the disorder of lipid metabolism. The proteomic study further proved that the hepatoprotective effect of SLE was closely related to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Indeed, the results of lipidomics demonstrated that SLE-dosing has an obvious callback effect on APAP-induced lipidic profile shift. The contents of 25 diglycerides (DAGs) and 21 triglycerides (TAGs) were enhanced significantly by APAP-induced liver injury, which could further induce liver injury and inflammatory response by up-regulating protein kinase C (PKCß, PKCÎ³, PKCÎ´ and PKCÎ¸). The up-regulated lipids and PKCs could be reversed to the normal level by SLE-dosing. More importantly, phosphatidic acid phosphatase (lipin1), fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were proved to be positively associated with the regulation of DAGs and TAGs. Significance Statement Integrated multi-omics was first used to reveal the mechanism of APAP-induced acute liver failure (ALF) and hepatoprotective role of SLE. The results showed that the ALF caused by APAP was closely related to lipid regulation and SLE-dosing could exert hepatoprotective role by reducing intrahepatic DAG and TAG levels. Our research can not only promote the application of multi-component technology in the study of the mechanism of TCMs, but also provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of ALF.","Yan, Caixia; Guo, Huimin; Ding, Qingqing; Shao, Yuhao; Kang, Dian; Yu, Tengjie; Li, Changjian; Huang, Haoran; Du, Yisha; Wang, He; Hu, Kangrui; Xie, Lin; Wang, Guangji; Liang, Yan",Drug metab. dispos,330,16

Among them, patients with cancer of the upper and lower airways share other risk factors, mostly related to tobacco-smoke exposure, including male gender, airway epithelial damages, chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clinical and pathophysiological factors shared by these conditions are reviewed. METHODS: Review of the published literature since the beginning of 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease and SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding occurs in nasal and bronchial epithelial respiratory cells through the interaction with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, both overexpressed in smokers and former smokers. Tobacco-smoke airway exposure is also characterized by a chronic inflammation with activation of inflammatory cells and cytokine release including interleukin-6 (IL-6). A high release of cytokine in response to viral infection is documented in COVID-19 patients with adverse clinical outcomes and IL-6 is a key element of the cytokine storm syndrome leading to multi-organ damage. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancers of the upper and lower airways might be at increased risk of infection, morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 also because of tobacco exposure, a key factor in triggering inflammation, immunity and cancer.","Gallo, Oreste",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,330,26

Evidence exists to support the claim that the virus can be spread through the air, but the relative significance of airborne transmission has not been well defined. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and hot-wire anemometry (HWA) measurements were conducted at 1 m away from the mouth of human subjects to develop a model for cough flow behavior at greater distances from the mouth than were studied previously. Biological aerosol sampling was conducted to assess the risk of exposure to airborne viruses. Throughout the investigation, 77 experiments were conducted from 58 different subjects. From these subjects, 21 presented with influenza-like illness. Of these, 12 subjects had laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections. A model was developed for the cough centerline velocity magnitude time history. The experimental results were also used to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The peak velocity observed at the cough jet center, averaged across all trials, was 1.2 m/s, and an average jet spread angle of Î¸ = 24° was measured, similar to that of a steady free jet. No differences were observed in the velocity or turbulence characteristics between coughs from sick, convalescent, or healthy participants.","Dudalski, Nicholas; Mohamed, Ahmed; Mubareka, Samira; Bi, Ran; Zhang, Chao; Savory, Eric",Indoor Air,330,16

To address this issue, we propose a flexible transoral robot with a teleoperated configuration for swab sampling. The robot comprises a flexible manipulator, an endoscope with a monitor, and a master device. A 3-prismatic-universal (3-PU) flexible parallel mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) is used to realize the manipulator's movements. The flexibility of the manipulator improves the safety of testees. Besides, the master device is similar to the manipulator in structure. It is easy to use for operators. Under the guidance of the vision from the endoscope, the surgeon can operate the master device to control the swab's motion attached to the manipulator for sampling. In this paper, the robotic system, the workspace, and the operation procedure are described in detail. The tongue depressor, which is used to prevent the tongue's interference during the sampling, is also tested. The accuracy of the manipulator under visual guidance is validated intuitively. Finally, the experiment on a human phantom is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the robot preliminarily.","Li, C.; Gu, X.; Xiao, X.; Lim, C.

It has been widely endorsed by relevant specialty colleges and societies. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: Generic guidelines exist for the intubation of different patient groups, as do resources to facilitate airway rescue and transition to the ""can't intubate, can't oxygenate"" scenario. They should be followed where they do not contradict our specific recommendations for the COVID-19 patient group. Consideration should be given to using a checklist that has been specifically modified for the COVID-19 patient group. Early intubation should be considered to prevent the additional risk to staff of emergency intubation and to avoid prolonged use of high flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. Significant institutional preparation is required to optimise staff and patient safety in preparing for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group. The principles for airway management should be the same for all patients with COVID-19 (asymptomatic, mild or critically unwell). Safe, simple, familiar, reliable and robust practices should be adopted for all episodes of airway management for patients with COVID-19. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: Airway clinicians in Australia and New Zealand should now already be involved in regular intensive training for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group. This training should focus on the principles of early intervention, meticulous planning, vigilant infection control, efficient processes, clear communication and standardised practice.","Brewster, David J; Chrimes, Nicholas; Do, Thy Bt; Fraser, Kirstin; Groombridge, Christopher J; Higgs, Andy; Humar, Matthew J; Leeuwenburg, Timothy J; McGloughlin, Steven; Newman, Fiona G; Nickson, Chris P; Rehak, Adam; Vokes, David; Gatward, Jonathan J",Med J Aust,330,8

In order to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions, detailed descriptions of their timelines, scale and scope are needed. The Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 (HIT-COVID) is a curated and standardized global database that catalogues the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 related PHSM. With a team of over 200 volunteer contributors, we assembled policy timelines for a range of key PHSM aimed at reducing COVID-19 risk for the national and first administrative levels (e.g. provinces and states) globally, including details such as the degree of implementation and targeted populations.

We aimed to study epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infants and children admitted for pertussis to a tertiary-care hospital and to investigate the risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With a retrospective study, we analyzed all medical reports of patients admitted to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome from January 2011 to December 2018 with a diagnosis of pertussis. RESULTS: We examined 195 patients. The majority of hospitalized children (66.15%) were <3 months of age. No mother had received pertussis containing vaccine during pregnancy. Ten cases required admission in PICU. The age at admission was lower in PICU patients with respect to ward patients (42.8 vs 240 days; p < .0007), length of hospital stay was longer in PICU group (24.7 vs 7.52 days; p < .003). Patients who needed PICU admission had greater white blood cell count at hospital admission compared with those hospitalized in the pediatric ward. One infant died and one had encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a remerging disease. In infants, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, many countries have implemented different vaccination strategies and public health measures to prevent the increase in pertussis cases. Maternal vaccination has been shown to be highly protective for infants <3 months of age before they can develop their own immunity via vaccination.","Di Camillo, Chiara; Vittucci, Anna Chiara; Antilici, Livia; Ciarlitto, Claudia; Linardos, Giulia; Concato, Carlo; Lancella, Laura; Villani, Alberto",Hum Vaccin Immunother,330,24

Using weekly data on the use of trade policy instruments during the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January-July, 2020), we assess the relationship between the use of trade policy instruments and attributes of pre-crisis public procurement regulation. Controlling for country size, government effectiveness and economic factors, we find that use of export restrictions targeting medical products is strongly positively correlated with the total number of steps and average time required to complete procurement processes in the pre-crisis period. Membership of trade agreements encompassing public procurement disciplines is associated with actions to facilitate trade in medical products. These findings suggest future empirical assessments of the drivers of trade policy during the pandemic should consider public procurement systems.","Hoekman, Bernard; Shingal, Anirudh; Eknath, Varun; Ereshchenko, Viktoriya",World econ,330,23

We aim to describe our experience providing acute stroke care at a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) and the impact of the pandemic on the quality of care for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from a quality improvement registry of consecutive AIS patients at New York University Langone Health's CSC between 06/01/2019-05/15/2020. During the early stages of the pandemic, the acute stroke process was modified to incorporate COVID-19 screening, testing, and other precautionary measures. We compared stroke quality metrics including treatment times and discharge outcomes of AIS patients during the pandemic (03/012020-05/152020) compared with a historical pre-pandemic group (6/1/2019-2/29/2020). RESULTS: A total of 754 patients (pandemic-120; pre-pandemic-634) were admitted with a principal diagnosis of AIS; 198 (26.3%) received alteplase and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Despite longer median door to head CT times (16 vs 12 minutes; p = 0.05) and a trend towards longer door to groin puncture times (79.5 vs. 71 min, pâ¯=â¯0.06), the time to alteplase administration (36 vs 35 min; pâ¯=â¯0.83), door to reperfusion times (103 vs 97 min, pâ¯=â¯0.18) and defect-free care (95.2% vs 94.7%; pâ¯=â¯0.84) were similar in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups. Successful recanalization rates (TICI&#8805;2b) were also similar (82.6% vs. 86.7%, pâ¯=â¯0.48). After adjusting for stroke severity, age and a prior history of transient ischemic attack/stroke, pandemic patients had increased discharge mortality (adjusted OR 2.90 95% CI 1.77 - 7.17, pâ¯=â¯0.021) CONCLUSION: Despite unprecedented demands on emergency healthcare services, early multidisciplinary efforts to adapt the acute stroke treatment process resulted in keeping the stroke quality time metrics close to pre-pandemic levels. Future studies will be needed with a larger cohort comparing discharge and long-term outcomes between pre-pandemic and pandemic AIS patients.","Agarwal, Shashank; Scher, Erica; Rossan-Raghunath, Nirmala; Marolia, Dilshad; Butnar, Mariya; Torres, Jose; Zhang, Cen; Kim, Sun; Sanger, Matthew; Humbert, Kelley; Tanweer, Omar; Shapiro, Maksim; Raz, Eytan; Nossek, Erez; Nelson, Peter K; Riina, Howard A; de Havenon, Adam; Wachs, Michael; Farkas, Jeffrey; Tiwari, Ambooj; Arcot, Karthikeyan; Parella, David Turkel; Liff, Jeremy; Wu, Tina; Wittman, Ian; Caldwell, Reed; Frontera, Jennifer; Lord, Aaron; Ishida, Koto; Yaghi, Shadi",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,330,22

Noteworthily, diabetes mellitus (DM) and poorly controlled blood glucose increase the risk of mortality and severity of COVID-19. Intravenous (IV) insulin administration with hourly monitoring of blood glucose is the ideal approach in managing patients with hyperglycemic crisis, but it is not judicious to be applied in developing countries where shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a major issue. Furthermore, increasing the probability of ""already greater risks"" for doctors or other healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 seems inappropriate. Thus, an alternative administration strategy and more moderate glucose monitoring to reduce the contact exposure of healthcare workers with COVID-19 patients, by ensuring appropriate blood glucose levels, needs to be performed in this critical pandemic era. Subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin analog administration could presumably be a solution to this contentious issue.","Permana, Hikmat; Soetedjo, Nanny Natalia M",Diabetes Metab Syndr,330,24

N Engl J Med 2020). Detection of biomarkers of endothelial injury in circulating blood may provide critical diagnostic and prognostic information on the disease course (Goshua et al. Lancet Haematology 2020). Endothelial injury is also a cornerstone of pathobiology in other septic and potentially life-threatening inflammatory syndromes. Objectives: To identify circulating markers of endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients, and compare their levels with those observed in other septic syndromes. Methods: Plasma samples from non-critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (positive nasopharyngeal swab and confirmatory radiological chest imaging) requiring admission (n=42) were collected during the first 36h of hospitalization. Endothelial damage was evaluated by measuring in plasma: i) markers of endothelial function and activation (sVCAM-1, VWF, ADAMTS-13 activity, Protein C and α2-antiplasmin as a marker of fibrinolysis); ii) heparan sulfate (HS) levels, as indicators of endothelial glycocalyx degradation and loss of endothelial barrier function; and iii) C5b9 deposits on endothelial cells in culture, and soluble C5b9 (sC5b9) levels, to measure complement activation. Circulating dsDNA was analyzed as an indicator of the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). ELISA tests were used for sVCAM-1, Protein C, HS, and sC5b9 levels. ADAMTS-13 activity was evaluated by FRETS. VWF, Protein C, and α2-antiplasmin were measured at the Atellica COAG 360 (Siemens Healthineers). C5b9 deposits were assessed by immunofluorescence and dsDNA levels by Quant-iT PicoGreen assay kit. Results were compared with those obtained in healthy donors (controls, n=45), and patients with non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS, n=8) and septic shock (SS, n=8). Results: Levels of sVCAM-1 were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients vs. controls, NI-SIRS and SS (159±12 vs. 79±4, 57±8 and 80±10 ng/mL, respectively, p<0.005) (Mean±SDM). VWF was elevated in COVID-19 patients vs. controls (240±26 vs. 96±5%, p<0.001), with similar values in NI-SIRS (271±40%), and significantly reduced vs. SS (476±43%, p<0.001). HS levels in COVID-19 patients were twice those detected in controls (1669±174 vs. 839±36 ng/mL, p=0.001), but they did not differ from those in NI-SIRS (1372±368 ng/mL), and were significantly lower than in SS (3677±880 ng/mL, p<0.001 vs COVID-19). Regarding complement activation, deposits of C5b9 on endothelial cells were significantly increased vs. controls (2-fold, p<0.01), with no notable differences vs. NI-SIRS (3±1-fold) and significantly lower than in SS (8±2-fold, p<0.001). Remarkably, sC5b9 levels were much more elevated in COVID-19 patients (1064±120 vs. 204±11 ng/mL, p<0.001), and no significant differences were observed vs. NI-SIRS (902±160 ng/mL) or SS (958±180 ng/mL). Also of note, presence of NETs was significantly elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients vs. controls (16±1.3 vs. 2±0.3 ng/ml, p<0.001), but similar to NI-SIRS (19±5 ng/mL) and clearly inferior to SS (33±6 ng/mL, p<0.001) (Figure). Importantly and in contrast, ADAMTS-13 activity, Protein C, and α2-antiplasmin values were within the normal range in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our data clearly demonstrate the presence of endothelial stress products in the circulating blood of non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. These biomarkers of endothelial injury are suggestive indicators of different aspects of the disease: specifically, release of acute phase reactants, degradation of the endothelial cell glycocalyx, and activation of the complement system. Furthermore, this profile of biomarkers in COVID-19 appears specific, with a differential behavior in comparison with septic shock, in which endothelial damage is also known to be critical. Additional studies are needed to validate these biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools of the endothelial complications in COVID-19 patients, both in early disease and later, as well as supporting specific forms of therapeutic intervention.

Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between the 19th of March and the 6th of April 2020 in three Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait) to explore the knowledge and practices of the Middle Eastern population regarding COVID-19. A previously developed questionnaire was adapted and used for this study. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1208 participants (members of the public) participated from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%). Participants had moderate overall COVID-19 knowledge, with a mean (SD) score of 7.93 (±1.72) out of 12 (66.1%). Participants had better knowledge about disease prevention and control (83.0%), whereas the lowest sub-scale scores were for questions about disease transmission routes (43.3%). High education level was an important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Further public education is needed to address the relatively low level of education regarding the transmission of COVID-19 in the Middle Eastern countries. Policymakers are recommended to develop informative COVID-19 related campaigns that specifically target young people (university students), unemployed individuals, and those with lower levels of education.","Naser, Abdallah Y.; Dahmash, Eman Zmaily; Alsairafi, Zahra Khalil; Alwafi, Hassan; Alyami, Hamad; Jalal, Zahraa; Al Rajeh, Ahmed M.; Paudyal, Vibhu; Alhartani, Yosra J.; Turkistani, Fawaz Mohammad; Hassanin, Fadi Fouad",Int J Environ Res Public Health,330,32

Our approach used the thermophilic family 9 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM9) as an N-terminal carrier protein and affinity tag. The CBM9 module was joined to SARS-CoV-2 protein fragments via a flexible proline-threonine linker, which proved to be resistant to E. coli proteases. Two CBM9-spike protein fragment fusion proteins and one CBM9-nucleocapsid fragment fusion protein largely resisted protease degradation, while most of the CBM9 fusion proteins were degraded at some site in the SARS-CoV-2 protein fragment. All fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli at about 0.1 g/L, and could be purified with a single affinity binding step using inexpensive cellulose powder. Three purified CBM9-SARS-CoV-2 fusion proteins were tested and found to bind antibody directed to the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic region. The largest intact CBM9 fusion protein incorporates spike protein amino acids 540-588, which is a conserved region immediately C-terminal to the receptor binding domain that is widely recognized by human convalescent sera and contains a putative protective epitope.","McGuire, Bailey E.; Mela, Julia E.; Thompson, Vanessa C.; Cucksey, Logan R; Stevens, Claire E.; McWhinnie, Ralph L.; Winkler, Dirk F.

We conducted a cross-sectional study examining compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout among trauma nurses to identify the predictors of burnout. Data were collected from 219 nurses in four trauma centers in South Korea from July to August 2019. We used the Traumatic Events Inventory to measure nurses’ traumatic experience and three Professional Quality of Life subscales to measure compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that compassion satisfaction and secondary traumatic stress significantly predicted nurses’ burnout, with compassion satisfaction being the most potent predictor. The regression model explained 59.2% of the variance. Nurses with high job satisfaction, high compassion satisfaction, and low secondary traumatic stress tend to experience less burnout than their counterparts. Nurse managers should recognize that strategies to enhance job and compassion satisfaction and decrease secondary traumatic stress are required to decrease burnout among nurses in trauma centers.","Lee, Hyoung Ju; Lee, Miyoung; Jang, Sun Joo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,330,1

SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6–30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area. Here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against SFTSV.","Takayama-Ito, Mutsuyo; Saijo, Masayuki",Front Microbiol,330,24

In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.","Toots, Mart; Plemper, Richard K.",Transl Res,330,20

Although some administrations are working on the promotion of active mobility, they consider neither the needs of older people nor health effects. A lack of human resources and expertise, mainly due to the low priority placed on the issue, are described as the main barriers for further strategic collaboration. Furthermore, the public health sector often focuses on pathogens as the cause of morbidity and mortality, reducing their acceptance of responsibility for the topic. Facilitating factors include the establishment of new administrative structures, projects with rapid results that create awareness and credibility among citizens and politicians, additional staff with expertise in health promotion, and political commitment.

We describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission in six singing events from September-October 2020, across the Netherlands, with attack rates from 25-74%. We investigated potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for each event. Events included 9-21 persons, aged 20-79 years. SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely took place during five out of six events; a possible index case could be identified in four out of five clusters. Limited sequencing data was available, hampering interpretation of results. Indirect contact and droplet transmission (<1.5m) may have caused some cases, but are unlikely to explain the high attack rates. The previously published AirCoV2 model indicated that airborne transmission (via infectious droplets/ aerosols over longer distances (>1.5m)) due to singing is possible in case of supershedder presence ([≥]1010 RNA copies/mL). Also, airflow expelling respiratory droplets over longer distances (>1.5m) may have influenced transmission. In conclusion, a combination of transmission routes probably caused these five clusters. Proportions attributable to each route cannot be deduced. It is possible that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to singing (partly) led to the high attack rates observed in these clusters.","Shah, A. A.; Dusseldorp, F.; Veldhuijzen, I.

Our institute, a tertiary referral cancer center catering to the whole of India (Western India in particular), implemented the “work from home” policy during COVID 19 pandemic. For the first time, the concept of “Practicing Pathology from the Distance” (telepathology) was implemented in the Department Of Pathology. This paper discusses how telepathology was factualized, integrated the problems faced during its reporting and possible solutions into the daily surgical pathology reporting at our institute. We analyzed 135 cases by Static Imagery Telepathology out of the total 385 cases reported during national lockdown in India (23rd March to 23rd May 2020) with later confirmation by light microscopy to search for percentage of diagnostic concordance and discrepancy, if any. We experienced 100% diagnostic concordance in all the cases which tested the experience skill and expertise of the concerned telepathology team. However some diagnostic challenges and technical pitfalls were noted while using static imagery technique like time constraints and image qualities. These problems could be resolved by integrating whole slide imaging telepathology for future use.

To identify the regions recognized by MAbs, DNA fragments derived from the N-coding region of the TGEV strain FS772/70 were cloned into pUR expression plasmids and the antigenicity of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by immunobloting. A major antigenic domain was identified, covering the first 241 amino acid residues of N, within which an epitope (residues 57–117) was also found. A second antigenic domain extended from residues 175 to 360 of the nucleoprotein, within which a subsite was characterized within the region covering residues 241–349. MAb DA3 recognized a linear epitope which mapped within residues 360 and 382 at the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein. The binding of the majority of the MAbs (8 out of 11) to large fusions, but not to smaller fragments included in them, suggests a conformational dependence of the MAb binding sites. Our data show that the use of fusions in Western blot experiments is a useful approach to map not only linear epitopes but more complex antigenic structures found in the nucleoprotein of TGEV.","Martín Alonso, J.

METHODS: We determined the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) PCR among employees of a large national healthcare system. Antibody testing was performed on those who agreed to provide a blood sample. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined the risk of infection (PCR+) associated with demographic characteristics, job family and job grade. RESULTS: We identified 35,075 staff (30,849 full-time, 4,226 outsourced) between March 1-October 31, 2020. Among full-time employees, 78.0% had a NPS (11.8% positive). Among outsourced staff, 94.4% had a NPS (31.1% positive). Antibody testing was performed on 33.9% full-time employees (13.0% reactive), and on 39.1% of the outsourced staff (47.0% reactive). PCR-positivity was higher among outsourced staff (31.0% vs. 18.3% in non-clinical and 9.0% in clinical full-time employees) and those in the low-grade vs. mid-grade and high-grade job categories. Male sex (OR 1.88), non-clinical job family (OR 1.21), low-grade job category (OR 3.71) and being an outsourced staff (OR 2.09) were associated with a higher risk of infection. CONCLUSION: HCWs are a diverse population with varying risk of infection. Clinical staff are at a lower risk likely due to increased awareness and infection prevention measures. Risk is higher for those in the lower socioeconomic strata.

METHODS: Included in this study were 10 bulbi of 5 COVID-19 patients who died because of respiratory insufficiency. Informed consent and institutional review board approval was obtained before this study (241/2020BO2). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using a pharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage. Tissue procurement and tissue preparation were performed with personal protective equipment (PPE) and the necessary protective measures. qRT-PCR-testing was performed for each of the abovementioned tissues and intraocular fluids.

Higher A1c was significantly associated with hospitalization, with an odds ratio of 1.56 (1.34‐1.84) after adjusting for age, gender, insurance, and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher A1c remained the only predictor for hospitalization with COVID‐19.

Recent FDA clearance of molecular-based multiplex panels represents the beginning of a new era for the diagnosis of respiratory infections. The ability to test for multiple pathogens simultaneously, accompanied by the increasing availability of molecular-based assays for newly recognized respiratory pathogens will likely have a major impact on patient care, drug development, and public health epidemiology.

While most studies report impaired antibody responses in older adults as a correlate of vaccine efficacy, it is now widely appreciated that this may fail to identify important changes occurring in the immune system with age that may affect vaccine efficacy. The impact of immunosenescence on vaccination goes beyond the defects on antibody responses as T cell-mediated responses are reshaped during aging and certainly affect vaccination. Likewise, age-related changes in the innate immune system may have important consequences on antigen presentation and priming of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, a low-level chronic inflammatory status known as inflammaging has been shown to inhibit immune responses to vaccination and pharmacological strategies aiming at blocking baseline inflammation can be potentially used to boost vaccine responses. Yet current strategies aiming at improving immunogenicity in the elderly have mainly focused on the use of adjuvants to promote local inflammation. More research is needed to understand the role of inflammation in vaccine responses and to reconcile these seemingly paradoxical observations. Alternative approaches to improve vaccine responses in the elderly include the use of higher vaccine doses or alternative routes of vaccination showing only limited benefits. This review will explore novel targets and potential new strategies for enhancing vaccine responses in older adults, including the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulators.","Pereira, Branca; Xu, Xiao-Ning; Akbar, Arne N.",Front Immunol,330,30

Previous evidence syntheses emphasize parent-healthcare provider interactions at rounds and resuscitation; our focus is the parent–child dyad. Prior to embarking on further study, we performed a scoping review to determine the breadth and scope of the literature addressing PPB of critically ill children in the PICU. We searched five online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PSYCHINFO) and the grey literature to identify English and French reports from January 1960 to June 2020 addressing physical parental presence with children (birth to 18 years) in intensive care units, without limitation by methodology. Screening, reference selection, and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted into a researcher-designed tool. We identified 204 publications (81 quantitative, 68 qualitative, 22 mixed methods, and 9 descriptive case or practice change studies, and a further 24 non-study reports). PPB was directly assessed in 78 (38%) reports, and was the primary objective in 64 (31%). Amount or quality of presence was addressed by 114 reports, barriers and enablers by 152 sources, and impacts and outcomes by 134 sources. While only 6 reports were published in the first two decades of our search (1960–1980), 17 reports were published in 2019 alone. Conclusions: A relatively large body of literature exists addressing PPB of critically ill children. Separate systematic evidence syntheses to assess each element of PPB are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify any independent association between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia and to determine the effect of these variables on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN: This was a large, longitudinal, prospective, unmatched diagnosed and not-diagnosed observational study assessing the effect of COVID-19 during pregnancy on mothers and neonates. Two consecutive not-diagnosed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each diagnosed woman was identified, at any stage during pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed until hospital discharge using the standardized INTERGROWTH-21(st) protocols and electronic data management system. A total of 43 institutions in 18 countries contributed to the study sample. The independent association between the 2 entities was quantified with the risk factors known to be associated with preeclampsia analyzed in each group. The outcomes were compared among women with COVID-19 alone, preeclampsia alone, both conditions, and those without either of the 2 conditions. RESULTS: We enrolled 2184 pregnant women; of these, 725 (33.2%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 1459 (66.8%) in the COVID-19 not-diagnosed groups. Of these women, 123 had preeclampsia of which 59 of 725 (8.1%) were in the COVID-19 diagnosed group and 64 of 1459 (4.4%) were in the not-diagnosed group (risk ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–2.61). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99–5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35–9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63–2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67–4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32–2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20–3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66–4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.","Papageorghiou, Aris T.; Deruelle, Philippe; Gunier, Robert B.; Rauch, Stephen; García-May, Perla K.; Mhatre, Mohak; Usman, Mustapha Ado; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Etuk, Saturday; Simmons, Lavone E.; Napolitano, Raffaele; Deantoni, Sonia; Liu, Becky; Prefumo, Federico; Savasi, Valeria; do Vale, Marynéa Silva; Baafi, Eric; Zainab, Ghulam; Nieto, Ricardo; Maiz, Nerea; Aminu, Muhammad Baffah; Cardona-Perez, Jorge Arturo; Craik, Rachel; Winsey, Adele; Tavchioska, Gabriela; Bako, Babagana; Oros, Daniel; Rego, Albertina; Benski, Anne Caroline; Hassan-Hanga, Fatimah; Savorani, Mónica; Giuliani, Francesca; Sentilhes, Loïc; Risso, Milagros; Takahashi, Ken; Vecchiarelli, Carmen; Ikenoue, Satoru; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Soto Conti, Constanza P.; Ferrazzi, Enrico; Cetin, Irene; Nachinab, Vincent Bizor; Ernawati, Ernawati; Duro, Eduardo A.; Kholin, Alexey; Firlit, Michelle L.; Easter, Sarah Rae; Sichitiu, Joanna; Bowale, Abimbola; Casale, Roberto; Cerbo, Rosa Maria; Cavoretto, Paolo Ivo; Eskenazi, Brenda; Thornton, Jim G.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Kennedy, Stephen H.; Villar, José",Am J Obstet Gynecol,330,1

Method: This study was methodological cross-sectional. It was conducted on an Iranian public population from April to July 2020 which was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Construct validity was determined through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with a total of 500 adults recruited via online data gathering. Reliability was checked through the average inter-item correlation (AIC), Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's omega. Convergent and divergent validity was determined using Fornell and Larcker's approach. Results: The results showed that the Persian version of IES-R had three factors, including intrusion (six items), avoidance (seven items), and hyperarousal (five items), that explained 59.22% of the total variance of the IES-R. The CFA findings indicated that all goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the model fit. The Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega, composite reliability (CR), and maximal reliability were excellent, and the three factors have good convergent validity.

METHODS: Consecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study. Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems. CT disease extension was visually graded as < 20%, 20–39%, 40–59%, or ≥ 60%. The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC). RESULTS: Of the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died. Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level. CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for ≥ 60% extension). cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.899–0.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.912–0.953) when adding CT extension. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic model based on clinical variables is highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients. Adding CT disease extension to the model scarcely improves its accuracy. KEY POINTS: • Early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of disease progression and death is crucial; the role of CT scan in defining prognosis is unclear. • A clinical model based on age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory results was highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency room. • Disease extension assessed with CT was independently associated with death when added to the model but did not produce a valuable increase in accuracy.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging plays a key role in the comprehensive analysis of patients with TTS in acute and follow-up examinations. In this review, we focus on the major advantages and latest evolutions of CMR in diagnosis and prognostication of TTS and discuss future perspectives and needs in the field of research and cardiovascular imaging in TTS. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific CMR criteria for TTS diagnosis at the time of acute presentation are established. In addition to identifying the typical regional wall motion abnormalities, CMR allows for precise quantification of right ventricular and left ventricular (LV) function, the assessment of additional abnormalities/complications (e.g. pericardial and/or pleural effusion, LV thrombi), and most importantly myocardial tissue characterization (myocardial oedema, inflammation, necrosis/fibrosis). SUMMARY: CMR enables a comprehensive assessment of the entire spectrum of functional and structural changes that occur in patients with TTS and may have also a prognostic impact. CMR can distinguish between TTS and other important differential diagnoses (myocarditis, myocardial infarction) with direct consequences on medical therapy.","Jensch, Philipp-Johannes; Stiermaier, Thomas; Eitel, Ingo",Curr Heart Fail Rep,330,1

However, there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity (here termed “virodiversity”) for any wildlife species, despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses. In this case study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families. We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be ~$6.3 billion (or ~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses.","Anthony, Simon J.; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Murray, Kris A.; Navarrete-Macias, Isamara; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos M.; Solovyov, Alexander; Ojeda-Flores, Rafael; Arrigo, Nicole C.; Islam, Ariful; Ali Khan, Shahneaz; Hosseini, Parviez; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Olival, Kevin J.; Sanchez-Leon, Maria D.; Karesh, William B.; Goldstein, Tracey; Luby, Stephen P.; Morse, Stephen S.; Mazet, Jonna A.

Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care. The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on liver transplantation programmes and recipients is still not completely understood but overall involves the risk of donor-derived transmission, health-care resource utilization and the effect of immunosuppression. The aim of this study is to describe the situation of liver transplantation in the era of pandemic COVID-19. Methods Data obtained from secondary data on 13 articles journal evaluated by searching in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database that have been carried out in the last 2 years (2019-2020). Results The result showed that patients with liver disease need special attention and continuous follow-up. Similarly, transplant candidates also need special care. Restricting non-transplant elective surgical procedures, managing transplant patients in separate outpatient clinics, and in-patient wards can prevent transmission of infection both to patients and healthcare workers. Telemedicine can help in the triage of patients to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 before their regular appointment. Patients with novel COVID-19 experience various degrees of liver function abnormalities. Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature. Conclusions It can be concluded that in management of immunosuppressive therapy and drug-drug interactions in liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be cautiously practiced to prevent rejection and effectively treat the underlying infection.","Ramlah, Ramlah",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,330,32

The demand for containing the virus and protecting the economy is high on the agenda of policymakers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Modelling studies indicated that highly effective contact tracing and case isolation were enough to contain the spread of COVID-19 at the early stages, but this has not been validated in real world contexts. What is added by this report? Integrated case finding approaches, including outpatient monitoring, exposed people quarantining, and contact tracing, effectively contained the spread of COVID-19 in a densely populated district in Shanghai Municipality, China. Active case-finding involving quarantine of exposed persons and contact tracing could reduce the time from symptom onset to COVID-19 diagnosis, thus reducing the risk of local transmission. What are the implications for public health practice? Active case-finding should be prioritized as an effective approach to minimize the risk of local transmission in future pandemics. Integrated COVID-19 case finding approaches applied in Shanghai may inform public health policy in other regions where strict lockdown is not applicable.","Zheng, Xubin; Wang, Jie; Cai, Enmao; Jiang, Yu; Tang, Hong; Xu, Biao",China CDC Wkly,330,19

It is usually investigated in simple scenarios, such as the removal of the system’s units in random order, or sequentially ordered by specific topological descriptors. However, in the vast majority of empirical applications, it is required to dismantle the network following more sophisticated protocols, for instance, by combining topological properties and non-topological node metadata. We propose a novel mathematical framework to fill this gap: networks are enriched with features and their nodes are removed according to the importance in the feature space. We consider features of different nature, from ones related to the network construction to ones related to dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Our framework not only provides a natural generalization of percolation but, more importantly, offers an accurate way to test the robustness of networks in realistic scenarios.","Artime, Oriol; De Domenico, Manlio",Nat Commun,330,20

Oropharyngeal and conjunctival swabs and blood samples were taken from 16 cats with clinical signs of URTD and 26 clinically healthy cats. PCR and RT-PCR were used to detect FHV/FIV or FCV/FeLV infections, respectively. Feline calicivirus was detected in all cats with URTD and 87.00% and 93.00% of them were positive for FIV and FeLV, respectively. Feline herpesvirus rate of infection was 43.00% in sick cats. In clinically normal cats, prevalence rates of FCV and FHV were about 50.00%, but FIV and FeLV rates (42.00% and 65.00% respectively) were higher compared to other studies. Stomatitis was observed in 50.00% of cats with URTD. The main causative agent of corneal ulcers is FHV-1, but in 50.00% of cats with corneal ulcers, FCV was detected alone. It seems new variants of Caliciviruses are the main causative agents to attack uncommon tissues like cornea, although retroviral infections may be in the background of these various signs. The high retroviral prevalence may be due to existence of large population of stray cats. This is the first molecular study of FeLV and FCV in Iran and seems that FCV and FHV prevalence rates in FIV or FeLV infected cats is more than other non-infected ones.","Najafi, Hamideh; Madadgar, Omid; Jamshidi, Shahram; Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, Arash; Darzi Lemraski, Mahdieh",Vet Res Forum,330,1

These interactions, together with the main effect terms of malnutrition and age, imply higher odds for severe COVID-19 for children between 6 and 17 years with history of malnutrition. Even higher odds of severe COVID-19 exist for adults (with history of malnutrition) between 18 and 79 years. These results indicate that the long-term effect of malnutrition predisposes patients to severe COVID-19 in an age-dependent way.","Kurtz, Alec; Grant, Kenneth; Marano, Rachel; Arrieta, Antonio; Grant, Kenneth; Feaster, William; Steele, Caroline; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis",Sci Rep,330,1

Methods: A comprehensive literature review for the years 2005–2020 via MEDLINE and PubMed. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of either PDE-5i alone, PI alone or a combination of PDE-5i and PI in the treatment of psychogenic ED. All studies included were performed in adults aged 19–55 years and were written in English. Results: A total of 13 articles, with an overall sample of 597 men, were included in this systematic review. The results show that the combination of PI and PDE-5i was more effective than either PI or PDE-5i alone, on erectile function and long-term sexual satisfaction in men with psychogenic ED. Combined interventions were found to be significantly superior to medical treatment in seven studies and to PI alone in one study. In comparing PI to PDE-5i, two studies found PI to be significantly superior to PDE-5i use. In three other studies, PI was found significantly superior to no treatment at all, although some participants in the control group had taken PDE-5i. Conclusions: The combination of PDE-5i with PI shows real promise for the treatment of psychogenic ED. However, no conclusions could be made about what PI is more promising than the other and larger studies are needed to confirm these initial findings.

In this context, efficient recognition systems are expected for checking that people faces are masked in regulated areas. Hence, a large dataset of masked faces is necessary for training deep learning models towards detecting people wearing masks and those not wearing masks. Currently, there are no available large dataset of masked face images that permits to check if faces are correctly masked or not. Indeed, many people are not correctly wearing their masks due to bad practices, bad behaviors or vulnerability of individuals (e.g., children, old people). For these reasons, several mask wearing campaigns intend to sensitize people about this problem and good practices. In this sense, this work proposes an image editing approach and three types of masked face detection dataset; namely, the Correctly Masked Face Dataset (CMFD), the Incorrectly Masked Face Dataset (IMFD) and their combination for the global masked face detection (MaskedFace-Net). Realistic masked face datasets are proposed with a twofold objective: i) detecting people having their faces masked or not masked, ii) detecting faces having their masks correctly worn or incorrectly worn (e.g.; at airport portals or in crowds). To the best of our knowledge, no large dataset of masked faces provides such a granularity of classification towards mask wearing analysis. Moreover, this work globally presents the applied mask-to-face deformable model for permitting the generation of other masked face images, notably with specific masks. Our datasets of masked faces (137,016 images) are available at https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net.

As such, it is important to improve MiL for the stability of nursing staff. General self-efficacy is a significant predictor of both MiL and nursing professional commitment. Nursing professional commitment is key for both the stability of nursing staff and the provision of excellent health care. Few scholars have investigated the relationship between general self-efficacy and nursing professional commitment. In particular, a possible mediating effect of MiL has not been fully explored in nursing students. We aimed to examine the association between general self-efficacy and MiL among nursing students and to determine whether MiL mediates the relationship between general self-efficacy and nursing professional commitment for Chinese nursing students. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. Between June and September 2019, 710 Chinese nursing students from 2 colleges completed the Meaning in Life Scale (MiLS), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and Nursing Professional Commitment Scale (NPCS). Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and SPSS (version 23.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The mean MiL score was above the moderate level (M = 52.55, SD = 9.79). However, the mean scores of self-efficacy and nursing professional commitment were relatively low. Self-efficacy was positively related to MiL (B = 0.46, P < .01), and MiL was positively related to nursing professional commitment (B = 0.37, P < .01). However, self-efficacy was not related to nursing professional commitment (B = 0.12, P = .01). We therefore suggest that MiL has a complete mediating role between self-efficacy and nursing professional commitment among Chinese nursing students. In this study, we confirmed the complete mediation of nursing professional commitment by MiL in nursing students, thus providing scientific evidence that could be beneficial for the development of interventions to increase nursing professional commitment.","Cheng, Linan; Chen, Qian; Zhang, Fengying",Medicine (Baltimore),330,10

Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method. It is also critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","Calvez, Ronan; Taylor, Andrew; Calvo-Bado, Leonides; Fraser, Donald; Fink, Colin G.",PLoS One,330,26

OBJECTIVE: Taking into account the small but significant differences in the development of ADHD in women, this literature review aims at identifying the special characteristics of ADHD symptoms in all stages of a woman’s life from childhood to menopause. Being aware of these signs is important to provide the best quality of health care in ADHD women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 268 healthcare workers (200 nurses and 68 physicians). The 8-item version of the AIS was used to assess insomnia. Perceived psychological work stress was investigated using the 23-item Effort-reward Imbalance (ERI) questionnaire based on the ERI model. RESULTS: HCWS who cared for more than 5 patients and worried about personal issues had a higher insomnia score. ER-ratio and over-commitment are significantly associated with insomnia. A significant correlation was found between worries about pandemic COVID-19 and over-commitment. CONCLUSION: Since high effort-reward imbalance (ER-ratio > 1) and overcommitment were positively associated to insomnia and the treatment of more than five patients with COVID-19 infection was impacting predictor of sleep difficulties, it is necessary to implement a reward system in which physicians and nurses will work in a less stressful environment aiming at reducing personnel’s negative feelings, poor health and sleeping difficulties.","Tzenetidis, Vasileios; Papathanasiou, Iokasti; Tzenetidis, Nikolaos; Nikolentzos, Athanasios; Sarafis, Pavlos; Malliarou, Maria",Mater Sociomed,330,24

As macrophages have unique effector functions as a first-line defense against invading pathogens, we genetically armed human macrophages with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to reprogram their phagocytic activity against SARS-CoV-2. After investigation of CAR constructs with different intracellular receptor domains, we found that although cytosolic domains from MERTK (CAR(MERTK)) did not trigger antigen-specific cellular phagocytosis or killing effects, unlike those from MEGF10, FcRγ and CD3ζ did, these CARs all mediated similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vitro. Notably, we showed that CAR(MERTK) macrophages reduced the virion load without upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression. These results suggest that CAR(MERTK) drives an ‘immunologically silent’ scavenger effect in macrophages and pave the way for further investigation of CARs for the treatment of individuals with COVID-19, particularly those with severe cases at a high risk of hyperinflammation.","Fu, Wenyan; Lei, Changhai; Ma, Zetong; Qian, Kewen; Li, Tian; Zhao, Jian; Hu, Shi",Front Immunol,330,30

We describe here an unusual translational frameshift event occurring between the GAG3 and POL3 genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast. A +1 frameshift occurs within the sequence GCG AGU U (shown as codons of GAG3), encoding alanine-valine ( GCG A GUU ). Unlike other programed translational frameshifts described, this event does not require tRNA slippage between cognate or near-cognate codons in the mRNA. Two features distal to the GCG codon stimulate frameshifting. The low availability of the tRNA specific for the “hungry” serine codon, AGU, induces a translational pause required for frameshifting. A sequence of 12 nt distal to the AGU codon (termed the Ty3. “context”) also stimulates the event.","Farabaugh, Philip J.; Zhao, Hong; Vimaladithan, Arunachalam",Cell,330,1

The identification of targeted antiviral mouth rinses to reduce salivary viral load would contribute to reducing the COVID-19 pandemic. While awaiting the results of significant clinical studies, which to date do not exist, the commercial availability of mouth rinses leads us to search among them for reagents that would have specific antiviral properties with respect to SARS-CoV-2. The challenges facing this target were examined for 7 reagents found in commercially available mouth rinses and listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website: povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, cyclodextrin, Citrox, cetylpyridinium chloride, and essential oils. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, many reagents target the outer lipid membrane. Moreover, some of them can act on the capsid by denaturing proteins. Until now, there has been no scientific evidence to recommend mouth rinses with an anti–SARS-CoV-2 effect to control the viral load in the oral cavity. This critical review indicates that current knowledge of these reagents would likely improve trends in salivary viral load status. This finding is a strong sign to encourage clinical research for which quality protocols are already available in the literature.","Carrouel, F.; Gonçalves, L.S.; Conte, M.P.; Campus, G.; Fisher, J.; Fraticelli, L.; Gadea-Deschamps, E.; Ottolenghi, L.; Bourgeois, D.",J Dent Res,330,4

Nonetheless, the number of trainees entering geriatric psychiatry fellowship is declining, making it important to identify modifiable factors that may influence trainees’ decisions to pursue fellowship. We analyzed survey data from Scholars Program participants to identify demographic characteristics, attitudes toward program components, and behaviors after the program that were independently associated with the decision to pursue fellowship. METHODS: : Web-based surveys were distributed to all 289 former Scholars participants (2010-2018), whether or not they had completed geriatric psychiatry fellowships. We conducted a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis to examine demographics, program components, and behaviors after the program associated with deciding to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. RESULTS: : Sixty-one percent of Scholars decided to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. Attending more than one AAGP annual meeting (relative variance explained [RVE]=34.2%), maintaining membership in the AAGP (RVE=28.2%), and rating the Scholars Program as important for meeting potential collaborators (RVE=26.6%) explained the vast majority of variance in the decision to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship. CONCLUSION: : Nearly two-thirds of Scholars Program participants decided to pursue geriatric psychiatry fellowship, suggesting the existing program is an effective fellowship recruitment pipeline. Moreover, greater involvement in the AAGP longitudinally may positively influence Scholars to pursue fellowship. Creative approaches that encourage Scholars to develop collaborations, maintain AAGP membership, and regularly attend AAGP annual meetings may help attract more trainees into geriatric psychiatry.","Conroy, Michelle L.; Yarns, Brandon C.; Wilkins, Kirsten M.; Lane, Chadrick E.; Zdanys, Kristina F.; Pietrzak, Robert H.; Forester, Brent P.; Kirwin, Paul D.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,330,3

In this study, we selected and analyzed the genetic evolution of 15 PEDV representative strains that were identified in fecal samples of diarrheic piglets in 10 provinces and cities during 2011–2017. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the 15 PEDV isolates clustered into G2 genotype associated with the current circulating strains. Compared with the genome of the prototype strain CV777, these strains had 103–120 amino acid mutations in their S proteins, most of which were in the N terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD). We also found 37 common mutations in all these 15 strains, although these strains shared 96.9–99.7% nucleotide homology and 96.3–99.8% amino acid homology in the S protein compared with the other original pandemic strains. Computational analysis showed that these mutations may lead to remarkable changes in the conformational structure and asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites of S1-NTD, which may be associated with the altered pathogenicity of these variant PEDV strains. We evaluated the pathogenicity of the PEDV strain FJzz1 in piglets through oral and intramuscular infection routes. Compared with oral infection, intramuscular infection could also cause typical clinical signs but with a slightly delayed onset, confirming that the variant PEDV isolate FJzz1 was highly pathogenic to suckling piglets. In conclusion, we analyzed the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the emerging PEDV isolates of China, indicating that G2 variant PEDV strains as the main prevalent strains that may mutate continually. This study shows the necessity of monitoring the molecular epidemiology and the etiological characteristics of the epidemic PEDV isolates, which may help better control the PED outbreaks.","Chen, Pengfei; Wang, Kang; Hou, Yixuan; Li, Huichun; Li, Xianbin; Yu, Lingxue; Jiang, Yifeng; Gao, Fei; Tong, Wu; Yu, Hai; Yang, Zhibiao; Tong, Guangzhi; Zhou, Yanjun",Infect Genet Evol,330,14

The major bottlenecks in implementing OH in Nepal include poor organizational structure to support OH, absence of a legal framework to implement OH, poor coordination among different governmental agencies, insufficient technical expertise, poor data sharing mechanism across sectors, limited budget and poor understanding at political level. We encourage GoN to address these gaps and prioritize the health problems where OH approach would give the best outcome. Institutional and legal frameworks need to be created to effectively implement an OH approach in Nepal. Increasing awareness among policy makers including political leadership and increasing regular government budget for OH activities would be helpful to promote OH in Nepal.","Acharya, Krishna Prasad; Karki, Surendra; Shrestha, Kshitiz; Kaphle, Krishna",One Health,330,24

Abstract As part of this work, we propose to understand the global epidemic of Covid-19 coronavirus, as a sociobiological phenomenon. To carry out our reflection, we will base on a psychological listening experience (in a psychoanalytic orientation) conducted during the Nice attacks in 2016, and continued today, during the current pandemic context. More specifically, we will look at the signifier ""victim"", including all that it involves as questions about the subject. Our proposal will be to consider the victim status as a crossing. During this one, it is important that the suffering of the subjects is listened to, recognized, judged and compensated. And this, in order that everyone can find his own way of giving an answer to the reality of the virus, as it has imposed itself on us. But we will also see that one of the possible conclusions of this crossing consists in going through various forms of sublimation.","Alby, Virginie Jacob",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),330,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 10 consecutive patients diagnosed with localised prostate cancer underwent extraperitoneal SP-RARP using the da Vinci SP® Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Exclusion criteria included previous surgery through an infra-umbilical midline incision, prostate size >100 g, or preoperative evidence of extraprostatic disease. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon with previous experience of >3000 cases in robotic surgery. Demographics and perioperative information were collected including: operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of stay, and days with Foley catheter. The extraperitoneal SP-RARP is performed as follows. Firstly, a 3-cm incision ~2 cm below the umbilicus is made. Dissection of the extraperitoneal space is achieved using a kidney shaped Spacemaker™ balloon (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), placed through the infra-umbilical incision caudally reaching the retropubic space. Thereafter, the balloon is deployed; the space is created and verified under direct vision with a laparoscopic endoscope. A GelPOINT® mini advanced access platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) is inserted and a dedicated 25-mm multichannel port is placed with a 12-mm accessory laparoscopic port through the gel-seal cap into the same incision. The da Vinci SP surgical platform robot is docked with the patient in a supine position. RARP is performed replicating the technique previously described for multi-arm platforms or transperitoneal SP-RARP. No drain and no additional assistant ports were utilised. RESULTS: The patient's ages ranged between 48 and 70 years, and the mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 9 ng/mL. No conversions or intraoperative complications were recorded. The median (interquartile range) operative time was 197.5 (185.5-229.7) min. EBL ranged between 50 and 400 mL, six patients were discharged on the same day as the surgery and the median time with a Foley catheter after surgery was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Extraperitoneal SP-RARP is a feasible and safe surgical option to treat localised prostate cancer. In our early experience, promising results and possible advantages were found such as: a small single incision, no additional ports, no Trendelenburg positioning, minimal postoperative pain and use of opioids, and same day discharge. Further investigations need to be done to validate these advantages.","Kaouk, Jihad; Valero, Rair; Sawczyn, Guilherme; Garisto, Juan",BJU Int,330,16

The low economic cost in comparison to high-field (HF-MRI) scanners and the ease of maintenance make this type of scanner the best choice for nonmedical purposes. However, LF-MRI scanners produce low-quality images, which encourages the identification of optimization procedures to generate the best possible images. In this paper, optimization of the image acquisition procedure for an LF-MRI scanner is presented, and predictive models are developed. The MRI acquisition procedure was optimized to determine the physicochemical characteristics of pork loin in a nondestructive way using MRI, feature extraction algorithms and data processing methods. The most critical parameters (relaxation times, repetition time, and echo time) of the LF-MRI scanner were optimized, presenting a procedure that could be easily reproduced in other environments or for other purposes. In addition, two feature extraction algorithms (gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and one point fractal texture algorithm (OPFTA)) were evaluated. The optimization procedure was validated by using several evaluation metrics, achieving reliable and accurate results (r > 0.85; weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) lower than 0.1%; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) lower than 0.1%; true standard deviation (TSTD) lower than 2; and mean absolute error (MAE) lower than 2). These results support the high degree of feasibility and accuracy of the optimized procedure of LF-MRI acquisition. No other papers present a procedure to optimize the image acquisition process in LF-MRI. Eventually, the optimization procedure could be applied to other LF-MRI systems.","Caballero, Daniel; Pérez-Palacios, Trinidad; Caro, Andrés; Ávila, Mar; Antequera, Teresa",PeerJ Comput Sci,330,23

Current non-surgical treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, oral contraceptive pills and hormonal treatments have limited effectiveness, and the side effect profile is bothersome. This study will evaluate the efficacy of Gynoclear™ by change in endometriosis-related pain based on the Endometriosis Pain Daily Diary (EPPD) scores. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will recruit a minimum of 90 adult participants across Australia who have a laparoscopic visualisation/confirmation of endometriosis in the last 5 years and have current moderate or greater pelvic pain. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Gynoclear™ (active) or placebo. Gyncolear’s active ingredients are Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower), Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon), Poria cocos (Hoelen), Paeonia suffriticosa (Tree peony), Paeonia lactiflora (Peony) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Red sage). Participants are asked to complete a total of 5 months’ worth of pain diary entries via the EPDD v3, including 1-month screening, 2-month treatment period and 1-month post-treatment follow-up. The primary outcome variable is change in endometriosis-related pain based on the EPDD v3 scores. Secondary outcomes include change in health-related quality of life via the Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30), SF-12 and EQ-5D scores as well as changes in rescue analgesic usage, dyspareunia and fatigue via the EPDD. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the safety and efficacy of Gynoclear™ to reduce the severity and duration of non-cyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and other symptoms of endometriosis.

All exons including the new alternative exon, exon‐intron boundaries, and the corresponding 5′‐flanking region of the gene were investigated and 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Out of these, 13 SNPs including one non‐synonymous substitution and three 3′‐UTR polymorphisms were newly identified. A case control study involving 44 SARS cases, 16 anti‐SARS‐CoV antibody‐positive contacts, 87 antibody‐negative contacts, and 50 non‐contacts in Vietnam, failed to obtain any evidence that the ACE2 gene polymorphisms are involved in the disease process in the population.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR(+Q)). The SEIR(+Q) dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR(+Q) dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12–14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.","Wei, Yongyue; Wei, Liangmin; Jiang, Yue; Shen, Sipeng; Zhao, Yang; Hao, Yuantao; Du, Zhicheng; Tang, Jinling; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu; Li, Liming; Chen, Feng; Shen, Hongbing",Engineering (Beijing),330,20

The biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites are closely linked to nitrogen availability; the benefits of low nitrogen application on the environment and herb quality are increasingly prominent. To analyze metabolic changes in the leaves and roots of I.indigotica in nitrogen deficiency conditions, and to identify the pathways and metabolites induced by low nitrogen availability, we used untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TripleTOF) to obtain metabolomics profiling of I.indigotica under two N-deficiency treatments (0 kg/hm(2); 337.5 kg/hm(2)) and normal nitrogen treatment (675 kg/hm(2)). A total of 447 metabolites were annotated. Principal component analysis separated the three nitrogen treatments. A greater diversity of metabolites was observed in roots than in leaves under N-deficiency treatments, suggesting that roots have a more important function in low N tolerance. Differential metabolites were mainly enriched in purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis that notably induced only in leaves in low nitrogen stress. Moderate N-deficiency benefits carbohydrate accumulation, whereas accumulation of most amino acids decreases. Uniquely, L-tryptophan was maintained at a high concentration in N-deficiency conditions. Low nitrogen stress induced the accumulation of some specialized metabolites (matairesinol, dictamnine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (serotonin) in roots and vitexin, xanthohumol, sinapyl alcohol in leaves). N-deficiency also increased the accumulation of adenosine and quality indicators of I.indigotica (indirubin-indigo, epigoitrin and anthranilic acid) in a certain degree. Our findings showed that nitrogen deficiency modified roots and leaves conditions of I.indigotica, affecting both the primary and secondary metabolism. Moderate nitrogen reduction was beneficial to the accumulation of active ingredients. Our methods and analysis are expected to provide an insight regarding the diversity of metabolites and regulation of their synthesis in low nitrogen application, and better investigate the nitrogen deficiency effect on I.indigotica.","Cao, Yi-Wen; Qu, Ren-Jun; Miao, Yu-Jing; Tang, Xiao-Qing; Zhou, Ying; Wang, Lei; Geng, Li",Phytochemistry,330,16

However, it is currently unknown whether poor or non- availability of these services are also closely related to COVID-19 fatalities. We analysed the latest data on COVID-19 fatality rates in Sub Saharan Africa with indicators of safe water and sanitation governance to test this hypothesis. We found a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation ( -0.30) compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our analysis does not establish causality. Given the increase spread of COVID-19 and related deaths, this analysis serves as an important reminder that safe water and sanitation services are key for public health interventions and highlights the need to prioritise this sector in all economies.","Amankwaa, Godfred; Fischer, Christian",,330,28

However, its benefit or harm while treating COVID-19 is not fully studied. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the rationality on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Pubmed, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and Preprint publisher were searched. In the qualitative syntheses, 41, and quantitative studies, 40, were included using PRISMA guidelines. Assessment of heterogeneity was done using the I-squared (I(2)) test and random/fixed effect analysis was done to determine the odds/risk ratio. We found severely ill COVID-19 patients almost 5 (OR 4.78, 2.76–8.26) times higher odds of getting corticosteroids during their treatment. Similarly, the odds for corticosteroids in addition to standard of care (SOC) were approximately 4 (OR 4.09, 1.89–8.84) times higher among intensive care unit (ICU) patients than non-ICU ones. A higher mortality risk with the corticosteroid-receiving group compared with the SOC alone (RR 2.01, 1.12–3.63) was observed. Neither increased discharge rate (RR 0.79, 0.63–0.99) nor recovery/improvement rate was shown among the corticosteroid-receiving group (OR 0.24, 0.13–0.43). Approximately, the overall 4-day longer hospital stay was found among the treatment groups (MD 4.19, 2.57–5.81). For the negative conversion of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), approximately a 3-day (MD 2.42, 1.31–3.53) delay was observed with corticosteroid treatment cases.

However, the kinetics of early antibody responses in vaccinated individuals remain poorly understood. METHOD: We followed BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCWs, N=108) including 103 infection-naïve and five previously infected individuals. A total of 763 blood samples were collected weekly or hourly basis before and after vaccination. Serological analysis of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies was performed. RESULTS: Seroconversion occurred in all infection-naïve HCWs 3 weeks after the first dose (just before the second vaccination) and a marked boosting effect was observed at 4 weeks (1 week after the second dose). Among previously infected HCWs with pre-existing antibodies against the spike protein, a remarkable boosting effect was observed during the first week after vaccination, and a further increase in antibody titres was observed after the second dose. In one previously infected patient, daily blood sampling was conducted. Antibody titres began to increase 96 hours (4 days) after the first dose. CONCLUSION: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine remarkably enhanced antibody responses after the second dose in infection-naïve individuals and after the first dose in previously infected HCWs of all ages and genders. Antibody titres decreased slightly after the 5(th) week post-vaccination. The robust boosting effect of immunisation suggests that increased antibody titres following exposure to the virus may restrict viral replication, prolong the incubation period, or lessen the severity of disease.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Amemiya, Kenji; Sugiura, Hiroki; Shinohara, Miyuki; Takatori, Mika; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Omata, Masao",Front Immunol,330,1

The present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of HCQ on individuals in close contact with patients with COVID-19. METHOD: In this quasi-trial study, we prescribed HCQ for 7 days to all people who had close contact with a patient with COVID-19. All contacts underwent a nasal swab in two steps, and those positive for COVID-19 were excluded from the study. After 14 days of follow-up, the clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 113 participants completed the study. The HCQ group comprised 51 (45.13 %) contacts, and 62 (54.86 %) contacts were allocated to the control group. According to the results of clinical examination and real-time polymerase chain reaction test, 8 (12.90%) contacts in the control group were reported to have contracted COVID-19. In the HCQ group, 7 (13.72%) contacts were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. There was no relationship between HCQ use and age, sex, underlying disorders, and laboratory data (all p >0.05).

Methods: This observational study collects data from a cohort of 279 patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia who attended the Balaguer Primary Health Care Area between 16 March 2020 and 30 September 2020. We collected the results of LUS scans reported by one general practitioner. We created a database and analysed the absolute and relative frequencies of LUS findings and their association with hospital admission. We found that different LUS patterns (diffuse, attenuated diffuse, and predominantly unilateral) were risk factors for hospital admission (p < 0.05). Additionally, an evolutionary pattern during the acute phase represented a risk factor (p = 0.0019). On the contrary, a normal ultrasound pattern was a protective factor (p = 0.0037). Finally, the presence of focal interstitial pattern was not associated with hospital admission (p = 0.4918).

In most cases, clinical symptoms indicated a LRI with a final diagnosis of bronchiolitis. During the winter of 2003–2004, all viral clusters (A1, A2, B1, and B2) that circulated in France shifted progressively from the A group to the B group. This study determined the prevalence of hMPV in Normandy, its clinical impact and permitted the analysis of the molecular evolution during the successive outbreaks. J. Med.

This analysis aimed to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer, and assess whether cancer is associated with COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. METHODS: COVID-19 positive patients with an inpatient or emergency encounter at the Mount Sinai Health System between March 1, 2020 and May 27, 2020 were included, and compared across cancer status on demographics and clinical characteristics. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to model the associations of cancer with sepsis, venous thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, intensive care unit admission, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: There were 5,556 COVID-19 positive patients included; 421 (7.6%) with cancer (325 solid, 96 non-solid). Those with cancer were statistically significantly older, more likely to be non-Hispanic Black and to be admitted to the hospital during their encounter, and had more comorbidities than non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Cancer patients were statistically significantly more likely to develop sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [OR(adj)]=1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06-1.61) and venous thromboembolism (OR(adj)=1.77, 95% CI = 1.01-3.09); there was no statistically significant difference in acute kidney injury (OR(adj)=1.10, 95% CI = 0.87-1.39), intensive care unit admissions (OR(adj)=1.04, 95% CI = 0.80-1.34), or mortality (OR(adj)=1.02, 95% CI = 0.81-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with cancer may have a higher risk for adverse outcomes. Although there was no statistically significant difference in mortality, COVID-19 patients with cancer have significantly higher risk of thromboembolism and sepsis. Further research is warranted into the potential effects of cancer treatments on inflammatory and immune responses to COVID-19, and on the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in these patients.","Alpert, Naomi; Rapp, Joseph L; Marcellino, Bridget; Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Flores, Raja; Taioli, Emanuela",JNCI Cancer Spectr,330,16

However, there are potential biases in group decision making, and formal consensus methods may help reduce these. METHODS: We conducted a case study using formal consensus, to develop one set of recommendations within the Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition guideline being produced for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Statements were generated through identification of published guidelines on several topics relating to neonatal parenteral nutrition. Ten high quality guidelines were included, and 28 statements were generated; these statements were rated by the committee via two rounds of voting. The statements which resulted in agreement were then used to develop the recommendations. RESULTS: The approach was systematic and provided transparency. Additionally, a number of lessons were learnt; including the value of selecting the appropriate topic, giving adequate time to the process, and ensuring methodologies are understood by the committee for their value and relevance. CONCLUSION: Formal consensus is a valuable option for use within guideline development when specific criteria are met. The approach provides transparent methodology, ensuring clarity on how recommendations are developed.

However, the number of infections confirmed by testing underestimates the total infections as it is biased based on the availability of testing and because asymptomatic individuals may remain untested. The infection fatality rate (IFR) and infection hospitalization rate (IHR), calculated using the estimated total infections based on a representative sample of a population, is a better metric to assess the actual toll of the disease. Objective: To determine the IHR and IFR for COVID-19 using the statewide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates for the non-congregate population in Connecticut. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Participants: Individuals aged 18 years or above. Exposure: Estimated number of adults with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Main Outcome and Measures: COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Results: Of the 2.8 million individuals residing in the non-congregate settings in Connecticut through June 2020, 113,515 (90% CI 56,758-170,273) individuals had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were a total of 9425 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and 4071 COVID-19-related deaths in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020, of which 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths occurred among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 IHR and IFR was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%-13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%-1.90%) among the non-congregate population. Older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals and those belonging to New Haven and Litchfield counties had a higher burden of hospitalization and deaths, compared with younger individuals, women, non-Hispanic White or Hispanic individuals, and those belonging to New London county, respectively. Conclusion and Relevance: Using representative seroprevalence estimates, the overall COVID-19 IHR and IFR were estimated to be 6.86% and 0.95% among the non-congregate population in Connecticut. Accurate estimation of IHR and IFR among community residents is important to guide public health strategies during an infectious disease outbreak.","Mahajan, S.; Caraballo, C.; Li, S.-X.; Dong, C.; Chen, L.; Huston, S.

However, such models leave a scale-gap between the spatial resolution of actionable information (i.e. the county or city level) and that of modeled viral spread. States and nations are not spatially homogeneous and different areas may vary in disease risk and severity. For example, COVID-19 has age-stratified risk. Similarly, ICU units, PPE and other vital equipment are not equally distributed within states. Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multi-week periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.","Beckett, S.

METHODS We performed an adaptive, phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous sarilumab 200 mg or 400 mg in adults hospitalized with Covid-19. The phase 3 primary analysis population (cohort 1) was patients with critical Covid-19 receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) randomized to sarilumab 400 mg or placebo. The primary end point for phase 3 was the proportion of patients with [≥]1-point improvement in clinical status from baseline to day 22. RESULTS Four-hundred fifty-seven (457) and 1365 patients were randomized and treated in phases 2 and 3, respectively. Among phase 3 critical patients receiving MV (n=289; 34.3% on corticosteroids), the proportion with [≥]1-point improvement in clinical status (alive not receiving MV) at day 22 was 43.2% in sarilumab 400 mg and 35.5% in placebo (risk difference [RD] +7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 7.4 to 21.3; P=0.3261), representing a relative risk improvement of 21.7%. Day 29 all-cause mortality was 36.4% in sarilumab 400 mg versus 41.9% in placebo (RD - 5.5%; 95% CI, -20.2 to 8.7; relative risk reduction 13.3%). In post hoc analyses pooling phase 2 and 3 critical patients receiving MV, the hazard ratio (HR) for death in sarilumab 400 mg compared with placebo was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.13) overall, improving to 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.94) in patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline. CONCLUSION In hospitalized patients with Covid-19 receiving MV, numerical benefits with sarilumab did not achieve statistical significance, but benefit may be greater in patients receiving corticosteroids.

We are reporting a case of a female who developed intestinal obstruction due to gallstones during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and was managed urgently surgically in a low-settings hospital. Case Presentation An 85-year-old white female with 40 years history of gallstone disease, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes presented to the accidents and emergency unit with upper central crampy abdominal pain for 5 days associated with green color vomiting and absolute constipation. On examination, she was barely stable, dehydrated, had a distended abdomen, and guarding in the epigastric region. Her electrolytes were disturbed and had elevated serum creatinine and blood urea. Imaging studies confirmed gallstone ileus. Management was surgical despite the lack of facilities and equipment including COVID-19 personal protective equipment. Conclusion Despite being an infrequent complication, gallstone ileus might present at the most unexpected time and in the least equipped hospital where the surgeon's suspicion, risk stratification, and improvisation by utilizing what is available are the keys for successful management and saving lives.","Al-Abbasi, Ghaith; Alhilfy, Ali Adil; Al-Jasim, Ameer",Surg J (N Y),330,16

Dendrimers are highly branched molecules that can be added to antiviral preparations to improve their delivery, as well as their intrinsic antiviral activity. Studies on identifying anti‐MERS‐CoV agents are few. Three types of polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate (generations 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5), hydroxyl (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5), and succinamic acid (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) and polycationic dendrimers containing primary amine (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) were used to assess their antiviral activity with the MERS‐CoV plaque inhibition assay. The hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17.36% to 29.75% decrease in MERS‐CoV plaque formation. The most potent inhibition of MERS‐CoV plaque formation was seen by G(1.5)‐16COONa (40.5% inhibition), followed by G(5)‐128SA (39.77% inhibition). In contrast, the cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic to Vero cells.

Among the most sensitive modalities, interferometry offers particularly high performance, but typically lacks the required operational simplicity and robustness. Here, we introduce a common-path interferometric sensor based on guided-mode resonances to combine high performance with inherent stability. The sensor exploits the simultaneous excitation of two orthogonally polarized modes, and detects the relative phase change caused by biomolecular binding on the sensor surface. The wide dynamic range of the sensor, which is essential for fabrication and angle tolerance, as well as versatility, is controlled by integrating multiple, tuned structures in the field of view. This approach circumvents the trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range, typical of other phase-sensitive modalities, without increasing complexity. Our sensor enables the challenging label-free detection of procalcitonin, a small protein (13 kDa) and biomarker for infection, at the clinically relevant concentration of 1 pg mL(−1), with a signal-to-noise ratio of 35. This result indicates the utility for an exemplary application in antibiotic guidance, and opens possibilities for detecting further clinically or environmentally relevant small molecules with an intrinsically simple and robust sensing modality.","Barth, Isabel; Conteduca, Donato; Reardon, Christopher; Johnson, Steven; Krauss, Thomas F.",Light Sci Appl,330,1

Although many commercial sanitisers contain a combination of cationic surfactants and aromatic alcohols, the physical mechanisms where these two substances bind to or how they disturb bacterial membranes are still largely unknown. In this study, we designed a well-defined model of Gram-negative bacteria surfaces based on the monolayer of lipopolysaccharides with uniform saccharide head groups. Since commonly used X-ray reflectivity is sensitive to changes in the thickness, roughness and electron density but is not sensitive to elements, we employed grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence. In the absence of Ca(2+), cationic surfactants can penetrate into the membrane core with no extra support by disturbing the layer of K(+) coupled to negatively charged saccharide head group at z = 17 Å from the air/chain interface. On the other hand, Ca(2+) confined at z = 19 Å crosslink charged saccharides and prevent the incorporation of cationic surfactants. We found that the addition of nonlethal aromatic alcohols facilitate the incorporation of cationic surfactants by the significant roughening of the chain/saccharide interface.

Individual animals were exposed to a specific dose of airborne pathogen. Following exposure, animals were individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The detection of specific antibodies and/or the pathogen in diagnostic specimens was evidence that the exposure dose resulted in infection. If replicated over a range of doses, the results can be used to derive a dose–response curve for a variety of animal species and infectious pathogens. This information is useful in estimating the likelihood of infection associated with exposure to airborne infectious microorganisms. Applications include predicting the risk of transmission associated with exposure to airborne pathogens, modeling the transmission of airborne pathogens, and determining requirements for effective exposure doses for vaccines delivered in aerosols.","Hermann, J.R.; Muñoz-Zanzi, C.A.; Zimmerman, J.J.",Vet Microbiol,330,20

Public health surveillance dates back to the first recorded epidemic in 3180 B.C. in Egypt. Hippocrates (460 B.C.–370 B.C.) coined the terms endemic and epidemic, John Graunt (1620–1674) introduced systematic data analysis, Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) started epidemic field investigation, William Farr (1807–1883) founded the modern concept of surveillance, John Snow (1813–1858) linked data to intervention, and Alexander Langmuir (1910–1993) gave the first comprehensive definition of surveillance. Current theories, principles, and practice of public health surveillance are summarized. A number of surveillance dichotomies, such as epidemiologic surveillance versus public health surveillance, are described. Some future scenarios are presented, while current activities that can affect the future are summarized: exploring new frontiers; enhancing computer technology; improving epidemic investigations; improving data collection, analysis, dissemination, and use; building on lessons from the past; building capacity; enhancing global surveillance.

Seize patients avaient une pathologie autre dont 3 cas de Kawasaki et 3 cas de syndrome inflammatoire multisystémique pédiatrique (PIMS). Dix sérums témoins de sujets sains ont également été inclus dans notre analyse. Nous avions peu de patients graves : 7 séjours en réanimation dont 3 pour une infection à COVID-19. Les principaux symptômes retrouvés étaient de la fièvre dans 67 % des cas (47), une rhinorrhée, une dyspnée dans 18 % des cas (12) et des signes digestifs dans 15 % des cas (10). Les patients atteints du SARS-CoV-2 avaient tous de la fièvre, 45 % (5) présentaient une rhinorrhée, 36 % (4) de la toux, 45 % (5) une dyspnée et 55 % (6) une asthénie. Nous avons observé que chez l’enfant, il existe également une surexpression du CD169 sur les monocytes chez 10 des 11 patients COVID positif. On ne retrouve pas cette surexpression dans le groupe infection virale autre que SARS-CoV-2 contrairement à ce qui est observé chez l’adulte. Dans les infections bactériennes, on observe une surexpression du CD64 sur les PNN et cette dernière est également retrouvée chez les cas de Kawasaki et PIMS, les résultats ne sont cependant pas significatifs devant le faible nombre de cas. Le HLA DR sur les monocytes, qui est habituellement diminué dans les sepsis sévères, ne ressort pas comme un marqueur potentiel. Conclusion Le CD169 sur les monocytes pourrait être également considéré comme un biomarqueur pour les infections à COVID-19 chez l’enfant. Le développement de tests rapides et automatisés pour ce biomarqueur pourrait constituer un réel outil de diagnostic rapide aux urgences permettant ainsi d’améliorer la prise en charge d’épidémies futures.","Domitien, L.; Bedin, A.; Tuaillon, E.; Jeziorski, E.",Infectious Diseases Now,330,1

It is defined as a reversible myocardial dysfunction, usually with apical ballooning aspect due to apical akinesia associated with hyperkinetic basal left ventricular contraction. Described in cases of viral infections such as influenza, only few have been reported associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the recent pandemic. Case summary: A 79-years-old man, with cardiovascular risk factors (type 2 diabetes and hypertension) and chronic kidney disease, presented to the emergency room for severe dyspnea after 8 days of presenting respiratory symptoms and fever. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, but he presented marked inflammatory syndrome. He was transferred to an intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation within 6 h, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He presented circulatory failure 2 days after, requiring norepinephrine support (up to up to 1.04 μg/kg/min). Troponin T was elevated (637 ng/l). ECG showed diffuse T wave inversion. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 40%), with visual signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac failure resolved after 24 h with troponin T decrease (433 ng/l) and restoration of cardiac function (LVEF 60% with regression of Takotsubo features). Patient died after 15 days of ICU admission, due to septic shock from ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Cardiac function was then normal. Conclusion: Mechanisms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in viral infections include catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity and inflammation related to sepsis. Differential diagnoses include myocarditis and myocardial infarction. Evidence of the benefit of immunomodulatory drugs and dexamethasone are growing to support this hypothesis in COVID-19.","Ortuno, Sofia; Jozwiak, Mathieu; Mira, Jean-Paul; Nguyen, Lee S.",Front Cardiovasc Med,330,16

The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.","Wang, Jiajun; Lapinski, Nicole; Zhang, X.

It was first identified in Wuhan City in China in December 2019. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the top 15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next 2 months. METHODS: The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. The spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents. The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The advanced ARIMA model was used for predicting future data based on time series data. The ARIMA model provides a weight to past values and error values to correct the model prediction, so it is better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. RESULTS: The top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model. The identified top 15 countries with cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 were compared. The United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, and a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy. There was a high death rate ratio in Italy and the United Kingdom and a lower death rate ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value is represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence interval values. The validation of the ARIMA model was done using the Akaike information criterion value; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were rose faster when compared to confirmed cases over the next 2 months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in the United States, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The forecast analysis of the COVID-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world, and it looks scarier than imagined, but recovery numbers start looking promising by July 7, 2020.","Singh, Ram Kumar; Rani, Meenu; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Sah, Ranjit; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Kalita, Himangshu; Nanda, Chintan; Sharma, Shashi; Sharma, Yagya Datt; Rabaan, Ali A; Rahmani, Jamal; Kumar, Pavan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,330,11

A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity. The availability of a “universal” method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism and/or efficiency of recombination. We conclude that the field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of individual properties.","Kim, Hyejeong; Ellis, Victor D.; Woodman, Andrew; Zhao, Yan; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.",bioRxiv,330,23

While vaccine updates for current variants of concern (VOCs) are underway, it is likewise important to prepare for further antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this end, a wealth of data and tools exist that can augment existing genetic surveillance of VOC evolution. In this study, we integrate published datasets describing genetic, structural, and functional constraints on mutation along with computational analyses of antibody-spike co-crystal structures to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) within the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further, we project the PADS set into a continuous epitope-paratope space to facilitate interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might be antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations, and this representation suggests that functionally convergent and synergistic antigenic mutations are accruing across VOC NTDs. The PADS set and synergy visualization serve as a reference as new mutations are detected on VOCs, enable proactive investigation of potentially synergistic mutations, and offer guidance to antibody and vaccine design efforts.","Miller, Nathaniel L.; Clark, Thomas; Raman, Rahul; Sasisekharan, Ram",bioRxiv,330,16

Current digital health projects focusing on PD, however, does not live up to the expectations of PwP.

AKI is associated with high mortality in the clinical setting and contributes to the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Up to date, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19-induced AKI. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms and interactions between Quercetin and SARS-CoV-2 targets proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle. In conclusion, Quercetin may be a novel therapeutic agent for COVID-19-induced AKI. Inhibition of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be the critical mechanisms by which Quercetin protects kidney from SARS-CoV-2 injury.","Gu, Yue-Yu; Zhang, Min; Cen, Huan; Wu, Yi-Fan; Lu, Zhaoyu; Lu, Fuhua; Liu, Xu-Sheng; Lan, Hui-Yao",PLoS One,330,1

The most severe impact of an SBV infection is the induction of malformations in newborns and abortions. Between 2011 and 2013 SBV spread throughout Europe in an unprecedented epidemic wave. SBV contains a tripartite genome consisting of the three negative-sense RNA segments L, M, and S. The virus is usually isolated from clinical samples by inoculation of KC (insect) or BHK-21 (mammalian) cells. Several virus passages are required to allow adaptation of SBV to cells in vitro. In the present study, the porcine SK-6 cell line was used for isolation and passaging of SBV. SK-6 cells proved to be more sensitive to SBV infection and allowed to produce higher titers more rapidly as in BHK-21 cells after just one passage. No adaptation was required. In order to determine the in vivo genetic stability of SBV during an epidemic spread of the virus the nucleotide sequence of the genome from seven SBV field isolates collected in summer 2012 in Switzerland was determined and compared to other SBV sequences available in GenBank. A total of 101 mutations, mostly transitions randomly dispersed along the L and M segment were found when the Swiss isolates were compared to the first SBV isolated late 2011 in Germany. However, when these mutations were studied in detail, a previously described hypervariable region in the M segment was identified. The S segment was completely conserved among all sequenced SBV isolates. To assess the in vitro genetic stability of SBV, three isolates were passage 10 times in SK-6 cells and sequenced before and after passaging. Between two and five nt exchanges per genome were found. This low in vitro mutation rate further demonstrates the suitability of SK-6 cells for SBV propagation.","Hofmann, Martin A.; Mader, Markus; Flückiger, Franziska; Renzullo, Sandra",Veterinary Microbiology,330,21

Despite the wide implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is still not known how they are impacted by changing contact patterns, age and other demographics. As COVID-19 disease control becomes more localised, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these impacts the loosening of interventions such as school reopening is crucial. Considering dynamics for the United States, we analyse aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. In contrast to previous approaches, we link mobility to mortality via age-specific contact patterns and use this rich relationship to reconstruct accurate transmission dynamics. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, we find little support for age-shifts in contact and transmission dynamics over time. We estimate that, until August, 63.4% [60.9%-65.5%] of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States originated from adults aged 20-49, while 1.2% [0.8%-1.8%] originated from children aged 0- 9. In areas with continued, community-wide transmission, our transmission model predicts that re-opening kindergartens and elementary schools could facilitate spread and lead to additional COVID-19 attributable deaths over a 90-day period.

In this study, we examined the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients aged 60 and over who had been infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7 ± 7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04). A CURB-65score ≥3 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) class ≥4 manifested a remarkable discrimination ability to predict 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). When the laboratory parameters were considered, the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significant in predicting mortality in univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03–1.21; p = 0.006, and OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11–2.39; p = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, NLR was determined to be an independent marker to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. PSI and CURB-65 revealed a considerably precise prognostic accuracy for the patients with COVID-19 in our study as well. Moreover, thanks to that NLR results in a very short time, it can enable the clinician to predict mortality before the scoring systems are calculated and hasten the management of the patients in the chaotic environment of the emergency room.","Genc Yavuz, Burcu; Colak, Sahin; Guven, Ramazan; Altundag, İbrahim; Seyhan, Avni Uygar; Gunay Inanc, Rumeysa",Gerontology,330,16

Questions are debated about the proper moment to start rehabilitation in the acute period of stroke, the significance of rehabilitation interventions during the so-called “plastic window”, and the advantages of modern and traditional programs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the role of different rehabilitation strategies and their combinations for motor recovery and the impact on functional disability by way of neurological and functional outcomes 3 months after ischemic stroke. Methods: We used three rehabilitation approaches: early rehabilitation from the first day of stroke (Phase I), traditional exercise programs (Phase II), and an author’s new method of biofeedback rehabilitation using motion sensors and augmented reality (AR) rehabilitation (Phase III). Clinical and functional outcomes were measured on the 90th day after stroke. We developed algorithms for quantifying the quality of movements during the execution of tasks in the motor domains of the AR rehabilitation program. Results: Phase I of rehabilitation led to an improvement in functional independence, and the recovery of motor functions of the extremities with an absence of mortality and clinical deterioration. AR rehabilitation led to significant improvement both with respect to clinical and functional scores on scales and to variables reflecting the quality of movements. Patients who were actively treated during Phases II and III achieved the same final level of motor recovery and functional outcomes as that of participants who had only received AR rehabilitation during Phase III. Patients who underwent outpatient observation after Phase I showed a deficit of spontaneous motor recovery on the 90th day after stroke. Conclusions: Early rehabilitation was successful but was not enough; rehabilitation programs should be carried out throughout the entire “sensitive period” of poststroke plasticity. The newly developed AR biofeedback motion training is effective and safe as a separate rehabilitation method in the early recovery period of moderately severe, hemiparalytic, and ischemic stroke. These two rehabilitation approaches must be applied together or after each other, not instead of each other, as shown in clinical practice.","Koroleva, Ekaterina S.; Kazakov, Stanislav D.; Tolmachev, Ivan V.; Loonen, Anton J.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) units have been forced to change their practices to address the disease and to ensure the quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a national survey among IBD gastroenterologist members of the Spanish Working Group on Crohn’s Disease and Colitis regarding changes of practice, IBD treatments, and diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: We received 54 answers from Spanish hospitals. One hundred percent of the IBD units rescheduled onsite visits to telematic consultation, and elective endoscopic and surgical procedures were delayed. Protective measures were also taken in the infusion units (100% of health centers) and hospital pharmacies, with 40.7% sending subcutaneous medications to patients. No switching between intravenous and subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were made. We also found that 96.1% of IBD units advised their patients to maintain treatment if they were asymptomatic for COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19 symptoms, 92.6% of IBD units referred them to primary care or the emergency department. In addition, 7.5% of IBD units made a COVID-19 diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and/or chest x-ray. Modifications in IBD treatment and treatment recommended for COVID-19 are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: We report a representative national survey of changes made in the structure, diagnosis of COVID-19, and modifications in IBD treatments within IBD units.","Martin Arranz, Eduardo; Suarez Ferrer, Cristina; García Ramírez, Laura; Rueda García, Jose Luis; Sánchez-Azofra, María; Poza Cordón, Joaquín; Noci, Jesus; Zabana, Yamile; Barreiro-de Acosta, Manuel; Martín-Arranz, María Dolores",Inflamm Bowel Dis,330,20

COVID‐19, bacterial pneumonia, and normal. The model performs the automatic feature extraction from X‐ray images and accurately identifies the features responsible for distinguishing the X‐ray images of different classes. It plots these features on the GradCam. The authors optimized the number of convolution and activation layers according to the size of the dataset. They also fine‐tuned the hyperparameters to minimize the computation time and to enhance the efficiency of the model. The performance of the model has been evaluated on the anonymous chest X‐ray images collected from hospitals and the dataset available on the web. The model attains an average accuracy of 97.71% and a maximum recall of 100%. The comparative analysis shows that the ‘COVID‐Screen‐Net’ outperforms the existing systems for screening of COVID‐19. The effectiveness of the model is validated by the radiology experts on the real‐time dataset. Therefore, it may prove a useful tool for quick and low‐cost mass screening of patients of COVID‐19.

We defined QoL resilience as maintaining high quality of life and studied whether walking speed, absence of loneliness, living arrangement, and stress-coping ability predict QoL resilience among older people. METHODS: Community-dwelling 75-, 80-, and 85-year-old persons (n = 685) were interviewed and examined in 2017–2018 and were followed up during COVID-19 social distancing in 2020. We assessed QoL using the OPQOL-brief scale and set a cut-off for ‘constant high’ based on staying in the highest baseline quartile over the follow-up and categorized all others as having ‘low/moderate’. Perceived restrictiveness of the social distancing recommendations was examined with one item and was categorized as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ restrictiveness. RESULTS: Better stress-coping ability (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14–1.28) and not being lonely (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.48–4.63) increased the odds for constant high QoL from before to amid social distancing, and the odds did not differ according to the perceived restrictiveness of the social distancing recommendations. Higher walking speed predicted constant high QoL only among those perceiving restrictiveness (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.27). Living arrangement did not predict constant high QoL. CONCLUSION: During social distancing, psychosocial resources helped to maintain good QoL regardless how restrictive the social distancing recommendations were perceived to be. Better physical capacity was important for constant high QoL only among those perceiving restrictiveness presumably because it enabled replacing blocked activities with open outdoor physical activities.","Koivunen, Kaisa; Portegijs, Erja; Sillanpää, Elina; Eronen, Johanna; Kokko, Katja; Rantanen, Taina",Qual Life Res,330,16

TM was a possible strategy, but its role in this very sick cohort is unknown. Methods During the lockdown (03-05/2020), we decided to make either a phone (PV) or an in presence (IV) visit, selecting for IV pts listed for HT, with LVAD, recently HT, scheduled for a biopsy within 6 months after HT or a RHC for listing eligibility. In PV, we assessed symptoms, blood pressure, drugs, and programmed a subsequent IV. All pts in IV group were triaged by phone for COVID-19 symptoms or contacts and if scheduled for RHC or biopsy received SARS-CoV-2 swab 48 h before the procedure. Study endpoints were: combined incidence at 6 months of MACE (HF hospitalization, CV death and need for anticipated IV) in HF/VAD group, and MACE, rejection and any cause- hospitalization in HT group. Results Among 448 pts (57±12y, 240 HT, 191 HF, 17 LVAD), 52% were managed by PV and a subsequent IV was scheduled after 3±2 months. Pts managed by PV were healthier: in HF-VAD group they were less frequently listed, had less Afib, LVAD (2/17) (p<0.01 all); post-capillary PH (pC-PH) was similarly distributed; in HT group there were less pts transplanted in the last 5 years (15% vs 52%, p<0.01) and numerically less with 2R rejection in the previous 6 months (8.3% vs 27.1%, p=0.13).The PV group had a lower incidence of the endpoints in both HF/VAD and HT cohorts (92.3±2.3% vs 70.3±4.4%; 97.0±1.7%vs82.5±4.1%, p<0.01). Overall, the predictors of the endpoints at multivariate analysis were pC-PH and PV (HR: 5.2 and 0.1, p<0.03 both) and a recent 2R rejection (HR: 3.6, p=0.05) in the HF/VAD and HT group respectively.There were no cases of COVID-19 in IV; 5 pts got infected at home in a context of infection prevalence of 6/1000 inhabitants in our region and of 40% of hospital beds dedicated to COVID-19 pts. Conclusion In this retrospective study, by reporting an organization set up in a emergency situation, we show that TM can be safely used to manage stable HF, LVAD and HT patients, whereas pC-PH and a recent rejection may identify those needing IV. These data suggest that the availability of devices for monitoring pulmonary pressures may improve safety of PV in HF pts and that TM could be useful not only in a pandemic outbreak but also subsequently.","Masetti, M.; Toniolo, S.; Adorno, A.; Giovannini, L.; Prestinenzi, P.; Sabatino, M.; Russo, A.; Suarez, S.

Policies that promote social capital building along all levels of society may offer an important avenue for improved healthcare delivery and health systems strengthening in the COVID-19 response. MAIN BODY: In reference to the established and emerging literature on social capital and health, we explore the role of social capital in the COVID-19 health policy response. We analyse current research with respect to mental health, public health policy compliance, and the provision of care for vulnerable populations, and highlight how considerations of bonding, bridging, and linking capital can contribute to health systems strengthening in the context of the COVID-19 response and recovery effort. CONCLUSIONS: This article argues that considerations of social capital – including virtual community building, fostering solidarity between high-risk and low-risk groups, and trust building between decision-makers, healthcare workers, and the public – offer a powerful frame of reference for understanding how response and recovery programs can be best implemented to effectively ensure the inclusive provision of COVID-19 health services.","Wong, Anna S.

The developed world responds to new and re‐emerging diseases through the discovery of medications. Disease can be transmitted around the world in a day, but the development of medications does not occur at this rate. The world has one environment and the focus in health care must be on identifying factors in this environment that coalesce to produce disease. Aim. The aim of this paper is to introduce the integrative model of environmental health and explore its potential to illuminate the Toronto SARS experience. Discussion. SARS affected people on three continents in a matter of days. Response to this new disease varied from one area to another and was dependent upon the level of integration of health services and communication across services. The present focus of the health care system is on treating the results of disease rather than the causative factors. Reacting to a new disease had grave social and economic consequences. The time for a new global environmental approach to health is now. The Toronto SARS experience was examined using the integrative model of environmental health and the upstream perspective as exemplars to interrupt the traditional approach to disease. All health care providers share the responsibility to learn about and to understand how our environment creates disease. This knowledge comes through research on topics such as; chemicals, pesticides, soil erosion, killing of forests, contamination of water, destabilization of climate, and social disruption from wars. Conclusions. Health care systems in the developed world continue to focus on the treatment of disease. A global ecological initiative for an integrated disease prevention system must be negotiated among nations.","Macdonald, Marilyn T.",J Adv Nurs,330,30

At 4 d of age, 112 calves had accelerometers attached to their hind leg and were housed in pens with ACFS. Calves were examined daily for signs of illness or injury. Of the 112 calves monitored, 18 were diagnosed with NCD; activities of calves with NCD were then compared with those of 18 healthy controls (calves that had no symptoms of NCD, other illnesses, or injury). Feeding (milk consumption and the number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder) and lying behavior during the 5 d leading up to calves displaying clinical signs of NCD were analyzed. Calves with NCD performed fewer unrewarded visits and consumed less milk than healthy calves during the 2- and 4-d periods before diagnosis with NCD, respectively. Calves with NCD tended to perform fewer lying bouts than healthy calves over the 5-d period before diagnosis with NCD. At 3 wk of age, a subset of 51 healthy calves were allocated to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) sham handling (SHAM, n = 10), (2) cautery disbudding (DB, n = 11), (3) administration of local anesthetic (LA) and DB (LA+DB, n = 11), 4) administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and DB (NSAID+DB, n = 9), and (5) administration of LA, NSAID and DB (LA+NSAID+DB, n = 10). Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h pre- and postdisbudding. We found no effect of treatment on the number of rewarded or unrewarded visits to the feeder and milk volume consumed 24 h before administration of treatments. During the 24-h postdisbudding period, SHAM calves performed more unrewarded visits than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves, but the number of unrewarded visits did not differ between SHAM and LA+NSAID+DB calves. During the first hour of the posttreatment period we noted a difference in lying times among treatments, with DB and NSAID+DB calves spending less time lying than SHAM calves and lying times being similar between SHAM, LA+DB, and LA+NSAID+DB calves. The ACFS and accelerometers have the potential to automatically gather valuable information regarding health status and pain in calves. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine both of these measures (ACFS and accelerometers) when evaluating NCD on farm or pain in calves in future research.","Sutherland, M.A.; Lowe, G.L.; Huddart, F.J.; Waas, J.R.; Stewart, M.",J Dairy Sci,330,6

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. RESULTS: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

RECENT FINDINGS: Whilst anxiety, depression and economic stressors are common findings worldwide, specific behavioural responses are heavily influenced by government stances, misinformation, conspiratorialism and competing demands of resource scarcity. This has led to very different understandings of the pandemic even in geographically close areas, and more so when comparing disparate regions such as Africa, South America and Europe. The paper also comments on the absence of robust evidence regarding increases of suicidality and violence on a global level, whilst noting evidence certainly exists in specific regions. SUMMARY: The psychological and behavioural impact of COVID is heavily influenced by the local lens.

We previously reported the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 by human IFITM1, 2 and 3. It is unknown whether other HIV-1 strains are similarly inhibited by IFITMs and whether there exists viral countermeasure to overcome IFITM inhibition. We report here that the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (HIV-1(NL4-3)) is not restricted by IFITM1 and its viral envelope glycoprotein is partly responsible for this insensitivity. However, HIV-1(NL4-3) is profoundly inhibited by an IFITM1 mutant, known as Δ(117–125), which is deleted of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus. In contrast to the wild type IFITM1, which does not affect HIV-1 entry, the Δ(117–125) mutant diminishes HIV-1(NL4-3) entry by 3-fold. This inhibition correlates with the predominant localization of Δ(117–125) to the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. In spite of strong conservation of IFITM1 among most species, mouse IFITM1 is 19 amino acids shorter at its C-terminus as compared to human IFITM1 and, like the human IFITM1 mutant Δ(117–125), mouse IFITM1 also inhibits HIV-1 entry. This is the first report illustrating the role of viral envelope protein in overcoming IFITM1 restriction. The results also demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal region of IFITM1 in modulating the antiviral function through controlling protein subcellular localization.","Jia, Rui; Ding, Shilei; Pan, Qinghua; Liu, Shan-Lu; Qiao, Wentao; Liang, Chen",PLoS One,330,2

After the rapid spread of SARS‐coronavirus (CoV)‐2 (the virus causing COVID‐19) from its origin in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. From the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, a significant number of studies have been conducted to better understand the biology and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, and to aid in developing effective treatment regimens, therapeutics, and vaccines. This review focuses on the recent advancements in the rapidly evolving areas of clinical care and management of COVID‐19. The emerging strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease are explored, and the development of effective vaccines is reviewed.","Hadisi, Zhina; Walsh, Tavia; Dabiri, Seyed Mohammad Hossein; Seyfoori, Amir; Hamdi, David; Mirani, Bahram; Pagan, Erik; Jardim, Armando; Akbari, Mohsen",Adv Ther (Weinh),330,1

However, the implication of this protein complex in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) disease has not been fully studied. Herein, we report that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a detrimental role during HMPV infection because NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protected mice from mortality and reduced weight loss and inflammation without impacting viral replication. We also demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts its deleterious effect via IL-1β production since we observed reduced mortality, weight loss and inflammation in IL-1β-deficient (IL-1β(-/-)) mice, as compared to wild-type animals during HMPV infection. Moreover, the effect on these evaluated parameters was not different in IL-1β(-/-) and wild-type mice treated with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. The production of IL-1β was also abrogated in bone marrow derived macrophages deficient for NLRP3. Finally, we show that small hydrophobic protein-deleted recombinant HMPV (HMPV ΔSH) failed to activate caspase-1, which is responsible for IL-1β cleavage and maturation. Furthermore, HMPV ΔSH-infected mice had less weight loss, showed no mortality and reduced inflammation, as compared to wild-type HMPV-infected mice. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome activation seems to be triggered by HMPV SH protein in HMPV disease. In summary, once activated by the HMPV SH protein, NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the maturation of IL-1β, which exacerbates HMPV-induced inflammation. Therefore, the blockade of IL-1β production by using NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors might be a novel potential strategy for the therapy and prevention of HMPV infection.","Lê, Vuong B.; Dubois, Julia; Couture, Christian; Cavanagh, Marie-Hélène; Uyar, Olus; Pizzorno, Andres; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Hamelin, Marie-Ève; Boivin, Guy",PLoS Pathog,330,1

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in New Delhi. We included all the patients who were ≥18 years of age and consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 between the 1(st) of May 2020 to 31(st) July 2020. Patients were interviewed by a physician using a semi-structure questionnaire. Data were collected on socio-economic status, occupation, income loss, leaves taken, decrease in work efficiency (self-perceived) and about-facing any stigma/discrimination at the workplace. RESULTS: Out of 245 patients, 190 patients were employed. A total of 126 patients (66.3%) self-reported their work was affected due to COVID-19 disease. A total of 30.5% of patients (n = 58/190) reported deduction in their salary. The median amount of salary loss was INR 10,000 (IQR 9000–25000). Decrease in income and work efficiency (self-perceived) was found to be 37.3% (n = 71) and 12.1% (n = 23), respectively. A total of 47 patients (37.3%) took personal leaves (median number – 17 days (IQR 14–25), and discrimination/stigma related to the COVID-19 at the workplace was faced by 22.6% of patients. CONCLUSION: Income and work of a substantial number of patients was affected due to COVID-19, as there was a decrease in income and work efficiency. Patients also had to take personal leaves and face stigma in the workplace. This will inform the policymakers to formulate strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","Chandra, Ankit; Sarda, Radhika; Kumar, Arvind; Bir, Megha; Parija, Pragyan Paramita; Pal, Aishee; Sinha, Sanjeev; Vikas, H; Naveet, Wig",J Family Med Prim Care,330,10

With no drugs or vaccines available yet, a wide range of treatment regimens used are being repurposed. The need of the hour is to analyze various currently available regimens and devise a treatment plan that is most effective for COVID-19. Here we describe the case of a 68-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes, exhibiting symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, who presented at the emergency department of our hospital. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral ground glass opacities that were indicative of COVID-19, and a computed tomography score of 24 was indicative of severe pulmonary pneumonia. He tested positive for COVID-19. His treatment regimen included the use of convalescent plasma, oxygen therapy, steroids, high-dose antibiotics, broad-spectrum antiviral remdesivir, and anti–interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab) at various stages of the disease. Oxygen supplementation was required at the time of admission. The patient initially developed a cytokine release storm, and oxygen supplementation was initiated to manage his condition. Supportive care and multiple treatment regimens were used to successfully recover the patient’s health. With a rapid increase in number of confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a major challenge to our health care system. With no available vaccines currently, the establishment of a combination of therapeutic drugs that effectively reduce disease progression is of utmost importance.","Ali, Sabahat; Khalid, Sundas; Afridi, Maham; Akhtar, Samar; Khader, Yousef S; Akhtar, Hashaam",JMIR Public Health Surveill,330,17

The mobility of humans on a daily basis in Mexico City is mathematically represented by a origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and a Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix, is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between February 27, 2020 and October 27, 2020 using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Since working with metapopulation models lead to rather high computational time consume, we do a clustering analysis based on mobility trends in order to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis could be implemented in smaller or lager scale in different part of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided in the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict the individuals movement in the city. Also, we calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters. The analysis of mobility trends can be helpful in public health decisions.","Prieto, K.; Chavez-Hernandez, M.; Romero-Leiton, J. P.",,330,1

The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.","Tai, Wanbo; He, Lei; Zhang, Xiujuan; Pu, Jing; Voronin, Denis; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying",Cell Mol Immunol,330,1

The N95 respirator is a mask that blocks at least 95% of very small (0.3 μm) particles and is considered a standard for enhanced respiratory precautions. The N95 mask shortage has created a need for other options for nasal and oral respiratory protection with similar filtration efficiency and “medical-grade” clearance, which can be used in health care settings. However, the literature around various filter types, their filtration capabilities, and the organizations certifying their use is dense, confusing, and not easily accessible to the public. Here, we synthesize relevant literature to analyze and disseminate information on (1) alternative viable filter options to N95s, (2) the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health certification process, (3) the relationship of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health certification to Food and Drug Administration certification of filtration devices and surgical masks, and (4) how this relationship may affect future filtration usage in the medical community during a pandemic. Analysis of these standards is meant to inform regarding evidence of respirator efficacy but does not imply any official endorsement of these alternatives.

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the anti-RA effects of PFD have not been investigated. This study was undertaken to investigate the repurposing of PFD for the treatment of RA, and explore its anti-rheumatic mechanisms. A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was used to observe joint pathological changes following PFD treatment. Based on bioinformatics to predict the mechanism of PFD anti-RA, using EA. hy926 and TNF-α-induced MH7A cells to establish in vitro model to explore its biological mechanism from the perspectives of synovial inflammation and angiogenesis. PFD significantly relieved pathological changes, including joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration and joint destruction. PFD was also associated with reduced expression of MMP-3 and VEGF in articular chondrocytes and synovial cells of CIA rats (p < 0.05). Using bioinformatic methods, we predicted that PFD inhibits cell inflammation and migration by interfering with the JAK2/STAT3 and Akt pathways. These results were verified using in vitro models. In particular, PFD effectively reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory, chondrogenic, and angiogenic cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1/3/2/9 and VEGF (p < 0.05), in TNF-α-induced MH7A cells. In addition, PFD significantly reduced the production of MMP-2/9 and VEGF in EA. hy926 cells, thereby weakening migration and inhibiting angiogenesis (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that PFD may alleviate the pathological process in CIA rats, by inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis through multiple pathways, and serve as a potential therapeutic drug for RA.","Gan, Donghao; Cheng, Wenxiang; Ke, Liqing; Sun, Antonia RuJia; Jia, Qingyun; Chen, Jianhai; Lin, Jietao; Li, Jian; Xu, Zhanwang; Zhang, Peng",Front Pharmacol,330,22

We intend to explore the place of lung ultrasound (LU) imagery to assess lung status in those latter patients, with afterthoughts on the interest of it for quick triage of patients. Methods: eChoVid is a multicentric observational study based on routinely collected data, conducted in 3 emergency units of Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris. 107 SDC patients included between 19.03.2020 and 01.04.2020 had both a LU examination (LU) and a chest CT-scanner (CCS). LU consisted in scoring lesions of 8 chest zones, each scored from 0 to 3, defining a severity Global Score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CCS severity score was graded from 0 to 3, according to interstitial pneumonia signs extension. 14 patients had a LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician (NTP). Findings: GS shows good performances to predict CCS severity assessment of Covid19 disease categorized as Normal vs Pathologic, AUC-ROC=0.93, maximal Youden index for GS=1, with 95% sensitivity, 83% specificity. Similar performances were found for CCS categorization Normal or Minimal vs Moderate or Severe, N=90, AUC-ROC= 0.89, maximal Youden index for GS=7, with 86% sensitivity, 78% specificity. Multi-logistic regression model provided a weighted score, relating ultrasound scoring of each chest zone and CT-scanner severity score, with no significant improvement of GS. Good agreement was found between GS assessed by NTP and experts, measured by Bland & Altman method. Interpretation : GS score brings a simple tool to assess lung damages severity in SDC patients. Compared performance results between NTP and expert physician are very preliminary but opens a path towards adoption beyond the scope of ultrasound experts. LU is a good candidate for triage of SDC patients, especially useful when CT-scanners suffer from availability issues related either to overwhelmed requests or poor health infrastructure.","Benchoufi, M.; Bokobza, J.; Anthony Chauvin, A.; Dion, E.; Baranne, M.-L.; Levan, F.; Gautier, M.; Cantin, D.; d Humieres, T.; Gil-Jardine, C.; Benenati, S.; Oberlin, M.; Martinez, M.; Kahn, N.; Vicaut, E.; Bourrier, P.; Diallo, A.",,330,1

METHOD: We performed a retrospective review of records and chest x-rays of eligible adult Filipinos with confirmed COVID-19 admitted from 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Demographics, clinical outcomes, and chest radiographic findings were recorded. Serial chest x-ray findings were correlated with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: From 144 adult patients (93 males and 51 females), a total of 785 chest x-rays were reviewed (144 baseline and 641 follow-up). The most common finding overall is ground-glass opacity. The most common distribution pattern is bilateral, patchy/diffuse involvement of the central/peripheral zones. In x-rays taken after the third admission day, reticular opacities become more common than consolidation. The radiographic extent score was higher for deceased patients compared to the survivors at Day 7-9 (6 vs 4.4, p-value = 0.0011), Day 10-12 (5.9 vs 4.3, p-value = 0.0079) and Day 13-15 (5.5 vs 4.1, p-value = 0.0297).

Here, we review recently published studies on the clinical diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of MIS-C, highlighting key gaps in research progress that are a microcosm for challenges in translational pediatric research. We then discuss potential solutions in the realm of translational bioinformatics. RECENT FINDINGS: Current case definitions are inconsistent and do not capture the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C, which remains poorly understood. Although overall mortality is low, some patients rapidly decompensate, and a test to identify those at risk for severe outcomes remains an unmet need. Treatment consists of various combinations of immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and biologics, based on extrapolated data and expert opinion, while the benefits remain unclear as we await the completion of clinical trials. SUMMARY: The small size and heterogeneity of the pediatric population contribute to unmet needs because of financial and logistical constraints of the current research infrastructure focused on eliminating most sources of heterogeneity, leading to ungeneralizable results. Data sharing and meta-analysis of gene expression shows promise to accelerate progress in the field of MIS-C as well as other childhood diseases beyond the current pandemic.","Murphy Jones, Lara; Khatri, Purvesh",Curr Opin Pediatr,330,32

The meetings were attended by 168 health professionals, scientists, academics, ethicists, religious leaders, and other community members representing 40 countries in these regions. Methods: We reviewed the meeting reports, notes and stories and mapped outcomes to the key ethical challenges for pandemic influenza response described in the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) guidance, Ethical Considerations in Developing a Public Health Response to Pandemic Influenza: transparency and public engagement, allocation of resources, social distancing, obligations to and of healthcare workers, and international collaboration. Results: The important role of transparency and public engagement were widely accepted among participants. However, there was general agreement that no ""one size fits all"" approach to allocating resources can address the variety of economic, cultural and other contextual factors that must be taken into account. The importance of social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission was also recognized, but the difficulties associated with this measure were acknowledged. There was agreement that healthcare workers often have competing obligations and that government has a responsibility to assist healthcare workers in doing their job by providing appropriate training and equipment. Finally, there was agreement about the importance of international collaboration for combating global health threats. Conclusion: Although some cultural differences in the values that frame pandemic preparedness and response efforts were observed, participants generally agreed on the key ethical principles discussed in the WHO’s guidance. Most significantly the input gathered from these regional meetings pointed to the important role that procedural ethics can play in bringing people and countries together to respond to the shared health threat posed by a pandemic influenza despite the existence of cultural differences.","Lor, Aun; Thomas, James C.; Barrett, Drue H.; Ortmann, Leonard W.; Herrera Guibert, Dionisio J.",Int J Health Policy Manag,330,20

Those with greater perceived or actual life stress are vulnerable to develop problematic internet behaviors. Thus, we assessed how COVID-19 social isolation affected online gaming (OG) and pornography viewing (PV) in the general population. METHODS: We developed an online cross-sectional survey, Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,344 adults (≥18 years). HabiT was released internationally with individuals from 80 countries participating; a majority residing in the United States and United Kingdom. We measured changes in OG (IGDS9-SF) and PV (CYPAT) behaviors before and during the COVID-19 quarantine period. We also assessed psychiatric factors such as anxiety, depression (HADS), and impulsivity (SUPPS-P). The primary outcome measures were change in amount of, and current OG and PV severity during quarantine. These measures were related to ten COVID-19-related stress factors. RESULTS: Overall, we observed a large increase in OG and a minor increase in PV. Those who increased OG (63%) and PV (43%) during quarantine were younger individuals, males, those who left the quarantine household infrequently, those who reported low frequency or poor quality social interactions, and those with higher depression, anxiety, and urgency impulsivity.

635327,635327,635327,Dosing Considerations for Antibodies Against COVID-19,16.015911,6.069214,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION: Our previous studies have highlighted sleep disparities for this underserved population, including how Grandparents Raising Grandchildren (GRG) experience troubled and disruptive sleep. Intersectional types of discrimination facing these families during COVID 19, include: race/ethnicity of self and children, income, age, essential workforce status, and impairments (mobility, vision, and hearing). This current study intends to explore how healthy sleep is an important resource (potential buffer) for GRG experiencing intersectional discrimination during COVID 19. METHODS: We used community partnerships to recruit 600 GRG from all fifty states in USA and several tribes to complete an online survey on their experiences with caregiving and intersectional discrimination during COVID 19. We developed an index on intersectional discrimination based on GRG lived experiences to inform the survey and used descriptive and bivariate statistics to profile this group. Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis was used to build a predictive model to help determine how variables in our study best merge to explain intersectional discrimination. RESULTS: Of the GRGs’, 37% were between 54–65 years and 33% cared for children 6 to 10 years for at least 5 years. The types of discrimination that were more likely to be included in intersectional discrimination include: Black or African American [83.8% (31)], my child’s race [59.5% (22)], my lower economic status [56.8% (21)], and my status as a caregiver [56.8% (21)]. The resource needs that showed the most disparity (higher rate showed higher priority/extreme concern) between those with ID and those without included: Information on how COVID impacts race and ethnicity differently (6.0 vs. 3.61), ability to pay utilities (3.7 vs. 1.99), and information on how to achieve healthy sleep (4.19 vs. 2.64). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that GRG facing intersectional discrimination identify the importance of attaining information on how to achieve healthy sleep as an important resource to them during COVID 19. These results can be used to help mobilize resources and disseminate information for this underserved group to improve healthy sleep and also model for their extended families and communities. SUPPORT (IF ANY): This study was conducted by the Grandfamilies Outcome Workgroup, (GrOW), with support from Generations United and Collaborative Solutions.","Pandey, Abhishek; Littlewood, Kerry; Spadola, Christine; Rosenthal, Michelle; Cooper, Larry; Carter, Shima; Bennett, Russell; Hash, Jonika; Kirtman, Nissa; Ward, Teresa",Sleep,330,16

However, the impact of unprecedented situation of COVID‐19 outbreak on health care of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in real‐world setting has seldom been investigated. METHODS: We performed an observational study in a tertiary referral IBD center in China. The mode of health care and medication use was compared before and after COVID‐19 outbreak. Electronic questionnaire surveys were performed among gastroenterologists and IBD patients to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 outbreak on their attitudes towards telemedicine. RESULTS: COVID‐19 outbreak resulted in substantial decrease of patients participating in standard face‐to‐face visit during 1 month post‐outbreak (n = 51) than pre‐outbreak (n = 249), whereas the participation in telemedicine was significantly higher than comparable period in 2019 (414 vs 93). During the 1 month after COVID‐19 outbreak, 39 (39/56, 69.6%) patients had their infliximab infusion postponed with the mean delay of 3 weeks. The immunomodulator use was similar between pre‐outbreak and post‐outbreak. Six elective surgeries were postponed for a median of 43 days. In post‐outbreak period, 193 (193/297, 64.98%) of the surveyed physicians have used telemedicine with an increase of 18.9% compared with 46.13% (137/292) in the pre‐outbreak period (P < 0.001); 331 (331/505, 65.54%) of the surveyed IBD patients supported that the use of telemedicine should be increased in future health care. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 outbreak resulted in a great change in health‐care access among IBD patients including decrease in standard face‐to‐face visit and delay of biologics use. There was an increased use and need of telemedicine after COVID‐19 outbreak.","Zhang, Ying‐Fan; Qiu, Yun; He, Jin‐Shen; Tan, Jin‐Yu; Li, Xiao‐Zhi; Zhu, Liang‐Ru; Chen, Yan; Liu, Zhan‐Ju; Iacucci, Marietta; Chen, Bai‐Li; He, Yao; Ben‐Horin, Shomron; Shen, Bo; Zeng, Zhi‐Rong; Ghosh, Subrata; Chen, Min‐Hu; Mao, Ren",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,330,1

Methods In total, 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. Results In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0–25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5–17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer was the time to negative conversion. Conclusions The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms.

Although HPIV-4 has been associated with mild ARTIs for years, recent investigations have also associated HPIV-4 infection with severe respiratory syndromes and with outbreaks of ARTIs in children. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the role of HPIV-4 and its clinical features in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) in Beijing, China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 2009 hospitalized children with ALRTIs between March 2007 and April 2010. RT-PCR and PCR analyses were used to identify HPIV types and other known respiratory viruses. RESULTS: HPIVs were detected in 246 (12.2%) patients, of whom 25 (10.2%) were positive for HPIV-4, 11 (4.5%) for HPIV-2, 51 (20.7%) for HPIV-1, 151 (61.4%) for HPIV-3, and 8 (3.3%) were co-detected with different types of HPIVs. Like HPIV-3, HPIV-4 was detected in spring, summer, and late fall over the study period. Seasonal incidence varied for HPIV-1 and -2. The median patient age was 20 months for HPIV-4 infections and 7–11 months for HPIV-1, -2, and -3 infections, but the clinical manifestations did not differ significantly between HPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4 infections. Moreover, co-detection of HPIV-4 (44%) with other respiratory viruses was lower than that of HPIV-1 (62.7%), HPIV-2 (63.6%), and HPIV-3 (72.7%).

SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells via ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation and expression patterns of ACE2 may provide valuable insights into tracing the carriers of SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we analyzed the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern among various mammalian species that are close to human beings. We show that mammalian ACE2 gene is deeply conserved at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammals can potentially host SARS-CoV-2. We further report that ACE2 expression in certain human tissues are consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we have built the first atlas of ACE2 expression in various common mammals, which shows that ACE2 expresses in mammalian tissues in a species-specific manner. Most notably, we observe exceptionally high expression of ACE2 in external body parts of cats and dogs, suggesting that these household pet animals could be vulnerable to viral infections and/or may serve as intermediate hosts, thus yielding novel insights into the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sun, Kun; Gu, Liuqi; Ma, Li; Duan, Yunfeng",Heliyon,330,29

METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, and controlled study including 106 eyes of 53 severe COVID-19 patients, compared to after recovery and 106 eyes of 53 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. All subjects were previously healthy adults and were assessed using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and ImageJ software. Subfoveal over a 1500-μm span and macular over a 6000-μm span cross-sectional areas of the vascular, stromal, and total choroid were measured. RESULTS: Of the 53 included patients, 28 (52.8%) were male, and 25 (47.2%) were female, with a mean age of 50.2 ± 7.4 years. In the active period of the disease, compared to after recovery and healthy controls, the outer plexiform layer thickness showed a significant increase (p = 0.004), and mean choroidal thickness was significantly higher (p < 0.0001); however, choroidal vascularity was significantly lower (p < 0.0001). The stromal area to vascular area (S/V) ratio of the choroid was significantly increased (p < 0.0001). All quadrants of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses were significantly increased (for all, p < 0.05). The reflectivity of OCT echo of the choroid and peripapillary RNFL was significantly higher (p = 0.023, p < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study detected significant posterior ocular structural and vascular alterations in patients with severe COVID-19 infections. These findings may be associated with direct host-virus interaction or linked to an autoimmune process, vasculopathy, or viral-mediated inflammation.","Bayram, Nurettin; Gundogan, Medine; Ozsaygılı, Cemal; Adelman, Ron A.",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,330,16

The empirical results highlight that government health investment has a crowding-in effect and can thus promote household consumption. Furthermore, the promotion effect on non-medical health consumption is greater than that on medical health consumption. The promotion effect of government health investment on rural household consumption is higher than that on urban household consumption, and the promotion effect on household consumption for northern provinces is higher than that in southern provinces. This heterogeneous effect is closely related to the difference between urban and rural development; and the economic levels of the northern and South regions. The mediation tests found that government health investment mainly promotes regional economic growth, and then increases household consumption. In the economic and social development process, the government should implement more effective medical and health care measures to increase social medical and health investment to improve the consumption level of households.","Cheng, Hao; Zhi, Yu-Peng; Deng, Zi-Wei; Gao, Qing; Jiang, Rui",Front Public Health,330,16

Here, we report SPCT involvement during the first wave of the pandemic and compare outcomes for patients with cancer who received and did not receive SPCT input from multiple European cancer centres. METHODS: From the OnCovid repository (N = 1318), we analysed cancer patients aged ⩾18 diagnosed with COVID-19 between 26 February and 22 June 2020 who had complete specialist palliative care team data (SPCT+ referred; SPCT− not referred). RESULTS: Of 555 eligible patients, 317 were male (57.1%), with a median age of 70 years (IQR 20). At COVID-19 diagnosis, 44.7% were on anti-cancer therapy and 53.3% had ⩾1 co-morbidity. Two hundred and six patients received SPCT input for symptom control (80.1%), psychological support (54.4%) and/or advance care planning (51%). SPCT+ patients had more ‘Do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation’ orders completed prior to (12.6% versus 3.7%) and during admission (50% versus 22.1%, p < 0.001), with more SPCT+ patients deemed suitable for treatment escalation (50% versus 22.1%, p < 0.001). SPCT involvement was associated with higher discharge rates from hospital for end-of-life care (9.7% versus 0%, p < 0.001). End-of-life anticipatory prescribing was higher in SPCT+ patients, with opioids (96.3% versus 47.1%) and benzodiazepines (82.9% versus 41.2%) being used frequently for symptom control. CONCLUSION: SPCT referral facilitated symptom control, emergency care and discharge planning, as well as high rates of referral for psychological support than previously reported.

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However, this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study, we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number (R(t)) of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021, as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the R(t) of B.1.1.7 was 6–10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions.

Expression profiles represent snapshots of combined genetic, socio-environmental (including socioeconomic and environmental factors), and physiological effects on the molecular phenotype. As such, they have potential to improve biological understanding of differences among populations, and provide therapeutic biomarkers and environmental mitigation strategies. Here, we undertook a large-scale assessment of patterns of gene expression between African Americans and European Americans, mining RNA-Seq data from 25 non-diseased and diseased (tumor) tissue-types. We observed the widespread enrichment of pathways implicated in COVID-19 and integral to inflammation and reactive oxygen stress. Chemokine CCL3L3 expression is up-regulated in African Americans. GSTM1, encoding a glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, is upregulated. The little-studied F8A2 gene is up to 40-fold more highly expressed in African Americans; F8A2 encodes HAP40 protein, which mediates endosome movement, potentially altering the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. African American expression signatures, superimposed on single cell-RNA reference data, reveal increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes. Our findings establish basal prognostic signatures that can be used to refine approaches to minimize risk of severe infection and improve precision treatment of COVID-19 for African Americans.

However, this pandemic scenario has also facilitated the rapid implementation and monitoring of technologies in the health field. In view of the occurrence of the public emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System created a contingency plan. In this paper, we aim to report the digital health strategies applied in Brazil and the first results obtained during the fight against COVID-19. Conecte SUS, a platform created to store all the health data of an individual throughout their life, is the center point of the Brazilian digital strategy. Access to the platform can be obtained through an app by the patient and the health professionals involved in the case. Health data sharing became possible due to the creation of the National Health Data Network (Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde, RNDS). A mobile app was developed to guide citizens regarding the need to go to a health facility and to assist in disseminating official news about the virus. The mobile app can also alert the user if they have had contact with an infected person. The official numbers of cases and available hospital beds are updated and published daily on a website containing interactive graphs. These data are obtained due to creating a web-based notification system that uses the RNDS to share information about the cases. Preclinical care through telemedicine has become essential to prevent overload in health facilities. The exchange of experiences between medical teams from large centers and small hospitals was made possible using telehealth. Brazil took a giant step toward digital health adoption, creating and implementing important initiatives; however, these initiatives do not yet cover the entire health system. It is expected that the sharing of health data that are maintained and authorized by the patient will become a reality in the near future.

Transdermal therapy has emerged as a time-tested practical treatment option, and the rotigotine patch has been used worldwide as an alternative to conventional oral treatment for PD. The efficacy of rotigotine on motor aspects of PD, as well as its safety and tolerability profile, are well-established, whereas its effects on a wide range of NMS have been described and studied but are not widely appreciated. In this review, we present our overall experience with rotigotine and its tolerability and make recommendations for its use in PD and restless legs syndrome, with a specific focus on NMS, underpinned by level 1–4 evidence. We believe that the effective use of the rotigotine transdermal patch can address motor symptoms and a wide range of NMS, improving health-related QoL for patients with PD. More specifically, the positive effects of rotigotine on non-motor fluctuations are also relevant. We also discuss the additional advantages of the transdermal application of rotigotine when oral therapy cannot be used, for instance in acute medical emergencies or nil-by-mouth or pre/post-surgical scenarios. We highlight evidence to support the use of rotigotine in selected cases (in addition to general use for motor benefit) in the context of personalised medicine.","Raeder, Vanessa; Boura, Iro; Leta, Valentina; Jenner, Peter; Reichmann, Heinz; Trenkwalder, Claudia; Klingelhoefer, Lisa; Chaudhuri, K.

Proportion of the GR clade is positively associated with temperature, but is negatively correlated with altitude in countries‐set. Virus disseminating velocities in states from cluster A (Overwhelming proportion of G + GR + GH clades, GH > 60%) and C (Overwhelming proportion of G + GR + GH clades, G 20–30%) both has negative correlations with temperature, while cluster C has more significant negative correlation than cluster A. Climate and geographical environment are revealed to affect virus spreading. GH and GR clades of SARS‐CoV‐2 are probably acquiring higher temperature tolerance, while G clade may retain high temperature intolerance.","Hao, Zhaonian; Li, Ruyuan; Hao, Chengyi; Zhao, Haoyuan; Wan, Xueyan; Guo, Dongsheng",Glob Chall,330,17

This immune response leads to excessive production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause clinical signs characteristic of COVID-19 such as decreased oxygen saturation, alteration of hemoglobin properties, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, vasoconstriction, elevated cytokines, cardiac and/or renal injury, enhanced D-dimer, leukocytosis, and an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. Particularly, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is thought to be especially abundant and, as a result, contributes substantially to oxidative stress and the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Conversely, melatonin, a potent MPO inhibitor, has been noted for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective actions. Melatonin has been proposed as a safe therapeutic agent for COVID-19 recently, having been given with a US Food and Drug Administration emergency authorized cocktail, REGEN-COV2, for management of COVID-19 progression. This review distinctly highlights both how the destructive interactions of HOCl with tetrapyrrole rings may contribute to oxygen deficiency and hypoxia, vitamin B12 deficiency, NO deficiency, increased oxidative stress, and sleep disturbance, as well as how melatonin acts to prevent these events, thereby improving COVID-19 prognosis.","Camp, Olivia G.; Bai, David; Gonullu, Damla C.; Nayak, Neha; Abu-Soud, Husam M.",J Inorg Biochem,330,9

The research questions concerned how the SVAI was delivered, the content of the SVAI and the physiotherapists’ experiences from delivering the SVAI. Methods We used qualitative and quantitative data from 148 intervention logs documenting the follow-up provided to each participant, recordings of 18 intervention sessions and minutes from 20 meetings with the physiotherapists. The log data were analysed with descriptive statistics. A qualitative content analysis was performed of the recordings, and we identified facilitators and barriers for implementation from the minutes. Results Of 170 participants randomised to the SVAI 152 (89%) received the intervention and 148 logs were completed. According to the logs, 131 participants received the correct number of sessions (all by telephone) and 146 action plans were developed. The physiotherapists did not attend any workplace meetings but contacted stakeholders in 37 cases. The main themes from the recorded sessions were: ‘symptom burden’, ‘managing symptoms’, ‘relations with the workplace’ and ‘fear of not being able to manage work’. The physiotherapists felt they were able to build rapport with most participants. However, case management was hindered by the restricted number of sessions permitted according to the protocol. Conclusion Overall, the SVAI was delivered in accordance with the protocol and is therefore likely to be implementable in primary care if it is effective in reducing sick leave.","Aanesen, Fiona; Øiestad, Britt Elin; Grotle, Margreth; Løchting, Ida; Solli, Rune; Sowden, Gail; Wynne-Jones, Gwenllian; Storheim, Kjersti; Eik, Hedda",J Occup Rehabil,330,0

The grounded theory approach was applied, which is one of the qualitative designs. The content of the verses of the Noble Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad that dealt with the issue of crises were analyzed. The results of the qualitative analysis of the verses of the Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet's noble Sunnah have resulted in four concepts that constitute a broad conceptual theory of crisis management according to the Islamic approach. These concepts are: Crisis management strategies in Islam, the stages of crisis management, the characteristics of a leader who manages crises, and the roles of a leader during the crisis management process. A number of assumptions have been made of this generated theory about Islamic crisis management model. In light of the results of this study, recommendations were formulated that indicate the necessity of training leaders in the Islamic approach to crisis management, its strategies and its scientific steps in crisis management. These results have wide applications in the field of training leaders, and also recommend future studies to verify the assumptions of the theory that emerged from the data in this study on crisis management in Islam (COVID‐19 pandemic crisis as a model).","Al Eid, Nawal A.; Arnout, Boshra A.",J Public Aff,330,26

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.","Kim, Kwang Su; Ejima, Keisuke; Ito, Yusuke; Iwanami, Shoya; Ohashi, Hirofumi; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Asai, Yusuke; Nakaoka, Shinji; Watashi, Koichi; Thompson, Robin N; Iwami, Shingo",,330,24

Italy was one of the most affected countries, as the first European full-blown outbreak occurred there. The exposure of the Italian health care workers to COVID-19 may be an important risk factor for psychological distress. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe worries and risk perception of being infected among Italian Health Care Workers (HCWs) during the first wave of the pandemic. In total, 2078 HCWs participated in a web survey (78.8% were females). The highest percentage of respondents were physicians (40.75%) and nurses (32.15%), followed by medical (18.00%), health care support (4.50%) and administrative (4.60%) staff. In a score range between 0 (not worried) and 4 (very worried), our results showed that participants declared that they were worried about the Coronavirus infection with a median score of 3 (IQR 2-3) and for 59.19% the risk perception of being infected was very high. In addition, HCWs reported they suffered from sleep disturbances (63.43%). From the analysis of the psychological aspect, a possible divergence emerged between the perceived need for psychological support (83.85%) and the relative lack of this service among health care providers emerged (9.38%). Our findings highlight the importance of psychological and psychiatric support services not only during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in other emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) scenarios. These services may be useful for health authorities and policymakers to ensure the psychological well-being of health care professionals and to promote precautionary behaviors among them.","Puci, Mariangela Valentina; Nosari, Guido; Loi, Federica; Puci, Giulia Virginia; Montomoli, Cristina; Ferraro, Ottavia Eleonora",Healthcare (Basel),330,16

Little research has addressed potential inequalities in access, with no research on variations before and since COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in social support service usage before and since the pandemic. METHODS: Unpaid carers and people living with dementia were interviewed over the phone about their experiences of accessing social support services before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcripts were analysed for key themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty participants (42 unpaid carers; eight people living with dementia) were interviewed, and five themes identified: (1) Service issues; (2) Access issues; (3) Relying on own initiative; (4) New inequalities due to COVID-19; and (5) Missing out on the benefits of support services. Participants reported transport, finances, and location as factors reducing their ability to access support service pre-COVID, with inequalities remaining and at times exacerbated since. Carers and people living with dementia also reported struggling with accessing basic necessities during COVID, including food and medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the benefits of accessing support services, resourced procedures and facilities are needed to maintain access to support services with more accessible remote support provision, enabling people from all backgrounds to access the care they need.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Tetlow, Hilary; Ward, Kym; Shenton, Justine; Cannon, Jacqueline; Butchard, Sarah; Komuravelli, Aravind; Gaughan, Anna; Eley, Ruth; Rogers, Carol; Rajagopal, Manoj; Limbert, Stan; Callaghan, Steve; Whittington, Rosie; Shaw, Lisa; Gabbay, Mark",Int J Equity Health,330,28

Indeed, COVID-19 manifestations may be equivocal, including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. In order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare providers, therefore, it is mandatory to stratify the risk of post-COVID-19 pandemic infection during the clinical and instrumental evaluation of cardiac patients, who are at low risk for COVID-19.

METHODS: Secondary data from a national external evaluation of PHC conducted in 2017 and 2018 were analyzed. The construction of the score used 14 variables, divided into the following: structural characteristics of the PHC, infection control equipment under conditions of use, and biosafety supplies in sufficient quantity. The questions were mostly dichotomous (yes/no). Descriptive analyses were carried out to characterize the OHT and factor analyses to reduce the number of observed variables to a specific number of factors. RESULTS: Among 20,301 health units with OHT, 4,510 (22.2%) units did not have washable floors, ceilings, and walls; 8,406 (41.4%) did not have a sealer; 16,780 (82.7%) did not have taps with noncontact activation, and 4,663 (23.0%) units did not have rubber gloves. Regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), 1,618 (8.0%) units did not have a sufficient quantity of basic PPE. Three factors were defined to explain the 14 evaluated variables. The South region had the best score of infection control, while the North had the worst. CONCLUSIONS: Regional inequalities in the failures in infection control structures identified in PHC with OHT were related to the physical structure, equipment, and supplies used for infection control and the absence of PPE for OHT.","da Fonseca, Emílio Prado; Pereira-Junior, Edmilson Antônio; Palmier, Andréa Clemente; Abreu, Mauro Henrique Nogueira Guimarães",Biomed Res Int,330,16

DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 432 parents of young children (ages 1–6) in six South Korean cities (320 and 112 from the high and low family cohesion groups, respectively). We collected data using self-report questionnaires on parents' health promotion behavior, stress, risk perception due to COVID-19, positive psychological capital, and family cohesion, and analyzed it using stepwise multiple regressions with the SPSS program. RESULTS: The factors influencing parents' health promotion behavior differed across the family cohesion groups. For the high group, family cohesion, positive psychological capital, gender, and stress significantly affected parents' health promotion behavior (adjusted R(2) = 0.22, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, for the low group, positive psychological capital, gender, stress and parents' health status significantly affected parents' health promotion behavior (adjusted R(2) = 0.19, p < 0.001). Thus, stress, positive psychological capital, and gender were common factors of parents' health promotion behavior overall, regardless of family cohesion. CONCLUSION: Our results are meaningful in finding that parents' health-related behaviors are not only affected by their individual factors, but also by family-related factors in the COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The study results may act as a base for improving family-centered intervention programs to promote healthy behaviors in both parents and young children based on personal and family cohesion factors.","Park, Song I.; Cho, In Young",J Pediatr Nurs,330,20

In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%–100%), fever (42%; 11%–100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%–100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Pediatr Infect Dis J,330,21

The acceleration of new cases is important for the characterization and comparison of epidemic curves. The objective of this work is to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazilian states. Methods: This is an ecological study with time series analysis of new cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federation units. Using the polynomial interpolation method, we calculated the daily cases and deaths with the measurement of the respective acceleration. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data. Results: The combination of daily data and acceleration determined that the states of Brazil are in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum acceleration of peak cases, peak of cases, maximum acceleration of deaths and peak of deaths are associated with the Gini index and population density, but did not correlate with HDI and per capita income. Conclusion: Brazilian states showed heterogeneous data curves. Densitypopulation and socioeconomic inequality are associated with worse control of the epidemic.","Rodrigues, C. A.; Pinto, A.

Immunohistochemistry revealed intense deposition of α‐defensins in lung vasculature and thrombi. IL‐6 stimulated the release of α‐defensins from neutrophils, thereby accelerating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis in human blood, imitating the coagulation pattern in COVID‐19 patients. The procoagulant effect of IL‐6 was inhibited by colchicine, which blocks neutrophil degranulation.

We investigated the epidemiology of sHCoV infection during the first year of life, including risk factors and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of infants enrolled in a birth cohort near Cape Town, South Africa, from 2012 to 2015. LRTI surveillance was implemented, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected fortnightly over infancy. Quantitative PCR detected respiratory pathogens, including coronaviruses-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1. Swabs were tested from infants at the time of LRTI and from the 90 days prior as well as from age-matched control infants from the cohort over the equivalent period. RESULTS: In total, 885 infants were included, among whom 464 LRTI events occurred. Of the 4751 samples tested for sHCoV, 9% tested positive, with HCoV-NL63 the most common. Seasonal HCoV detection was associated with LRTI; this association was strongest for coronavirus-OC43, which was also found in all sHCoV-associated hospitalizations. Birth in winter was associated with sHCoV-LRTI, but there were no clear seasonal differences in detection. Co-detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae was weakly associated with sHCoV-LRTI (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-3.6); detection of other respiratory viruses or bacteria was not associated with sHCoV status.

This paper aimed to systematically identify the impact of frailty on overall mortality among older adults with COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review of the literature indexed in 4 databases. A random-effects model with inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis using the odds ratio was used to study the association of frailty levels with clinical outcomes among older adults with COVID-19. Heterogeneity was measured using the I(2) statistic and Egger's test. We identified 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria, including 924,520 total patients. Overall, frailty among older adults was associated with high rates of COVID-19-related mortality compared with non-frail older adults (OR [odds ratio]:5.76; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.85–8.61, I(2): 40.5%). Our results show that physical limitations, such as those associated with frailty among older adults, are associated with higher rates of COVID-19-related mortality.","Saragih, Ita Daryanti; Advani, Shailesh; Saragih, Ice Septriani; Suarilah, Ira; Susanto, Irwan; Lin, Chia-Ju",Geriatr Nurs,330,21

In this prospective cohort study of 39 hospitalized coronavirus disease COVID-19 patients, we describe systemic complement activation and its association with development of respiratory failure. Clinical data and biological samples were obtained at admission, days 3 to 5, and days 7 to 10. Respiratory failure was defined as PO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of ≤40 kPa. Complement activation products covering the classical/lectin (C4d), alternative (C3bBbP) and common pathway (C3bc, C5a, and sC5b-9), the lectin pathway recognition molecule MBL, and antibody serology were analyzed by enzyme-immunoassays; viral load by PCR. Controls comprised healthy blood donors. Consistently increased systemic complement activation was observed in the majority of COVID-19 patients during hospital stay. At admission, sC5b-9 and C4d were significantly higher in patients with than without respiratory failure (P = 0.008 and P = 0.034). Logistic regression showed increasing odds of respiratory failure with sC5b-9 (odds ratio 31.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 746, P = 0.03) and need for oxygen therapy with C4d (11.7, 1.1 to 130, P = 0.045). Admission sC5b-9 and C4d correlated significantly to ferritin (r = 0.64, P < 0.001; r = 0.69, P < 0.001). C4d, sC5b-9, and C5a correlated with antiviral antibodies, but not with viral load. Systemic complement activation is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients and provides a rationale for investigating complement inhibitors in future clinical trials.","Holter, Jan C.; Pischke, Soeren E.; de Boer, Eline; Lind, Andreas; Jenum, Synne; Holten, Aleksander R.; Tonby, Kristian; Barratt-Due, Andreas; Sokolova, Marina; Schjalm, Camilla; Chaban, Viktoriia; Kolderup, Anette; Tran, Trung; Tollefsrud Gjølberg, Torleif; Skeie, Linda G.; Hesstvedt, Liv; Ormåsen, Vidar; Fevang, Børre; Austad, Cathrine; Müller, Karl Erik; Fladeby, Cathrine; Holberg-Petersen, Mona; Halvorsen, Bente; Müller, Fredrik; Aukrust, Pål; Dudman, Susanne; Ueland, Thor; Andersen, Jan Terje; Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof; Heggelund, Lars; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne M.; Mollnes, Tom E.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,330,1

Data on the impact on otolaryngological clinics and private practices is sparse. This study aimed to present data on healthcare worker (HCW) screening, status of HCW, pre-interventional testing, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the economic impact of the pandemic. METHODS: Otolaryngological private practices and hospital-based departments were surveyed nationwide using an online questionnaire. Participating facilities were recruited via the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and the German Association for Otolaryngologists in Bavaria. RESULTS: 365 private practices (2776 employees) and 65 hospitals (2333 employees) were included. Significantly more hospitals (68.7%) than practices (40.5%) performed pre-interventional testing in their outpatients (p < 0.00). Most inpatients were tested in practices and hospitals (100.0% and 95.0%; p = 0.08). HCW screening was performed in 73.7% of practices and in 77.3% of hospitals (p = 0.54). Significantly more HCW infections were reported in private practices (4.7%) than in hospital (3.6%; p = 0.03). The private or home environment was the most frequent source of infection among HCW in hospitals (44%) and practices (63%). The use of PPE increased over the course of the pandemic. The number of procedures and the revenue decreased in 2020. CONCLUSION: The rate of pre-interventional testing among outpatients in otolaryngological practices is low and HCW infections were found to be more frequent in practices than in hospitals. In addition, a high rate of infections in otolaryngological HCW seems to stem from the private or home environment.

MethodsWe identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv databases from December 2019 to October 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Only reports with multivariate adjusted results were included to avoid the impact of potential confounding factors. ResultsA total of six studies with 377,265 patients were identified. Overall, in the categorical analysis, a low serum vitamin D level was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09- 1.97, I2=81%), hospitalization (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%), but not in-hospital death (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 0.27-27.61). Notably, when vitamin D level was analyzed as a continuous variable, each 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D level was not associated with any increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12, I2=74%) or in-hospital death (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.12). ConclusionsLow serum vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. In-hospital death showed a tendency to be increased in COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels. The ongoing clinical trials for evaluation of vitamin D supplementation will be key to the validation of this adjunctive treatment for COVID-19 patients.","chen, jie; xie, lixia; yuan, ping; yu, peng; ma, jianyong; zheng, chunhua; liu, xiao",,330,14

Immunocompromised patients, including IBD, were presumed to have higher risk. AIMS: We hypothesized patients with IBD would have higher-than-baseline anxiety, high perceived vulnerability and significant lifestyle impacts as a result of the pandemic. We sought to assess the impact of these changes on disease and management. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unspecified was conducted. Patients were invited to participate by email in an IRB-approved brief, voluntary survey. Survey questions focused on disease characteristics, healthcare access and self-reported psychological well-being. RESULTS: Responses from 492 (CD = 337, UC = 141,IC = 14) patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients with IBD had increased anxiety since the pandemic, which correlated with an increase in GI symptoms. This risk of symptoms was mitigated by communication with their provider. Many patients had lifestyle changes including requesting time off work due to perceived vulnerability and changes in eating habits. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an increase in illness-associated anxiety and perceived vulnerability among patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Open communication with providers is important to maintain adequate control of disease and reduce symptoms of flares triggered by ongoing stress.

COVID-19 is classically diagnosed by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test on a blood sample. However, it has some limitations related to the sensitivity and availability of tests and the turnaround times for results. To resolve these issues, artificial intelligence techniques can diagnose COVID-19 from computed tomography scans and investigate radiological features for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. This chapter presents a new Internet of Medical Things–based COVID-19 diagnosis model using different machine learning–based classification models on chest X-rays. The proposed model initially collects the samples of patients using Internet of Things devices and transfer the data to the cloud server, where actual diagnosis takes place. Once diagnosis is completed, the report is transferred to the concerned health care centers for further processing. For purposes of diagnosis, a series of processes involves preprocessing, texture feature extraction, and classification. The performance of the proposed model has been validated using a chest X-ray dataset. Analysis of the experimental results indicated that the AdaBoost with random forest model is superior to other models with a maximum accuracy of 90.13%, F score of 90.28%, kappa value of 89.59%, and Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 87.44%. The attained results demonstrated that the proposed model is effective for the diagnosis of COVID-19 along with severe acute respiratory syndrome over comparable methods.","Sheeba Rani, S.; Selvakumar, S.; Pradeep Mohan Kumar, K.; Thanh Tai, Duong; Dhiravida Chelvi, E.",Data Science for COVID-19,330,3

This has put them at increased risk of burnout at a time when levels are already worryingly high in the profession, with recent studies consistently showing that around half of doctors meet the validated criteria for burnout. OBJECTIVES: To understand the wider factors influencing and impacting upon hospital doctors’ well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and mixed quantitative–qualitative analysis. SETTING: Acute National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England. PARTICIPANTS: An online survey was circulated in early June 2020 to all 449 doctors employed by the Trust. 242 doctors completed the survey (54% response rate). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Questions assessed occupational details, self-reported changes in physical and mental health, satisfaction with working hours and patterns, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), medication and facilities, communication and sought to identify areas seen as having a significant effect on doctors’ well-being. RESULTS: 96% of respondents requiring PPE were able to access it. Nearly half of the respondents felt that their mental health had deteriorated since the start of the pandemic. Over a third stated that their physical health had also declined. Issues identified as having a negative impact on doctors included increased workload, redeployment, loss of autonomy, personal issues affecting family members, anxiety around recovery plans, inadequate access to changing and storage facilities and to rest areas that allow for social distancing. Doctors appreciated access to ‘calm rooms’ that were made available for staff, access to clinical psychology support, free drinks and free car parking on site. CONCLUSION: The emerging themes are suggestive of increased burnout risk among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and encompass factors well beyond shortage of PPE. Small organisational initiatives and the implementation of changes suggested by survey respondents can have a positive impact on doctors’ well-being.","Cubitt, Lyndsey Jayne; Im, Yu Ri; Scott, Ciaran James; Jeynes, Louise Claire; Molyneux, Paul David",BMJ Open,330,20

Although it was initially reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases, it quickly became apparent that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory tract infection. Its clinical course is often complicated by cardiovascular manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, electrical disturbances, and myocardial damage. In addition, the cardiovascular system is involved not only during infection but also preceding the contraction of the virus; having cardiovascular comorbidities indicates significant vulnerability to the pathogen. As longer-term data continue to accumulate, we now have concerns over its lasting cardiovascular effects after recovery. Moreover, there have been substantial collateral effects on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of adverse cardiovascular events from vaccination have emerged as new hurdles to our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. As such, the association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular practice in general is expansive.

This noble concept affirms our essential connections to each other. However, labeling someone’s labor as a gift can make givers feel obligated exceed both contracts and professionalism. Contracts define the boundaries of expected work for expected compensation. Like heroism, professionalism in healthcare implies undertaking duties to others beyond the contractual. Careless use of these words, however, can lead to negative consequences. Gifts and heroism are best applied to special needs in special circumstances. Professionalism goes beyond special circumstances to address ongoing commitments to others. When the language of gifts, heroism, or professionalism are used to promote the ongoing performance of dangerous, excessive work, however, they become instruments of injustice and burnout.

Our sample comprised all patients in a North Carolina health care system’s registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020-February 2021. Patients’ addresses were geo-referenced and analyzed by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). A set of 12 SDOH variables for each county were collected from the American Community Survey (ACS-5) and the Economic Research Service. Principal Component Analysis was applied to SDOH variables in order to reduce dimensions down to 3 geographical SDOH categories: Protective SDOH, High-Risk SDOH and Increased Vulnerability for Infection (Table 1). Using Multivariate Clustering Analysis (MCA), three clusters of census tracts were categorized according to SDOH indicators: decreased social disparities (DSD), equivocal social disparities (ESD) and increased social disparities (ISD) (Image A). Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's Post-Hoc adjusted with Bonferroni were utilized to verify any difference in the proportion of patients residing in the different clusters (significance p<0.05). Results: A total of 13,733 patients were included in the study. The patients predominantly reside in Durham County (55.4%), are women (56.96%), and between 40 and 69 years old (41.9%). Further, patients are predominantly white (38.7%), non-Hispanic (79.63%), and single (49.6%). The concomitant analysis of KDE and MCA showed an overlap of COVID-19 hotspots with areas of ISD (Image B). The MCA revealed that there are 308 census tracts constituted by six counties, in which 40 form ISD clusters (vs. 109 ESD;vs. 159 DSD). In addition, ISD clusters have the highest rates of infection, with 179.8 patients per 10,000 (vs. 81.7 ESD;vs. 60.1 DSD). The ISD cluster was the most densely populated and was significantly more densely populated from the ESD and DSD clusters (p=0.01). Conclusion: In this sampling of COVID-19 patients, a disproportionate amount of patients come from areas with increased social disparities, suggesting further research and health policy will need to be directed towards addressing negative and vulnerability SDOH to curtail pandemic-related outbreaks.

The primary outcomes are risk of anastomotic leakage, death, clinical recurrence and subsequent diverting or permanent stoma and/or proctectomy. Secondary endpoints are quality of life and functional outcome. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted using the Cochrane library, EMBASE and Medline. The complete search strategy is uploaded online at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/. Human studies in English with over five subjects were included and no limit was set regarding the date of publication. All relevant studies were screened by two reviewers. The web-based software platform www.covidence.org was used for primary screening of the title, abstract, full-text review and data extraction. RESULTS The search identified 2231 unique articles. After the screening process, 37 remained. Key results were an overall anastomotic leak (AL) rate of 6.4%; cumulative rates of clinical recurrence of 43% and 67% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; an overall rate of proctectomy of 18.9%; and subsequent ileostomy required in 18.8%. Only one study presented useful data on quality of life. Recurrence rates remained stable over time. A small decline in the anastomotic leak rate was found. CONCLUSIONS Only minor improvements in the outcomes of IRA in patients with Crohn´s disease have occurred during the past 50 years regarding anastomotic leakage and recurrence, except for a slight increase in the rate of a functioning IRA. These results call for the implementation guidelines in patient selection for IRA, and post-operative medical treatment and follow-up.","Baelum, Jens Kristian; Qvist, Niels; Ellebaek, Mark Bremholm",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,330,16

This review article presents the status of solar energy in Nigeria. Also, it provides an all-inclusive contemporary analysis of the extensive research carried out in this field by Nigerians and renewable energy researchers in general. With her large population, Nigeria requires enormous energy for sustainability; this has caused somewhat an overdependence on crude oil and natural gas for energy. This overdependence constantly puts the country in an energy consumption crisis when these resources are not readily available. It has its disadvantages as it affects climate change and her economy. Solar energy growth and application/adoption from the global, African, West African, and Nigerian perspectives were expounded with that of Nigeria buttressed on to bring into view the contrast between her adoption of this technology and the world. Albeit, the electricity generation from solar energy in Nigeria has also been estimated from solar radiation data, results of this analysis showed some areas in Northern Nigeria as the regions with the highest electricity generation capacity; the estimation using 1 kWp (Kilowatt-peak) PV (photovoltaic) modules were made from obtained data for possible electricity generation in kWh. The challenges to adopting these technologies were noted together with some recommendations/policies on how to curb these challenges and their implications. This review article will be of massive benefit to both the government and researchers in this research area and scientists who are currently working on renewable-related projects.","Agbo, Emmanuel.P.; Edet, Collins.O.; Magu, Thomas.O.; Njok, Armstrong.O.; Ekpo, Chris.M.; Louis, Hitler",Heliyon,330,16

The use of ABO-incompatible plasma is not contraindicated in treatment, but can be hesitated due to the lack of experience of physicians. Here, we describe a 68-year old man with COVID-19 who was treated ABO-incompatible plasma therapy; additionally, we comment on the acute side effects associated with ABO mismatch transfusion. To overcome the obstacles of donor-recipient connections (schedule and distance), we propose the storage of frozen plasma, modification of the current Blood Management Law, and the establishment of a CP bank. We suggest that experience gained in CP therapy will be useful for not only the treatment of COVID-19, but also for coping with new emerging infectious diseases.","Im, Jae Hyoung; Nahm, Chung Hyun; Baek, Ji Hyeon; Kwon, Hea Yoon; Lee, Jin-Soo",J Korean Med Sci,330,24

We compared cases in Guangzhou and Wuhan to illustrate potential changes in pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics as the epidemic has progressed. METHODS: We studied 20 patients admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China from January 22 to February 12, 2020. Data were extracted from medical records. These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020. RESULTS: Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients. The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%). Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more community clustered. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces. Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission. Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.","Lei, Ziying; Cao, Huijuan; Jie, Yusheng; Huang, Zhanlian; Guo, Xiaoyan; Chen, Junfeng; Peng, Liang; Cao, Hong; Dai, Xiaoling; Liu, Jing; Li, Xuejun; Zhu, Jianyun; Xu, Wenxiong; Chen, Dabiao; Gao, Zhiliang; He, Jian-Rong; Lin, Bing-Liang",Travel Med Infect Dis,330,20

Here we elucidate the structural basis and mode of action for two potent SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies CV3–1 and CV3–25 that remained effective against emerging variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. CV3–1 bound to the (485-GFN-487) loop within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the “RBD-up” position and triggered potent shedding of the S1 subunit. In contrast, CV3–25 inhibited membrane fusion by binding to an epitope in the stem helix region of the S2 subunit that is highly conserved among β-coronaviruses. Thus, vaccine immunogen designs that incorporate the conserved regions in RBD and stem helix region are candidates to elicit pan-coronavirus protective immune responses.","Li, Wenwei; Chen, Yaozong; Prévost, Jérémie; Ullah, Irfan; Lu, Maolin; Gong, Shang Yu; Tauzin, Alexandra; Gasser, Romain; Vézina, Dani; Anand, Sai Priya; Goyette, Guillaume; Chaterjee, Debashree; Ding, Shilei; Tolbert, William D.; Grunst, Michael W.; Bo, Yuxia; Zhang, Shijian; Richard, Jonathan; Zhou, Fei; Huang, Rick K.; Esser, Lothar; Zeher, Allison; Côté, Marceline; Kumar, Priti; Sodroski, Joseph; Xia, Di; Uchil, Pradeep D.; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andrés; Mothes, Walther",bioRxiv,330,20

The volume of coronavirus tweets was far too great for one to find accurate or reliable information. Healthcare workers were flooded with noise which drowned the signal of valuable COVID-19 information. To combat the infodemic, physicians created healthcare-specific micro-communities to share scientific information with other providers. We analyzed the content of eight physician-created communities and categorized each message in one of five domains. We coded 1) an application programming interface to download tweets and their metadata in JavaScript Object Notation and 2) a reading algorithm using visual basic application in Excel to categorize the content. We superimposed the publication date of each tweet into a timeline of key pandemic events. Finally, we created NephTwitterArchive.com to help healthcare workers find COVID-19-related signal tweets when treating patients. We collected 21071 tweets from the eight hashtags studied. Only 9051 tweets were considered signal: tweets categorized into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards fewer signal tweets as the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42%). The most popular subdomain in Prevention was PPE (2448 signal tweets). In Therapeutics, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine wwo Azithromycin and Mechanical Ventilation were the most popular subdomains. During the active Infodemic phase (Days 0 to 49), a total of 2021 searches were completed in NephTwitterArchive.com, which was a 26% increase from the same time period before the pandemic was declared (Days -50 to -1). The COVID-19 Infodemic indicates that future endeavors must be undertaken to eliminate noise and elevate signal in all aspects of scientific discourse on Twitter. In the absence of any algorithm-based strategy, healthcare providers will be left with the nearly impossible task of manually finding high-quality tweets from amongst a tidal wave of noise.","DESAI, T.; Conjeevaram, A.",,330,5

The mRNAs 1 to 6 were larger in the mutant, whereas there was no difference between the two viruses in the size of the smallest mRNA, mRNA 7. Sequence analyses of the genomic RNA, mRNA 6, and mRNA 7 of the two viruses revealed that an additional 111 nt were inserted just upstream of the intergenic consensus sequence preceding the N gene in MHV-S No. 8. The inserted region consisted of two different parts; the 3′-most 30 nt corresponded to nucleotides 28 to 57 of the leader sequence and the 5′-most 81 nt corresponded to nucleotides 58 to 138 of mRNA 7. This structure of No. 8 was most likely generated by RNA-RNA recombination between genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA species. The nucleotide insertion in the intergenic sequence between genes M and N resulted in two consensus sequences separated by 111 nt. Primer extension analysis revealed that the amount of a slightly larger, subgenomic mRNA resulting from initiation of synthesis at the upstream consensus sequence was only 5% of the usual sized mRNA 7 initiated from the downstream consensus sequence.","Taguchi, Fumihiro; Ikeda, Toshio; Makino, Shinji; Yoshikura, Hiroshi",Virology,330,20

As the demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing continues to increase amid supply shortages, many laboratories have investigated the use of sources other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and midturbinate (MT) nasal swabs are attractive alternatives, as they allow for self-collection and are well accepted by patients. Saliva also requires limited consumables. We compared the performance of health care provider-collected NP swabs, patient-collected MT swabs, and patient-collected saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection using a laboratory-developed PCR assay that had received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Of 281 total evaluable samples, 33 (11.7%) NP swabs, 33 (11.7%) MT swabs, and 32 (11.4%) saliva specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 following resolution of discordant results. Compared to NP swabs, saliva exhibited a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248), while patient-collected MT swabs exhibited a sensitivity of 93.9% (31/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248). When comparing to the consensus standard, the sensitivity was found to be 100% (31/31) for both NP and MT swabs and 96.8% (30/31) for saliva specimens, while specificity was the same in both NP swabs and saliva specimens (98.8% [247/250]) and 99.2% (248/250) for MT swabs. Pretreatment of saliva with proteinase K and heating for 15 min prior to extraction reduced the invalid rate from 26.7% (52/195) to 0% (0/195). These data show that midturbinate nasal swabs and saliva are suitable sources for self-collection in individuals who require routine monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Boerger, Aimee C.; Buckwalter, Seanne; Fernholz, Emily C.; Jannetto, Paul J.; Binnicker, Matthew J.; Reed, Katelyn; Walchak, Robert; Woodliff, Ethan; Johnson, Michael; Pritt, Bobbi S.",J Clin Microbiol,330,23

However, recent increases in the number of pregnant women considering undergoing prenatal testing have made it challenging to retain individualized in-person care. To explore pregnant women’s opinions toward pretest GC models and the ideal time duration, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted for women at their first prenatal visit. A total of 114 valid respondents (93.4%) were included in the analyses. Of these, 80.7% of women preferred in-person GC, followed by classroom (9.6%), group (3.5%), and telegenetic-based GC (2.6%). Women with experience in undergoing prenatal testing significantly did not prefer in-person GC (p = 0.05). Sixty-two women (54.4%) preferred a duration of 15–29 min for pretest GC sessions, followed by 30–59 min (28.9%) and <15 min (14.9%). Women’s preference of ≥30 min in length was significantly associated with anhedonia, singleton pregnancies, acquaintance with people with trisomy 21, and awareness of prenatal testing. Women who were unaware of the need for agreement with the partner for prenatal testing and who did not know the average life expectancy of a trisomy 21 patient significantly preferred <15 min in length over other durations. While the majority of women preferred in-person GC for <30 min, their preferences varied by their background characteristics, experiences, attitudes, and knowledge. These findings will help establish a prenatal GC system offering a choice of GC models in Japan; however, further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Nishiyama, Miyuki; Ogawa, Kohei; Hasegawa, Fuyuki; Sekido, Yuki; Sasaki, Aiko; Akaishi, Rina; Tachibana, Yoshiyuki; Umehara, Nagayoshi; Wada, Seiji; Ozawa, Nobuaki; Sago, Haruhiko",J Hum Genet,330,21

The live pathogen vaccine (LPV) strategy, which originated in ancient China for fighting smallpox, has been applied successfully in the USA military recruits for decades to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses. This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS‐CoV‐2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV's safety (SARS‐CoV‐2 is not highly pathogenic; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV's safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in hot seasons). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options, and could reduce greatly the morbidity and mortality as well as economic loss caused by the pandemic. The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough cautiousness.

While many computational methods have been developed to infer the pseudo-temporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, methods that compare pseudo-temporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions are lacking. Lamian is a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. It can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions, and also to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, Lamian draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both simulations and real scRNA-seq data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of Lamian in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes.","Hou, Wenpin; Ji, Zhicheng; Chen, Zeyu; Wherry, E.

METHODS: A qualitative study incorporating 20 focus groups was conducted between August 2010 and May 2011. HCWs from 7 hospitals in Vietnam were invited to participate. RESULTS: Issues associated with the availability of facemasks (medical and cloth masks) and respirators was the strongest theme to emerge from the discussion. Participants reported that it is not unusual for some types of facemasks to be unavailable during nonemergency periods. It was highlighted that the use of facemasks and respirators is not continuous, but rather is limited to selected situations, locations, and patients. Reuse of facemasks and respirators is also common in some settings. Finally, some participants reported believing that the reuse of facemasks, particularly cloth masks, is safe, whereas others believed that the reuse of masks put staff at risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In low and middle-income countries, access to appropriate levels of personal protective equipment may be restricted owing to competing demands for funding in hospital settings. It is important that issues around reuse and extended use of medical masks/respirators and decontamination of cloth masks are addressed in policy documents to minimize the risk of infection.","Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; Chi Dung, Tham; Maher, Lisa; Nga, Phan Thi; MacIntyre, C.

Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of social, municipal, and individual factors on the COVID-19 pandemic in working-age population living in Mexico City. To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested. Finally, we assessed the influence of MUPD and DISLI on discrepancies of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality compared with death certificates from the General Civil Registry. We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically active sectors and who experienced increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The impact of social inequalities transcends individuals and has significant effects at a municipality level, with and interaction between DISLI and MUPD. Marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced an accentuated risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts across marginalized municipalities. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths and significant excess mortality associated with non-COVID-19 deaths closely related to MUPD/DISLI in an ambulatory setting, which could be a negative externality of hospital reconversion.

Worldwide, on July 20, it has been estimated above 160 million individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it is found that only about 1 out of 11 infected individuals are detected. In an information context in which population-based seroepidemiological studies are not frequently available, this study shows a parsimonious alternative to provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. By comparing our estimates with those provided by the population-based seroepidemiological ENE-COVID study in Spain, we confirm the utility of our approach. Then, using a cross-country regression, we investigated if differences in detection rates are associated with differences in the cumulative number of deaths. The hypothesis investigated in this study is that higher levels of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections can reduce the risk exposure of the susceptible population with a relatively higher risk of death. Our results show that, on average, detecting 5 instead of 35 percent of the infections is associated with multiplying the number of deaths by a factor of about 6. Using this result, we estimated that 120 days after the pandemic outbreak, if the US would have tested with the same intensity as South Korea, about 85,000 out of their 126,000 reported deaths could have been avoided.","Villalobos, Carlos",Front Public Health,330,1

METHOD: A task force comprising of 25 rheumatologists from the 5 regions of the continent was formed and operated through a hub-and-spoke model with a central working committee (CWC) and 4 subgroups. The subgroups championed separate scopes of the clinical questions and formulated preliminary statements of recommendations which were processed centrally in the CWC. The CWC and each subgroup met by several virtual meetings, and two rounds of voting were conducted on the drafted statements of recommendations. Votes were online-delivered and recommendations were pruned down according to predefined criteria. Each statement was rated between 1 and 9 with 1–3, 4–6 and 7–9 representing disagreement, uncertainty and agreement, respectively. The levels of agreement on the statements were stratified as low, moderate or high according to the spread of votes. A statement was retired if it had a mean vote below 7 or a ‘low’ level of agreement. RESULTS: A total of 126 initial statements of recommendations were drafted, and these were reduced to 22 after the two rounds of voting. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary statements of recommendations will serve to guide the clinical practice of rheumatology across Africa amidst the changing practices and uncertainties in the current era of COVID-19. It is recognized that further updates to the recommendations will be needed as more evidence emerges.","Akintayo, Richard Oluyinka; Bahiri, Rachid; El Miedany, Yasser; Olaosebikan, Hakeem; Kalla, Asgar Ali; Adebajo, Adewale Olukayode; Migowa, Angela Nyangore; Slimani, Samy; Koussougbo, Ouma Devi; Kawther, Ben Abdelghani; Akpabio, Akpabio Akanimo; Ghozlani, Imad; Dey, Dzifa; Hassan, Waleed A.; Govind, Nimmisha; Makan, Kavita; Mohamed, Abdelgaffar; Genga, Eugene Kalman; Ghassem, Mohamed Khattry Ahmed; Mortada, Mohamed; Hamdi, Wafa; Wabi, Moudjib O.; Tikly, Mohammed; Ngandeu-Singwe, Madeleine; Scott, Christian",Clin Rheumatol,330,1

METHODS: Data of 615 patients discharged from ASST Ovest Milanese (Milan, Lombardy, Italy) with final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were retrospectively extracted from electronical medical records from 21 February to 1 May 2020. Patients were descriptively analyzed with respect to the following variables: sex, age, muscular manifestations (myalgia and/or arthralgia), fatigue, respiratory involvement (SARS pneumonia or respiratory failure) and history of falls. Association between patients’ characteristics and CK levels was investigated. In addition, the proportion of patients who died following access to the ER was calculated. Finally, the effect of CK levels and other patients’ features on mortality was estimated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: 176 (28.6%) patients had raised serum CK levels. CK levels were significantly associated with history of falls, male gender, SARS pneumonia, respiratory failure and in-hospital death. No correlation was found between hyperckemia and muscular manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides preliminary evidence that hyperckemia is associated with respiratory failure and fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Multiorgan MRI can provide further insight on the repercussions of COVID-19 on organ health but requires a balance between richness and quality of data acquisition and total scan duration. We adapted the UK Biobank brain MRI protocol to produce high-quality images while being suitable as part of a post-COVID-19 multiorgan MRI exam. The analysis pipeline, also adapted from UK Biobank, includes new imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) designed to assess the effects of COVID-19. A first application of the protocol and pipeline was performed in 51 COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 25 controls participating in the Oxford C-MORE study. The protocol acquires high resolution T1, T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted images, susceptibility weighted images, and arterial spin labelling data in 17 minutes. The automated imaging pipeline derives 1575 IDPs, assessing brain anatomy (including olfactory bulb volume and intensity) and tissue perfusion, hyperintensities, diffusivity, and susceptibility. In the C-MORE data, these quantitative measures were consistent with clinical radiology reports. Our exploratory analysis tentatively revealed that recovered COVID-19 patients had a decrease in frontal grey matter volumes, an increased burden of white matter hyperintensities, and reduced mean diffusivity in the total and normal appearing white matter in the posterior thalamic radiation and sagittal stratum, relative to controls. These differences were generally more prominent in patients who received organ support. Increased T2* in the thalamus was also observed in recovered COVID-19 patients, with a more prominent increase for non-critical patients. This initial evidence of brain changes in COVID-19 survivors prompts the need for further investigations. Follow-up imaging in the C-MORE study is currently ongoing, and this protocol is now being used in large-scale studies. The pipeline is widely applicable and will contribute to new analyses to hopefully clarify the medium to long-term effects of COVID-19.","Griffanti, L.; Raman, B.; Alfaro-Almagro, F.; Filippini, N.; Cassar, M.

We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.","Sugimoto, Ryu; Kenzaka, Tsuneaki; Fujikawa, Moemi; Kawasaki, Satoru; Nishisaki, Hogara",Cureus,330,16

However, prolonged evaluation in the emergency department (ED) may not be required for all patients. As a quality improvement initiative, we implemented an algorithm for rapid assessment of febrile travelers (RAFT) in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: Criteria for RAFT referral include: presentation to the ED, reported fever and travel to the tropics or subtropics within the past year. Exclusion criteria include Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and fulfilment of admission criteria such as unstable vital signs or significant laboratory derangements. We performed a time series analysis preimplementation and postimplementation, with primary outcome of wait time to tropical medicine consultation. Secondary outcomes included number of ED visits averted for repeat malaria testing, and algorithm adherence. RESULTS: From February 2014 to December 2015, 154 patients were seen in the RAFT clinic: 68 men and 86 women. Median age was 36 years (range 16–78 years). Mean time to RAFT clinic assessment was 1.2±0.07 days (range 0–4 days) postimplementation, compared to 5.4±1.8 days (range 0–26 days) prior to implementation (p<0.0001). The RAFT clinic averted 132 repeat malaria screens in the ED over the study period (average 6 per month). Common diagnoses were: traveller's diarrhoea (n=27, 17.5%), dengue (n=12, 8%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (n=11, 7%), chikungunya (n=10, 6.5%), laboratory-confirmed influenza (n=8, 5%) and lobar pneumonia (n=8, 5%). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to provision of more timely care to ambulatory febrile returned travellers, we reduced ED bed-usage by providing an alternate setting for follow-up malaria screening, and treatment of infectious diseases manageable in an outpatient setting, but requiring specific therapy.","Jazuli, Farah; Lynd, Terence; Mah, Jordan; Klowak, Michael; Jechel, Dale; Klowak, Stefanie; Ovens, Howard; Sabbah, Sam; Boggild, Andrea K",BMJ Open,330,1

In response to this pandemic, most psychological responses have been at a higher prevalence such as stress, anxiety, depression, lower mental well-being, poor sleep quality, along with the fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease. Related to these psychological responses, previous studies have suggested an association between COVID-19 fear and stress as well as stress and sleep quality. The present study aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality and investigate the possible mediating effect of perceived stress during this pandemic. The data were collected, utilizing a self-report online questionnaire, from a sample of 521 Bangladeshi adults. Results showed significant gender differences in COVID-19 fear, stress, and sleep quality and also a significant association between these variables. Mediation results revealed that stress fully mediated the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality for males and partially mediated it for females. These results suggest that women are in a more vulnerable position in this pandemic. These findings would be helpful to mental health professionals and policy makers to address the psychological problems induced by the current pandemic.","Siddique, Rumana Ferdousi; Ahmed, Oli; Hossain, Kazi Nur",Heliyon,330,20

Beginning in March 2020, nationwide shelter-in-place orders rapidly led to widespread job loss and economic upheaval; disruption and breakdown of multiple support systems; and increases in family stress, all of which may exacerbate underlying PTSD symptoms. Although telehealth has proven an effective means of delivering evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD, little is known about the delivery of these treatments in an intensive, daily format over telehealth. There is growing need for intensive treatment options to reduce treatment-interfering barriers such as high dropout rates. In order to address this gap in the literature, this paper details several design considerations as well as patient selection procedures for a 2-week virtual intensive treatment program (vITP) for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consisting of daily individual Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and other adjunctive interventions. We also describe two cases of veterans who successfully completed the vITP including their clinical outcomes, therapist reflections on the process, feedback regarding the program, as well as challenges patients encountered with the telehealth platform.

Objectives: To assess reticulo-endothelial activation and its correlation with disease severity and death in patients across the entire spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Methods: Consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients were studied, with similar number of patients in each disease severity category. Baseline serum ferritin, sCD163 (macrophage activation markers) and plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (endothelial activation marker) levels were studied. Clinical parameters and plasma D-dimer levels were also studied. The study parameters were correlated with COVID-19 severity and survival. Results: The 143 patients (104 males [80%], age 54 [42 – 65] years, median [inter-quartile range]) presented 4 (3—7) days after symptom onset. Thirty-four patients had mild disease, 36 had moderate disease, 36 had severe disease and 37 had critical disease at baseline. With increasing COVID-19 severity, ferritin, sCD163, VWF and D-dimer levels significantly increased at baseline, however, 139 patients had normal sCD163 levels.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.

Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16. Results In the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of NSP12-16 in the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV RTC functions in the “leader-to-body fusion” process. More importantly, our results revealed the associations between multiple functions of the RTC, including RNA synthesis, NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation, and CoV replication and transcription at the molecular level. As the most important finding, transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) hairpins were reported for the first time to help understand the multiple functions of CoV RTCs and the strong recombination abilities of CoVs. Conclusions TRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes. We provide a systematic understanding of the structures and functions of the RTC, leading to the eventual determination of the global CoV RTC structure. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a basis for future studies. Future drug design targeting SARS-CoV-2 needs to consider protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the RTC, particularly the complex structure of NSP15 and NSP16 with the TRS hairpin.","Li, Xin; Zhao, Qiang; Chang, Jia; Duan, Guangyou; Bei, Jinlong; Yau, Tung On; Yang, Jianyi; Ruan, Jishou; He, Bingjun; Gao, Shan",bioRxiv,330,33

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio(™) COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS during the second pandemic wave in Switzerland. RESULTS: 402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT clinical sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2–86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a clinical specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9–99.9) for the Ag-RDT. For cycle threshold values ≤ 26.7 (≥ 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7–99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS. INTERPRETATION: Based on our findings, the diagnostic performance of the Panbio(™) Covid-19 RDT with OPS samples, if taken by a trained person and high requirements regarding quality of the specimen, meet the criteria required by the WHO for Ag-RDTs (sensitivity ≥80% and specificity ≥97%) in a high incidence setting in symptomatic individuals.","Ngo Nsoga, Marie Thérèse; Kronig, Ilona; Perez Rodriguez, Francisco Javier; Sattonnet-Roche, Pascale; Da Silva, Diogo; Helbling, Javan; Sacks, Jilian A.; de Vos, Margaretha; Boehm, Erik; Gayet- Ageron, Angèle; Berger, Alice; Jacquerioz-Bausch, Frédérique; Chappuis, François; Kaiser, Laurent; Schibler, Manuel; Renzoni, Adriana; Eckerle, Isabella",PLoS One,330,18

Barriers to use include technical issues, privacy and security concerns, forgetfulness and a lack of support from businesses. The perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, government recommendations and communications, and the importance of contact tracing facilitated use. Technical, user, business, and government factors influenced the public's use of a COVID-19 contact tracing app. The development of apps requiring minimal user effort and initial user testing may improve uptake.

There is an urgent need for strategies to improve opioid use disorder treatment quality (e.g., 6-month retention). Substance use disorder treatment programs are challenged by limited resources and a workforce that does not have the requisite experience or education in quality improvement methods. The purpose of this study is to test a multicomponent clinic-level intervention designed to aid substance use disorder treatment clinics in implementing quality improvement processes to improve high-priority indicators of treatment quality for opioid use disorder. METHODS: A stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with 30 outpatient treatment clinics serving approximately 2000 clients with opioid use disorder each year will test whether a clinic-level measurement-driven, quality improvement intervention, called Coaching for Addiction Recovery Enhancement (CARE), improves (a) treatment process quality measures (use of medications for opioid use disorder, in-treatment symptom and therapeutic progress, treatment retention) and (b) recovery outcomes (substance use, health, and healthcare utilization). The CARE intervention will have the following components: (1) staff clinical training and tools, (2) quality improvement and change management training, (3) external facilitation to support implementation and sustainability of quality improvement processes, and (4) an electronic client-reported treatment progress tool to support data-driven decision making and clinic-level quality measurement. The study will utilize multiple sources of data to test study aims, including state administrative data, client-reported survey and treatment progress data, and staff interview and survey data. DISCUSSION: This study will provide the field with a strong test of a multicomponent intervention to improve providers’ capacity to make systematic changes tied to quality metrics. The study will also result in training and materials that can be shared widely to increase quality improvement implementation and enhance clinical practice in the substance use disorder treatment system.

This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of face mask in community settings in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS- CoV-2. Methods The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search using PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were performed using Medical subject heading (MeSH) words from the year 2000-2020. The articles focused on the use of masks and N95 respirators in healthcare workers were excluded. Results A total of 305 records were identified, out of which 14 articles were included in the review based upon quality and eligibility criteria. All the articles mentioned about the role of face masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, in the community or experimental setting. Studies also suggested that early initiation of face mask usage was more effective. Masks were also reported to be more effective in viruses that transmit easily from asymptomatic individuals, as is now known in SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence suggested that usage of face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.","GUPTA, MADHU; Gupta, Khushi; Gupta, Sarika",,330,16

METHODS: Paediatric patients (<13 years) presenting to Mitchells Plain Hospital were included. The level 5 lockdown period (27 March 2020–30 April 2020) was compared with similar 5-week periods immediately before (21 February 2020–26 March 2020) and after the lockdown (1 May 2020–4 June 2020), and to similar time periods during 2018 and 2019. Patient demographics, characteristics, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis, disposition and process times were collected from an electronic patient tracking and registration database. The χ(2) test and the independent samples median test were used for comparisons. RESULTS: Emergency centre visits during the lockdown period (n=592) decreased by 58% compared with 2019 (n=1413) and by 56% compared with the 2020 prelockdown period (n=1342). The proportion of under 1 year olds increased by 10.4% (p<0.001), with a 7.4% increase in self-referrals (p<0.001) and a 6.9% reduction in referrals from clinics (p<0.001).

Therefore, the need for stress prevention strategies is of personal and economic interest. Especially during the recent period related to covid-19 outbreak and lock-down, an ongoing discussion of increasing stress etiology is reported. Biomarker analysis may help to assist diagnosis and classification of stress-related diseases and therefore support therapeutical decisions. Due to its non-invasive sampling, the analysis of saliva has become highly attractive compared to the detection methods in other specimen. This review article summarizes the status of research, innovative approaches, and trends. Scientific literature published since 2011 was excerpted with concentration on the detection of up to seven promising marker substances. Most often reported cortisol represents the currently best evaluated stress marker, while norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol is also a quite commonly considered stress marker. Other complementary stress marker candidates are testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfonated analogue DHEA-S, alpha-amylase, secretory immunoglobulin A, and chromogranin A. Several working groups are researching in the field of stress marker detection to develop reliable, fast, and affordable methods.

Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 antibody conjugated magnetic graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-based magnetic relaxation switch (MRSw) that specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV-2. The probe of MRSw can be directly mixed with the test sample in a fully sealed vial without sample pretreatment, which largely reduces the testers’ risk of infection during the operation. The closed-tube one-step strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 is developed with home-made ultra-low field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR) relaxometry working at 118 μT. The magnetic GQDs-based probe shows ultra-high sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to its high magnetic relaxivity, and the limit of detection is optimized to 248 Particles mL(‒1). Meanwhile, the detection time in ULF NMR system is only 2 min, which can significantly improve the efficiency of detection. In short, the magnetic GQDs-based MRSw coupled with ULF NMR can realize a rapid, safe, and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Yongqiang; Ma, Peixiang; Tao, Quan; Krause, Hans-Joachim; Yang, Siwei; Ding, Guqiao; Dong, Hui; Xie, Xiaoming",Sens Actuators B Chem,330,24

Objectives We sought to test pulmonary, cardiovascular and peripheral responses to exercise in patients recovering from COVID-19. Methods We prospectively evaluated patients who recovered from COVID-19 using a combined anatomic/functional assessment. All patients underwent clinical examination, laboratory tests, and a combined stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test. We measured left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, stroke volume, heart rate, E/e' ratio, right ventricular function, VO2, lung volumes, Ventilatory efficiency, O2 saturation and muscle O2 extraction in all effort stages and compared them to historical controls. Results A total of 71 patients were assessed 90.6±26 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Only 23 (33%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fatigue (34%), muscle weakness/pain (27%) and dyspnea (22%). VO2 was lower among post-COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p=0.03, group by time interaction p=0.007). Reduction in peak VO2 was due to a combination of chronotropic incompetence (75% of post-COVID-19 patients vs. 8% of controls, p<0.0001) and insufficient increase in stroke volume during exercise (p=0.0007, group by time interaction p=0.03). Stroke volume limitation was mostly explained by diminished increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (p=0.1, group by time interaction p=0.03) and insufficient increase in ejection fraction (p=0.01, group by time interaction p=0.01). Post-COVID-19 patients had higher peripheral O2 extraction (p=0.004) and did not have significantly different respiratory and gas exchange parameters compared to controls. Conclusions Patients recovering from COVID-19 have symptoms associated with objective reduction in peak VO2. The mechanism of this reduction is complex and mainly involves a combination of attenuated heart rate and stroke volume reserve.","Szekely, Yishay; Lichter, Yael; Sadon, Sapir; Lupu, Lior; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Sapir, Orly; Granot, Yoav; Hochstadt, Aviram; Friedman, Shirley; Laufer-Perl, Michal; Banai, Shmuel; Topilsky, Yan",J Am Soc Echocardiogr,330,30

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective review, 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR form February 16, 2020, to March 28, 2020 were included. A total of 449 CT scans were reviewed. We analyze the type and distribution of lung abnormalities, and CT general assessment and lesion area statistics were performed. Patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe disease based on Chinese guidelines: mild (patients with minimal symptoms, CT scans showed no pneumonia or a small area of pneumonia infection), moderate (different extent of clinical manifestations and CT scans showed multiple pneumonia infections in both lungs), severe disease (respiratory distress, CT scans lesion area exceeds 50%, and the lesion contains consolidation). The proportion of patients with mild, moderate and severe diseases was counted. RESULTS The CT score and the area involved reached a peak (median 10) on illness days 7-12, and then, continued to be at a high level. The main abnormal pattern after symptoms appeared GGO (36/94 [36%] to 40/65 [62%] in different periods). The proportion of mixed reached its peak on illness days 13-18 (36/93 [39%]). Pure GGO was the most common subtype of GGO (24 of 60 CT scans [40%] to 23 of 33 CT scans [70%]) after symptoms onset. The ratio of GGO with irregular lines and interfaces peaked on illness days 7-12 (6/34 [18%]). The lesions are mainly distributed on both sides and under the pleura. 76/84 (90%) of discharged patients had residual lesions on the final CT scans. 4 confirmed patients' CT scans did not show lesions (on illness days 1-24 days). There were 47 mild cases (42.7%), 46 moderate cases (41.8%), and 7 severe cases (6.3%). CONCLUSIONS The degree of lung abnormality on the CT of the patients reached the peak on the 7th to 12th days of the disease. CT performance changes with time have a certain regularity, which may indicate the progress and recovery of the disease. 90% of patients still observed residual lung abnormalities in CT images at the time of discharge. There were 4 confirmed cases where the CT images did not show the lesion; hence, CT cannot be used as a basis for judging COVID-19 as a single tool.","Fengjun, Z; Ping, Z; Yi, Z; Liu, K; Liu, H-S; Yu, X-D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,330,32

FECV causes subclinical infections; FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic and fatal disease. It is thought that mutations in FECV enable infection of macrophages, causing FIP. However, the molecular basis for this biotype switch is unknown. We examined a furin cleavage site in the region between receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains of the spike of serotype 1 FCoV. FECV sequences were compared with FIPV sequences. All FECVs had a conserved furin cleavage motif. For FIPV, there was a correlation with the disease and >1 substitution in the S1/S2 motif. Fluorogenic peptide assays confirmed that the substitutions modulate furin cleavage. We document a functionally relevant S1/S2 mutation that arises when FIP develops in a cat. These insights into FIP pathogenesis may be useful in development of diagnostic, prevention, and treatment measures against coronaviruses.","Licitra, Beth N.; Millet, Jean K.; Regan, Andrew D.; Hamilton, Brian S.; Rinaldi, Vera D.; Duhamel, Gerald E.; Whittaker, Gary R.",Emerg Infect Dis,330,1

To address this issue, re-use of surgical face masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended; prior decontamination is paramount to their re-use. Aim: We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. Methods: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, UV irradiation, H2O2 vaporisation, and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. Findings: UV irradiation, H2O2 vaporisation and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. Conclusion: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, H2O2 vaporisation and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the FDA policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilisation in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","Ludwig-Begall, L.

An initial triaging method that accurately identifies the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is needed. We aimed to investigate if a potentially deteriorating clinical course in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be detected using all X-ray images taken during hospitalisation. METHODS: We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images acquired from 528 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for the purpose of validation. RESULTS: We found that our deep learning model predicted the need for mechanical ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately 3 days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24%–13.25%.

The employment of college graduates is not only related to the vital interests of graduates themselves and the general public, but also related to the sustainable and healthy development of higher education and the country’s prosperity through science and education. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has left China’s domestic labor and employment market in severe condition, which has a significant impact on the employment of college graduates. Based on the situation, the Chinese government has formulated a series of employment promotion policies for college graduates in accordance with local conditions to solve the current difficulties in employment of college graduates during the COVID-19Pandemic. Do these policies meet the expectations of the people? Is the policy implementation process reasonable? All these issues need to be tested and clarified urgently.

To this end, we adopted advanced deep network architectures and proposed a transfer learning strategy using custom-sized input tailored for each deep architecture to achieve the best performance. We conducted extensive sets of experiments on two CT image datasets, namely, the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan and the COVID19-CT. The results show superior performances for our models compared with previous studies. Our best models achieved average accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score values of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, and [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] on the COVID19-CT dataset, respectively.

Its rapid expansion and high number of cases mean that there are many open questions regarding its management, treatment and prognosis. One of these is the performing of a tracheostomy in patients affected by this pneumonia admitted to intensive care. Material and methods: A retrospective, observational study was carried out on all the patients admitted to the Intensive Medicine Department at a University Hospital with the clinical or analytical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. An analysis was performed on all patients that required mechanical ventilation connection and tracheostomy during their management. Results: A total of 37 patients were analysed, of whom 70.3% (26/37) were male. The mean age was 59.4 ± 9.4, and the APACHE II score was 14.8 ± 4.67. The mean number of days of mechanical ventilation prior to the performing of the tracheostomy was 11 ± 2.66. On 3 occasions it was done during the first week, and on 31 occasions during the second. Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed in 86.5% (32/37) of the cases, and 17 (46%) patients were decannulated. The mean number of days from tracheostomy to decannulation was 17.7 ± 10.6 days, with 16 of these 17 patients having been discharged from the hospital. In the study sample, the type of technique was not associated with a higher mortality or complication rate. Conclusions: The results are presented on 37 patients who required a tracheostomy as part of the management of COVID 19 pneumonia in a University Hospital, as well as a description of the technique performed and prognosis.","Higuera, J; Tato, J; Llorente, B; Trascasa, M; Vaduva, C; Ruíz A Serrano, C; Arteaga, J; Villa, P; Rivera, T; Nevado, E",,330,20

Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were diagnosed with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or mild or severe COVID-19, on admission to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) and at the end of observation. METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study included participants with laboratory-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital from Feb 11 to Feb 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analysed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until discharge or Feb 26, 2020, whichever came first. We defined asymptomatic infection as SARS-CoV-2 infection with no history of clinical signs and symptoms, severe COVID-19 as clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnoea, tachypnoea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy), and mild COVID-19 as all other symptoms. Clinical features on admission were compared among patients with different disease severity, including asymptomatic infection, at the end of observation. We used univariable analysis to identify factors associated with symptomatic illness among asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. FINDINGS: Among the 104 participants included in the final analysis, the median age was 68 years (IQR 47–75) and 54 (52%) were male. On admission, 43 (41%) participants were classified as asymptomatic, 41 (39%) as having mild COVID-10, and 20 (19%) as having severe COVID-19. At the end of observation, 33 (32%) participants were confirmed as being asymptomatic, 43 (41%) as having mild COVID-19, and 28 (27%) as having severe COVID-19. Serum lactate hydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period (five [50%] vs four [12%] participants; odds ratio 7·25, 95% CI 1·43–36·70; p=0·020). Compared with patients with mild disease at the end of observation, patients with severe COVID-19 were older (median age 73 years [IQR 55–77] vs 60 years [40–71]; p=0·028) and had more frequent consolidation on chest CT (13 [46%] of 28 vs nine [21%] of 43; p=0·035) and lymphopenia (16 [57%] vs ten [23%]; p=0·0055) on admission. INTERPRETATION: Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to improved clinical management.

As of April 2021, more than 130 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. Different approaches must be put in place to confront a new pandemic: community-based behaviours (i.e., isolation and social distancing), antiviral treatments, and vaccines. Although behaviour-based actions have produced significant benefits and several efficacious vaccines are now available, there is still an urgent need for treatment options. Remdesivir represents the first antiviral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 but has several limitations in terms of safety and treatment benefits. There is still a strong request for other effective, safe, and broad-spectrum antiviral systems in light of future emergent coronaviruses. Here, we describe a polymeric nanomaterial derived from L-lysine, with an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 associated with a good safety profile in vitro. Nanoparticles of hyperbranched polylysine, synthesized by L-lysine's thermal polymerization catalyzed by boric acid, effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication. The virucidal activity is associated with the charge and dimension of the nanomaterial, favouring the electrostatic interaction with the viral surface being only slightly larger than the virions' dimensions. Low-cost production and easiness of synthesis strongly support the further development of such innovative nanomaterials as a tool for potential treatments of COVID-19 and, in general, as broad-spectrum antivirals.","Stagi, Luigi; De Forni, Davide; Malfatti, Luca; Caboi, Francesca; Salis, Andrea; Poddesu, Barbara; Cugia, Giulia; Lori, Franco; Galleri, Grazia; Innocenzi, Plinio",Nanoscale (Online),330,16

Recent detections of circulating serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in northern Nigeria (Borno and Sokoto states) and Pakistan (Balochistan Province) and serotype 1 wild poliovirus in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (Borno) represent public health emergencies that require aggressive response. METHODS. We demonstrate the importance of undervaccinated subpopulations, using an existing dynamic poliovirus transmission and oral poliovirus vaccine evolution model. We review the lessons learned during the polio endgame about the role of subpopulations in sustaining transmission, and we explore the implications of subpopulations for other vaccine-preventable disease eradication efforts. RESULTS. Relatively isolated subpopulations benefit little from high surrounding population immunity to transmission and will sustain transmission as long as they do not attain high vaccination coverage. Failing to reach such subpopulations with high coverage represents the root cause of polio eradication delays. Achieving and maintaining eradication requires addressing the weakest links, which includes immunizing populations in insecure areas and/or with disrupted or poor-performing health systems and managing the risks of individuals with primary immunodeficiencies who can excrete vaccine-derived poliovirus long-term. CONCLUSIONS. Eradication efforts for vaccine-preventable diseases need to create performance expectations for countries to immunize all people living within their borders and maintain high coverage with appropriate interventions.Keywords.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 virus cases per 1000 residents and mental health outcomes of individuals across the globe. METHODS: Using plausibly exogenous variation in daily country-level reports of new COVID-19 cases across the world, this study employs an individual-by-day global data set to assess the association between virus outbreak intensity and short-term measures of mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Results indicate that females are 20.02% (95 % CI [6.65 %, 33.39 %]) more likely than males to find life depressing, suggesting that they may bear a much larger mental health burden than males during the COVID-19 pandemic. The association between the pandemic and mental health is more pronounced among individuals staying at home for the past week, who are 14.81 % (95 % CI [3.46 %, 26.16 %]) more likely to feel anxious and 11.17 % (95 % CI [2.13 %, 20.21 %]) more likely to experience emotional instability than their counterparts. The association between virus outbreak intensity and the likelihood of anxiety among individuals staying at home increases with household size, ranging from 11.73 % (95 % CI [-4.65 %, 28.11 %]) among individuals with 0–1 members in the household to 21.02 % (95 % CI [5.73 %, 36.31 %]) among those with 4–8 members in the household.

More than one million people have been infected since the appearance of the virus in Brazil in 2015. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic. An association with microcephaly and other birth defects as well as Guillain-Barre Syndrome has led to a World Health Organization declaration of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Zika virus is a vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Male to female sexual transmission has been reported and there is potential for transmission via blood transfusions. After an incubation period of 2–7 days, symptomatic patients develop rapid onset fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, often associated with headache and myalgias. Emergency department (ED) personnel must be prepared to address concerns from patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute Zika virus infection, especially those who are pregnant or planning travel to Zika-endemic regions, as well as those women planning to become pregnant and their partners. The identify-isolate-inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED, and later adjusted for measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for initial detection and management of patients under investigation for Zika virus. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk, including travel to countries with mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus, patients are further investigated if clinically indicated. If after a rapid evaluation, Zika or other arthropod-borne diseases are the only concern, isolation (contact, droplet, airborne) is unnecessary. Zika is a reportable disease and thus appropriate health authorities must be notified. The modified 3I tool will facilitate rapid analysis and triggering of appropriate actions for patients presenting to the ED at risk for Zika.","Koenig, Kristi L.; Almadhyan, Abdulmajeed; Burns, Michael J.",West J Emerg Med,330,16

PURPOSE: To evaluate PE prevalence on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) in COVID+ patients and factors associated with PE severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study evaluated 62 COVID+ patients who underwent CTPA between March 13 and April 5, 2020. A 62-patient cohort who underwent CTPA prior to the first reported local COVID-19 case was retrogradely selected. The relative rate of CTPA-positivity was recorded. For the COVID+ cohort, comorbidities, laboratory values, clinical outcome, and venous thrombosis were recorded. Two thoracic radiologists assessed embolic severity using the Mastora system and evaluated right heart strain. Statistical analysis evaluated factors associated with PE and arterial obstruction severity. A P-value<.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 37.1% of COVID+ patients had PE, higher than 14.5% of pre-COVID patients (P=.007). D-dimer levels closest to CTPA date correlated with Mastora obstruction score. ROC analysis identified optimal sensitivity (95%) and specificity (71%) for PE diagnosis at 1394 ng/mL DDU. The mean D-dimer was 1774 ng/mL and 6432 ng/mL DDU in CTPA-negative and CTPA-positive subgroups, respectively (P<.001). One additional CTPA-negative patient had DVT, for a total 38.7% with PE/DVT, despite 40% receiving prophylactic anticoagulation. Other factors did not demonstrate significant PE association. CONCLUSION: 37.1% of COVID+ CTPA exams diagnosed PE. PE can be a cause of decompensation in COVID+, and D-dimer can be used to stratify patients regarding PE risk and severity.","Kaminetzky, Mark; Moore, William; Fansiwala, Kush; Babb, James S.; Kaminetzky, David; Horwitz, Leora I.; McGuinness, Georgeann; Knoll, Abraham; Ko, Jane P.",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,330,24

The method is based on that of von Heijne (1). The program calculates a score for each residue in a polyprotein. The score indicates the resemblance of each residue to that at the cleavage site of a typical N-terminal eucaryotic signal sequence. The program correctly predicts the known N-terminal signal sequence cleavage sites of several cellular and viral proteins. The analysis demonstrates that the polyproteins of enveloped RNA viruses—including the alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses—contain several internal signal-sequence-like regions. The predicted cleavage site in these internal sequences are often known cleavage sites for processing of the polyprotein and are amongst the highest scoring residues with this algorithm. These results indicate a role for the cellular enzyme signal peptidase in the processing of several viral polyproteins. Not all high-scoring residues are sites of cleavage, suggesting a difference between N-terminal and internal signal sequences. This may reflect the secondary structure of the latter. Signal sequences were also found at the N-termini of the fusion proteins of the paramyxoviruses and the retroviruses. This suggests a mechanism of viral fusion analogous to that by which proteins are translocated through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum at synthesis.","Fazakerley, J. K.; Ross, A.

SETTING: U.S. residential colleges. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 5000 persons (students, faculty, and staff) living and working in close proximity on campus. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative infections over a 120-day semester. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, if 90% coverage can be attained with a vaccine that is 85% protective against infection and 25% protective against asymptomatic transmission, the model finds that campus activities can be resumed while holding cumulative cases below 5% of the population without the need for routine, asymptomatic testing. With 50% population coverage using such a vaccine, a similar cap on cumulative cases would require either daily asymptomatic testing of unvaccinated persons or a combination of less frequent testing and resumption of aggressive distancing and other nonpharmaceutical prevention policies. Colleges returning to pre–COVID-19 campus activities without either broad vaccination coverage or high-frequency testing put their campus population at risk for widespread viral transmission. LIMITATION: Uncertainty in data, particularly vaccine effectiveness (preventive and transmission); no distinguishing between students and employees; and assumes limited community intermixing. CONCLUSION: Vaccination coverage is the most powerful tool available to residential college administrators seeking to achieve a safe return to prepandemic operations this fall. Given the breadth of potential outcomes in the face of uncontrollable and uncertain factors, even colleges with high vaccination rates should be prepared to reinstitute or expand testing and distancing policies on short notice.

The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of β-actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles. This study reveals an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus.","Wang, Jibin; Fang, Shouguo; Xiao, Han; Chen, Bo; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang",PLoS One,330,1

Fear of infection and possible employment loss has placed stress on parents; while parents who could work from home faced chal-lenges in both working and providing full-time attentive childcare. For pregnant individuals, fear of at-tending prenatal visits also increased maternal stress, anxiety, and depression. Not surprising, there has been concern over how these factors, as well as missed educational opportunities and reduced interaction, stimulation, and creative play with other children might impact child neurodevelopment. Lev-eraging a large on-going longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment, we examined general childhood cognitive scores in 2020 and 2021 vs. the preceding decade, 2011-2019. We find that children born during the pandemic have significantly reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance com-pared to children born pre-pandemic. Moreover, we find that males and children in lower socioeconom-ic families have been most affected. Results highlight that even in the absence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness, the environmental changes associated COVID-19 pandemic is signifi-cantly and negatively affecting infant and child development.","Deoni, S.; Beauchemin, J.; Volpe, A.; D'Sa, V.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,330,16

Particularly, resistance training (RT) practitioners represent important DSEA consumers due to its easy access and the appeal of claims related to muscle hypertrophy, aesthetics, and physical performance improvements. METHODS: Our aim was to study knowledge, prevalence, and profile of DSEA used by Brazilian recreational RT practitioners. For this, RT practitioners of both sexes (n=129, female=58 and male=71) answered a paper-based questionnaire. The questionnaire was specifically created for the studied population to assess different aspects of the DSEA used and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of the participants (n=99) declared that they had already used DSEA. The majority (53%) searched the internet to obtain information about DSEA. Whey protein (66%) was the most used followed by branched chain amino acids (48%). CONCLUSION: The use of DSEA, before coronavirus outbreak, was popular among RT practitioners; protein and amino acids were the most used DSEA. Most users used internet to obtain information about DSEA. The results suggest the need for appropriate attitude and guidance by health professionals who deal with this population, especially dietitians, nutritionists, and physical training professionals in order to promote best and security practices.","Vancini, Rodrigo Luiz; Rufo-Tavares, Weverton; de Paula Oliveira, Hudson Renato; Viana, Ricardo Borges; Andrade, Marilia dos Santos; Knechtle, Beat; Nikolaidis, Pantelis Theodoros; Gentil, Paulo; de Lira, Claudio Andre Barbosa",Open Access J Sports Med,330,26

Therefore, there is an imperative need to speed up the drug discovery process to identify novel and efficient drug candidates. In this study, we have developed quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR)‐based models for predicting antiviral compounds (AVCs) against deadly viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human herpesvirus (HHV) and 26 others using publicly available experimental data from the ChEMBL bioactivity database. Support vector machine (SVM) models achieved a maximum Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.72, 0.74, 0.66, 0.68, and 0.71 in regression mode and a maximum Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.91, 0.93, 0.70, 0.89, and 0.71, respectively, in classification mode during 10‐fold cross‐validation. Furthermore, similar performance was observed on the independent validation sets. We have integrated these models in the AVCpred web server, freely available at http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/avcpred. In addition, the datasets are provided in a searchable format. We hope this web server will assist researchers in the identification of potential antiviral agents.

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.","Wang, Hao; Yuan, Zixuan; Pavel, Mahmud Arif; Hobson, Robert; Hansen, Scott B.",bioRxiv,330,20

We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 16,103 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 15,807 patients at Stanford facilities between March 2 and April 11, 2020. We analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between March 2nd and April 11th 2020. RESULTS: We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems. CONCLUSION: Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.","Kashyap, Sehj; Gombar, Saurabh; Yadlowsky, Steve; Callahan, Alison; Fries, Jason; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Shah, Nigam H",J Am Med Inform Assoc,330,24

METHODS: Participants were 100 residents and 102 staff from four co-located care homes in Wales. Data were collected from the homes and Public Health Wales, including demographics, presentations, test status and results, hospital admissions and deaths. Genomic sequencing of confirmed case samples was completed, where possible. Epi-curves, crude attack rates, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using R. RESULTS: About 14 confirmed and 43 possible resident cases, 23 confirmed and 47 possible staff cases occurred. Crude attack rates of possible and confirmed cases were 57% (residents) and 69% (staff). Genomic sequencing for 10 confirmed case PCR samples identified at least 5 different UK lineages of COVID-19.42 (42%) residents died, 23 (55%) with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 recorded on the death certificate.

AIM: To explore barriers and facilitators of conducting antipsychotic medication reviews in primary care for individuals with no specialist mental health input. DESIGN & SETTING: Realist review in general practice settings. METHOD: A realist review has been conducted to synthesise evidence on antipsychotic medication reviews conducted in primary care with service users diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychosis. Following initial scoping searches and discussions with stakeholders, a systematic search and iterative secondary searches were conducted. Articles were systematically screened and analysed to develop a realist programme theory explaining the contexts (C) and mechanisms (M) which facilitate or prevent antipsychotic medication reviews (O) in primary care settings, and the potential outcomes of medication reviews. RESULTS: Meaningful Antipsychotic medication reviews may not occur for individuals with only primary care medical input. Several, often mutually reinforcing, mechanisms have been identified as potential barriers to conducting such reviews, including low expectations of recovery for people with severe mental illness, a perceived lack of capability to understand and participate in medication reviews, linked with a lack of information shared in appointments between GPs and Service Users, perceived risk and uncertainty regarding antipsychotic medication and illness trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: The review identified reciprocal and reinforcing stereotypes affecting both GPs and service users. Possible mechanisms to counteract these barriers are discussed, including realistic expectations of medication, and the need for increased information sharing and trust between GPs and service users.

Additionally, by interrogating the temporal effects of radiotherapy on human peripheral blood mononuclear and mucosal cells, we observed important treatment-related alterations in host innate immunity, specifically type I interferon responses. Overall, cancers enhance expression of critical viral entry genes, and innate viral defenses can be dysregulated transiently during radiation treatments.

The aim of this study was to review the work of an ECLO over a period of 1 year at an NHS Trust to determine the volume of work and the areas of support provided by the ECLO. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A secondary data analysis of the ECLO case notes for all patients reviewed by the ECLO at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust during the year 2019, was performed. Demographic data and certification of visual impairment (CVI) status were noted. The main outcome variable recorded was the categories of support provided by the ECLO. Case vignettes were chosen to illustrate the variety of support offered to individual patients. RESULTS: A total of 1127 consecutive participants were reviewed by the ECLO at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust during the year 2019. Areas of support most commonly provided by the ECLO included aiding the process of registration for CVI, and assistance in accessing benefits, social support and low vision support.

However, several critical hurdles have impeded the development of robust AI model, which include deficiency, isolation, and heterogeneity of CT data generated from diverse institutions. These bring about lack of generalization of AI model and therefore prevent it from applications in clinical practices. To overcome this, we proposed a federated learning-based Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI, http://www.ai-ct-covid.team/), a decentralized architecture where the AI model is distributed to and executed at each host institution with the data sources or client ends for training and inferencing without sharing individual patient data. Specifically, we firstly developed an initial AI CT model based on data collected from three Tongji hospitals in Wuhan. After model evaluation, we found that the initial model can identify COVID from Tongji CT test data at near radiologist-level (97.5% sensitivity) but performed worse when it was tested on COVID cases from Wuhan Union Hospital (72% sensitivity), indicating a lack of model generalization. Next, we used the publicly available UCADI framework to build a federated model which integrated COVID CT cases from the Tongji hospitals and Wuhan Union hospital (WU) without transferring the WU data. The federated model not only performed similarly on Tongji test data but improved the detection sensitivity (98%) on WU test cases. The UCADI framework will allow participants worldwide to use and contribute to the model, to deliver a real-world, globally built and validated clinic CT-COVID AI tool. This effort directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals’ number 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and allows sharing and transferring of knowledge to fight this devastating disease around the world.","Xu, Yongchao; Ma, Liya; Yang, Fan; Chen, Yanyan; Ma, Ke; Yang, Jiehua; Yang, Xian; Chen, Yaobing; Shu, Chang; Fan, Ziwei; Gan, Jiefeng; Zou, Xinyu; Huang, Renhao; Zhang, Changzheng; Liu, Xiaowu; Tu, Dandan; Xu, Chuou; Zhang, Wenqing; Yang, Dehua; Wang, Ming-Wei; Wang, Xi; Xie, Xiaoliang; Leng, Hongxiang; Holalkere, Nagaraj; Halin, Neil J.; Kamel, Ihab Roushdy; Wu, Jia; Peng, Xuehua; Wang, Xiang; Shao, Jianbo; Mongkolwat, Pattanasak; Zhang, Jianjun; Rubin, Daniel L.; Wang, Guoping; Zheng, Chuangsheng; Li, Zhen; Bai, Xiang; Xia, Tian",medRxiv,330,3

It becomes more appealing in the micro-scale context, especially where the surface forces become predominant. In addition, the deformations happening at the very local level are often coupled, and therefore providing multi-axis force sensing capabilities to microgripper becomes an important necessity. The manufacturing of a multi-axis instrumented microgripper comprises several levels of complexity, especially when it comes to the single wafer fabrication of a sensing and actuation mechanism. To address these requirements, in this work, an instrumented two-axis force sensing tool is proposed, which can then be integrated with the appropriate actuators for microgripping. Indeed, based on the task, the gripper design and shape requirements may differ. To cover wide needs, a versatile manufacturing strategy comprising of the separate fabrication of the passive and sensing parts was especially investigated. At the microscale, signal processing brings additional challenges, especially when we are dealing with multi-axis sensing. Therefore, a proper device, with efficient and appropriate systems and signal processing integration, is highly important. To keep these requirements in consideration, a dedicated clean-room based micro-fabrication of the devices and corresponding electronics to effectively process the signals are presented in this work. The fabricated sensing part can be assembled with wide varieties of passive parts to have different sensing tools as well as grippers. This force sensing tool is based upon the piezoresistive principle, and is experimentally demonstrated with a sensing capability up to 9 mN along the two axes with a resolution of 20 µN. The experimental results validate the measurement error within 1%. This work explains the system design, its working principle, FEM analysis, its fabrication and assembly, followed by the experimental validation of its performance. Moreover, the use of the proposed sensing tool for an instrumented gripper was also discussed and demonstrated with a micrograsping and release task.","Tiwari, Bhawnath; Billot, Margot; Clévy, Cédric; Agnus, Joël; Piat, Emmanuel; Lutz, Philippe",Sensors (Basel),330,11

METHODS: From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. RESULTS: Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (p < 0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22–2.36, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6–8 h per day, and working ≥10 h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization.

Most of the research on the virus is focused on key players during its initial attack and entry into the cellular host; namely the S protein, its glycan shield, and its interactions with the ACE2 receptors of human cells. As cases continue to raise around the globe, and new mutants are identified, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of this virus during different stages of its life cycle.

Not only can these cells support the growth of SARS-CoV infection, but they are also capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines to initiate and, eventually, aggravate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune-mediated pathology within the lungs. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signaling to SARS-CoV is crucial for paving the way to better understand SARS pathogenesis. Based on microarray-based functional genomics, we report here the global gene response of 2B4 cells, a cloned bronchial epithelial cell line derived from Calu-3 cells. Specifically, we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor (NF)κB, activator protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3/7 in infected 2B4 cells at 12-, 24-, and 48-hrs post infection (p.i.), resulting in the activation of many antiviral genes, including interferon (IFN)-β, -λs, inflammatory mediators, and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We also showed, for the first time, that IFN-β and IFN-λs were capable of exerting previously unrecognized, non-redundant, and complementary abilities to limit SARS-CoV replication, even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2B4 bronchial epithelial cells until 48 hrs p.i. Collectively, our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by SARS-CoV in bronchial epithelial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies, aiming at advancing strategies against SARS.","Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Hill, Terence E.; Yoshikawa, Naoko; Popov, Vsevolod L.; Galindo, Cristi L.; Garner, Harold R.; Peters, C.

We performed a small-scale experiment to test the possibility of infectious virus carryover on the surface of different fabrics used in commercially available protective gowns. Application of a lentivirus vector that expresses green fluorescent protein allowed easy monitoring of infectious viral loads on fabrics. Results indicate that fabrics of level-3 surgical gowns serve better to reduce virus transmission compared to fabrics of chemical protective clothing with the same or higher barrier efficiency. Analysis of sliding angles provided indexes of fluid repellency, which were inversely related to virus carryover potentials. Droplets of infectious body fluids may easily roll off fabrics with water-repellent finishing.

Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters.

In this paper, we seek to understand stratification in the wake of the Great Recession by examining enrollment among students from differing income backgrounds by institutional type. Two theoretical frameworks suggest different conclusions. A Disaster Capitalism framework suggests that in places where the recession was most severe, enrollment by income would become more stratified than in places where the downturn was less severe. In contrast, Effectively Maintained Inequality would suggest that enrollments were already effectively stratified by income and would not necessarily be sensitive to exposure to an economic shock. Employing fixed effects modeling and novel data based on the tax records of 30 million Americans, we examine income composition by institutional type from 2004 to 2012. We find that although stratification by institutional type worsened during the recession and subsequent recovery, patterns of economic stratification were not more intense for institutions that enrolled students from states hardest hit by the recession. We conclude that these patterns are consistent with an Effectively Maintained Inequality framework. During the recession, the top quintiles continued to enjoy their longstanding disproportionate enrollment in the most selective institutions. For the bottom quintiles, the longstanding marginalization from 4-year college going persisted through the recession. These stratification patterns, however, were not more pronounced in places hardest hit by the recession.","Ford, Karly S.; Rosinger, Kelly Ochs; Zhu, Qiong",Res High Educ,330,1

CONCLUSION: To prepare for continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, evaluative studies of adaptations to fundamental healthcare delivery must be prioritized to enable evidence-based care to be provided in future. IMPACT: Our review identifies the barriers nurses experience in providing fundamental care during a pandemic, highlights potential adaptations that address barriers and ensure positive healthcare experiences and draws attention to the need for evaluative research on fundamental care practices during pandemics.","Whear, Rebecca; Abbott, Rebecca A; Bethel, Alison; Richards, David A; Garside, Ruth; Cockcroft, Emma; Iles-Smith, Heather; Logan, Pip A; Rafferty, Ann Marie; Shepherd, Maggie; Sugg, Holly V R; Russell, Anne Marie; Cruickshank, Susanne; Tooze, Susannah; Melendez-Torres, G J; Thompson Coon, Jo",J. adv. nurs,330,23

The purpose of this study was to compare clinical course and laboratory parameters between the most severely ill flu and COVID 19 patients treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). METHODS: The study was conducted at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the tertiary care hospital in Zagreb, Croatia in the period between November 2018 and July 2020. Investigation included 72 adult patients requiring IMV due to influenza or SARS-CoV‑2 virus infection and 42 patients had influenza and 30 had SARS-CoV‑2 virus infection and the comparison between two etiological groups was conducted. RESULTS: Invasively mechanically ventilated patients with COVID 19 and influenza differ in certain aspects. COVID 19 patients are older, male, have lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and have less need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. In other measured variables, including mortality, the difference between influenza or SARS-CoV‑2 etiology was not significant. CONCLUSION: High mortality of IMV patients with influenza and COVID 19 with 55% and 63%, respectively, challenges and urges medical and especially ICU community to expand our quest for further treatments, especially since ECMO use that is scarcely required in COVID 19 patients probably has limited impact in reducing mortality in COVID 19 patients.","Gjurašin, Branimir; Santini, Marija; Krajinović, Vladimir; Papić, Neven; Atelj, Anita; Kotarski, Viktor; Krznarić, Juraj; Vargović, Martina; Kutleša, Marko",Wien Klin Wochenschr,330,1

Social isolation is likely to lead to a decline in physical activity, which could result in immune system dysfunction, thereby increasing infection susceptibility and exacerbating the pathophysiology of conditions that are common among older adults, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory disorders. Older adults and people living with these comorbidities are at a greater risk for complications during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the negative impact of physical inactivity on immune function and showcase evidence that regular physical activity may be an effective strategy to counter some of the deleterious effects of social isolation. Furthermore, we briefly highlight key research questions in exercise immunology, with a focus on older adults in the context of COVID-19. Although it is worth emphasizing that there is no direct evidence that physical activity can prevent or treat ­COVID-19, promoting an active lifestyle is a key intervention to counteract the effects of social isolation, especially in older adults and other at-risk individuals, such as those living with chronic diseases associated with ageing and lifestyle.","Damiot, Anthony; Pinto, Ana Jéssica; Turner, James E.; Gualano, Bruno",Gerontology,330,20

Here, the effects of an approved parenteral glycyrrhizin preparation (Stronger Neo-Minophafen C) were investigated on highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 virus replication, H5N1-induced apoptosis, and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial (A549) cells. Therapeutic glycyrrhizin concentrations substantially inhibited H5N1-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules CXCL10, interleukin 6, CCL2, and CCL5 (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 25 to 50 µg/ml) but interfered with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced apoptosis to a lesser extent (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 100 µg/ml or higher). Glycyrrhizin also diminished monocyte migration towards supernatants of H5N1-infected A549 cells. The mechanism by which glycyrrhizin interferes with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression includes inhibition of H5N1-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and (in turn) reduced activation of NFκB, JNK, and p38, redox-sensitive signalling events known to be relevant for influenza A virus replication. Therefore, glycyrrhizin may complement the arsenal of potential drugs for the treatment of H5N1 disease.","Michaelis, Martin; Geiler, Janina; Naczk, Patrizia; Sithisarn, Patchima; Leutz, Anke; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm; Cinatl, Jindrich",PLoS One,330,1

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15–49 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (≥40 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83–4.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

This study evaluated the utility of a behavioral test for candidate detection dog puppies. Agreement between scores from different observers was high; demonstrating the reliability of the test. Scores based on dogs’ performance in the test were also consistent with scores derived from questionnaires completed by the dog’s trainers; demonstrating the validity of the test’s measures. Finally; puppies’ performance in the test predicted future selection as a working dog as early as three months of age. The results indicate that the behavioral test is useful for evaluating the potential success of detection dog puppies. ABSTRACT: Behavioral characteristics are the most influential factor in the success of a working dog. The need for highly capable detection dogs continues to rise; but reliable methods for early selection are lacking. The current study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of a behavioral test for assessing detection dog suitability. A cohort of candidate detection dog puppies (n = 60) were tested at 3; 5; and 11 months of age; as well as at the completion of training at approximately one year. Tests were designed to assess important detection dog behavioral characteristics such as search ability and fearfulness. Inter-rater reliability was high between independent observers. Convergent validity was demonstrated by comparing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores from the behavior test to trainer ratings using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) and a survey of detection dog traits. Performance on the behavior test predicted adult selection as a detection dog as early as 3 months. The methods reported will be valuable for improving selection measures and enhancing collaborations across breeding programs in order to increase the availability of highly capable detection dogs.,"Lazarowski, Lucia; Rogers, Bart; Krichbaum, Sarah; Haney, Pamela; Smith, Jordan G.; Waggoner, Paul",Animals (Basel),330,22

Adoption may also benefit adoptive mothers, for example they might care for close kin to gain indirect fitness or to learn caregiving behaviours. Here, we report two cases of a wild bonobo adopting an infant from a different social group, the first report of cross-group adoption in great apes. In one case, the adoptive mother was already a mother of two dependent offspring. In the other case, the adoptive mother was an old parous female whose own offspring had already emigrated into a different social group. The adoptive mothers provided various maternal care to the adoptees, such as carrying, grooming, nursing, and sharing food. No aggression was observed by group members towards the out-group adoptees. In both cases, adoptees had no maternal kin-relationship with their adoptive mothers. Both adoptive mothers already had experience of rearing their own offspring. Instead, these cases of adoption may have been driven by other evolutionary adaptive traits of bonobos, such as their strong attraction to infants and high tolerance towards immatures and out-group individuals.","Tokuyama, Nahoko; Toda, Kazuya; Poiret, Marie-Laure; Iyokango, Bahanande; Bakaa, Batuafe; Ishizuka, Shintaro",Sci Rep,330,29

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the immunological phenotype of patients are associated with duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19. METHOD: In this single-center study, 69 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively. Immunological parameters including counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of circulating cytokines and cytokine receptors were screened for their association with disease severity, survival and duration of illness of COVID-19. RESULTS: Our data confirmed previous results that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and circulating levels of IL-6 represent prominent biomarker for the prediction of disease severity and survival of COVID-19. However, this study shows for the first time that duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19 is positively associated with serum levels of IL-8 (P=0.004) and soluble IL-2Rα (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: The significant association of duration of illness with circulating levels of IL-8 and soluble IL-2Rα in patients with severe COVID-19 implicates that neutrophils and T cells are involved in the evolution of COVID-19.","Ma, Aiping; Zhang, Liang; Ye, Xiaokai; Chen, Jing; Yu, Jie; Zhuang, Liangjin; Weng, Chaohang; Petersen, Frank; Wang, Zhanxiang; Yu, Xinhua",Front Immunol,330,16

At their best, the declarations are a first step to address long standing inaction in the face of need. At their worst, the declarations poison or sedate grassroots momentum toward anti-racism structural change by delivering politicians unearned publicity and slowing progress on health equity. Declaring racism as a public health crisis is a tool that must be used with clarity and caution in order to maximize impact. Key to holding public institutions accountable for creating declarations is the direct involvement of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) led groups and organizers. Sharing power, centering their voices and working in tandem, these collaborations ensure that declarations push for change from the lens of those most impacted and authentically engage with the demands of communities and their legacies. Superficial diversity and inclusion efforts that bring BIPOC people and organizers into the conversation and then fail to implement their ideas repeat historical patterns of harm, stall momentum for structural change at best, and poison the strategy at worst.

The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT: In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. Then the sequence similarity is used as the final similarity of receptors according to the prediction results. The 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) are used to assess the prediction performance of our method. We also compare our method with other three competing methods (BRWH, LapRLS, CMF). CONLUSION: The experiment results show that IILLS achieves the AUC values of 0.8675 and 0.9061 with the 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), respectively, which illustrates that IILLS is superior to the competing methods.

Moreover, another aim of this study is to examine gender differences in compliance with 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. Methods: A final sample of 1465 Spanish adolescents (44.50% girls; 13.08 ± 0.86) participated in this cross-sectional study.

We perform comprehensive immunologic evaluation of one individual with prolonged shedding. The case subject recovered from severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA repeatedly as many as 87 days after the first positive test, 97 days after symptom onset. The subject did not have any associated rise in anti-Spike protein antibody titers or plasma neutralization activity, arguing against re-infection. This index subject exhibited a profoundly diminished circulating CD8+ T cell population and correspondingly low SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses when compared with a cohort of other recovering COVID-19 subjects. CD4+ T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses developed as expected in this individual. Our results demonstrate that detectable viral RNA shedding in the upper airway can occur more than 3 months following infection in some individuals with COVID-19 and suggest that impaired CD8+ T cells may play a role in prolonged viral RNA shedding.","Turner, Jackson S.; Day, Aaron; Alsoussi, Wafaa B.; Liu, Zhuoming; O’Halloran, Jane A.; Presti, Rachel M.; Patterson, Bruce K.; Whelan, Sean P.

SARS-CoV-2 possesses an almost 30kbp long genome. The genome contains open-reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene, the largest one of SARS-CoV-2, encoding polyprotein PP1ab and PP1a responsible for viral transcription and replication. Several vaccines have already been approved by the respective authorities over the world to develop herd immunity among the population. In consonance with this effort, RNA interference (RNAi) technology holds the possibility to strengthen the fight against this virus. Here, we have implemented a computational approach to predict potential short interfering RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are presumed to be intrinsically active against SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we have screened miRNA library and siRNA library targeting the ORF1ab gene. We predicted the potential miRNA and siRNA candidate molecules utilizing an array of bioinformatic tools. By extending the analysis, out of 24 potential pre-miRNA hairpins and 131 siRNAs, 12 human miRNA and 10 siRNA molecules were sorted as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 based on their GC content, melting temperature (T(m)), heat capacity (C(p)), hybridization and minimal free energy (MFE) of hybridization. This computational study is focused on lessening the extensive time and labor needed in conventional trial and error based wet lab methods and it has the potential to act as a decent base for future researchers to develop a successful RNAi therapeutic.","Hasan, Mahedi; Ashik, Arafat Islam; Chowdhury, Md Belal; Tasnim, Atiya Tahira; Nishat, Zakia Sultana; Hossain, Tanvir; Ahmed, Shamim",Inform Med Unlocked,330,21

The aim of this paper was to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose–response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose–response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen‐binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to the development of mechanistic dose–response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","Gale, P.; Hill, A.; Kelly, L.; Bassett, J.; McClure, P.; Le Marc, Y.; Soumpasis, I.",J Appl Microbiol,330,26

Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15 342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major β-interferon antagonists. The study provides valuable information for therapeutics and vaccine design, as well as insight into mutation tendencies that could facilitate preventive control.","Tomaszewski, Tre; DeVries, Ryan S; Dong, Mengyi; Bhatia, Gitanshu; Norsworthy, Miles D; Zheng, Xuying; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo",Evol Bioinform Online,330,16

METHODS: Hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were asked to collect two oropharyngeal swabs (SC-OPS1/2), and an additional oropharyngeal swab was collected by a health care professional (HCP-OPS). SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for samples from 58 participants was performed, with a 48-h delay in half of the self-collected samples (SC-OPS2). The sensitivity, probability of concordance, and interrater reliability were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess predictive factors. Practicability was evaluated through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The test sensitivity for HCP-OPS, SC-OPS1, and SC-OPS2 was 88%, 78%, and 77%, respectively. Combining both SC-OPS results increased the estimated sensitivity to 88%. The concordance probability between HCP-OPS and SC-OPS1 was 77.6% and 82.5% between SC-OPS1 and SC-OPS2, respectively. Of the participants, 69% affirmed performing future self-sampling at home, and 34% preferred self-sampling over HCP-guided testing. Participants with both positive HCP-OPS1 and SC-OPS1 indicating no challenges during self-sampling had more differences in viral load levels between HCP-OPS1 and SC-OPS1 than those who indicated challenges. Increasing disease duration and the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG correlated with negative test results in self-collected samples of previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal self-sampling is an applicable testing approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Self-sampling tends to be more effective in early versus late infection and symptom onset, and the collection of two distinct samples is recommended to maintain high test sensitivity.

This study aims to work out potential adjustments of trauma bay algorithms during a global pandemic in order to reduce contamination and to increase safety for patients and medical personnel. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared patients admitted to the trauma bay of one academic level-one trauma centre in March and April 2019 with patients admitted in March and April 2020. Based on these datasets, possible adjustments of the current international guidelines of trauma bay management were discussed. RESULTS: Group Pan (2020, n = 30) included two-thirds the number of patients compared with Group Ref (2019, n = 44). The number of severely injured patients comparable amongst these groups: mean injury severity score (ISS) was significantly lower in Group Pan (10.5 ± 4.4 points) compared with Group Ref (15.3 ± 9.2 points, p = 0.035). Duration from admission to whole-body CT was significantly higher in Group Pan (23.8 ± 9.4 min) compared with Group Ref (17.3 ± 10.7 min, p = 0.046). Number of trauma bay admissions decreased, as did the injury severity for patients admitted in March and April 2020. In order to contain spreading of SARS Cov-2, the suggested recommendations of adjusting trauma bay protocols for severely injured patients include (1) minimizing trauma bay team members with direct contact to the patient; (2) reducing repeated examination as much as possible, with rationalized use of protective equipment; and (3) preventing potential secondary inflammatory insults. CONCLUSION: Appropriate adjustments of trauma bay protocols during pandemics should improve safety for both patients and medical personnel while guaranteeing the optimal treatment quality. The above-mentioned proposals have the potential to improve safety during trauma bay management in a time of a global pandemic.","Halvachizadeh, Sascha; Teuben, Michel; Berk, Till; Neuhaus, Valentin; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Pfeifer, Roman",Int Orthop,330,20

Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding a 15 kDa sandfly (Phlebotomus papatasi) salivary protein (PpSP15) and recombinant nonpathogenic Leishmania tarentolae secreting PpSP15 have been shown to induce protective immunity against Leishmania major in mice, demonstrating that PpSP15 is a promising vaccine candidate. In this study, we developed a fermentation process in yeast with a yield of ~1g PpSP15/L and a scalable purification process consisting of only 2 chromatographic purification steps with high binding capacity for PpSP15, suggesting that PpSP15 can be produced economically. The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the purified PpSP15 indicated that the protein was of high purity (>97%) and conformationally stable between pH 4.4 and 9.0. More importantly, the recombinant protein had a defined structure similar to that of the related PdSP15 from Phlebotomus duboscqi, implying the suitability of the yeast expression system for producing a correctly folded PpSP15.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Nyon, Mun Peak; Poongavanam, Mohan V.; Liu, Zhuyun; Biter, Amadeo B.; Kundu, Rakhi T.; Strych, Ulrich; Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",J Pharm Sci,330,17

Confined to their homes, despite recent relaxation of mobility and travel sanctions, many people find comfort and psychological reassurance in plant tending and gardening. Plants have been known for their medicinal and recreational purposes and their psychological therapeutic value. In the case of the Philippines, plant parenting has become a viral phenomenon.","Rivas, Virgilio A; Biana, Hazel T",J. public health (Oxf),330,20

Most research on cost-related abortion barriers relies on clinic-based samples, but people who desire abortions may never make it to a healthcare center. To examine a novel, pre-abortion population, we analyzed a unique qualitative dataset of posts from Reddit, a widely used social media platform increasingly leveraged by researchers, to assess financial obstacles among anonymous posters considering abortion. Methods: In February 2020, we used Python to web-scrape the 250 most recent posts that mentioned abortion, removing all identifying information and usernames. After transferring all posts into NVivo, a qualitative software package, the team identified all datapoints related to cost. Three qualitatively trained evaluators established and applied codes, reaching saturation after 194 posts. The research team used a descriptive qualitative approach, using both inductive and deductive elements, to identify and analyze themes related to financial barriers. Results: We documented multiple cost-related deterrents, including lack of funds for both the procedure and attendant travel costs, inability to afford desired abortion modality (i.e., medication or surgical), and for some, consideration of self-managed abortion options due to cost barriers. Conclusions: Findings from this study underscore the centrality of cost barriers and third-party payer restrictions to stymying reproductive health access in the United States. Results may contribute to the growing evidence base and building political momentum focused on repealing the Hyde Amendment.","Higgins, Jenny A.; Lands, Madison; Valley, Taryn M.; Carpenter, Emma; Jacques, Laura",Int J Environ Res Public Health,330,28
