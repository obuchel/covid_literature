1952,1952,1952,Discordant identification of pediatric severe sepsis by research and clinical definitions in the SPROUT international point prevalence study,18.918707,11.53209,2015-09-16,"INTRODUCTION: Consensus criteria for pediatric severe sepsis have standardized enrollment for research studies. However, the extent to which critically ill children identified by consensus criteria reflect physician diagnosis of severe sepsis, which underlies external validity for pediatric sepsis research, is not known. We sought to determine the agreement between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria to identify pediatric patients with severe sepsis across a network of international pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). METHODS: We conducted a point prevalence study involving 128 PICUs in 26 countries across 6 continents. Over the course of 5 study days, 6925 PICU patients <18 years of age were screened, and 706 with severe sepsis defined either by physician diagnosis or on the basis of 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference consensus criteria were enrolled. The primary endpoint was agreement of pediatric severe sepsis between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria as measured using Cohen’s κ. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and clinical outcomes for patients identified using physician diagnosis versus consensus criteria. RESULTS: Of the 706 patients, 301 (42.6 %) met both definitions. The inter-rater agreement (κ ± SE) between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria was 0.57 ± 0.02. Of the 438 patients with a physician’s diagnosis of severe sepsis, only 69 % (301 of 438) would have been eligible to participate in a clinical trial of pediatric severe sepsis that enrolled patients based on consensus criteria. Patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis who did not meet consensus criteria were younger and had lower severity of illness and lower PICU mortality than those meeting consensus criteria or both definitions. After controlling for age, severity of illness, number of comorbid conditions, and treatment in developed versus resource-limited regions, patients identified with severe sepsis by physician diagnosis alone or by consensus criteria alone did not have PICU mortality significantly different from that of patients identified by both physician diagnosis and consensus criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Physician diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis achieved only moderate agreement with consensus criteria, with physicians diagnosing severe sepsis more broadly. Consequently, the results of a research study based on consensus criteria may have limited generalizability to nearly one-third of PICU patients diagnosed with severe sepsis.

This study aims to evaluate the rate of both colonisations and infections related to ECMO devices at the time of ECMO removal. RESULTS: We included all consecutive adult patients treated with venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO) for at least 48 h during a 34-month study. At the time of ECMO removal, blood cultures, swab cultures on insertion cannula site and intravascular cannula extremity cultures were systematically performed. Each ECMO device was classified according to the infectious status into three groups: (1) uninfected/uncolonised ECMO device, (2) ECMO device colonisation and (3) ECMO device infection. Ninety-nine patients underwent 103 VV-ECMO, representing 1472 ECMO days. The ECMO device infection rate was 9.7% (10 events), including 7 ECMO device-related bloodstream infections (6.8%). The ECMO device colonisation rate was 32% (33 events). No difference was observed between the three groups, regarding days of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality. We observed a longer ECMO duration in the ECMO device colonisation group as compared to the uninfected/uncolonised ECMO device group [12 (9–20 days) vs. 5 days (5–16 days), respectively, p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of ECMO removal, systematic blood culture and intravascular extremity cannula culture may help to diagnose ECMO device-related infection. We reported a quite low infection rate related to ECMO device. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of systematic strategies of cannula culture at the time of ECMO removal.

This study is to explore the efficiency of anti-C5a–based intervention on systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat poisoning. DESIGN: Study of cynomolgus macaque model and plasma from paraquat-poisoning patients. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Cynomolgus macaque (n = 12) and samples of plasma from patients (n = 16). INTERVENTIONS: The neutralizing antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was administered to investigate the new treatment strategy for paraquat-induced systemic inflammatory responses in cynomolgus macaque model. In addition, C5a activation in plasma of paraquat patients was blocked by IFX-1 to investigate the blockade role of anti-C5a antibody in activation of inflammatory cells. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Dysregulated complement activation and the subsequent cytokine storm were found in patients with acute lung injury and in a primate model of paraquat poisoning. Targeted inhibition of C5a by IFX-1 led to marked alleviation of systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ damage in the primate model. In addition, blockade of C5a activity in plasma from patients completely inhibited activation of CD11b on blood granulocytes from normal donors, suggesting that IFX-1 may alleviate the excessive activation of inflammatory responses and have clinical utility for patients with acute lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-C5a antibodies such as IFX-1 may be used as effective therapeutics for treatment of those suffering from systemic inflammatory responses induced by chemical poisoning like paraquat.","Sun, Shihui; Jiang, Yuting; Wang, Renxi; Liu, Chenfeng; Liu, Xiaoling; Song, Nianping; Guo, Yan; Guo, Renfeng; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Yan; Qiu, Zewu; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhou, Yusen",Crit Care Med,329,12

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted across 148 Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain. RESULTS: Primary viral pneumonia was present in 733 ICU patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection with severe respiratory failure. Macrolide-based treatment was administered to 190 (25.9 %) patients. Patients who received macrolides had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease more often, lower severity on admission (APACHE II score on ICU admission (13.1 ± 6.8 vs. 14.4 ± 7.4 points, p < 0.05), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome less often (23.4 vs. 30.1 %, p < 0.05). Length of ICU stay in survivors was not significantly different in patients who received macrolides compared to patients who did not (10 (IQR 4–20) vs. 10 (IQR 5–20), p = 0.9). ICU mortality was 24.1 % (n = 177). Patients with macrolide-based treatment had lower ICU mortality in the univariate analysis (19.2 vs. 28.1 %, p = 0.02); however, a propensity score analysis showed no effect of macrolide-based treatment on ICU mortality (OR = 0.87; 95 % CI 0.55–1.37, p = 0.5). Moreover, the sensitivity analysis revealed very similar results (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.58–1.44, p = 0.7). A separate analysis of patients under mechanical ventilation yielded similar results (OR = 0.77; 95 % CI 0.44–1.35, p = 0.4). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that macrolide-based treatment was not associated with improved survival in critically ill H1N1 patients with primary viral pneumonia.","Martín-Loeches, I.; Bermejo-Martin, J.

Influenza A/H5N1, in particular, has repeatedly caused human infections associated with high mortality, and since 1998 the virus has evolved into many clades of variants with significant antigenic diversity. In 2013, three (A/H7N9, A/H6N1, and A/H10N8) novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) breached the animal-human host species barrier in Asia. In humans, roughly 35% of A/H7N9-infected patients succumbed to the zoonotic infection, and two of three A/H10N8 human infections were also lethal; however, neither of these viruses cause influenza-like symptoms in poultry. While most of these cases were associated with direct contact with infected poultry, some involved sustained human-to-human transmission. Thus, these events elicited concern regarding potential AIV pandemics. This article reviews the human incursions associated with AIV variants and the potential role of pigs as an intermediate host that may hasten AIV evolution. In addition, we discuss the known influenza A virus virulence and transmission factors and their evaluation in animal models. With the growing number of human AIV infections, constant vigilance for the emergence of novel viruses is of utmost importance. In addition, careful characterization and pathobiological assessment of these novel variants will help to identify strains of particular concern for future pandemics.","Kim, Se Mi; Kim, Young-Il; Pascua, Philippe Noriel Q.; Choi, Young Ki",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,329,12

In light of their designability and functionability, the fluorescent nanoparticles are widely used as the fluorescent probes for diverse applications. To enhance the sensitivity and selectivity, the combination of the fluorescent nanoparticles with the molecularly imprinted polymer, i.e. molecularly imprinted fluorescent nanoparticles (MIFN), was an effective way. The sensor based on MIFN (the MIFN sensor) could be more compatible with the complex sample matrix, which was especially widely adopted in medical and biological analysis. In this mini-review, the construction method, detective mechanism and types of MIFN sensors are elaborated. The current applications of MIFN sensors in pharmaceutical analysis, including pesticides/herbicide, veterinary drugs/drugs residues and human related proteins, are highlighted based on the literature in the recent three years. Finally, the research prospect and development trend of the MIFN sensor are forecasted.","Wang, Yi-fan; Pan, Meng-meng; Yu, Xu; Xu, Li",Curr Med Sci,329,26

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as O(3) adaptation. Whether or not a “state” of adaptation develops due to long-term low level O(3) exposure is unknown. Two human studies have reported adaptation in subjects living in Los Angeles during periods when ambient O(3) concentrations have been relatively high. At present, however, we are not aware of comparable information from rats. This study assessed O(3) adaptation in rats following chronic (12 or 18 months) exposure and after a 4-month recovery period. A chronic exposure pattern, similar to that found in an urban area during the summer (0.06 ppm O(3) for 13 hr/day, 7 days/week; Monday–Friday, peak to 0.25 ppm O(3), over 9 hr), was used. To assess whether adaptation had occurred and/or persisted, awake rats were challenged with high provocative concentrations of O(3) for up to 2 hr. During a challenge, rats were monitored for typical O(3)-induced alterations in spontaneous breathing parameters (e.g., increase in breathing frequency and decrease in tidal volume). Adaptation was defined as attenuation of breathing response during the challenge in rats chronically exposed to O(3) as compared to that in “control” rats (chronically exposed to air). Adaptation was found in the rats within 8 hr following the chronic O(3) exposure but not after the 4-month recovery period. Spontaneous breathing parameters that were significantly attenuated in the chronically exposed rats were breathing frequency, tidal volume, inspiratory and expiratory times, and maximum expiratory flow. We conclude that rats demonstrated adaptation to O(3) after long-term exposure to an urban-type O(3) profile and that the adaptation was not seen 4 months postexpo-sure. These results suggest that exposure to environmental O(3) in Los Angeles air may have been responsible for the adaptation found in residential subjects.","WIESTER, M. J.; TEPPER, J. S.; DOERFLER, D.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Online survey of participants with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer who had received chemotherapy within the past 12 months and experienced ≥1 episode of CIM in the past year. Participants were asked to answer close-ended questions and provide qualitative responses to: “In your own words, please describe how side effects from myelosuppression have impacted your life.” RESULTS: Among 301 survey participants, fatigue was the most frequently reported side effect of chemotherapy; 55% of participants rated fatigue as highly bothersome (9 or 10 on a 1–10 scale of “bothersomeness”). Participants rated symptoms associated with CIM, including fatigue, weakened immune system (infections), bleeding and/or bruising, and shortness of breath, as being as bothersome as other side effects of chemotherapy, including alopecia, neuropathy, and nausea/vomiting. Overall, 24–43% of participants thought that CIM and its symptoms had a negative impact on their daily lives, including their ability to complete tasks at home and work, and to socialize. Qualitative responses supported these findings; participants highlighted that CIM-related symptoms, particularly fatigue and fear of infections, affected their ability to be physically active, complete work, or continue meaningful relationships with friends and family. CONCLUSION: Participants described a real-world impact of CIM that often isolates them from family and friends, and means that they are unable to work or perform tasks of daily living. Using measures that help patients to recognize and communicate the signs and symptoms of CIM might increase the likelihood of maintaining daily lives as close to normal as possible, during and after chemotherapy treatment.","Epstein, Robert S; Basu Roy, Upal K; Aapro, Matti; Salimi, Tehseen; Moran, Donald; Krenitsky, JoAnn; Leone-Perkins, Megan L; Girman, Cynthia; Schlusser, Courtney; Crawford, Jeffrey",Patient Prefer Adherence,329,31

Although several computational approaches have been developed to elucidate the interactions of cross-species miRNAs and their targets in mammals, the number of verified plant miRNAs is still limited, and the biological roles of most exogenous plant miRNAs remain unknown. METHODS: A miRNA mimic library-based phenotypic screening, which contained 8394 plant mature miRNAs published in the official database miRbase, was performed to identify more novel bioactive plant miRNAs for the prevention of hepatic fibrosis. Inhibition of candidates for the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the underlying mechanisms were evaluated in TGF-β1- and PDGF-exposed HSC models. The protective effects of the candidates against CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis were evaluated in a mouse model. RESULTS: Among the 8394 plant mature miRNAs reported in the official database miRBase, five candidates were found to effectively inhibit the differentiation of HSCs. gma-miR-159a (miR159a) exerted the strongest inhibitory activities on both TGF-β1- and PDGF-induced HSC activation and proliferation by inhibiting the GSK-3β-mediated NF-κB and TGF-β1 pathways. Moreover, miR159a was mainly accumulated in the liver after intravenous injection, and it reduced CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in mice. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that miR159a has the therapeutic potential for preventing hepatic fibrosis. This study provides a novel strategy for achieving natural nucleic acid drugs.","Yu, Wen-Ying; Cai, Wei; Ying, Hua-Zhong; Zhang, Wen-You; Zhang, Huan-Huan; Yu, Chen-Huan",J Inflamm Res,329,12

Transmission follows a human-mosquito-human cycle starting with a mosquito bite. Subsequently, symptoms develop after 2–6 days of incubation, including high fever and severe arthralgia. The disease is self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks. However, chronic disease can last up to several years with persistent polyarthralgia. Overlapping symptoms and common vector with dengue and malaria present many challenges for diagnosis and treatment of this disease. CHIKF was reported in India in 1963 for the first time. After a period of quiescence lasting up to 32 years, CHIKV re-emerged in India in 2005. Currently, every part of the country has become endemic for the disease with outbreaks resulting in huge economic and productivity losses. Several mutations have been identified in circulating strains of the virus resulting in better adaptations or increased fitness in the vector(s), effective transmission, and disease severity. CHIKV evolution has been a significant driver of epidemics in India, hence, the need to focus on proper surveillance, and implementation of prevention and control measure in the country.

Clarifying levels of food security and the factors affecting it (social, economic, agricultural, climatic) can help improve regional food security. The spatiotemporal patterns and driving factors of food security vary at different scales. There is, however, a lack of research that considers the various factors affecting food security at multiple scales. This study, therefore, analyzed dynamic spatiotemporal changes in food security at small (city), medium (province), and large (country) scales; identified hot and cold areas of food security; and revealed the main factors affecting food security at different scales. A food security index (FSI) was built based on the coupling of grain yield, population, and GDP, and spatial analysis was used to evaluate dynamic spatiotemporal changes in China’s food security from 1980 to 2017. Further, the relationship between food security and its driving factors was quantitatively analyzed using stepwise regression. The results showed greater heterogeneity in food security at the smaller scale than at the larger scale. The key factors affecting food security varied substantially at different scales: the added value of tertiary industry dominated the prefecture level, and gross agricultural output value was the main factor at the provincial and national levels. Multiple-scale research can reveal the status and primary factors of food security and provide a decision-making basis for improving regional food security.","Lv, Furong; Deng, Longyun; Zhang, Zhengtao; Wang, Zheye; Wu, Quanyuan; Qiao, Jianmin",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,329,12

Such unstructured clinical notes recorded by medical personnel can also be a potential source of rich patient-specific information which can be leveraged to build CDSSs, even for hospitals in developing countries. If such unstructured clinical text can be used, the manual and time-consuming process of EHR generation will no longer be required, with huge person-hours and cost savings. In this article, we propose a generic ICD9 disease group prediction CDSS built on unstructured physician notes modeled using hybrid word embeddings. These word embeddings are used to train a deep neural network for effectively predicting ICD9 disease groups. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art disease group prediction model built on structured EHRs by 15% in terms of AUROC and 40% in terms of AUPRC, thus proving our hypothesis and eliminating dependency on availability of structured patient data.","Krishnan, Gokul S.; Kamath, S.

However, traditional biological experiments are expensive and time-consuming. In this study, we proposed a novel method named BWHCDA, which applied bi-random walk algorithm on the heterogeneous network for predicting circRNA-disease associations. First, circRNA regulatory similarity is measured based on circRNA-miRNA interactions, and circRNA similarity is calculated by the average of circRNA regulatory similarity and Gaussian interaction profiles (GIP) kernel similarity for circRNAs. Similarly, disease similarity is the mean of disease semantic similarity and GIP kernel similarity for diseases. Then, the heterogeneous network is constructed by integrating circRNA network, disease network via circRNA-disease associations. Subsequently, the bi-random walk algorithm is implemented on the heterogeneous network to predict circRNA-disease associations. Finally, we utilize leave-one-out cross validation and 10-fold cross validation frameworks to evaluate the prediction performance of BWHCDA method and obtain AUC of 0.9334 and 0.8764 ± 0.0038, respectively. Moreover, the predicted hsa_circ_0000519-gastric cancer association is analyzed. Results show that BWHCDA could be an effective resource for clinical experimental guidance.","Fan, Chunyan; Lei, Xiujuan; Tan, Ying",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,329,1

Using recent survey data (N = 5059), results suggest that PLHIV reported more core network members than their peers without HIV (IRR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03, 1.13), but were equally likely to receive emotional support from network members (1.21; 95% CI 0.93, 1.58). PLHIV who had yet to disclose their serostatus were more likely than others to have friends and other non-kin in their core network (B 0.08; 95% CI 0.02, 0.13) and to maintain networks of non-overlapping members (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.33, 3.34). Even as HIV remains highly stigmatized in South Africa, PLHIV tend to maintain relatively large and supportive networks. Still, a sizeable proportion of PLHIV do not disclose their illness—these individuals disproportionately inhabit networks marked by non-kin and by high bridging potential.","Schafer, Markus H.; Upenieks, Laura; DeMaria, Julia",AIDS Behav,329,1

Forced suction may produce disturbingly loud noise, which acts as a nonnegligible stressor. Especially, in emergency situations with heavy bleeding, this loud noise has been described as an impeding factor in the medical decision-making process. In addition, there are reports of inner ear damage in patients due to suction noises during operations in the head area. These problems have not been solved yet. The purpose of this study was to analyse flow-dependent suction noise effects of different surgical suction tips. Furthermore, we developed design improvements to these devices. Methods We compared five different geometries of suction tips using an in vitro standardised setup. Two commercially available standard suction tips were compared to three adapted new devices regarding their flow-dependent (10-2000 mL/min) noise emission (dB, weighting filter (A), distance 10 cm) and acoustic quality of resulting noises (Hamilton fast Fourier analysis) during active suction at the liquid-air boundary. Noise maps at different flow rates were created for all five suction devices, and the proportion of extracted air was measured. The geometries of the three custom-made suction tips (new models 1, 2, and 3) were designed considering the insights after determining the key characteristics of the two standard suction models. Results The geometry of a suction device tip has significant impact on its noise emission. For the standard models, the frequency spectrum at higher flow rates significantly changes to high-frequency noise patterns (>3 kHz). A number of small side holes designed to prevent tissue adhesion lead to increased levels of high-frequency noise. Due to modifications of the tip geometry in our new models, we are able to achieve a highly significant reduction of noise level at low flow rates (new model 2 vs. standard models p < 0.001) and also the acoustic quality improved. Additionally, we attain a highly significant reduction of secondary air intake (new model 2 vs. the other models p < 0.001). Conclusion Improving flow-relevant features of the geometry of suction heads is a suitable way to reduce noise emissions. Optimized suction tips are significantly quieter. This may help us to reduce noise-induced hearing damage in patients as well as stress of medical staff during surgery and should lead to quieter operation theatres overall. Furthermore, the turbulence reduction and reduced secondary air intake during the suction process are expected to result in protective effects on the collected blood and thus could improve the quality of autologous blood retransfusions. We are on the way to evaluate potential benefits.","Friedrich, M G; Tirilomis, T; Kollmeier, J M; Wang, Y; Hanekop, G G",Surgery research and practice,329,20

The aim of this study was to investigate which factors are related to weight regain in the long-term after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS A retrospective case-control study with 40 patients undergoing SG (32 women, 8 men; age 42.9 ± 10.7 y; preoperative body mass index 35 ± 2.8 kg/m(2)), was performed. Patients were grouped according percentile->50% (cases) or <50% (controls)-of weight regain (%WR cutoff: 25% of weight loss). Weight history, anthropometry, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), thyroid-stimulating hormone, resting energy expenditure, body composition, dietary survey, psychological test, and physical activity were recorded. Residual gastric capacity was estimated using a radiologic method. RESULTS (MEDIAN [P25-P75]): The evaluation was conducted 38.5 mo (34-41 mo) after SG. Percent weight regain ranged from 2.7% to 129.2% (25.4% [13-37.1]). Patients in the higher %WR group had a greater residual gastric volume (252.7 ± 108.4 versus 148.5 ± 25.3; P < 0.05) and the estimated volume was significantly correlated with %WR (r = 0.673; P = 0.023). Significantly higher body mass index (P = 0.001), resting energy expenditure (P = 0.04), fasting insulin (P = 0.01), and HOMA-IR (P = 0.02) were observed in the higher %WR group. A higher fat intake and a trend toward higher total energy intake were observed in the group with greater %WR. Clinical or borderline levels of anxiety were more frequently observed in the higher %WR group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Results from the present study demonstrated that the most important factor associated with long-term weight regain after SG was residual gastric volume. Additional prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are necessary to confirm our results.","Alvarez, Veronica; Carrasco, Fernando; Cuevas, Ada; Valenzuela, Barbara; Muñoz, Giselle; Ghiardo, Daniela; Burr, Maria; Lehmann, Yael; Leiva, Maria J; Berry, Marcos; Maluenda, Fernando",Nutrition,329,33

If an investigator engages in a systematic investigation designed or intended to contribute to generalizable knowledge, then he or she is engaged in research. If that research involves living individuals and the investigator will either interact or intervene with people or obtain their identifiable personal information, then the research must be prospectively reviewed by an institutional review board (IRB), a federally mandated committee that ensures the ethical and regulatory appropriateness of proposed research. In public health institutions, and especially at state departments of health, this definition of research may prove vexing for determining when particular public health activities must be reviewed by IRBs. This article outlines several reasons for such vexation and 2 key responses from major public health stakeholders. In the current climate of public health preparedness initiatives at state health departments for disasters and bioterrorism, how research is defined vis-à-vis public health interventions may add even more confusion to preparedness initiatives and pose difficulties in determining when IRB review and the added protections it affords are appropriate. This article suggests several practical ways to avoid confusion and attempts to strike a balance between the need for expeditious approvals of research-based responses to public health disasters and to ensure proper protections for human subjects at state health departments. It is hoped that these suggestions can assist not only state health departments but also academically based researchers who either collaborate with those departments or whose research will need to be reviewed by their IRBs.","Perlman, David",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,329,24

However, the clinical benefits of glue mesh fixation are still controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the acute pain, chronic pain, and recurrence rate between these two fixation methods. METHODS After reviewing all patients in our prospective hernia repair database from February 2008 to December 2017, we identified 583 patients who underwent TEP with tack mesh fixation and 70 patients with glue fixation by a single surgeon. Acute post-operative pain and activity level were evaluated using a Visual Analog Score (VAS) and the modified Medical Outcome Study (MOS) score. The primary endpoint was chronic pain 6 months after TEP. The secondary endpoints were acute pain, activity level, complications, and recurrence. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the glue mesh fixation had significant lower VAS at 2 h post operation during rest and coughing and on the first day after surgery during coughing (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, and p = 0.011). The modified MOS on the first day was higher in the glue group (p < 0.001). There were no reduced risk of chronic pain or increased risk of recurrence for the glue group compared to the tack group [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.237, p = 0.169; OR = 2.498, p = 0.299]. In the sub-group analysis for recurrent hernia repair, glue fixation is associated with better modified MOS (p = 0.031) on first day and lower VAS on the operative day and first day at rest (p = 0.003 and p = 0.024) after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Glue fixation method was superior to tack fixation method in acute post-operative pain and early post-operative activity level after laparoscopic TEP repair. However, both fixation methods had similar incidence of chronic pain-, recurrence-, and procedure-related complications after laparoscopic TEP repair.","Yu, Chih-Chin; Chen, Yung-Tai; Huang, Ching-Shui; Chueh, Shih-Chieh J; Lo, Chi-Wen; Tsai, Yao-Chou",Surgical endoscopy,329,30

The authors have pioneered a two-trocar SILC technique at the University of Texas Southwestern. Their results for 100 patients are presented. METHODS From January 2008 to March 2009, 100 patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease underwent SILC through a 1.5- to 2-cm umbilical incision using a two-port (5-mm) technique. For nearly all the patients, a 30 degrees angled scope was used. The gallbladder was retracted, with two or three sutures placed along the gallbladder. These sutures were either fixated internally or placed through the abdominal wall to obtain a critical view of Calot's triangle. The SILC procedure was performed using standard technique with 5-mm reticulating or conventional laparoscopic instruments. The cystic duct and artery were well visualized, clipped, and divided. Cholecystectomy was completed with electrocautery, and the specimen was retrieved through the umbilical incision. RESULTS In this series, 80 women (85%) and 15 men (15%) with an average age of 33.8 years (range, 17-66 years) underwent SILC. Their mean BMI was 29.8 kg/m(2) (range, 17-42.5 kg/m(2)), and 39% of these patients had undergone previous abdominal surgery. The mean operative time was 50.8 min (range, 23-120 min). The mean estimated blood loss was 22.3 ml (range, 5-125 ml), and 5% of the patients had an intraoperative cholangiogram. There were no conversions of the SILC technique. A two-trocar technique was feasible for 87% of the patients. For the remaining patients, either a three-channel port or three individual trocars were required. A SILC technique was used for 5% of the patients to manage acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis. CONCLUSION The SILC technique with a two-trocar technique is safe, feasible, and reproducible. The operating times are reasonable and can be lessened with experience. Even complex cases can be managed with this technique. Excellent exposure of the critical view was obtained in all cases. The SILC procedure is becoming the standard of care for most of the authors' elective patients with gallbladder disease. Clinical trials are warranted before the SILC technique is adopted universally.","Rivas, Homero; Varela, Esteban; Scott, Daniel",Surgical endoscopy,329,16

Phlebovirus glycoproteins (GP) play a key role in targeting viral structural components to the budding compartments in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi complex. However, the role of SFTSV GP in targeting structural proteins to the ERGIC and Golgi complex remains unresolved. In this study, we show that SFTSV GP plays a significant role in targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) to the budding sites. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular localization of SFTSV structural proteins. In SFTSV-infected cells, GP and L localized to the ER, ERGIC and Golgi complex, whereas NP localized to the ERGIC and Golgi complex. In addition, GP colocalized with L and NP in infected cells. In cells singly transfected with GP, L or NP, GP localized to the same subcellular compartments as in infected cells. However, L or NP alone did not localize to the ER, ERGIC, or Golgi complex. Cotransfection experiments showed that GP altered the localization of L to the ERGIC and Golgi complex but not that of NP. Interestingly, plasmid-expressed NP fused with a hemagglutinin tag localized to the ERGIC and Golgi complex when expressed in SFTSV-infected cells and colocalised with GP, suggesting that GP plays a role in the subcellular localization of L and NP in infected cells. Thus, the SFTSV structural components start to assemble at the ERGIC to Golgi complex. GP is required for transporting L and NP to the ERGIC and Golgi complex. In addition, targeting of NP requires interaction with other factors besides GP.","Lundu, Tapiwa; Tsuda, Yoshimi; Ito, Ryo; Shimizu, Kenta; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Yoshii, Kentaro; Yoshimatsu, Kumiko; Arikawa, Jiro; Kariwa, Hiroaki",Biomedical research,329,0

Therefore, knowledge about the effect of vaccination in this specific group is limited. This information is essential to empower lactating women to make a well-informed decision on their choice for vaccination. After natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in human milk, which might offer protection for her newborn. The dynamics of these antibodies in human milk following vaccination remain to be elucidated. RESEARCH AIM To determine the effect of vaccination with BNT162b2 on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk. METHODS In this prospective longitudinal study, we included lactating women who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Human milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after both vaccine doses. Samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS In total, 366 human milk samples from 26 lactating women were analyzed. A biphasic response was observed, with SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) starting to increase between day 5 and 7 after the first dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, an accelerated IgA antibody response was observed. CONCLUSION After vaccination with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response was observed in human milk. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA after vaccination is important as antibodies are transferred via human milk, and thereby might provide protection to infants against COVID-19.","Juncker, Hannah G; Mulleners, Sien J; van Gils, Marit J; de Groot, Christianne J M; Pajkrt, Dasja; Korosi, Aniko; van Goudoever, Johannes B; van Keulen, Britt J",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,329,19

Measures of defect optical density and volumetric data including bone density (BD), bone volume (BV) and bone mass (BM) were compared with qualitative data involving visual appraisal of radiographs [% bridging callus and modified radiographic union score tibia (mRUST)] and a clinical outcome measure (locomotory function). Percent bridging callus and mRUST measures displayed strong correlation (r = 0.999), while locomotory function was weakly correlated with bridging callus (r = 0.029) and mRUST (r = 0.046). There was moderate to strong correlation between the qualitative and quantitative data. Bone density, BV and BM showed strong correlations within this dataset (BD-BV, r = 0.814; BD-BM, r = 0.818; BV-BM, r = 1.000). Likewise, optical density measures were strongly correlated with BD (r = 0.824), BV (r = 0.957) and BM (r = 0.959).

However, previous studies have not compared B-mode sonographic images (BSIs) and EBUS elastography images (EEIs) with final pathological diagnoses in radiologically normal-sized (computed tomography [CT]-negative) LNs. METHODS Consecutive patients with CT-negative LNs, who received EBUS-TBNA, were retrospectively reviewed. Images of BSIs and EEIs of each LN were stored and independently evaluated. EEIs were assessed by calculating the stiffness area ratio (SAR, blue/overall areas). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to calculate the cutoff value for the SAR. Diagnostic test parameters were evaluated for each EBUS finding. RESULTS A total of 132 patients (149 LNs) were enrolled, and the median SAR of malignant LNs was significantly higher than that of benign LNs (0.58 vs. 0.32, P < 0.001). At the SAR cutoff of 0.41, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy rate (DAR) of elastography were 88.2%, 80.2%, 78.9%, 89.0%, and 83.9%, respectively.

The highest NPV (96.6%) was achieved with a combination of BSIs and EEIs. CONCLUSIONS EBUS elastography predicted malignant LNs with a high DAR and NPV in CT-negative LNs. The NPV was highest when EEIs were combined with BSIs. Therefore, the combined evaluation of CT-negative LNs using EEIs and BSIs may help bronchoscopists perform EBUS-TBNA more efficiently. KEY POINTS SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Endobronchial ultrasound elastography accurately predicted malignancy with a high diagnostic accuracy rate and negative predictive value in radiologically normal-sized lymph nodes. The additional use of B-mode sonographic features resulted in a higher negative predictive value. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Endobronchial ultrasound elastography can guide the accurate collection of specimens with transbronchial needle aspiration, even in radiologically normal-sized lymph nodes. It can also readily distinguish benign and malignant lymph nodes, thus avoiding unnecessary punctures.","Uchimura, Keigo; Yamasaki, Kei; Sasada, Shinji; Hara, Sachika; Ikushima, Issei; Chiba, Yosuke; Tachiwada, Takashi; Kawanami, Toshinori; Yatera, Kazuhiro",Thoracic cancer,329,17

Therefore, recognizing and treating the cardiovascular sign and symptoms that caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be effective in reducing patient mortality. To control the COVID-19-related cardiovascular symptoms, natural products are considered one of the promising choices as complementary medicine. Scientists are struggling to discover new antiviral agents specific to this virus. In this review, the natural products for management of cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 are categorized into three groups: (a) natural products with an impact on angiotensin II type 1 receptor; (b) natural products that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme activity; and (c) natural products that mimic adenosine activity. All these natural products should undergo clinical investigations to test their efficacy, safety, and toxicity in the treatment of cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19. This article summarizes agents with potential efficacy against COVID-19-related cardiovascular symptoms.","Mohammadi Pour, Pardis; Farzaei, Mohammad Hosein; Soleiman Dehkordi, Ebrahim; Bishayee, Anupam; Asgary, Sedigheh",Phytotherapy research : PTR,329,16

We tested the psychometric properties of a new instrument designed to assess the extent and types of pandemic-related stress experienced by pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS 4,451 pregnant women from across the U.S. were recruited via social media and completed an online questionnaire in April-May 2020. The questionnaire included measures of psychological, sociodemographic, and obstetric factors and the new Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). RESULTS Confirmatory factor analyses of the PREPS showed excellent model fit. Three factors - Perinatal Infection Stress (5 items), Preparedness Stress (7 items), and Positive Appraisal (3 items) - converged and diverged with expected psychological factors, and scales created from these factors demonstrated acceptable to good reliability (α's 0.68-0.86). In addition, mean PREPS scores were associated with perceived risk of infection, and with financial and vocational COVID-19 related burdens. CONCLUSION The PREPS is a robust instrument to assess multidimensional COVID-19 pandemic prenatal stress. It is a valuable tool for future research to examine vulnerability to pandemic stress and how this stress may affect women and their offspring.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,329,5

In order to measure the effectiveness of interventions and patient experience, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are frequently used. The aim of the scoping review was to identify footwear item content within foot-specific PROMs and PREMs used in people with arthritis. METHOD Original articles which developed or validated a footwear inclusive PROM or PREM for use in people with arthritis affecting the foot were included. A comprehensive search was conducted using AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Ovid Emcare and Embase. A content analysis of extracted footwear content items was performed, by coding item content and grouping into broad themes, then further narrowing down and defining themes under five main categories. RESULTS Nineteen articles satisfied inclusion criteria for this scoping exercise. Eleven PROMs met the inclusion criteria, five of which were designed for use in disease-specific populations (rheumatoid arthritis and gout) and six designed for generic populations. Categories of the footwear specific content from the PROMs included pain, impairment and function, shoe specific characteristics and psychosocial aspects. None of the included PROMs assessed footwear satisfaction. Eight PREMs relating to footwear experiences were identified. Seven of the PREMs were disease-specific (Inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis) and one was generic. Content of the footwear-related items of the included PREMs were categorised under pain, impairment and function, footwear satisfaction and shoe specific characteristics. None of the PREM studies reported on psychosocial aspects of footwear. CONCLUSIONS Many different instruments have been used to measure the experience of footwear in patients with arthritis. However, no comprehensive tool which evaluates footwear and its relationship with pain, impairment and disability, the psychosocial aspects of footwear, specific footwear features and satisfaction is currently available for use in people with arthritis.","Tehan, Peta Ellen; Carroll, Matthew; Dalbeth, Nicola; Rome, Keith","PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",329,1

METHODS A systematic literature search was performed on 16 April 2019 using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science to conduct a scoping review. Included studies were summarized with regard to the quantity of research, the study designs, aims, populations and themes RESULTS: From 3406 records, we included 23 studies about everyday life and illness management among people with coexisting type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Four studies were qualitative (observations, interviews and focus groups), and 19 were quantitative (observational and interventions) and used questionnaires. Five themes emerged in the findings: (1) diet and exercise, but not other diabetes self-care activities, are consistently compromised in the target group; (2) psychiatric exacerbation diminishes diabetes self-care; (3) social support and high self-efficacy improve diabetes self-care; (4) use of healthcare services is compromised; and (5) quality of life and well-being is poor. CONCLUSIONS The limited research into the studied population's experiences with coexisting type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness is characterized by its heterogeneity in aims and methods and a strong focus on diabetes management and treatment. Further research focusing on the management of both conditions in everyday life is needed to improve specialized and integrated care targeting the population.","Rønne, S T; Zabell, V; Joensen, L E; Jørgensen, R; Gaede, P H; Arnfred, S M Hemmingsen",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,329,7

Furthermore, conventional meta-analyses are unable to test possible effects of moderators affecting this relationship. This protocol outlines the building of a comprehensive database of the literature in this research field. In addition, we will conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) to establish the effectiveness of psychotherapy in reducing suicidality, and to examine which factors moderate the efficacy of these interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To build a comprehensive database, randomised controlled trials examining the effect of any psychotherapy targeting any psychiatric disorder on suicidal thoughts or behaviour will be identified by running a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from data inception to 12 August 2019. For the IPD-MA, we will focus on adult outpatients with suicidal ideation or behaviour. In addition, as a comparison group we will focus on a control group (waiting-list, care as usual or placebo). A 1-stage IPD-MA will be used to determine the effectiveness of psychotherapy on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and/or suicide deaths, and to investigate potential patient-related and intervention-related moderators. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of the findings. Additionally, a conventional MA will be conducted to determine the differences between studies that provided IPD and those that did not. IPD-MA may determine the effectiveness of psychotherapy in reducing suicidality and provide insights into the moderating factors influencing the efficacy of psychotherapy. Answering these questions will inform mental healthcare practitioners about optimal treatments for different groups of individuals with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour and consequently help to reduce suicide risk.

A huge variety of GBS incidence and mortality rates has been noted across the world. AIMS The objective of the present multicentric study was to assess the incidence and mortality rates of GBS during a ten-year period in Serbia. METHODS We collected data of adult GBS patients who were hospitalized from 2009-2018 in all five tertiary healthcare centers in Serbia. The incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and further corrected for the estimated number of patients hospitalized in secondary centers. Mortality rates were also assessed. GBS was considered severe if patients were not able to walk at least 10 meters without assistance. RESULTS 640 GBS patients were registered in tertiary centers in a ten-year period. The proportion of severe cases was 75% at nadir, and 52% on discharge. GBS incidence rate in Serbia was 1.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, and estimated incidence if patients from secondary centers included 1.2 per 100,000. Peak incidence was observed during the sixth decade of life. During the acute phase, 5.6% of GBS patients died, while overall 9.7% of them died during six-month period from disease onset. CONCLUSION This study contributes to our knowledge about GBS epidemiology.

Aim of this study was to compare the radiological outcomes and time metrics of the various thrombectomy techniques. METHODS In this retrospective, multicenter study we analysed the data of 450 patients with occlusion of the anterior circulation, treated in five high-volume center from 2013 to 2016. The treatment techniques were divided in three categories: first-pass use of a large-bore aspiration-catheter; first-pass use of a stent-retriever; and primary combined approach (PCA) of an aspiration-catheter and stent-retriever. Primary endpoints were successful reperfusion and groin to reperfusion time. Secondary endpoints were the number of attempts and occurrence of emboli in new territory (ENT). The primary analysis was based on the intention to treat groups (ITT). RESULTS The ITT-analysis showed significantly higher reperfusion rates, with 86% of successful reperfusion in the PCA-group compared with 73% in the aspiration group and 65% in the stent-retriever group. There was no significant difference in groin to reperfusion time regarding the used technique. The secondary analysis showed an impact of the technique on the number of attempts and the occurrence of ENTs. Lowest ENT rates and attempts were reported with the combined approach. CONCLUSIONS The combined first-pass deployment of a stent-retriever and an aspiration-catheter was the most effective technique for reperfusion of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Our results correlate with the latest single-centrere studies, reporting very high reperfusion rates with PCA variations.","Hesse, Amélie Carolina; Behme, Daniel; Kemmling, André; Zapf, Antonia; Große Hokamp, Nils; Frischmuth, Isabelle; Maier, Ilko; Liman, Jan; Tsogkas, Ioannis; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Tran, Julia; Fiehler, Jens; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Schramm, Peter; Berlis, Ansgar; Knauth, Michael; Psychogios, Marios-Nikos",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,329,1

The Boot Camp is a hands-on, practicum-based, 3-day course to introduce core concepts in plastic surgery for new plastic surgery residents (in both integrated and independent tracks). METHODS The course was held in Pittsburgh in July to August 2015. There were 43 attendees (35 integrated/8 independent) representing 22 residency programs across 15 states. Faculty was composed of 8 local personnel and 5 visiting. Lecture topics and practical sessions covered the full spectrum of plastic surgery. All trainees completed an online survey evaluation both during the course and at 6 months. RESULTS Participant responses were overwhelmingly positive. A total of 72% of respondents rated the Boot Camp ≥ 8 on a 1 to 10 scale (10 is excellent) for the overall course rating; 79% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the simulation scenarios were realistic; and 75% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that they found simulation-based training to be a valuable way to teach this material. Respondents reported an increase in comfort and confidence across topics after attending the Boot Camp at both 0- and 6-month time points. Instructors received positive evaluations across all topics.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this pandemic will disappear soon. No health system, with its present resources and workflow, is capable enough to deal with a full-blown wave of this pandemic. Acquisition of specific new skills may be fundamental in delivering appropriate health care for our patients. The gold standard for diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Radiological investigations (chest X-ray or high-resolution computerized tomography [CT]) can be helpful both for diagnosis and management, but they have many limitations. Ultrasound has been suggested as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing the lungs in COVID-19 patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) can show specific signs of interstitial pneumonia, which is characteristic of COVID-19 pulmonary infection. In addition, nonradiologist specialists with experience in ultrasound can be trained on LUS with a relatively rapid learning curve. In pregnancy, LUS can be particularly useful due to the avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation.

There are currently two different absorbable barbed suture products available, V-Loc and Stratafix, and both have not been compared to each other with regard to flexor tendon repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both suture materials for primary stability under static and cyclic loading in a biomechanical ex vivo model. METHODS Forty fresh porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were randomized in two groups. A four-strand modified Kessler suture technique was used to repair the tendon either with a 3-0 V-Loc or 3-0 Stratafix without a knot. Parameters of interest were mode of failure, 2-mm gap formation force, displacement, stiffness and maximum load under static and cyclic testing. RESULTS The maximum load was 42.3 ± 7.2 for the Stratafix group and 50.7 ± 8.8 N for the V-Loc group. Thus, the ultimate tensile strength was significantly higher for V-Loc (p < 0.05). The 2-mm gap occurred at 24.8 ± 2.04 N in the Stratafix group in comparison to 26.5 ± 2.12 N in the V-Loc group (n.s.). Displacement was 2.65 ± 0.56 mm in the V-Loc group and 2.71 ± 0.59 mm in the Stratafix group (n.s.). Stiffness was 4.24 ± 0.68 (N/mm) in the V-Loc group and 3.85 ± 0.55 (N/mm) the Stratafix group (n.s.). Those measured differences were not significant. CONCLUSION V-Loc demonstrates a higher maximum load in tendon reconstruction. The differences in 2-mm gap formation force, displacement and stiffness were not significant. Hereby, the V-Loc™ has an advantage when used as unidirectional barbed suture for knotless flexor tendon repair.","Jordan, Martin C; Hölscher-Doht, Stefanie; Jakubietz, Michael G; Jakubietz, Rafael G; Meffert, Rainer H; Schmidt, Karsten",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,329,26

AMEN (Avondale Moms Empowered to Nurse) launched a Peer-to-Peer support group to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration in an under-resourced African American urban community with low breastfeeding rates. Materials and Methods: A Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)-guided project was developed in partnership with a neighborhood church. Using modified Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) peer counseling materials, Avondale neighborhood breastfeeding moms were trained and designated Breastfeeding Champions. Community organizations and partnering agencies helped recruit local mothers. Support groups included childcare, transportation, refreshments, and incentives, plus stipends for Champions. A mixed-methods approach captured participation, feeding intention and practices, and program evaluation using electronic data capture. After adding another neighborhood with low breastfeeding rates, AMEN was modified to ""All Moms Empowered to Nurse."" Additional Champion moms were trained as Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere (ROSE) Community Transformers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has met weekly by virtual platform. Results: Since May 2017, 67 AMEN support meetings have included 158 participants, with average attendance of 10 (range 5-19) per meeting. In addition to 8 Champions, 110 moms have attended, including 24% expecting mothers. Additional attendees include 13 family support persons, 23 guest speakers, and 12 from community outreach programs. Qualitative feedback from participants has been uniformly positive. Breastfeeding initiation rates have increased 12% in the initial neighborhood.

However, its pharmacokinetics and metabolism have yet to be evaluated. In this study, a sensitive LC-HRMS method was developed and validated to quantify tHGA in rat plasma. The method showed good linearity (0.5-80 ng/mL). The accuracy and precision were within 10%. Pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on three groups of six rats. The first two groups were given oral administrations of unformulated and liposome-encapsulated tHGA, respectively, while the third group received intraperitoneal administration of liposome-encapsulated tHGA. The maximum concentration (Cmax), the time required to reach Cmax (tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2) and area under curve (AUC0-24) values for intraperitoneal administration were 54.6 ng/mL, 1.5 h, 6.7 h, and 193.9 ng/mL·h, respectively. For the oral administration of unformulated and formulated tHGA, Cmax values were 5.4 and 14.5 ng/mL, tmax values were 0.25 h for both, t1/2 values were 6.9 and 6.6 h, and AUC0-24 values were 17.6 and 40.7 ng/mL·h, respectively.

Further, universities and schools and colleges of pharmacy should foster a culture that values all faculty regardless of rank or position. The purpose of this commentary is to describe ongoing efforts and lessons learned by one public university with a college of pharmacy that has non-tenure-track and tenure-track faculty.

The loss of TDP-43 function that is associated with these inclusions affects post-transcriptional processing of RNAs in multiple ways including pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, modulation of mRNA stability and translation. In contrast, less is known about the role of TDP-43 in axonal RNA metabolism in motoneurons. Here we show that depletion of Tdp-43 in primary motoneurons affects axon growth. This defect is accompanied by subcellular transcriptome alterations in the axonal and somatodendritic compartment. The axonal localization of transcripts encoding components of the cytoskeleton, the translational machinery and transcripts involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism were particularly affected by loss of Tdp-43. Accordingly, we observed reduced protein synthesis and disturbed mitochondrial functions in axons of Tdp-43-depleted motoneurons. Treatment with nicotinamide rescued the axon growth defect associated with loss of Tdp-43. These results show that Tdp-43 depletion in motoneurons affects several pathways integral to axon health indicating that loss of TDP-43 function could thus make a major contribution to axonal pathomechanisms in ALS.","Briese, Michael; Saal-Bauernschubert, Lena; Lüningschrör, Patrick; Moradi, Mehri; Dombert, Benjamin; Surrey, Verena; Appenzeller, Silke; Deng, Chunchu; Jablonka, Sibylle; Sendtner, Michael",Acta neuropathologica communications,329,1

The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the effect of pre-transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) and CO-weighted oxygen delivery index (ODI) on CrSO2 and on the post-transfusion CrSO2 change. METHODS Preterm infants of <32 weeks gestational age (GA) receiving PRBC transfusion were enrolled. Infants received 15 ml/kg PRBC over 3 h. CrSO2 by near-infrared spectroscopy and CO by electrical velocimetry were recorded for 1 h pre-ransfusion and post transfusion. ODI was defined as pre-transfusion Hb × CO. RESULTS Thirty infants of 26.6 ± 2.0 weeks GA were studied at 19 ± 12 days. Pre-transfusion Hb was 9.8 ± 0.6 g/dl. Pre-transfusion CrSO2 correlated with pre-transfusion ODI (R2 = 0.1528, p = .044) but not with Hb level. The pre-transfusion to post-transfusion CrSO2 change correlated with pre-transfusion ODI (R2 = 0.1764, p = .029) but not with Hb level. CrSO2 increased from 66 ± 6% to 72 ± 7% post transfusion (p < .001), while arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and CO did not change. CONCLUSION In these infants, the pre-transfusion ODI was a better indicator of brain oxygenation and its improvement post transfusion than Hb alone. The role of CO and tissue oxygenation monitoring in assessing the need for transfusion should be evaluated.","Jain, Deepak; D'Ugard, Carmen; Bancalari, Eduardo; Claure, Nelson",Pediatric research,329,1

We report results of the Delphi process to define and optimize robotic training procedures for HPB surgeons. METHODS In 2019, a robotic HPB surgery panel with an interest in surgical training from the Americas and Europe was created and met. An e-consensus-finding exercise using the Delphi process was applied and consensus was defined as 80% agreement on each question. Iterations of anonymous voting continued over three rounds. RESULTS Members agreed on several points: there was need for a standardized robotic training curriculum for HPB surgery that considers experience of surgeons and based on a robotic hepatectomy includes a common approach for ""basic robotic skills"" training (e-learning module, including hardware description, patient selection, port placement, docking, troubleshooting, fundamentals of robotic surgery, team training and efficiency, and emergencies) and an ""advanced technical skills curriculum"" (e-learning, including patient selection information, cognitive skills, and recommended operative equipment lists). A modular approach to index procedures should be used with video demonstrations, port placement for index procedure, troubleshooting, and emergency scenario management information. Inexperienced surgeons should undergo training in basic robotic skills and console proficiency, transitioning to full procedure training of e-learning (video demonstration, simulation training, case observation, and final evaluation). Experienced surgeons should undergo basic training when using a new system (e-learning, dry lab, and operating room (OR) team training, virtual reality modules, and wet lab; case observations were unnecessary for basic training) and should complete the advanced index procedural robotic curriculum with assessment by wet lab, case observation, and OR team training. CONCLUSIONS Optimization and standardization of training and education of HPB surgeons in robotic procedures was agreed upon. Results are being incorporated into future curriculum for education in robotic surgery.","Fong, Yuman; Buell, Joseph F; Collins, Justin; Martinie, John; Bruns, Christiane; Tsung, Allan; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Nachmany, Ido; Edwin, Bjørn; Pratschke, Johann; Solomonov, Evgeny; Koenigsrainer, Alfred; Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo",Surgical endoscopy,329,31

METHODS We included in this study patients with OSAS, who were divided into three groups according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (group 1, mild [n = 20]; group 2, moderate [n = 20]; and group 3, severe [n = 20]), and healthy controls (group 4, n = 20). Pupillary responses were measured using a pupillometry system. RESULTS Static (mesopic PD, P = 0.0019; low photopic PD, P = 0.001) and dynamic pupil responses (resting diameter, P = 0.004; amplitude of pupil contraction, P < 0.001; duration of pupil contraction, P = 0.022; velocity of pupil contraction, P = 0.001; and velocity of pupil dilation, P = 0.012) were affected in patients with different OSAS severities. Also, AHI was negatively correlated with mesopic PD (P = 0.008), low photopic PD (P = 0.003), resting diameter (P = 0.001), amplitude of pupil contraction (P < 0.001), duration of pupil contraction (P = 0.011), velocity of pupil contraction (P < 0.001), and velocity of pupil dilation (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION We detected pupil responses innervated by the ANS were affected in the OSAS patients. This effect was more significant in the severe OSAS patients. Therefore, the pupillometry system can be an easily applicable, noninvasive method to detect ANS dysfunction in the OSA patients.","Erdem, Seyfettin; Yilmaz, Sureyya; Karahan, Mine; Dursun, Mehmet Emin; Ava, Sedat; Alakus, Mehmet Fuat; Keklikci, Ugur",International ophthalmology,329,5

Hashtags #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns were used to promote them on Twitter. Objectives: This study quantified the effect of hashtag count, mention count, and URL count and attaching visual cues to #CDCGrandRounds or #VitalSigns tweets on their retweet frequency. METHODS Through Twitter Search Application Programming Interface, original tweets containing the hashtag #CDCGrandRounds (n = 6,966; April 21, 2011-October 25, 2016) and the hashtag #VitalSigns (n = 15,015; March 19, 2013-October 31, 2016) were retrieved respectively. Negative binomial regression models were applied to each corpus to estimate the associations between retweet frequency and three predictors (hashtag count, mention count, and URL link count). Each corpus was sub-set into cycles (#CDCGrandRounds: n = 58, #VitalSigns: n = 42). We manually coded the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle, whether it contained visual cues (images or videos). Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency for each cycle, between tweets with and without visual cues. FINDINGS URL links increased retweet frequency in both corpora; effects of hashtag count and mention count differed between the two corpora. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significantly different retweet frequencies between tweets with and without visual cues. Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate < 1; twenty-four, PR > 1 but < 3; and four, PR > 3. Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant. Of these 19 cycles, six were PR > 1 and < 3; and thirteen, PR > 3. Conclusions: The increase of retweet frequency through attaching visual cues varied across cycles for original tweets with #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns. Future research is needed to determine the optimal choice of visual cues to maximize the influence of public health tweets.","Jackson, Ashley M; Mullican, Lindsay A; Yin, Jingjing; Tse, Zion Tsz Ho; Liang, Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Ahweyevu, Jennifer O; Jenkins Iii, Jimmy J; Saroha, Nitin; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",Annals of global health,329,12

The surgery involves placement of a composite mesh with 3-5 cm overlap at the edges of the defect. The disadvantage of this repair is one, the composite mesh used for intraperitoneal placement is quite costly and two, it leaves a foreign body inside the peritoneal cavity, with the potential to cause problems in the future. To circumvent both these issues, we have developed a new approach, called the Retro-Rectal Onlay Mesh (RROM) repair, which allows placement of a plain polypropylene mesh in an extraperitoneal plane. Patients and Methods Patients with paraumbilical hernia and lower midline incisional hernias were included in this pilot study performed at a single centre by the same surgeon. The steps of the technique are described in detail. Results Since 2016, a total of 52 patients were operated by this technique, including both male and female patients. It included patients with para-umbilical hernias as well as incisional hernias. The RROM repair could be successfully carried out in all the patients. In six of the patients, transversus abdominis release was added as the defect size was large to allow closure of the defect. The results were satisfactory with a low morbidity and no mortality. Conclusion In our opinion, the RROM technique is an important tool in the armamentarium of the laparoscopic surgeon dealing with ventral abdominal hernias, allowing placement of polypropylene mesh in an extraperitoneal space. It allows significant cost savings as compared to the prevalent intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair.","Jani, Kalpesh; Contractor, Samir",Journal of minimal access surgery,329,11

One reason for this could be attributed to the independent practice of residents in these situations. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether differences in performance exist between residents working alone vs with a resident partner when encountering simulated non-OR airway management scenarios. METHODS Thirty-six anaesthesia residents were randomized into two groups. Each group experienced three separate scenarios (two scenarios initially and then a third 6 weeks later). The scenarios consisted of one control scenario and two critical event scenarios [i.e. asystole during laryngoscopy and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) upon post-intubation institution of positive pressure ventilation]. One group experienced the simulated non-OR scenarios alone (Solo group). The other group consisted of resident pairs, participating in the same three scenarios (Team group). RESULTS Although the time to intubation did not differ between the Solo and Team groups, there were several differences in performance. The Team group received better overall performance ratings for the asystole (8.5 vs 5.5 out of 10; P<0.001) and PEA (8.5 vs 5.8 out of 10; P<0.001) scenarios. The Team group was also able to recognize asystole and PEA conditions faster than the Solo group [10.1 vs 23.5 s (P<0.001) and 13.3 vs 36.0 s (P<0.001), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS Residents who performed a simulated intubation with a second trained provider had better overall performance than those who practised independently. The residents who practised in a group were also faster to diagnose serious complications, including peri-intubation asystole and PEA. Given these data, it is reasonable that training programmes consider performing all non-OR airway management with a team-based method.","DeMaria, S; Berman, D J; Goldberg, A; Lin, H-M; Khelemsky, Y; Levine, A I",British journal of anaesthesia,329,1

CASE SUMMARY A 58 year-old male presented with acute psychosis and no symptoms associated with COVID-19. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse (including cocaine and alcohol), liver disease, anxiety, and panic disorder. Patient was confused, disruptive, unable to communicate, and admitted to hallucinations. Prior to transfer to a psychiatric facility, the patient developed a cough, triggering COVID-19 testing and a positive result. He was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine before this was discontinued. The patient was treated with haloperidol and lorazepam before returning to baseline. He was discharged home with continued isolation. CONCLUSION Acute psychosis, with or without other symptoms, appears to be a potential presentation of COVID-19 and should be considered by clinicians as a possible presenting manifestation. Other coronaviruses appear to have also been linked to neurological manifestations, including psychosis. Neurological manifestations of the virus vary widely, but have been reported multiple times. Treatment, as shown in this case report, appears to be supportive and symptom based for the associated psychotic symptoms. Optimal antiviral treatment is still yet to be clearly defined, as research continues on how to best treat the virus itself.","Lanier, Cameron G; Lewis, Stacey A; Patel, Paras D; Ahmed, Ahmed Mohamed; Lewis, Paul O",Journal of pharmacy practice,329,31

During follow-up examinations, we noted many patients with weight regain complaining of fatigue shortly after eating. Thus, we decided to study the glucose tolerance test (GTT) results in a cohort of post-RYGB patients. METHODS A total of 63 RYGB patients, >6 months postoperatively, were studied with a GTT and measurement of insulin levels. The mean age was 48.5 ± 10.8 years, mean preoperative body mass index was 49.0 ± 6.5 kg/m(2), mean percentage of excess body mass index lost was 64.5% ± 29.0%, mean weight regain at follow-up was 11.6 ± 12.4 lb, and mean follow-up period was 47.9 months. RESULTS Of the 63 patients, 49 had abnormal GTT results. Of the 63 patients, 6 were diabetic; however, only 1 of these patients had an elevated fasting glucose level. All 6 patients were diabetic preoperatively. Of the 63 patients, 43 had evidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 1-2 hours after the glucose load. Of these patients, 22 had a maximum/minimum glucose ratio >3:1, including 7 with a ratio >4:1. CONCLUSION The results of the present study have demonstrated that an abnormal GTT result is a common finding after RYGB. Reactive hypoglycemia was found in 43 of 63 patients, with insulin values that do not support nesidioblastosis. It is our hypothesis, that rather than preventing simple carbohydrate ingestion, the induced hypoglycemia that occurs might contribute to weight regain and maladaptive eating in certain post-RYGB patients.","Roslin, Mitchell S; Oren, Jonathan H; Polan, Barrett N; Damani, Tanuja; Brauner, Rachel; Shah, Paresh C",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,329,1

We describe the particular controversies concerning the biopsy assessment of Barrett's oesophagus, chronic gastritis and the duodenum in the investigation of coeliac disease. We accept that there are indications for more extensive upper GI biopsy protocols in children than in adults; the latter constitute our main focus in this article. We would encourage detailed discussion between pathologists and their endoscopy colleagues about the indications, or lack of them, for routine upper GI endoscopic biopsy, as studies have shown that adherence to agreed guidelines has resulted in a very considerable diminution in the biopsy workload without compromising patient management. Furthermore, where biopsy is indicated, we emphasise the importance of accompanying clinical information provided to the pathologist, in particular regarding biopsy site(s), and regular feedback to endoscopists to improve and maintain the quality of such information. Finally, local dialogue is also advised, when necessary, to indicate to endoscopists the need to appropriately segregate biopsies into separate, individually labelled specimens, to maximise the information that can be derived by pathological evaluation and thereby improve the quality of the final pathology report.","Loughrey, Maurice B; Shepherd, Neil A",Histopathology,329,26

Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA), Scopus, and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) catalog up until January 9, 2017. Reference lists were scrutinized, and citation searches were performed on the included studies. The primary outcome was the quality of literature searches and the secondary outcome was time spent on the literature search when the PICO model was used as a search strategy tool, compared to the use of another conceptualizing tool or unguided searching. Results A total of 2,163 records were identified, and after removal of duplicates and initial screening, 22 full-text articles were assessed. Of these, 19 studies were excluded and 3 studies were included, data were extracted, risk of bias was assessed, and a qualitative analysis was conducted. The included studies compared PICO to the PIC truncation or links to related articles in PubMed, PICOS, and sample, phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation, research type (SPIDER). One study compared PICO to unguided searching. Due to differences in intervention, no quantitative analysis was performed. Conclusions Only few studies exist that assess the effect of the PICO model vis-a-vis other available models or even vis-a-vis the use of no model.

The American Heart Association recognizes mobile health technologies (mHealth) as an emerging strategy in the mitigation of CVD risk factors, with significant potential for improving population health. The purpose of this review is to highlight and summarize the latest available literature on mHealth applications and provide perspective on future directions and barriers to implementation. RECENT FINDINGS While available randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews tend to support efficacy of mHealth, published literature includes heterogenous approaches to similar problems with inconsistent results. Some of the strongest recent evidence has been focused on the use of wearables in arrhythmia detection. Systematic reviews of mHealth approaches demonstrate benefit when applied to risk factor modification of diabetes, cigarette smoking cessation, and physical activity/weight loss, while also showing promise in multi risk factor modification via cardiac rehabilitation. SUMMARY Evidence supports efficacy of mHealth in a variety of applications for CVD prevention and management, continued work is needed for further validation and scaling. Future directions will focus on platform optimization, data and sensor consolidation, and clinical workflow integration.

The learning needs for single-incision skills acquisition are unknown and no current guidelines exist for training or for its safe adoption. METHODS We developed an approach to adoption of new surgical techniques and applied it to single-incision laparoscopy. It is based on the following principles: a defined training algorithm, dry and wet-laboratory practice, a graded clinical introduction, and careful review of early outcomes. We analyzed its impact in our initial 40 patients. RESULTS Our training paradigm consisted of the following: attending a formal course, developing a simulation model, and animal laboratory training, followed by graduated clinical adoption. A 20% conversion rate to standard laparoscopy or open surgery occurred. CONCLUSION Introducing a new surgical technique may not only offer potential advantages but also present significant risks. We developed a thoughtful approach to adoption that includes simulation-based training, progressive clinical adoption, and early review of outcomes. This approach may be applied to various new clinical applications.","Khandelwal, Saurabh; Wright, Andrew S; Figueredo, Edgar; Pellegrini, Carlos A; Oelschlager, Brant K",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Physicians should know both the scientific rationale and the practical implications for medical marijuana laws. OBJECTIVE To review the pharmacology, indications, and laws related to medical marijuana use. EVIDENCE REVIEW The medical literature on medical marijuana was reviewed from 1948 to March 2015 via MEDLINE with an emphasis on 28 randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids as pharmacotherapy for indications other than those for which there are 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved cannabinoids (dronabinol and nabilone), which include nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and appetite stimulation in wasting illnesses. FINDINGS Use of marijuana for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis is supported by high-quality evidence. Six trials that included 325 patients examined chronic pain, 6 trials that included 396 patients investigated neuropathic pain, and 12 trials that included 1600 patients focused on multiple sclerosis. Several of these trials had positive results, suggesting that marijuana or cannabinoids may be efficacious for these indications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medical marijuana is used to treat a host of indications, a few of which have evidence to support treatment with marijuana and many that do not. Physicians should educate patients about medical marijuana to ensure that it is used appropriately and that patients will benefit from its use.","Hill, Kevin P",JAMA,329,24

However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the number of Australians choosing to purchase private health insurance (PHI), particularly within the young adult age group with the proportion of insurance customers aged 20 to 29 falling from 10.3 to 9.4% between 2012 and 2017 (Sivey, The Conversation, 2017). Young adults are critical to private health insurance funding models as their involvement offsets the drawdown by older adults (Dalzell and Borys, ABC News, 2019). While this issue is widely reported in the Australian media, few empirical studies have explored the factors that enable or constrain young adults' enrolment in PHI. METHODS To address the scarcity of research about the motivational factors behind young adult decision-making, this study conducted a survey of 594 Australian young adults aged between 18 and 30 years. Within this age group, the survey sought an equal split of participants who were members and non-members of PHI schemes. CONCLUSION The findings identified perceived value and trust in insurers as additional motivational factors alongside traditional measures of recognition of the problem and involvement in the problem. Differences between the insured and uninsured groups were identified which help to shape a more holistic understanding of the key motivational factors and barriers in relation to Australian young adults' enrolment in PHI.","Tam, Lisa; Tyquin, Ellen; Mehta, Amisha; Larkin, Ingrid",BMC health services research,329,11

The adaptive immune response is the second line of defense and is specific to the pathogen. Innate immunity occurs immediately while adaptive immunity develops upon pathogen exposure, and is long-lasting, highly specific, and sustained by memory T cells. Respiratory virus infection typically induces effective immunity but over-exuberant responses are associated with pathophysiology. Cytokines expressed in response to viral infection can enhance biological responses, activate, and trigger signaling pathways leading to adaptive immunity that involves B cell-mediated humoral and T cell-mediated cellular immune responses. Vaccines induce immunity, specifically B cell and T cell responses. Vaccination targeting respiratory viruses like influenza is generally efficacious, but for many viruses, our understanding of vaccination strategies and immunity is incomplete or in its infancy. Studies that examine innate and adaptive immune responses to respiratory virus infection will aid vaccine development and may reduce the burden of respiratory viral disease. AREAS COVERED A literature search was performed using PubMed, a search engine maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) bibliographic database. The areas of search covered: innate, adaptive, respiratory virus, vaccine development, B cell, and T cell.

Triage protocols have been proposed incorporating the exclusion of specified subgroups of patients from critical care. There have been no studies that explore the theoretical underpinning of triage at referral, and it is not clear under what circumstances triage would confer the intended benefits. We sought to explore the mechanisms whereby triage could lead to fewer deaths across a critical care population in the context of a pandemic. DESIGN We constructed a mathematical model based on queuing theory to compare the estimated short-term survival achieved by using a critical care service with and without triage at referral. Illustrative scenarios concerning a hypothetical critical care population were constructed to explore the roles of length of stay and critical care survival in determining the impact of triage and to identify ""tipping points"" of demand at which triage would result in more survivors. SETTING Not applicable as this was a data-free mathematical modeling exercise. MAIN RESULTS We identified circumstances in which triage would be expected to result in more survivors and circumstances in which it would not. In some scenarios, excluding patient groups solely on the basis of anticipated length of stay could be effective due to a more efficient use of critical care bed days. CONCLUSIONS The impact of triage is dependent on the level of demand and on the scale of achievable differences between included and excluded groups in terms of anticipated length of stay and critical care survival. It cannot be assumed that triage can or will result in fewer deaths. It should be remembered that there are considerations other than population-level short-term survival when determining the objectives of triage and its ethical implementation.","Utley, Martin; Pagel, Christina; Peters, Mark J; Petros, Andy; Lister, Paula",Critical care medicine,329,17

BACKGROUND TAVR has been used to treat BAV-AS but with heterogeneous outcomes and uncertainty regarding the relevance of morphology. METHODS In 14 centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, 130 BAV-AS patients underwent TAVR. Baseline cardiac computed tomography (CT) was analyzed by a dedicated Corelab. Outcomes were assessed in line with Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. RESULTS Bicommissural BAV (vs. tricommissural) accounted for 68.9% of those treated in North America, 88.9% in Europe, and 95.5% in Asia (p = 0.003). For bicommissural bicuspids, non-raphe type (vs. raphe type) BAV accounted for 11.9% of those treated in North America, 9.4% in Europe, and 61.9% in Asia (p < 0.001). Overall rates of 30-day mortality (3.8%) and cerebrovascular events (3.2%) were favorable and similar among anatomical subsets. The rate of new permanent pacemaker insertion was high (26.2%) and similar between balloon-expandable (BE) and self-expanding (SE) designs (BE: 25.5% vs. SE: 26.9%; p = 0.83); there was a trend to greater permanent pacemaker insertion in BE TAVR in the presence of coronary cusp fusion BAV morphology. Paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR) ≥ moderate was 18.1% overall but lower at 11.5% in those with pre-procedural CT. In the absence of pre-procedural CT, there was an excess of PAR in BE TAVR that was not the case in those with a pre-procedural CT; SE TAVR required more post-dilation. Predictors of PAR included intercommissural distance for bicommissural bicuspids (odd ratio [OR]: 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.84; p = 0.036) and lack of a baseline CT for annular measurement (OR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.20 to 7.69; p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study, TAVR achieved favorable outcomes in patients with pre-procedural CT, with the exception of high permanent pacemaker rates for all devices and shapes.","Jilaihawi, Hasan; Chen, Mao; Webb, John; Himbert, Dominique; Ruiz, Carlos E; Rodés-Cabau, Josep; Pache, Gregor; Colombo, Antonio; Nickenig, Georg; Lee, Michael; Tamburino, Corrado; Sievert, Horst; Abramowitz, Yigal; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Alqoofi, Faisal; Chakravarty, Tarun; Kashif, Mohammad; Takahashi, Nobuyuki; Kazuno, Yoshio; Maeno, Yoshio; Kawamori, Hiroyuki; Chieffo, Alaide; Blanke, Philipp; Dvir, Danny; Ribeiro, Henrique Barbosa; Feng, Yuan; Zhao, Zhen-Gang; Sinning, Jan-Malte; Kliger, Chad; Giustino, Gennaro; Pajerski, Basia; Imme, Sebastiano; Grube, Eberhard; Leipsic, Jonathon; Vahanian, Alec; Michev, Iassen; Jelnin, Vladimir; Latib, Azeem; Cheng, Wen; Makkar, Raj",JACC.

However, trainees deficient in those skills are not identified early enough to address the deficiency. Furthermore, faculty often struggle to identify effective remediation strategies for those who fail to meet expectations. We undertook a systematic review to determine which assessment methods are appropriate to identify learners that struggle with communication skills and the strategies used to remediate them. METHODS The literature was searched from January 1998 through to May 2019 using academic databases and grey literature. Trainees were defined as healthcare practitioners in undergraduate, graduate and continuing education. Characteristics of studies, assessment and intervention strategies and outcomes were synthesized qualitatively and summarized in tables. RESULTS From an initial 1636 records, 16 (1%) studies met the review criteria. Majority of the learners were medical students. A few studies (44%) included students from other disciplines, residents and physicians in practice. The remediation programs, in the studies, ranged from 1 week to 1 year. Around half of the studies focused solely on learners struggling with communication skills. The majority of studies used a format of a clinical OSCE to identify struggling learners. None of the studies had a single intervention strategy with the majority including an experiential component with feedback. CONCLUSIONS A few studies collectively described the diagnosis, remediation intervention and the assessment of the outcomes of remediation of communication skills. For a remediation strategy to be successful it is important to ensure: (i) early identification and diagnosis, (ii) the development of an individualized plan and (iii) providing reassessment with feedback to the learner.","Al-Sheikhly, Deema; Östlundh, Linda; Arayssi, Thurayya",BMC medical education,329,1

Neurologists assess the severity of PD motor symptoms using the clinical rating scale, i.e., MDS-UPDRS. However, this assessment method is time-consuming and easily affected by the perception difference of assessors. In the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, telemedicine for PD has become extremely urgent for clinical practice. To solve these problems, we developed an automated and objective assessment method of the leg agility task in the MDS-UPDRS using videos and a graph neural network. In this study, a sparse adaptive graph convolutional network (SA-GCN) was proposed to achieve fine-grained quantitative assessment of skeleton sequences extracted from videos. Specifically, the sparse adaptive graph convolutional unit with a prior knowledge constraint was proposed to perform adaptive spatial modeling of physical and logical dependency for skeleton sequences, thus achieving the sparse modeling of the discriminative spatial relationships. Subsequently, a temporal context module was introduced to construct the remote context dependency in the temporal dimension, hence determining the global changes of the task. A multi-domain attention learning module was also developed to integrate the static spatial features and dynamic temporal features, and then to emphasize the salient feature selection in the channel domain, thereby capturing the multi-domain fine-grained information. Finally, the evaluation results using a dataset with 148 patients and 870 samples confirmed the effectiveness and reliability of our scheme, and the method outperformed other related state-of-the-art methods. Our contactless method provides a new potential tool for automated PD assessment and telemedicine.","Guo, Rui; Shao, Xiangxin; Zhang, Chencheng; Qian, Xiaohua",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,329,16

Access to routine viral load testing is crucial to identify women with unsuppressed viral load early in pregnancy and to provide timely intervention to improve viral suppression. This study aimed to determine the coverage of maternal viral load monitoring nationally, focusing on viral load testing, documentation of viral load test results, and viral suppression (viral load < 50 copies/mL). At the time of this study, the first-line regimen for women initiating ART during pregnancy was non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen. METHODS Between 1 October and 15 November 2019, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 15- to 49-year-old pregnant women attending antenatal care in 1589 nationally representative public health facilities. Data on ART status, viral load testing and viral load test results were extracted from medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with coverage of viral load testing. RESULTS Of 8112 participants eligible for viral load testing, 81.7% received viral load testing, and 94.1% of the viral load test results were documented in the medical records. Of those who had viral load test results documented, 74.1% were virally suppressed. Women initiated on ART during pregnancy and who received ART for three months had lower coverage of viral load testing (73%) and viral suppression (56.8%) compared with women initiated on ART before pregnancy (82.8% and 76.1%, respectively). Initiating ART during pregnancy rather than before pregnancy was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a viral load test during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.8). CONCLUSIONS Viral load result documentation was high; viral load testing could be improved especially among women initiating ART during pregnancy. The low viral suppression among women who initiated ART during pregnancy despite receiving ART for three months highlights the importance of enhanced adherence counselling during pregnancy. Our finding supports the WHO recommendation that a Dolutegravir-containing regimen be the preferred regimen for women who are newly initiating ART during pregnancy for more rapid viral suppression.","Woldesenbet, Selamawit A; Kufa-Chakezha, Tendesayi; Lombard, Carl; Manda, Samuel; Cheyip, Mireille; Ayalew, Kassahun; Puren, Adrian",HIV medicine,329,33

Genetic and immunologic studies have highlighted the importance of the interleukin (IL)-23/T-helper 17 (Th17) pathway in systemic psoriasis pathogenesis. Main IL-23 is an upstream regulatory cytokine with direct effects on epidermal keratinocytes and other resident skin cells while IL-17, a downstream molecule, can activate inflammatory responses in different cells across a diversity of organs. Disease modification could be achieved with drugs that can slow down the biological processes that cause the persistent inflammation in moderate to severe psoriasis. Early intervention with anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 agents in new-onset moderate to severe plaque psoriasis might modify the natural course of the disease. Perhaps we are not simply seeing a pharmacologic and mechanistic effect of new-generation biologics but eventually a disease modification process. In this short report we underline the main available data which supports an important role for IL-17 blockade and address whether these new drugs targeting the IL-23/IL-17 axis could be disease-modifying agents in plaque psoriasis.

Knocking down either of these two TFs significantly impacted NK cell transformation. Finally, we constructed a genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network that provides an understanding of the regulatory dynamics during NK cell differentiation.","Li, Kun; Wu, Yang; Li, Young; Yu, Qiaoni; Tian, Zhigang; Wei, Haiming; Qu, Kun",bioRxiv,329,20

Although it is true, around the world there are companies that are responsible for recycling plastic waste, since 42% of plastics that are generated worldwide have a single utility. In Peru, the culture of recycling is not promoted, each year approximately each person uses 30 kilos of plastic and that only in Metropolitan Lima and Callao 46% of plastic waste is generated nationwide. In view of this problem, this article will design a plastic shredding machine to obtain small plastic waste to help people to be dedicated to the recycling industry in an automated way, it would also generate jobs since it requires a staff in charge of the machine and it will also be extremely useful to reduce plastic pollution in the environment, which due to COVID-19 is increasing. Through the design of the plastic waste shredding machine, the plastic will be selected by color and type of plastic composition, whether it is Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polychloride vinyl (PVC) or Others (Plastic Mix), then it will go through the shredding process to become small plastic waste, which could be turned into filament for 3D printer. © 2021.

We use the excess mortality instead, showing the difference between most restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (mrNPIs) and less restrictive NPIs (lrNPIs) with respect to the growth rate and death counts. Methods: We estimate the COVID-19 growth rate for Sweden, South Korea, Italy and Germany from the excess mortality. We use the average growth rate obtained for Sweden and South Korea, two countries with lrNPIs, to estimate additional death numbers in Germany and Italy (two countries with mrNPIs) in a hypothetic lrNPIs scenario. Results: The growth rate estimated from excess mortality decreased faster for Germany and Italy than for Sweden and South Korea, suggesting that the mrNPIs have a non-negligible effect. This is not visible when the growth rate is calculated using the reported case numbers of COVID-19. This results in approximately 4 500 and 12 000 more death numbers for Germany and Italy, respectively. Conclusion: The reproduction numbers or growth rates obtained from reported COVID-19 cases are most likely biased. Expanding testing capacity led to an overestimation of the growth rate across all countries analyzed, masking the true decrease already visible in the excess mortality. Using our method, a more realistic estimate of the growth rate is obtained. Conclusions made for the reproduction number derived from the reported case numbers like the insignificance of most restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (lockdowns) might be wrong and have to be reevaluated using the growth rates obtained with our method.","Weber, A.",,329,26

Radioimmunoassay and semiquantitative video analysis of immunofluorescence on frozen sections showed that one apical and three basolateral glycoproteins, defined by monoclonal antibodies and binding of beta-2-microglobulin, were incompletely extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in a buffer that preserves the cortical cytoskeleton (Fey, E. G., K. M. Wan, and S. Penman. 1984. J. Cell Biol. 98:1973-1984; Nelson, W. T. and P. J. Veshnock. 1986. J. Cell Biol. 103:1751-1766). The marker proteins were preferentially extracted from the ""incorrect"" domain (i.e., the apical domain for a basolateral marker), indicating that the cytoskeletal anchoring was most effective on the ""correct"" domain. The two basolateral markers were unpolarized and almost completely extractable in cells prevented from establishing cell-cell contacts by incubation in low Ca++ medium, while an apical marker was only extracted from the basal surface under the same conditions. Procedures were developed to apply fluorescent probes to either the apical or the basolateral surface of live cells grown on native collagen gels. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of predominantly basolateral antigens showed a large percent of cells (28- 52%) with no recoverable fluorescence on the basal domain but normal fluorescence recovery on the apical surface of most cells (92-100%). Diffusion coefficients in cells with normal fluorescence recovery were in the order of 1.1 x 10(-9) cm2/s in the apical domain and 0.6-0.9 x 10(-9) cm2/s in the basal surface, but the difference was not significant.

In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation.

DESIGN Prospective surveillance of elderly people. INTERVENTION None. SETTING Leicestershire, England SUBJECTS 533 subjects 60 to 90 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pathogens, symptoms, restriction of activity, duration of illness, medical consultations, interval between onset of illness and medical consultation, antibiotic use, admission to hospital, and death. RESULTS 231 pathogens were identified for 211 (43%) of 497 episodes for which diagnostic specimens were available: 121 (52%) were rhinoviruses, 59 (26%) were coronaviruses, 22 (9.5%) were influenza A or B, 17 (7%) were respiratory syncytial virus, 7 (3%) were parainfluenza viruses, and 3 (1%) were Chlamydia species; an adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae caused one infection each. Infections occurred at a rate of 1.2 episodes per person per annum (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.7; range 0-10) and were clinically indistinguishable. Lower respiratory tract symptoms complicated 65% of upper respiratory infections and increased the medical consultation rate 2.4-fold (chi 2 test P < 0.001). The median interval between onset of illness and medical consultation was 3 days for influenza and 5 days for other infections. Rhinoviruses caused the greatest disease burden overall followed by episodes of unknown aetiology, coronaviruses, influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses cause substantial morbidity in elderly people. Although respiratory syncytial virus and influenza cause considerable individual morbidity, the burden of disease from rhinovirus infections and infections of unknown aetiology seems greater overall. The interval between onset of illness and consultation together with diagnostic difficulties raises concern regarding the role of antiviral drugs in treating influenza.","Nicholson, K G; Kent, J; Hammersley, V; Cancio, E",BMJ,329,30

METHODS The level of compliance for each subject was evaluated with a self-administered questionnaire together with microbiological examination of their contact lenses, lens cases and lens care solutions. The effect of an intervention to improve the level of compliance was determined by a controlled trial. A regular self-review exercise on proper lens handling was given to the test group once every three months for 12 months. The levels of compliance and contamination of contact lenses and lens care accessories between test and control groups were compared at the end of the 12-month period to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS Sixty-five subjects who were experienced contact lens wearers were recruited and 60 completed the study. All showed some degree of non-compliance in the care of their contact lenses and lens accessories. Most (about 60 per cent) were non-compliant with at least six of a total of 15 lens care procedures. The most common non-compliant behaviour among contact lens wearers was associated with the care of the lens case. By the end of the study period, our compliance enhancement strategy did not appear to have had a significant effect on the behaviour of our subjects, except for improvement in the care of lens cases. Compliance for other procedures improved in both test and control groups. CONCLUSION All subjects showed some degree of non-compliance and the spectrum of non-compliance was wide. The poorest levels of compliance were associated with care of the lens case, which was also the most frequently contaminated item. Our compliance enhancement strategy showed a significant difference in improvement in compliance between the intervention and control groups only in the care of lens cases.","Yung, Alice M S; Boost, Maureen V; Cho, Pauline; Yap, Maurice",Clinical & experimental optometry,329,1

As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a high mutation rate due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerase. To study the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, 158 SNPs with high confidence were identified by deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing, and the most common SNP type was C > T. Analyses of intra-host population diversity revealed that intra-host quasispecies' composition varies with time during the early onset of symptoms, which implicates viral evolution during infection. Network analysis of co-occurring SNPs revealed the most abundant non-synonymous SNP 22,638 in the S glycoprotein RBD region and 28,144 in the ORF8 region. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 variations differ in an individual's respiratory tissue (nose, throat, BALF, or sputum), suggesting independent compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 populations in patients. The positive selection analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome uncovered the positive selected amino acid G251V on ORF3a.

METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic test strategies (RIDT, DIA, NAAT, clinical judgement, batch polymerase chain reaction) preceding treatment; no diagnostic testing and treating everyone; and not treating anyone. We modeled high-risk 65-year old patients from a health payer perspective and accrued outcomes over a patient's lifetime. We reported health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, and net health benefit (NHB) to measure cost-effectiveness per cohort of 100,000 patients. RESULTS: Treating everyone with no prior testing was the most cost-effective strategy, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, in over 85% of simulations. This strategy yielded the highest NHB of 15.0344 QALYs, but inappropriately treats all patients without influenza. Of the novel rapid diagnostics, NAAT resulted in the highest NHB (15.0277 QALYs), and the least number of deaths (1,571 per 100,000). Sensitivity analyses determined that results were most impacted by the pretest probability of ILI being influenza, diagnostic test sensitivity, and treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, treating high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness, without performing a novel rapid diagnostic test, resulted in the highest NHB and was most cost-effective. However, consideration of whether treatment is appropriate in the absence of diagnostic confirmation should be taken into account for decision-making by clinicians and policymakers.","Mac, Stephen; O039,; Reilly, Ryan; Adhikari, Neill K J; Fowler, Robert; Sander, Beate",PLoS One,329,24

Besides traditional risk factors, it is unknown whether the health deficit burden is related to the appearance of cardiovascular disease. In order to answer this question, the same multidimensional FI looking at 45-health deficits was serially calculated per participant at 4 time periods (0-16, 19-44, 45-54 and 60-64 years) using data from the 1946 Medical Research Council (MRC) British National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)-the world's longest running longitudinal birth cohort with continuous follow-up. From these the mean and total FI for the life-course, and the step change in deficit accumulation from one time period to another was derived. Echocardiographic data at 60-64 years provided: ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVmassi, BSA), myocardial contraction fraction indexed to BSA (MCFi) and E/e'. Generalized linear models assessed the association between FIs and echocardiographic parameters after adjustment for relevant covariates. 1375 participants were included. For each single new deficit accumulated at any one of the 4 time periods, LVmassi increased by 0.91-1.44% (p < 0.013), while MCFi decreased by 0.6-1.02% (p < 0.05). A unit increase in FI at age 45-54 and 60-64, decreased EF by 11-12% (p < 0.013). A single health deficit step change occurring between 60 and 64 years and one of the earlier time periods, translated into higher odds (2.1-78.5, p < 0.020) of elevated LV filling pressure. Thus, the accumulation of health deficits at any time period of the life-course associates with a maladaptive cardiac phenotype in older age, dominated by myocardial hypertrophy and poorer function.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Moon, James C; Hardy, Rebecca; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Hughes, Alun D; Captur, Gabriella",Sci Rep,329,16

RESULTS: Survival analysis showed HLH patients with infections other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and unknown causes experienced better 5-year overall survival (OS) than patients with HLH due to autoimmune disease, EBV or immunodeficiency (76% vs. 65, 33.3, 11%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, among all patients, non-response at 8 weeks was the most powerful predictor of poor OS. When treatment response was excluded, hemoglobin < 60 g/L and albumin < 25 g/L at diagnosis were associated with poor OS. In patients with EBV-HLH, hemoglobin < 60 g/L at diagnosis was associated with poor OS. A prognostic risk score was established and weighted based on hazard ratios calculated for three parameters measured at diagnosis: hemoglobin < 60 g/L (2 points), platelets < 30 × 109/L (1 point), albumin < 25 g/L (2 points). Five-year OS of low-risk (score 0-1), intermediate-risk (score 2), and poor-risk (score &#8805; 3) patients were 88, 38, and 22%, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that clinicians should be aware of predictive factors at diagnosis and consider 8-week treatment response to identify patients with high-risk of disease progression and the need for second-line therapy and allogeneic HCT.","Pan, Hua; Wang, Gaoyan; Guan, Enben; Song, Liang; Song, Aiqin; Liu, Xiaodan; Yi, Zhi; Sun, Li-Rong",BMC Pediatr,329,17

In this study, we investigated the epitaxial growth of PVDF-TrFE on a chitin film for developing triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The crystallographic match between the chitin and PVDF-TrFE enables the development of the intended crystal orientation, with the PVDF-TrFE polarization axis aligned perpendicular to the substrate. In addition, the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE on chitin not only enhances the performance of the TENG but also increases the stability of the hygroscopic chitin film against water. The corresponding TENG exhibits a significantly higher output current compared to that of a nonepitaxial PVDF-TrFE/chitin film. Furthermore, the triboelectric sensors based on epitaxial PVDF-TrFE/chitin films allow the monitoring of subtle pressures, suggesting that tailoring the crystal orientation of PVDF-TrFE is a promising approach for developing high-performance TENGs.","Eom, Kijoo; Shin, Young-Eun; Kim, Joong-Kwon; Joo, Se Hun; Kim, Kyungtae; Kwak, Sang Kyu; Ko, Hyunhyub; Jin, Jungho; Kang, Seok Ju",Nano lett,329,16

The experience of moral distress in nurses might be magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To explore causes of moral distress in nurses caring for Covid-19 patients and identify strategies to enhance their moral resiliency. RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative study using a qualitative content analysis of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We purposively sampled 31 nurses caring for Covid-19 patients in the acute care units within large academic medical systems in Maryland and New York City during April to June 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. RESULTS: We identified themes and sub-themes representative of major causes of moral distress in nurses caring Covid-19 patients. These included (a) lack of knowledge and uncertainty regarding how to treat a new illness; (b) being overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the Covid-19 illness; (c) fear of exposure to the virus leading to suboptimal care; (d) adopting a team model of nursing care that caused intra-professional tensions and miscommunications; (e) policies to reduce viral transmission (visitation policy and PPE policy) that prevented nurses to assume their caring role; (f) practicing within crisis standards of care; and (g) dealing with medical resource scarcity. Participants discussed their coping mechanisms and suggested future strategies. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our study affirms new causes of moral distress related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Institutions need to develop a supportive ethical climate that can restore nurses' moral resiliency. Such a climate should include non-hierarchical interdisciplinary spaces where all providers can meet together as moral peers to discuss their experiences.","Silverman, Henry J; Kheirbek, Raya Elfadel; Moscou-Jackson, Gyasi; Day, Jenni",Nurs Ethics,329,24

Out of them, the majority were females (249), with a median age of 47 years. Approximately 72% of patients were treated with HCQ (5 mg/kg/day), 37% with conventional synthetic disease-modifying drugs (47 mycophenolate, 37 azathioprine, 12 methotrexate, 4 cyclosporine, 1 colchicine), 15 patients were receiving biological agents (13 belimumab, 1 rituximab, and 1 abatacept), and more than half of the cohort were also taking corticosteroids (median dose 5 mg daily). A further 50 patients reported respiratory symptoms consistent with a viral infection, but they did not have access to the swab. These patients had a mild clinical course with a rapid resolution of symptoms. Serological test was performed in 2 patients with respiratory symptoms and was negative. No patients were admitted to hospital care and none reported a viral pneumonia. Even HCQ seems to not have a prophylactic role in the prevention of COVID-19 infection, as it has recently been shown by a randomised controlled trial, such conclusion cannot be drawn from this study which identified no confirmed cases of COVID-19. In conclusion, although they cannot exclude asymptomatic infections, the likely low incidence of COVID-19 in our SLE cohort could encourage the maintenance of ongoing rheumatological therapy. However, these are preliminary results that can only be regarded as tentative to help clinicians until replicated in larger cohorts.","Fasano, S.; Ciccia, F.",Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology,329,10

Mortality and case-fatality rates vary widely depending on incidence of COVID-19 and the testing policy in affected countries. To date, data comparing hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and influenza is scarce. METHODS: Data from patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients infected with influenza A (InfA) and B (InfB) virus during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. All patients were &#8805; 18 years old, had PCR-confirmed infection and needed hospital treatment. Demographic data, medical history, length-of-stay (LOS), complications including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 142 patients with COVID-19 were compared to 266 patients with InfA and 300 with InfB. Differences in median age (COVID-19 70.5 years vs InfA 70 years and InfB 77 years, p < 0.001) and laboratory results were observed. COVID-19 patients had fewer comorbidities, but complications (respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death) occurred more frequently. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was longer in COVID-19 patients (12 days vs InfA 7 days vs. InfB 7 days, p < 0.001). There was a fourfold higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (23.2%) when compared with InfA (5.6%) or InfB (4.7%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is associated with longer LOS, a higher number of complications and higher in-hospital mortality compared to influenza, even in a population with fewer co-morbidities. This data, a high reproduction number and limited treatment options, alongside excess mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, support the containment strategies implemented by most authorities.","Pawelka, Erich; Karolyi, Mario; Mader, Theresa; Omid, Sara; Kelani, Hasan; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Ely, Sarah; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Jilma, Bernd; Koenig, Franz; Laferl, Hermann; Traugott, Marianna; Turner, Michael; Seitz, Tamara; Wenisch, Christoph; Zoufaly, Alexander",Infection,329,22

This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality. Approach and Results: All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits.

New disease modifying treatments have changed the disease trajectories and most impressive results are seen if treatment is initiated in the presymptomatic phase of the disease. Very recently, the European Medicine Agency approved Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma®) for the treatment of patients with SMA with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene or the clinical presentation of SMA type 1. While this broad indication provides new opportunities, it also triggers discussions on the appropriate selection of patients in the context of limited available evidence.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement. ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney.","Massoth, Lucas R; Desai, Niyati; Szabolcs, Annamaria; Harris, Cynthia K; Neyaz, Azfar; Crotty, Rory; Chebib, Ivan; Rivera, Miguel N; Sholl, Lynette M; Stone, James R; Ting, David T; Deshpande, Vikram",Am J Surg Pathol,329,30

Continued research can shed light on potential longer-term impacts. An online survey of U.S. parents with 4- to 8-year-old children (n = 1000) was administered in October 2020. The survey examined parent-reported impacts of COVID-19 on lifestyle (e.g., work, child-care, grocery shopping), as well as current family food acquisition and eating behaviors (e.g., cooking, restaurant use). Descriptive statistics were calculated, incorporating sampling weights based on sociodemographics. In terms of COVID-19 impacts, parents reported increases in working from home, decreased work hours, and increased child care and instruction, with most children attending school or receiving care at home. Parents reported increased home cooking and online grocery shopping; only 33% reported increased take-out or delivery from restaurants. About half of parents reported that their child dined at restaurants, 62% reported getting take-out, and 57% reported delivery from restaurants at least 2-3 times per month. About half viewed dining at restaurants as safe, while take-out and delivery were seen as safe by around three-quarters. Approximately two-thirds reported recent food insecurity.

We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.

Although in the case of uniform lockdown, a simple compartmental model would indicate instantaneous transition to decay of the epidemic, this is not the case when partially isolated active clusters remain with the potential to create a series of small outbreaks. We model this using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm based on a connected set of stochastic susceptible-infected-removed/recovered networks representing the locked-down majority population (in which the reproduction number is less than 1) weakly coupled to a large set of small clusters in which the infection may propagate. We find that the presence of such active clusters can lead to slower than expected decay of the epidemic and significantly delayed onset of the decay phase. We study the relative contributions of these changes, caused by the active clusters within the population, to the additional total infected population. We also demonstrate that limiting the size of the inevitable active clusters can be efficient in reducing their impact on the overall size of the epidemic outbreak. The deceleration of the decay phase becomes apparent when the active clusters form at least 5% of the population.","Khataee, Hamid; Kibble, Jack; Scheuring, Istvan; Czirok, Andras; Neufeld, Zoltan",Biophys. j,329,16

However, complement contribution to endotheliopathy and hypercoagulability has not been elucidated yet. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association among complement activation, endothelial damage and disease severity or activity in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single-centre cohort study, 148 patients with COVID-19 of different severity were evaluated upon hospital admission and 30 days later. Markers of complement activation (SC5b-9 and C5a) and endothelial perturbation (von Willebrand factor [vWF], tissue-type plasminogen activator [t-PA], plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], soluble thrombomodulin [sTM], and soluble endothelial selectin [sE-selectin]) were measured in plasma. RESULTS: The patients had high plasma levels of SC5b-9 and C5a (p = 0.0001 for both) and vWF, t-PA and PAI-1 (p = 0.0001 for all). Their SC5b-9 levels correlated with those of vWF (r = 0.517, p = 0.0001) and paralleled disease severity (severe vs mild p = 0.0001, severe vs moderate p = 0.026 and moderate vs mild p = 0.001). The levels of sE-selectin were significantly increased only in the patients with severe disease. After 30 days, plasma SC5b-9, C5a and vWF levels had significantly decreased (p = 0.0001 for all), and 43% of the evaluated patients had normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Complement activation is boosted during the progression of COVID-19 and dampened during remission, thus indicating its role in the pathophysiology of the disease. The association between complement activation and the biomarkers of endothelial damage suggests that complement may contribute to tissue injury and could be the target of specific therapy.","Cugno, Massimo; Meroni, Pier Luigi; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Griffini, Samantha; Grovetti, Elena; Torri, Adriana; Lonati, Paola; Grossi, Claudia; Borghi, Maria Orietta; Novembrino, Cristina; Boscolo, Massimo; Uceda Renteria, Sara Colonia; Valenti, Luca; Lamorte, Giuseppe; Manunta, Maria; Prati, Daniele; Pesenti, Antonio; Blasi, Francesco; Costantino, Giorgio; Gori, Andrea; Bandera, Alessandra; Tedesco, Francesco; Peyvandi, Flora",J Autoimmun,329,32

Our primary aim was to study the relationship between adolescents' resilience and their participation in online sports programs during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. Our secondary aims were to assess the associations between the organized sports programs' determinants and resilience. Methods: Online surveys designed to examine resilience, lifestyle, psychosocial health and characteristics of the organized sports programs were administered to 473 adolescents who were enrolled in organized sports programs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Adolescents who continued to participate in online structured programs during the lockdown period were significantly more resilient and physically active, had higher self-related health, satisfaction with life, and ability to cope during the pandemic, compared to those who did not participate. Relationships with the adult instructor and levels of physical activity were the most important factors of the programs that were associated with resilience. Conclusions: Participation of adolescents in sports programs is an important resource associated with higher levels of resilience. Youth programs should continue their activities during globally challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Constantini, K.; Markus, I.; Epel, N.; Jakobovich, R.; Gepner, Y.; Lev-Ari, S.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],329,17

We define emergency politics as a mode of politics in which actions departing from convention are rationalised as necessary responses to exceptional and urgent threats. Arguably, the many crises affecting the EU in the recent past have made this mode increasingly salient. To capture its various expressions, the article presents a new typology of the forms that emergency politics can take in this setting, identifying four in particular: supranational, multilateral, unilateral and domestic. It connects these to the events of the last decade, spanning eurozone economics, migration, and Covid-19. We conclude by considering the variable consequences of these different types of emergency politics, in particular for the EU’s normative and sociological legitimacy.

We developed a process including acid leaching, solvent extraction and stripping in order to recycle spent catalyst. In this study, we conducted selective recovery of molybdenum through focus on finding an optimized extraction and stripping process by comparing different extractants and stripping agents. To separate molybdenum from other metals efficiently and figure out the mechanism of extraction process, the five different extractants of methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride, tri-n-octylamine, tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate and tributyl phosphate with different functional groups were examined, the extraction ability and extraction mechanism of these five extractants were systematically studied under the same system for the first time. It was found that more than 98% of the molybdenum could be extracted with an organic phase consisting of tri-n-octylamine or methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride under the optimal conditions. The result indicated that the tri-n-octylamine and methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride possess excellent molybdenum extraction ability, the extraction capacity of the rest extractants was in the order of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate > tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine > tributyl phosphate. In the stripping process, NH4OH, NaOH and H2SO4 were chosen as stripping agent to strip the molybdenum from the loaded tri-n-octylamine organic phase. the stripping ability of the three studied stripping agent were in the order NaOH > NH4OH > H2SO4. The FTIR spectra showed that the structure of tri-n-octylamine organic phase was stable during the extraction and stripping process. Result showed that molybdenum could be highly and efficiently recovered by optimized extraction and stripping process.","Zhang, Menglei; Song, Hao; Zheng, Chenghang; Lin, Zhenglong; Liu, Yi; Wu, Weihong; Gao, Xiang",,329,14

In Togo, where four in five people practice self-medication, the absence of a cure for COVID-19 and the constant progression of the disease requires an assessment of self-medication patterns in the context of the pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 and its associated factors in Lomé, Togo. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lomé, the capital city of Togo, from April 23rd to May 8th, 2020, with a sample of participants from five sectors: the healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal sectors. The participants were invited to provide information about their self-medication practices to prevent COVID-19 in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants (71.6% men) with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included. Approximately 22.1% were in the air transport sector, 20.5% were in the police sector, and 38.7% were in the health sector. The overall prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 was 34.2% (95% CI: 31.2-37.3%). The most commonly used products were vitamin C (27.6%) and traditional medicine (10.2%). Only 2.0% of participants reported using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Female sex (aOR=1.90; p< 0.001), work in the health sector (aOR=1.89; p= 0.001), secondary education level (aOR= 2.28; p= 0.043) and university education level (aOR= 5.11; p< 0.001) were associated with self-medication. CONCLUSION: One-third of the individuals in high-risk populations in Lomé practiced self-medication. Intensifying awareness campaigns is crucial to fight misinformation about alleged COVID-19 prevention products on social media.","Sadio, Arnold J; Gbeasor-Komlanvi, Fifonsi A; Konu, Rodion Y; Bakoubayi, Akila W; Tchankoni, Martin K; Bitty-Anderson, Alexandra M; Gomez, Iris M; Denadou, Claudia P; Anani, Joël; Kouanfack, Harold R; Kpeto, Innocent K; Salou, Mounerou; Ekouevi, Didier K",BMC Public Health,329,1

Therefore, it is advantageous for human performance laboratories to continue operating during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. All institutions should adhere to general COVID-19 guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control. Because of the testing environment, CPX laboratories must consider additional precautionary safety measures. This article provides recommendations for modifying the CPX protocol to ensure safety for all stakeholders during the pandemic. These modifications are universal across all populations, types of institutions and testing modalities. Preliminary measures include careful review of federal, local, and institutional mandates. The description outlines how to evaluate a testing environment and alter workflow. Guidelines are provided on what specific personal protective equipment should be acquired; as well as necessary actions before, during, and after the CPX test. These precautions will limit the possibility of both clients and staff from contracting or spreading the disease while maintaining testing volume in the laboratory.","Duscha, Brian D; Johnson, Johanna L; Bennett, William C; Ball, Kelsey N; Mae Fos, Liezl B; Reaves, Megan A; Kraus, William E",Curr Sports Med Rep,329,6

Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. There remains a need to find other innovative drug candidates as possible candidates to enter clinical evaluation and testing.","Tripathy, Satyajit; Dassarma, Barsha; Roy, Somenath; Chabalala, Hlupheka; Matsabisa, Motlalepula Gilbert",Int J Antimicrob Agents,329,21

Most of existing methods can be summarized as anomaly object detection-based and reconstruction error-based techniques. However, due to the bottleneck of defining encompasses of real-world high-diversity outliers and inaccessible inference process, individually, most of them have not derived groundbreaking progress. To deal with those imperfectness, and motivated by memory-based decision-making and visual attention mechanism as a filter to select environmental information in human vision perceptual system, in this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Memory with hash addressing Autoencoder network (MAMA Net) for anomaly detection. First, to overcome a battery of problems result from the restricted stationary receptive field of convolution operator, we coin the multi-scale global spatial attention block which can be straightforwardly plugged into any networks as sampling, upsampling and downsampling function. On account of its efficient features representation ability, networks can achieve competitive results with only several level blocks. Second, it's observed that traditional autoencoder can only learn an ambiguous model that also reconstructs anomalies ""well"" due to lack of constraints in training and inference process. To mitigate this challenge, we design a hash addressing memory module that proves abnormalities to produce higher reconstruction error for classification. In addition, we couple the mean square error (MSE) with Wasserstein loss to improve the encoding data distribution.

Whether the virus plays a role as canine pathogen and whether it is distributed elsewhere, in other geographical areas, is not known. We performed a case-control study to investigate the possible association of CaChPV with enteritis in dogs. CaChPV DNA was detected both in the stools of diarrhoeic dogs (1.9 %, 3/155) and of healthy animals (1.6 %, 2/120). All the CaChPV-infected dogs with diarrhea were mixed infected with other enteric viruses such as canine parvovirus (formerly CPV-2), canine bufavirus (CBuV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), whilst none of the asymptomatic CaChPV positive animals resulted co-infected. The nearly full-length genome and the partial capsid protein (VP) gene of three canine strains, Te/36OVUD/19/ITA, Te/37OVUD/19/ITA and Te/70OVUD/19/ITA, were reconstructed. Upon phylogenetic analyses based on the NS1 and VP aa sequences, the Italian CaChPV strains tightly clustered with the American reference viruses.

The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","Karan, Ebrahim; Asgari, Sadegh",Environ Syst Decis,329,24

Currently, the therapy benefits of antiviral experimental drugs are still uncertain. The main aim of this study is to describe the experience of a level III hospital regarding therapeutic management of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and to characterize clinical features and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study of patients with COVID-19 in a level III pediatric hospital in Portugal between March and June 2020. Experimental drugs were administered according to the best scientific evidence at the time as 'off-label use'. RESULTS: Among 200 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were admitted due to COVID-19. Median age was one year (23 days - 18 years), 43% had comorbidities and 20/37 (54%) received antiviral therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 13 patients, in monotherapy or combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or azithromycin. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered in eight patients and three children were treated with remdesivir. The patients who were treated had pneumonia (14), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (2), sepsis (2), myocarditis (1), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1), and mild illness with comorbidities (3). Other therapies included methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (3), enoxaparin (2), antibiotics (16), oxygen (7), corticosteroids, and other inhaled therapy (16). DISCUSSION: Several treatment approaches have been proposed for severe COVID-19, even though none of them had been proven effective or approved for small children. Currently, remdesivir is approved for children aged above 12 years-old. Although 54% of our patients were treated with antivirals, it is important to understand that the favorable clinical evolution could be related with the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of our population presented severe and critical disease, was hospitalized and received treatment according to the most recent data, although most patients had mild disease. COVID-19 treatment in children is a clinical challenge and clinical trials are urgently needed.","Saraiva, Bárbara Martins; Garcia, Ana Margarida; Silva, Tiago Milheiro; Gouveia, Catarina; Brito, Maria João",Acta med. port,329,1

They thus offer the unique opportunity to examine the relationship between mobility and disease incidence. The objective was to examine whether an association between COVID-19-confirmed case numbers and levels of mobility was apparent, and if so then to examine whether such data enhance disease modelling and prediction. CMR data for countries worldwide were cross-correlated with corresponding COVID-19-confirmed case numbers. Models were fitted to explain case numbers of each country's epidemic. Models using numerical date, contemporaneous and distributed lag CMR data were contrasted using Bayesian Information Criteria. Noticeable were negative correlations between CMR data and case incidence for prominent industrialised countries of Western Europe and the North Americas. Continent-wide examination found a negative correlation for all continents with the exception of South America. When modelling, CMR-expanded models proved superior to the model without CMR. The predictions made with the distributed lag model significantly outperformed all other models. The observed relationship between CMR data and case incidence, and its ability to enhance model quality and prediction suggests data related to community mobility could prove of use in future COVID-19 modelling.","Sulyok, M; Walker, M",Epidemiol Infect,329,1

While some NAS methods handle this issue by utilizing a supernet trained on a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet, they may be suboptimal if the target tasks are highly dissimilar from the dataset the supernet is trained on. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel neural network retrieval method, which retrieves the most optimal pre-trained network for a given task and constraints (e.g. number of parameters) from a model zoo. We train this framework by meta-learning a cross-modal latent space with contrastive loss, to maximize the similarity between a dataset and a network that obtains high performance on it, and minimize the similarity between an irrelevant dataset-network pair. We validate the efficacy of our method on ten real-world datasets, against existing NAS baselines. The results show that our method instantly retrieves networks that outperforms models obtained with the baselines with significantly fewer training steps to reach the target performance.","Jeong, Wonyong; Lee, Hayeon; Park, Gun; Hyung, Eunyoung; Baek, Jinheon; Hwang, Sung Ju",,329,1

This resulted in global supply bottlenecks for medical protective equipment. The so-called Maker Movement recognized this emerging problem early on and, with the help of additive manufacturing (AM), began developing and manufacturing half masks or face shields as personal protective equipment (PPE). This knowledge has been made available in many places in form of open source product data, so that products could be adapted and improved, saving development time. METHODS: This production and innovation potential has been taken up and professionalized by the authors of this article. By means of a proof-of-principle we provide an overview of the possibility and successful unique introduction of a so-called professional ""hybrid production"" in a micro factory using 3D-printing at the place of greatest demand in a hospital by medical personnel to produce their own PPE. Furthermore the learning process and future benefits of on site 3D-printing are described. RESULTS: Our proof-of-principle successfully showed that the allocation of 3D-printing capabilities in the hospital infrastructure is possible. With assistance of the engineers, responsible for product design and development, the medical staff was able to produce PPE by means of AM. However, due to legal uncertainties and high material and production costs the usability is severely limited. CONCLUSIONS: The practical research showed that a complete implementation of the concept and the short-term establishment of a 3D-printing factory for the autonomous supply of a hospital with PPE was not feasible without further efforts. Nevertheless, it has enabled the medical staff to use AM technologies for future research approaches.","Hartig, Sascha; Duda, Sven; Hildebrandt, Lennart",3D Print Med,329,1

Several factors that vary across geographies, such as age, existing disease prevalence, medical resource availability and deprivation, can trigger adverse effects on the National Health System during a pandemic. In this paper, we present data on these factors and combine them to create an index to show which areas are more exposed. This technique can help policy makers to moderate the impact of similar pandemics. DESIGN: We combine several sources of data, which describe specific risk factors linked with the outbreak of a respiratory pathogen, that could leave local areas vulnerable to the harmful consequences of large-scale outbreaks of contagious diseases. We combine these measures to generate an index of community-level vulnerability. SETTING: 91 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We merge 15 measures spatially to generate an index of community-level vulnerability. These measures cover prevalence rates of high-risk diseases; proxies for the at-risk population density; availability of staff and quality of healthcare facilities. RESULTS: We find that 80% of CCGs that score in the highest quartile of vulnerability are located in the North of England (24 out of 30). Here, vulnerability stems from a faster rate of population ageing and from the widespread presence of underlying at-risk diseases. These same areas, especially the North-East Coast areas of Lancashire, also appear vulnerable to adverse shocks to healthcare supply due to tighter labour markets for healthcare personnel. Importantly, our index correlates with a measure of social deprivation, indicating that these communities suffer from long-standing lack of economic opportunities and are characterised by low public and private resource endowments. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based policy is crucial to mitigate the health impact of pandemics such as COVID-19. While current attention focuses on curbing rates of contagion, we introduce a vulnerability index combining data that can help policy makers identify the most vulnerable communities. We find that this index is positively correlated with COVID-19 deaths and it can thus be used to guide targeted capacity building. These results suggest that a stronger focus on deprived and vulnerable communities is needed to tackle future threats from emerging and re-emerging infectious disease.","Nicodemo, Catia; Barzin, Samira; Cavalli, Nicolo039; Lasserson, Daniel; Moscone, Francesco; Redding, Stuart; Shaikh, Mujaheed",BMJ Open,329,3

Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiologic changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes in high-risk pregnancies may affect the pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin-(1-7) (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering angiotensin-(1-7) levels, which can mimic/worsen the vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials. We summarize guidelines for medical/obstetric care and outline future directions for optimization of treatment and preventive strategies for pregnant patients with COVID-19 with the understanding that relevant data are limited and rapidly changing.","Narang, Kavita; Enninga, Elizabeth Ann L; Gunaratne, Madugodaralalage D S K; Ibirogba, Eniola R; Trad, Ayssa Teles A; Elrefaei, Amro; Theiler, Regan N; Ruano, Rodrigo; Szymanski, Linda M; Chakraborty, Rana; Garovic, Vesna D",Mayo Clin Proc,329,26

Knowledge that one is less at risk after being vaccinated may alleviate distress, but this hypothesis remains unexplored. Here we test whether psychological distress declined in those vaccinated against COVID-19 in the US and whether changes in perceived risk mediated any association. MethodsA nationally-representative cohort of U.S. adults (N=5,792) in the Understanding America Study were interviewed every two weeks from March 2020 to June 2021 (28 waves). Difference-in-difference regression tested whether getting vaccinated reduced distress (PHQ-4 scores), with mediation analysis used to identify potential mechanisms, including perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. ResultsVaccination was associated with a 0.09 decline in distress scores (95% CI:-0.15 to -0.04) (0-12 scale), a 5.7% relative decrease compared to mean scores in the wave prior to vaccination. Vaccination was also associated with an 8.44 percentage point reduction in perceived risk of infection (95% CI:-9.15% to -7.73%), a 7.44-point reduction in perceived risk of hospitalization (95% CI:-8.07% to -6.82%), and a 5.03-point reduction in perceived risk of death (95% CI:-5.57% to -4.49%). Adjusting for risk perceptions decreased the vaccination-distress association by two-thirds. Event study models suggest vaccinated and never vaccinated respondents followed similar PHQ-4 trends pre-vaccination, diverging significantly post-vaccination. Analyses were robust to individual and wave fixed effects, time-varying controls, and several alternative modelling strategies. Results were similar across sociodemographic groups. ConclusionReceiving a COVID-19 vaccination was associated with declines in distress and perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Vaccination campaigns could promote these additional benefits of being vaccinated.","Koltai, Jonathan; Raifman, Julia; Bor, Jacob; McKee, Martin; Stuckler, David",,329,29

Thus, the study objective was to identify context-specific factors associated with testing positive for COVID-19 and fatality in Nigeria. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: COVID-19 surveillance and laboratory centres in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory reporting data to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time PCR testing during the study period 27 February-8 June 2020. METHODS: COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with both outcome variables, and findings are presented as adjusted ORs (aORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 36 496 patients were tested for COVID-19, with 10 517 confirmed cases. Of 3215 confirmed cases with available clinical outcomes, 295 died. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 positivity were older age (p value for trend<0.0001), male sex (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18) and the following presenting symptoms: cough (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.32), fever (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.71), loss of smell (aOR 7.78, 95% CI 5.19 to 11.66) and loss of taste (aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.90). An increased risk of mortality following COVID-19 was observed in those aged &#8805;51 years, patients in farming occupation (aOR 7.56, 95% CI 1.70 to 33.53) and those presenting with cough (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.01), breathing difficulties (aOR 5.68, 95% CI 3.77 to 8.58) and vomiting (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.84). CONCLUSION: The significant risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality in the Nigerian population are similar to those reported in studies from other countries and should guide clinical decisions for COVID-19 testing and specialist care referrals.","Elimian, Kelly Osezele; Ochu, Chinwe Lucia; Ebhodaghe, Blessing; Myles, Puja; Crawford, Emily E; Igumbor, Ehimario; Ukponu, Winifred; Olayinka, Adobola; Aruna, Olusola; Dan-Nwafor, Chioma; Olawepo, Olatayo Ayodeji; Ogunbode, Oladipo; Atteh, Rhoda; Nwachukwu, William; Venkatesan, Sudhir; Obagha, Chijioke; Ngishe, Samuel; Suleiman, Kabir; Usman, Muhammad; Yusuff, Hakeem Abiola; Nwadiuto, Ifeoma; Mohammed, Abbas Aliyu; Usman, Rabi; Mba, Nwando; Aderinola, Olaolu; Ilori, Elsie; Oladejo, John; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Ihekweazu, Chikwe",BMJ Open,329,16

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of echocardiography in assessing the anatomy of coronary arteries in neonates with transposition of the great arteries, and determine impact on outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Preoperative echocardiographic coronary artery pattern and surgical intraoperative reports were compared. Mismatch between transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports and the impact on perioperative outcome were assessed. Coronary patterns were classified into four groups: type 1 (normal); type 2 (risk of coronary with intramural course); type 3 (coronary loop); and type 2+3. RESULTS: Overall, 108 neonates who underwent an arterial switch operation were included: 68 were classified as type 1; seven as type 2; 32 as type 3; and one as type 2+3. Overall, 10 adverse events occurred. Five patients died, three from coronary causes. Survival was 96% at 1 month. Transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports differed in 17.6% of cases. Mortality was 15.8% in case of inappropriate diagnosis and 2.2% for appropriate diagnosis (P=0.01). Mortality in type 2 was 66.7% in case of discordance versus 0% when concordant. Multivariable analysis found that inappropriate preoperative transthoracic echocardiography diagnosis of coronary pattern was the only significant risk factor for mortality (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography can assess coronary artery anatomy in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Intramural coronary course is often misdiagnosed. Preoperative misdiagnosis of coronary artery anomaly may impact perioperative mortality. However, this assessment will have to be confirmed by further larger studies.","Bertail-Galoin, Claire; Leconte, Cecile; Bakloul, Mohamed; Perouse-de-Montclos, Thomas; Moulin-Zinsch, Anne; Martin-Bonnet, Caroline; Debost, Bernard; Di Filippo, Sylvie",Arch.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng, Bi-Heng; Xia, Zhong-Yuan; Meng, Qing-Tao",Can J Anaesth,329,33

It causes mild to severe respiratory illness with some flu-like symptoms. The causal virus behind this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), conceivably attacks the receptors of the respiratory system of the human body but has no strict evidence of attacking the blood cells yet. However, patients with hemoglobin disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia, thalassemia) are vulnerable to this global health situation due to their clinical complications. Such patients are generally more prone to viral and bacterial infections, which can worsen their physical condition. Some of these patients present immunocompromised conditions, e.g., splenectomized or post-transplant patients. Therefore, they should follow some preventive steps such as shielding as well as the general guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent evidence suggests a growing number of older patients continue to suffer serious neurological comorbidities including polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular disease, central nervous system infection, cognitive deficits, and fatigue following discharge. Studies suggest that complaints manifest late in disease and persist beyond resolution of acute COVID-19 symptoms. Recent research reports that neurocognitive symptoms are correlated with severe disease, older age, male gender, and comorbidities including hypertension, renal failure, and neoplastic disease. The underlying causes are unclear, but current hypotheses include hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, immunopathological mechanisms, and neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for more research into the underlying mechanisms of post-COVID-19 neurological sequela, particularly in the elderly, a population already burdened with neurocognitive disorders.","Krupp, Karl; Madhivanan, Purnima; Killgore, William D. “Scott”; Ruiz, John M.; Carvajal, Scott; Coull, Bruce M.; Grandner, Michael A.",Adv Geriatr Med Res,329,24

In clinical practice, there are no appropriate tools to evaluate whether HFNC therapy was successful or failed after planned extubation. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated whether the use of the ROX index was appropriate to differentiate between HFNC success and failure within 72 h after extubation and to develop an integrated model including the ROX index to improve the prediction of HFNC success in patients receiving HFNC therapy after planned extubation. Of 276 patients, 50 patients (18.1%) were reintubated within 72 h of extubation. ROX index values of >8.7 at 2 h, >8.7 at 6 h, and >10.4 at 12 h after HFNC therapy were all meaningful predictors of HFNC success in extubated patients. In addition, the integrated model including the ROX index had a better predictive capability for HFNC success than the ROX index alone. In conclusion, the ROX index at 2, 6, and 12 h could be applied to extubated patients to predict HFNC success after planned extubation. To improve its predictive power, we should also consider an integrated model consisting of the ROX index, sex, body mass index, and the total duration of ventilator care.","Lee, Young Seok; Chang, Sung Won; Sim, Jae Kyeom; Kim, Sua; Kim, Je Hyeong",J Clin Med,329,24

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest challenge for pancreatic surgeons is the difficulty in providing oncological care. In this review article, from the standpoint of surgeons, we explain the concept of triaging of patients with pancreatic tumors under the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actual impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumors. The most vital points in selecting the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic are (1) Oncologists need to tailor the treatment plan based on the COVID-19 phase, tumor malignant potential, and patients’ comorbidities; and (2) Optimal treatment for pancreatic cancer should be planned according to the condition of each patient and tumor resectability based on national comprehensive cancer network resectability criteria. To choose the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic, we need to tailor the treatment plan based on elective surgery acuity scale (ESAS). Newly established ESAS for pancreatic tumor and flowchart indicating the treatment strategy of pancreatic cancer, are feasible to overcome this situation.","Kato, Hiroyuki; Asano, Yukio; Arakawa, Satoshi; Ito, Masahiro; Kawabe, Norihiko; Shimura, Masahiro; Hayashi, Chihiro; Ochi, Takayuki; Yasuoka, Hironobu; Higashiguchi, Takahiko; Kondo, Yuka; Nagata, Hidetoshi; Horiguchi, Akihiko",World J Clin Cases,329,20

In this 12-week, 2 × 2 factorial study, participants were randomly allocated into one of four groups: dairy milk beverage (DM), exercise and dairy milk beverage (EX+DM), exercise alone (EX), and control (CON). The EX group underwent a 12-week whole-body PRT schedule (three sessions/week) and a high-protein dairy milk beverage (DM) was consumed twice daily (30 g protein/day). At weeks 0, 6, and 12, body composition (iDXA), strength [one-repetition maximum (1RM): leg press, chest press, lateral (lat) pull-down, and handgrip], power (countermovement jump), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2)), and physical performance (gait speed) were measured. Before measurements, blood samples were collected to determine the immune (i.e., leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory cytokines) and hormonal (i.e., insulin, cortisol, IGF-1, testosterone, and estradiol) profiles. Participants (n = 37) completed the study within the controlled experimental conditions. Protein intake increased in the EX+DM [mean ± SD, 1.2 ± 0.2 to 1.8 ± 0.4 g/kg body mass (BM) per day(−1)] and DM (1.3 ± 0.5 to 1.8 ± 0.6 g kg(−1) BM day(−1)) groups during the intervention. Absolute fat-free mass increased in the EX+DM [mean (95% confidence interval) = 0.65 (0.25–1.0) kg] and EX [0.49 (−0.44 to 1.40) kg] groups (P < 0.001) compared to DM [−0.54 (−1.6 to 0.05) kg]. Relative fat mass decreased (group(*)time, P = 0.018) in DM [−1.8% (−3.3 to −0.35%)] and EX+DM [−1.3% (−2.3 to −0.31%)], which was a greater reduction than that in the CON [0.10% (−0.80 to 1.0%)] group (P < 0.01). Relative maximal strength increased in both the EX and EX+DM (≥35%, P < 0.05) groups, but not in the DM and CON groups. The change in 1RM strength outcomes was higher in EX+DM compared to all other groups (53–78%, P < 0.01). There was an increase in resting plasma IL-10 concentration in EX+DM (88%), compared to all the other groups (P = 0.016). No other differences in systemic inflammatory cytokines were observed. There were no significant changes in all hormone concentrations measured among all groups. In conclusion, a high-protein dairy milk beverage providing additional protein did not further enhance the effects of PRT on outcomes of fat-free mass, power, or physical performance. However, there was a significant augmentative effect for high-protein dairy milk consumption on changes to maximal strength outcomes during PRT in healthy active older adults.","Huschtscha, Zoya; Parr, Alexandra; Porter, Judi; Costa, Ricardo J.

The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS as a diagnostic indicator for assessing suspicion of lung involvement of COVID-19 on a scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). We investigated retrospectively 154 adult patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, between April and June 2020, who underwent chest CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients’ average age was 61.3 years (range, 21–93), 101 were male, and 76 were RT-PCR positive. Using CO-RADS, four radiologists evaluated the chest CT images. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) by comparing the individual reader’s score to the median of the remaining three radiologists. The average sensitivity was 87.8% (range, 80.2–93.4%), specificity was 66.4% (range, 51.3–84.5%), and AUC was 0.859 (range, 0.847–0.881); there was no significant difference between the readers (p > 0.200). In 325 (52.8%) of 616 observations, there was absolute agreement among observers. The average ICC of readers was 0.840 (range, 0.800–0.874; p < 0.001).

The objective of this study was to analyze the quantity and quality of research activity in the field of infectious diseases in Arab countries and compare it with that in non-Arab countries. METHODS: Documents published in Arab countries within the research category of “infectious diseases” were extracted and analyzed using the Web of Science database. The data analyzed represent research productivity during the time interval between 1900 – 2012. RESULTS: Worldwide, the total number of documents published in the field of infectious diseases up to 2012 was 227,188. A total of 2,408 documents in the field of infectious diseases were published in Arab countries, which represents 1.06% of worldwide research output. Research output from Arab countries in the field of infectious diseases was low for decades. However, approximately a five-fold increase was observed in the past decade. Arab countries ranked 56(th) to 218(th) on the standard competition ranking (SCR) in worldwide publications in the field of infectious diseases. Egypt, with a total publication of 464 (19.27%) documents ranked first among Arab countries, while Kuwait University was the most productive institution with a total of 158 (6.56%) documents. Average citation per document published in Arab countries was 13.25 and the h-index was 64. Tuberculosis (230; 9.55%), malaria (223; 9.26%), and hepatitis (189; 7.8%) were the top three infectious diseases studied as according to the retrieved documents. CONCLUSION: The present data reveals that some Arab countries contribute significantly to the field of infectious diseases. However, Arab countries need to work harder to bridge the gap in this field. Compared with non-Arab countries in the Middle East, research output from Arab countries was high, but more efforts are needed to enhance the quality of this output. Future research in the field should be encouraged and correctly directed.

Objective: The objective of this study was to know the psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the nursing professionals working for the Rioja Health Service. Methods: We conducted an observational and descriptive cross-sectional study. The nursing staff at the Rioja Health Service were invited to respond to a self-administered questionnaire between June and August 2020. Results: A total of 605 health professionals participated in the questionnaire; 91.9% were women, 63.14% were registered nurses, and 36.28% were auxiliary nurses. Risk factors for mental health professionals were identified in more than 90% of nurses (p = 0.009), affecting their psychological state with feelings of exhaustion, emotional overload (p = 0.002), and less use of coping strategies among women. Younger professionals with less experience had higher levels of stress compared to those with more than five years of experience, who showed a progressive reduction in the impact of stressors (p < 0.001). Professionals with dependent family members presented higher levels of emotional overload and coping problems (p = 0.009). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant psychological impact on health professionals in terms of stress, emotional well-being, and the use of coping strategies.

Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID‐19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID‐19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non‐COVID‐19, mortality (COVID‐19 = 38.2% vs. non‐COVID‐19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non‐COVID‐19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C‐reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin‐6] was indifferent, d‐dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID‐19 = 23.7% vs. non‐COVID‐19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID‐19 = 17.1% vs. non‐COVID‐19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID‐19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID‐19. While mortality was also similar, COVID‐19 is characterized with increased thrombogenicity and high pulmonary embolism rates.","Jirak, Peter; Larbig, Robert; Shomanova, Zornitsa; Fröb, Elisabeth J.; Dankl, Daniel; Torgersen, Christian; Frank, Nino; Mahringer, Magdalena; Butkiene, Dominyka; Haake, Hendrik; Salzer, Helmut J.F.; Tschoellitsch, Thomas; Lichtenauer, Michael; Egle, Alexander; Lamprecht, Bernd; Reinecke, Holger; Hoppe, Uta C.; Pistulli, Rudin; Motloch, Lukas J.",ESC Heart Fail,329,6

Such considerable influence can be greater in vulnerable populations including pregnant women. This study aimed to assess the presence of prenatal depression (PND, as an important risk factor of postpartum depression) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to characterize infection‐induced preventive behaviors and psychological responses in the early phase of COVID‐19 outbreak. METHODS: Based on a population‐based sample of pregnant women from all regions in China, presence of probable PND and suspected PTSD were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (≥13) and the PTSD Checklist (≥14), respectively. A web‐based questionnaire was used to assess psychological and behavioral responses to COVID‐19. RESULTS: Among a total of 1908 questionnaires returned, 1901 women provided valid data (mean [SD] age, 28.9 [4.7] years). High prevalence of probable PND (34%) and suspected PTSD (40%) among pregnant women was observed. Those with suspected PTSD presented six times higher risk of probable PND than the non‐suspected (OR=7.83, 95% CI: 6.29–9.75; p<0.001). Most women (91%–96%) reported anxiousness about infection of themselves and the members within their social network. Lack of security and loss of freedom were reported in approximately two‐thirds of pregnant women. More frequent preventive behaviors, including handwashing, use of facemasks, and staying at home, were undertaken in more than 80% of the sample. Anxiousness of miscarriage and preterm birth were prevalent (>75%). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of PND and PTSD and high levels of anxiety suggest profound impacts of the present outbreak on mental health. This calls for special attention and support for vulnerable populations. Mental health care should become part of public health measures during the present outbreak and should continue to be intensified to empower the health system for post‐outbreak periods.","Zhang, Casper J.

METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to 17 December 2020. Studies that reported clinical data on patients with COVID-19 and pericarditis were included. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical and continuous variables [meanâ±âstandard deviation or median (interquartile range)]. As an exploratory analysis, differences between patients with acute pericarditis and myopericarditis were compared. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies (32 case reports and 1 case series) involving 34 patients were included. The mean age was 51.6â±â19.5âyears and 62% of patients were men. Sixty-two percentage of patients were diagnosed with myopericarditis. The most frequent electrocardiographic pattern (56%) was diffuse ST-elevation and PR depression.

The median values of C-reactive protein [77âmg/dl (12-177)] and white blood cells [12â335âcells/µl (5625-16â500)] were above the normal range. Thirty-eight percent and 53% of patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine, respectively. These drugs were more frequently used in patients with acute pericarditis compared with myopericarditis. The in-hospital mortality was 6% without a significant difference between both groups. CONCLUSION: Our review shows that COVID-19 patients with pericarditis had similar clinical features to other viral cardiotropic infections. However, NSAIDs and colchicine were used in half or less of the cases. Overall, the short-term prognosis was good across groups.","Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Saucedo-Chinchay, Jose; Imazio, Massimo",J. cardiovasc. med. (Hagerstown),329,1

Methods: This study evaluated the association of underlying CVD with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to intensive care due to disease progression. The patients were divided with and without CVD as well as stable and intensive care groups. Results: Of 332 patients with mild COVID-19, median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of 48 (14.5%) patients with CVD, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CVD, patients with CVD were older, and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CVD than in patients without CVD (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease than in patients without hypertension or coronary heart disease. The multivariable regression model showed CVD served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (Odd ratio [OR], 2.652 [95% CI, 1.019-6.899]) after adjustment for various cofounders.

In view of the limitations of existing diagnostic techniques, the present theoretical study proposes a novel scheme of detecting virus-like particles employing whispering gallery and quasi-whispering gallery resonant modes of a composite optical system. Whereas whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are conventionally realized using micro-disk, -ring, -toroid or spherical structures, the present study utilizes a rotationally symmetric array of silicon nanowires which offers higher sensitivity compared to the conventional WGM resonator while detecting virus-like particles. Notwithstanding the relatively low quality factor of the system, the underlying multiple-scattering mediated photon entrapment, coupled with peripheral total-internal reflection, results in high fidelity of the system against low signal-to-noise ratio. Finite difference time domain based numerical analysis has been performed to correlate resonant modes of the array with spatial location of the virus. The correlation has been subsequently utilized for statistical analysis of simulated test cases. Assuming detection to be limited by resolution of the measurement system, results of the analysis suggest that for only about 5% of the simulate test cases the resonant wavelength shift lies within the minimum detection range of 0.001-0.01 nm. For a single virus of 160 nm diameter, more than 8 nm shift of the resonant mode and nearly 100% change of quality factor are attained with the proposed nanowire array based photonic structure.","Hassan, Mohammad Muntasir; Baten, Md Zunaid",Opt Express,329,20

Use PPE!,19.280611,11.63743,2021-02-15,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐COV‐2), a novel coronavirus responsible for the recent infectious pandemic, is known to downregulate angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2). Most current investigations focused on SARS‐COV‐2‐related effects on the renin–angiotensin system and especially the resultant increase in angiotensin II, neglecting its effects on the kinin–kallikrein system. SARS‐COV‐2‐induced ACE2 inhibition leads to the augmentation of bradykinin 1‐receptor effects, as ACE2 inactivates des‐Arg9‐bradykinin, a bradykinin metabolite. SARS‐COV‐2 also decreases bradykinin 2‐receptor effects as it affects bradykinin synthesis by inhibiting cathepsin L, a kininogenase present at the site of infection and involved in bradykinin production. The physiologies of both the renin–angiotensin and kinin–kallikrein system are functionally related suggesting that any intervention aiming to treat SARS‐COV‐2‐infected patients by triggering one system but ignoring the other may not be adequately effective. Interestingly, the snake‐derived bradykinin‐potentiating peptide (BPP‐10c) acts on both systems. BPP‐10c strongly decreases angiotensin II by inhibiting ACE, increasing bradykinin‐related effects on the bradykinin 2‐receptor and increasing nitric oxide‐mediated effects. Based on a narrative review of the literature, we suggest that BPP‐10c could be an optimally effective option to consider when aiming at developing an anti‐SARS‐COV‐2 drug.","Gouda, Ahmed S.; Mégarbane, Bruno",Drug Dev Res,329,3

It is therefore a central player in the immune response to infectious pathogens, but its contribution is often clouded by multiple roles acting on different cells in time and space. Hence, context is all-important in understanding when TGF-β is beneficial or detrimental to the outcome of infection. In this review, a full range of infectious agents from viruses to helminth parasites are explored within this framework, drawing contrasts and general conclusions about the importance of TGF-β in these diseases.","Maizels, Rick M",Advances in immunology,329,1

MERS-CoV causes an acute lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~35.5%. Currently, there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against MERS in the world. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein plays the most important role in the viral life cycle (virus internalization). The S protein is an immunodominant antigen and the main target for neutralizing antibodies. In the present study, the immunogenicities of five different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein were compared: the full-length S glycoprotein, the full-length S glycoprotein with the transmembrane domain of the G glycoprotein of VSV (S-G), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein, the membrane-fused RBD (the RBD fused with the transmembrane domain of the VSV G glycoprotein (RBD-G)), and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc). Recombinant vectors based on human adenoviruses type 5 (rAd5) were used as delivery vehicles. Vaccination with all of the developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response in mice. The most robust humoral immune response was induced after the animal had been vaccinated with the membrane-fused RBD (rAd5-RBD-G). Only immunization with membrane forms of the glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) elicited neutralizing antibodies among all vaccinated animals. The most significant cellular immune response was induced after vaccination of the animals with the full-length S (rAd5-S). These investigations suggest that the full-length S and the membrane form of the RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of S glycoprotein.","Ozharovskaia, T.

We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures. METHODS: We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. RESULTS: 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.","Mehta, Nisha S; Mytton, Oliver T; Mullins, Edward W S; Fowler, Tom A; Falconer, Catherine L; Murphy, Orla B; Langenberg, Claudia; Jayatunga, Wikum J P; Eddy, Danielle H; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S",Clin Infect Dis,329,19
