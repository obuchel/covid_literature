29510,Nariz,2010-01-11,"The term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory. Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins—from bacteria to snakes—is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.","Clark, David P.; Pazdernik, Nanette J.",Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150198/,760
46549,RELATO DE CASO ‐ SÍNDROME DE KAWASAKI LIKE EM PACIENTE COM SUSPEITA DE MENINGITE,2021-03-06,"One way for policymakers to reduce labor costs and stimulate the recruitment of marginalized groups of labor in a highly unionized economy is to lower payroll taxes. However, the efficiency of this policy instrument has been questioned, and previous evaluations have mostly found small employment effects for such reforms. We investigate the effects of a payroll tax cut in Sweden that decreased firms’ labor costs in relation to the number of young employees that they had employed when the reform was implemented in 2007. We find that most firms received small labor cost savings as a result of the reform, but those that received larger cost savings increased their number of employees significantly more than firms that received no, or minor, labor cost savings. Our findings also suggest that the payroll tax cut increased the total wages paid to incumbent workers, but the wage effect was too small to offset the positive extensive-margin employment effect of the reform. In total, we find that the Swedish payroll tax reform created 18,100 jobs over the period 2006–2008; most of these jobs were within the targeted group of young employees.

53320,980 An Audit of a Surgical Ambulatory Service [SAmS] Performance Pre And Post COVID-19 - The Impact of Senior Decision Making,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Telemedicine can be broadly defined as the use of telecommunication technologies to provide medical information and services. It can be audio, visual, or text. Its use has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure patient and healthcare worker safety. Any healthcare professional can engage with it. It carries benefits like reduced stress and expense of traveling, maintenance of social distancing, and reduced risk of infection. There are some potential drawbacks such as lack of physical examination, liability and technological issues. Methods A questionnaire was sent to 200 patients, selected from different virtual clinics (new and review, doctor and ANP led) run between March and May 2020 in the rheumatology department of University Hospital Waterford. We formulated 14 questions to cover the following aspects: demography, the purpose of the consult, punctuality, feedback, medico-legal concerns, and free text for comments. A self-addressed return envelope was included. Results 83 responses were received. 2 were excluded. The ratio of females to male respondents was 59: 41, with the majority over 60 years old. The main appointment type was review 67 (83%). 80% of patients were called either before or at the time of their scheduled appointment. The vast majority (98.8%) of our patients had confidence in our data protection and trusted our system to maintain their confidentiality. 95% stated that they felt comfortable, were given enough time to explain their health problem and felt free from stress. The respondents who preferred attending the clinic in person (17 in total) compared to the virtual were mostly follow up patients- 12 vs. 5 new. Conclusion Patient satisfaction among those surveyed was high, despite having to introduce the service abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many improvements we can adopt to improve our service and even maintain after the pandemic as a way of communicating with our stable patients. As we are covering a large geographical catchment, we can continue to implement the virtual clinic for some appointments. We should prioritize our efforts on identifying the right patient and the type of service we can offer, further training of staff, and increasing awareness of the patients as to how to get the most out of a virtual appointment.

An 80-year-old man, who underwent partial colectomy with functional end-to-end anastomosis for splenic flexure colon cancer 10 years earlier, presented with a chief complaint of anorexia. Complete blood count showed anemia, and the fecal occult blood test was positive. Lower gastrointestinal series showed an irregular defect of the splenic flexure, and colonoscopy showed an ulcerated tumor on the staple line of the primary surgery. Partial colectomy was performed, and the tumor was pathologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, resembling the pathology of primary colon cancer. This case suggests the importance of considering staple-line recurrence after functional end-to-end anastomosis for colon cancer even more than 5 years after primary surgery.","Ouchi, Akira; Asano, Masahiko; Aono, Keiya; Watanabe, Tetsuya; Oya, Shingo",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-014-0011-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26943375/,760

METHODS Zucker diabetic fatty rats were randomized into three surgical groups: Sham, small bowel resection, and small bowel resection with sleeve gastrectomy (BRSG). Weight and fasting glucose levels were measured at randomization and monitored after surgery. Oral glucose tolerance testing was performed at baseline and 45 days after surgery to assess glucose homeostasis and peptide changes. RESULTS At baseline, all animals exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and showed no difference in weight or fasting (area under the curve) AUC(glucose). At sacrifice, Sham animals weighed more than BRSG animals (p = 0.047). At day 45, the Sham group experienced a significant increase in AUC(glucose) compared to baseline (p = 0.02), whereas there was no difference in AUC(glucose) in either surgical group at any time point: BR (p = 0.58) and BRSG (p = 0.56). Single-factor ANOVA showed a significant difference in AUC(glucose) of p = 0.004 between groups postoperatively: Sham (50,745 ± 11,170) versus BR (23,865 ± 432.6) (p = 0.01); Sham versus BRSG (28,710 ± 3188.8) (p = 0.02). There was no difference in plasma insulin, GLP-1, or adiponectin levels before surgery, although 45 days following surgery adiponectin levels where higher in the BRSG group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Partial small bowel resection improved glucose tolerance independent of weight. The combination of small bowel resection and sleeve gastrectomy leads to an increase in adiponectin levels, which may contribute to improved glucose homeostasis.","Kopsombut, Gift; Shoulson, Rivka; Milone, Luca; Korner, Judith; Lifante, Jean-Christophe; Sebastian, Manu; Inabnet, William B",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1483-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362044/,760
64843,AJOE: Our future. Are we facing the lost generations?,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE This study aimed to endow the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) S413-PV with adequate features towards a safe and effective application in cancer gene therapy. METHODS Peptide/siRNA complexes were prepared with two new derivatives of the CPP S413-PV, which combine a lauroyl group attached to the N- or C-terminus with a histidine-enrichment in the N-terminus of the S413-PV peptide, being named C12-H5-S413-PV and H5-S413-PV-C12, respectively. Physicochemical characterization of siRNA complexes was performed and their cytotoxicity and efficiency to mediate siRNA delivery and gene silencing in cancer cells were assessed in the absence and presence of serum. RESULTS Peptide/siRNA complexes prepared with the C12-H5-S413-PV derivative showed a nanoscale (ca. 100 nm) particle size, as revealed by TEM, and efficiently mediated gene silencing (37%) in human U87 glioblastoma cells in the presence of 30% serum. In addition, the new C12-H5-S413-PV-based siRNA delivery system efficiently downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, a key-enzyme of lipid metabolism overexpressed in cancer, which resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of U87 cells. Importantly, these complexes were able to spare healthy human astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS These encouraging results pave the way for a potential application of the C12-H5-S413-PV peptide as a promising tool in cancer gene therapy.","Morais, Catarina M; Cardoso, Ana M; Aguiar, Luísa; Vale, Nuno; Nóbrega, Clévio; Zuzarte, Mónica; Gomes, Paula; Pedroso de Lima, Maria C; Jurado, Amália S",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-020-02904-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888084/,760
79999,"Effects of antibiotic duration on the intestinal microbiota and resistome: The PIRATE RESISTANCE project, a cohort study nested within a randomized trial.",2021-09-04,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) non-structural protein 2 (nsP2) is a multifunctional protein that is considered a master regulator of the viral life cycle and a main viral factor responsible for cytopathic effects and subversion of antiviral defense. The C-terminal part of nsP2 possesses protease activity, whereas the N-terminal part exhibits NTPase and RNA triphosphatase activity and is proposed to have helicase activity. Bioinformatics analysis classified CHIKV nsP2 into helicase superfamily 1. However, the biochemical significance of a coexistence of two functionally unrelated modules in this single protein remains unknown. In this study, recombinant nsP2 demonstrated unwinding of double-stranded RNA in a 5'-3' directionally biased manner and RNA strand annealing activity. Comparative analysis of NTPase and helicase activities of wild type nsP2 with enzymatic capabilities of different truncated or N-terminally extended variants of nsP2 revealed that the C-terminal part of the protein is indispensable for helicase functionality and presumably provides a platform for RNA binding, whereas the N-terminal-most region is apparently involved in obtaining a conformation of nsP2 that allows for its maximal enzymatic activities. The establishment of the protocols for the production of biochemically active CHIKV nsP2 and optimization of the parameters for helicase and NTPase assays are expected to provide the starting point for a further search of possibilities for therapeutic interventions to suppress alphaviral infections.","Das, Pratyush Kumar; Merits, Andres; Lulla, Aleksei",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m113.503433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24407286/,760

131042,Legislation to combat Covid-19: Indian Scenario.,2020-10-15,"Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is an uncommon and highly aggressive tumor. There is no HER2 testing protocol for UCS despite the development of HER2 antibody conjugates. We aimed to elucidate histopathological HER2 expression details in UCS, to compare HER2 scores between ASCO/CAP criteria for gastric and breast cancer, and to propose requirements for HER2 testing for UCS. Eighty-nine specimens from 84 patients with metastatic/recurrent UCS were prospectively collected from May 2018 to July 2020. We performed HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 89 specimens and FISH for 44 specimens. HER2 expression details and HER2 score were evaluated according to the latest ASCO/CAP criteria for gastric (2016) and breast cancer (2018). HER2 IHC scores according to the gastric cancer criteria were 0 in 31 cases (35%), 1+ in 26 (29%), 2+ in 22 (25%), and 3+ in 10 cases (11%) of the 89 specimens. A lateral/basolateral membranous staining pattern was observed in 28/32 (88%) specimens with HER2 scores of 2+/3+. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 28/32 (88%) of the specimens with HER2 scores of 2+/3+. The overall concordance rate of HER2 score was 70% between the gastric and breast criteria. FISH revealed HER2 gene amplification in 10/44 (23%) specimens containing only lateral/basolateral membranous staining pattern. Based on the histopathological features of HER2 expression in UCS, a scoring system that accepts lateral/basolateral staining patterns should be applied. Furthermore, we proposed specific requirements for UCS testing, including specimen selection, scoring system, and calculating the proportion of HER2-positive cells.","Yoshida, Hiroshi; Nishikawa, Tadaaki; Matsumoto, Koji; Mori, Masahiko; Hirashima, Yasuyuki; Takehara, Kazuhiro; Ariyoshi, Kazuya; Hasegawa, Kosei; Yonemori, Kan",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-021-03017-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423127/,760
144359,OLFACTORY DISORDERS IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: CONSIDERATIONS IN AGING.,2020,"BACKGROUND Although continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is often performed in critically ill patients during sepsis treatment, the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin (VCM) during CHDF with a polymethylmethacrylate hemofilter (PMMA-CHDF) has not been revealed. In this study, the authors aimed to describe the population pharmacokinetics of VCM in critically ill patients undergoing PMMA-CHDF and clarify its hemofilter clearance (CLhemofilter). METHODS This single-center, retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent intravenous VCM therapy during PMMA-CHDF at the intensive care unit of Chiba University Hospital between 2008 and 2016. A population analysis was performed and CLhemofilter was assessed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Median body weight (BW) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were 63 kg and 15, respectively. Mean conditions for CHDF were 107.5 ± 18.3 mL/min for blood flow rate and 26.3 ± 6.3 mL/kg/h for effluent flow rate. The mean parameter estimates were: distribution volume of the central compartment (V1), 59.1 L; clearance of the central compartment (CL1), 1.35 L/h; distribution volume of the peripheral compartment (V2), 56.1 L; and clearance of the peripheral compartment (CL2), 3.65 L/h. BW and SOFA score were significantly associated with V1 (P < 0.05) and CL1 (P < 0.05), respectively, and were thus selected as covariates in the final model. The estimated dosage of VCM to achieve a target area under the concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ≥ 400 was 27.1 mg/kg for loading and 9.7 mg/kg every 24 h for maintenance; these dosages were affected by BW and SOFA score. Mean CLhemofilter obtained from 8 patients was 1.35 L/h, which was similar to CL1. CONCLUSIONS The authors clarified the pharmacokinetics and CLhemofilter of VCM in PMMA-CHDF patients. The pharmacokinetics of VCM in patients undergoing CHDF appeared to vary not only with the CHDF setting and BW, but also with SOFA score.","Yamazaki, Shingo; Tatebe, Mizuki; Fujiyoshi, Masachika; Hattori, Noriyuki; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Takatsuka, Hirokazu; Uchida, Masashi; Suzuki, Takaaki; Ishii, Itsuko",Therapeutic drug monitoring,https://doi.org/10.1097/ftd.0000000000000721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31913865/,760
184575,[Going through the heart of darkness].,2020,"The epidemiological role of cats in the coronavirus disease pandemic remains unclear despite of several studies that have been conducted to understand it, in other words it is not yet known whether the cat would be able to transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to humans. Taking that into account, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to identify what is known and not known on this topic. Our results revealed that cats can be infected through an airborne (perhaps oral, too) route and that the clinical development of the infection in cats is parallel to that in humans. The majority of infected cats remained asymptomatic, and more severe clinical cases described occurred only in animals with comorbidities. In addition to infection, cats achieved seroconversion with detectable titers. However, the epidemiological role of cats in relation to transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear and needs to be studied further. We emphasize that, regardless of the conclusion regarding the epidemiological role of cats, this reinforces the concepts of ONE HEALTH to be incorporated into the studies and practices of epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases, with multidisciplinary teams, to achieve an understanding of the transmission of diseases with zoonotic potential. © 2021 Society of Veterinary Medicine of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations. There are two types of bruxism, awake bruxism and sleep bruxism. Awake bruxism is generally treated by dentists and maxilla-facial surgeons through several treatment modalities such as, counselling about triggers, relaxation, occlusal splints and botulinum toxin type A injections. METHODS We will present the case of a 21-year-old woman presenting mood swings with a high level of anxiety and concentration difficulties since childhood. She also complained of awake bruxism. Intelligence was evaluated using The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated through a neuropsychology test. RESULTS Intelligence evaluation showed normal intellectual function. Neuropsychology test showed a profile corresponding to ADHD. Bupropion XR 300 mg was initiated for ADHD. Pregabalin was prescribed for general anxiety syndrome. The patient reported a complete disappearance of awake bruxism at a daily dose of 375 mg, with no occlusal appliances. Following the improvement of the anxiety symptoms, the attempt to reduce the dose twice leading to the recurrence of bruxism. CONCLUSIONS A 21 years old female treated with 375 mg daily doses of pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder experienced a significant reduction of daytime bruxism. More studies are needed to determine whether pregabalin has a long term effect against awake bruxism.","Tecco, Juan Martin; Tecco, Simona",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890359/,760

Epidemiological and genetic studies point at zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels and possibly bats. Infection is characterized by severe acute respiratory failure with a high fatality rate and the ability to spread from person to person; health care-associated outbreaks have been described. No known vaccine or antiviral therapy has been developed for MERS. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating the MERS-CoV in lower respiratory secretions by RT PCR. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals in the epidemic areas, should be adhered to. Health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms of MERS-CoV in the early stage of infection.","Gańczak, Maria",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25763589/,760

We retrospectively compared the results of these techniques to better define the individual role and the benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS From July 2005 to September 2012, 28 patients with small and exophytic renal tumors underwent HALPN (n = 12), CLPN (n = 10) and LESSPN (n = 6). In these procedures, the surgeon used an MTC for circumferential coagulation around the tumor. After coagulation, the tumor was resected without renal pedicle clamping. RESULTS The mean operative time was 259, 194 and 174 min for the HALPN, CLPN and LESSPN groups respectively. Two patients (one in HALPN group and one in LESSPN group) converted to laparotomy due to an inability to maintain hemostasis; however, there were no conversions to ischemic partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy. No differences between HALPN, CLPN and LESSPN were noted in terms of estimated blood loss, measured analgesic requirements, outcomes, or complications. CONCLUSION We believe that these techniques are feasible and that they minimize the risk of unexpected collateral thermal damage by appropriate MTC needle puncture. When deciding to use HALPN, CLPN or LESSPN, our findings suggest that the choice of surgical approach should depend on the patient's individual circumstance.","Nozaki, Tetsuo; Asao, Yoshihiro; Katoh, Tomonori; Yasuda, Kenji; Fuse, Hideki",Urology journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015604/,760

METHODS By using phage display technology, we constructed a naive antibody library from convalescent SARS patient lymphocytes. To obtain the neutralizing antibody to SARS virus surface proteins, the library panning procedure was performed on purified SARS virions and the specific Fab antibody clones were enriched by four rounds of repeated panning procedure and screened by highthroughput selection. The selected Fab antibodies expressed in the periplasma of E. coli were soluble and further purified and tested for their binding properties and antiviral function to SARS virus. The functional Fab antibodies were converted to full human IgG antibodies with recombinant baculovirus/insect cell systems and their neutralizing activities were further determined. RESULTS After four rounds of the panning, a number of SARS-CoV virus-targeted human recombinant Fab antibodies were isolated from the SARS patient antibody library. Most of these were identified to recognize both natural and recombinant SARS spike (S) proteins, two Fab antibodies were specific for the virus membrane (M) protein, only one bound to SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. The SARS-CoV S and M protein-targeted Fab or IgG antibodies showed significant neutralizing activities in cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition neutralization test, these antibodies were able to completely neutralize the SARS virus and protect the Vero cells from CPE after virus infection. However, the N protein-targeted Fab or IgG antibodies failed to neutralize the virus. In addition, the SARS N protein-targeted human Fab antibody reacted with the denatured N proteins, whereas none of the S and M protein specific neutralizing antibodies did. These results suggested that the S and M protein-specific neutralizing antibodies could recognize conformational epitopes which might be involved in the binding of virions to cellular receptors and the fusion activity of the virus. CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV spike protein and membrane proteins are able to elicite efficient neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients. The neutralizing antibodies we generated in this study may be more promising candidates for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS infection.","Liang, Mi-Fang; Du, Run-Lei; Liu, Jing-Zhi; Li, Chuan; Zhang, Quan-Fu; Han, Lu-Lu; Yu, Jian-Shi; Duan, Shu-Min; Wang, Xiao-Fang; Wu, Kong-Xing; Xiong, Zhao-Hui; Jin, Qi; Li, De-Xin",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16544518/,760

This technology, termed thin-film detection, allows for the visualization of subattomole amounts of nucleic acid targets, even in complex clinical samples. Thin-film technology has been applied to a broad range of clinically relevant indications, including the detection of pathogenic bacterial and viral nucleic acid sequences and the discrimination of sequence variations in human genes causally related to susceptibility or severity of disease.","Jenison, Robert D; Bucala, Richard; Maul, Diana; Ward, David C",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16359270/,760

We have presented the first live, cross-institutional virtual medical student subspecialty training camp to deliver standardized neurosurgical educational content to medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its results on medical student anxiety and perceptions of neurosurgery. METHODS: The online training camp used a video conferencing platform that was open to all medical students. A post-training camp survey was administered. RESULTS: A total of 305 medical students registered for the event from 107 unique U.S. medical schools. Of the 305 medical students, 108 reported intending to apply to neurosurgery residency in 2021. The top medical student objectives for the training camp were program networking and mentorship. Of the 305 participants, 121 (39.7%) completed the post-training survey. Of the respondents, 65.0% reported improved neurosurgical knowledge, 79.8% reported decreased anxiety about subinternships and interviews, 82.5% reported increased enthusiasm about neurosurgery, and 100% desired a future annual virtual training camp because of the increased accessibility and decreased cost.

208725,Informe diário de evidências: COVID-19 busca realizada em 21 de abril de 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, information on the prognosis of the disease is needed. The recently developed Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department in Acutely ill Older Patients (RISE UP) score has very good discriminatory value for short-term mortality in older patients in the emergency department (ED). It consists of six readily available items. We hypothesised that the RISE UP score could have discriminatory value for 30-day mortality in ED patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Two EDs of the Zuyderland Medical Centre, secondary care hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 642 adult ED patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3 March and until 25 May 2020. Inclusion criteria were (1) admission to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and (2) positive result of the PCR or (very) high suspicion of COVID-19 according to the chest CT scan. OUTCOME: Primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Within 30 days after presentation, 167 patients (26.0%) died and 102 patients (15.9%) were admitted to ICU. The RISE UP score showed good discriminatory value for 30-day mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.81) and for the composite outcome (AUC 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.76). Patients with RISE UP scores below 10% (n=121) had favourable outcome (zero deaths and six ICU admissions), while those with scores above 30% (n=221) were at high risk of adverse outcome (46.6% mortality and 19.0% ICU admissions). CONCLUSION: The RISE UP score is an accurate prognostic model for adverse outcome in ED patients with COVID-19. It can be used to identify patients at risk of short-term adverse outcome and may help guide decision-making and allocating healthcare resources.","van Dam, Paul Mel; Zelis, Noortje; Stassen, Patricia; van Twist, Daan J L; De Leeuw, Peter W; van Kuijk, Sander; Buijs, Jacqueline",BMJ Open,,760

The disparities of COVID-19 and police brutality have highlighted the pervasiveness of systemic racism in health outcomes. Whether racial bias impacts patient access to advanced HF therapies is unclear. RECENT FINDINGS: As documented in other settings, racial bias appears to operate in HF providers' consideration of patients for advanced therapy. Multiple medical and psychosocial elements of the evaluation process are particularly vulnerable to bias. SUMMARY: Reducing gaps in access to advanced therapies will require commitments at multiple levels to reduce barriers to healthcare access, standardize clinical operations, research the determinants of patient success and increase diversity among providers and researchers.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the organization and execution of activities in the clinical sector. Asymptomatic infections are increasingly being identified when patients seek medical advice for non-respiratory system illnesses, particularly digestive system symptoms. This has posed a significant challenge for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 reported to date, patients with typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with symptoms associated with the digestive system. Digestive illness symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are underscored by a bidirectional relationship between respiratory and digestive systems. Because the clinical diagnosis and treatment of digestive illnesses caused by COVID-19 have been challenging so far, we hypothesized that investigating the pathogenesis of digestive system diseases in patients with COVID-19 will provide potential novel targets for its prevention and treatment, and concurrently reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden. This review summarizes the relationship between the digestive and respiratory systems in patients with COVID-19 from the perspective of the ""gut-lung"" axis. We discuss extant literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related digestive symptoms, which may facilitate differential diagnosis and treatment of this condition.","Li, Juan; Li, Chunmei; Wang, Xiaojun; Wang, Yuping; Zhou, Yongning",Ann Palliat Med,,760

On 18 December 2020, the South African government also announced the emergence of a new variant in a scenario similar to that of the UK, which is referred to as variant 501.V2. Another important milestone regarding this pandemic was the beginning, in December 2020, of vaccination campaigns in several countries. There are several vaccines, with different characteristics, developed by various laboratories and research centers. A natural question arises: what could be the impact of these variants and vaccines on the spread of COVID-19? Many models have been proposed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them incorporates the effects of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants together with the vaccines in the spread of COVID-19. We develop here a Î¸ - i j -SVEIHQRD mathematical model able to simulate the possible impact of this type of variants and of the vaccines, together with the main mechanisms influencing the disease spread. The model may be of interest for policy makers, as a tool to evaluate different possible future scenarios. We apply the model to the particular case of Italy (as an example of study case), showing different outcomes. We observe that the vaccines may reduce the infections, but they might not be enough for avoiding a new wave, with the current expected vaccination rates in that country, if the control measures are relaxed. Furthermore, a more contagious variant could increase significantly the cases, becoming the most common way of infection. We show how, even with the pandemic cases slowing down (with an effective reproduction number less than 1) and the disease seeming to be under control, the effective reproduction number of just the new variant may be greater than 1 and, eventually, the number of infections would increase towards a new disease wave. Therefore, a rigorous follow-up of the evolution of the number of infections with any potentially more dangerous new variant is of paramount importance at any stage of the pandemic.","Ramos, A M; Vela-Pérez, M; Ferrández, M R; Kubik, A B; Ivorra, B",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,,760

The COVID-19 pandemic heightens this risk. This pilot aims to enhance professional fulfillment and support while decreasing risk and prevalence of burnout in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) trainees through virtual delivery of a Balint-like group incorporating brief emotional awareness modules. METHODS: Six CAP trainees participated. Eight 60-min sessions held every 2 weeks were co-facilitated by a psychologist and psychiatrist who developed the curricular content. Five of the eight semi-structured sessions combined a brief emotional awareness enhancing module with a Balint-based approach to case review. The authors assessed trainee well-being, professional fulfillment, and sense of professional support pre- and post-intervention with the Well-being Index (WBI), Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI), and the authors' own supplemental survey. Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: Trainees found the curriculum feasible and useful. Surveys showed a reduction in burnout from three to zero participants (p = 0.03) and specific improvements in enthusiasm (p = 0.013), empathy with colleagues (p = 0.093), and connectedness with colleagues (p = 0.007) and patients (p = 0.042) at work. There were also improvements in happiness (p = 0.042) and valued contributions at work (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: A novel well-being curriculum focused on combining brief emotional awareness enhancing modules with a Balint-like approach enhances professional fulfillment and a sense of professional support and decreases the risk and prevalence of burnout, even when delivered virtually to a group of CAP fellows. Results support the planned expansion of this low-cost, high-value intervention for trainee well-being.","Chochol, Megan D; Pease, Eric; Swintak, Cosima; Anand, Uma",Acad. psychiatry,,760

However, recent reports explored a rare pediatric multisystem syndrome possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).The study prospectively enrolled 5 patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Their clinical presentation, laboratory, and outcome were described.All patients shared similar clinical presentations such as persistent documented fever for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, and ferritin). Three patients had concurrent positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and the other 2 patients had contact with suspected COVID-19 positive patients. They were all managed in the PICU and received intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroid, and hydroxychloroquine. The hospital stays ranged between 3 and 21âdays. One patient died due to severe multiorgan failures and shock, and the other 4 patients were discharged with good conditions.Pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for MIS-C. MIS-C has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory presentations, and the clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and should initiate its early treatment to avoid unfavorable outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies will be required to explore any sequelae of MIS-C, precisely the cardiovascular complications.","Asseri, Ali A; AlHelali, Ibrahim; Elbastawisi, Emad; Ali, Abdelwahid S; Al-Qahtani, Saleh M; Shati, Ayed A; Awadalla, Nabil J",Medicine (Baltimore),,760

Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes. Informed consent must include risks of complications related to COVID-19 disease. Surgery must be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to avoid increase of operating time and risks of complications. Surgical approach of BPH must be considered depending on availability of disposable material, infrastructure, and the epidemiological COVID-19 status of your area.

The goal of this tutorial is to disseminate skills in structure-based drug design and to allow others to unleash their own creativity to design new drugs to fight the current pandemic. The tutorial begins with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bound to a peptide substrate and then uses the UCSF Chimera software to modify the substrate to create a cyclic peptide inhibitor within the Mpro active site. Finally, the tutorial uses the molecular docking software AutoDock Vina to show the interaction of the cyclic peptide inhibitor with both SARS-CoV Mpro and the highly homologous SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The supporting information provides an illustrated step-by-step protocol, as well as a video showing the inhibitor design process, to help readers design their own drug candidates for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses that will cause future pandemics. An accompanying preprint in bioRxiv [https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.234872] describes the synthesis of the cyclic peptide and the experimental validation as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Zhang, Sheng; Krumberger, Maj; Morris, Michael A; Parrocha, Chelsea Marie T; Kreutzer, Adam G; Nowick, James S",Eur J Med Chem,,760

Joint document of the Geriatric Cardiology Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology and the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology],2020,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve area (AVA) is commonly determined from 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) by continuity equation; however, this method relies on geometric assumptions of the left ventricular outflow tract which may not hold true. This study compared mean differences and correlations for AVA by planimetric (2-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography [2D TEE], 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography [3D TEE], 3-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography [3D TTE], multi-detector computed tomography [MDCT], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) with hemodynamic methods (2D TTE and catheterization) using pairwise meta-analysis. METHOD: Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library (Wiley) were queried for studies comparing AVA measurements assessed by planimetric and hemodynamic techniques. Pairwise meta-analysis for mean differences (using random effect model) and for correlation coefficients (r) were performed. RESULTS: Forty-five studies (3014 patients) were included. Mean differences between planimetric and hemodynamic techniques were 0.12â¯cm2 (95%CI 0.10-0.15) for AVA (pooled râ¯=â¯0.84; 95%CI 0.76-0.90); 1.36cm2 (95%CI 1.03-1.69) for left ventricular outflow tract area; and 0.13â¯cm (95%CI 0.07-0.20) for annular diameter (pooled râ¯=â¯0.76; 95% CI 0.64-0.94); 0.67â¯cm2 (95%CI 0.59-0.76) for annular area (pooled râ¯=â¯0.74; 95%CI 0.55-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Planimetric techniques slightly, but significantly, overestimate AVA when compared to hemodynamic techniques.","Rong, Lisa Q; Hameed, Irbaz; Di Franco, Antonino; Rahouma, Mohamed M; Khan, Faiza M; Demetres, Michelle; Weinsaft, Jonathan W; Devereux, Richard B; Gaudino, Mario",Int. j. cardiol,,760

The way in which people physically interact is a major component in the complexity found in human societies. Mexico City, the largest city in Mexico, is as well one of the largest cities in the world, with over 9 million inhabitants and concentrating the vast majority of government and business centers. Reconstructing the set of physical interactions between its inhabitants could lead to a better understanding of the city's complexity. Such contact network can be used for applications that range from urban planning to the spread of infectious agents. In this work, we used anonymized location data from mobile devices (cellphones) collected in the month of February 2020 to reconstruct contact networks for several days, based on physical proximity of these devices. We found that contact networks in Mexico City are very sparse, with a heavy tailed degree distribution, characterized by a largest connected component that contains between $10$ and $20\%$ of devices. We found that, while network topologies are different each day, there is no consistent difference in these between weekdays and weekends.

Additional evidence, however, suggests the validity of this estimation could benefit from vetting for biases and miscalculations. The main objective of this article is to critically appraise the coronavirus mortality estimation presented to Congress. Informational texts from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are compared with coronavirus mortality calculations in Congressional testimony. Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate as a case fatality rate. Public health lessons learned for future infectious disease pandemics include: safeguarding against research biases that may underestimate or overestimate an associated risk of disease and mortality; reassessing the ethics of fear-based public health campaigns; and providing full public disclosure of adverse effects from severe mitigation measures to contain viral transmission.","Brown, Ronald B",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,760

Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. METHODS: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation. RESULTS: At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Burbelo, Peter D; Riedo, Francis X; Morishima, Chihiro; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Das, Sanchita; Strich, Jeffrey R; Chertow, Daniel S; Davey, Richard T; Cohen, Jeffrey I",J Infect Dis,,760

Accordingly, we reported the utilised examination details, allocation of radiology staff and actions and safety procedures for patients and radiology staff. As the corporate radiology team serving in these designated pandemic hospitals, examination details and safety procedures of some diagnostic radiology facilities among five training research hospitals have been identified in the current study. Our guidelines and preparedness protocol aimed to reduce patient morbidity and infection-related mortality through quick and proper diagnosis to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to our employees, patients and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that teamwork is a key factor while providing medical services. In addition, continuous communication efforts and individual responsibilities of radiology staff were remarkable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent situation also showed that co-operation of radiology facilities with device manufacturers and applicators are quite significant especially for development of special protocols in the frame of As Low As Reasonably Achievable. The COVID-19 pandemic has tackled several challenges in radiology among radiology departments. Therefore, continuous co-operation plans and motivational actions are highly recommended not only between radiology staff but also between radiology stakeholders and service providers in the future.

Diversity in news media, however, is understood as multiperspectivity (e.g., different opinions on corona measures), and arguably a key responsibility of the press in a democratic society. While viewpoint diversity is often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science domain, in this paper, we take a computational view. We operationalize the notion of framing, adopted from communication science. We apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists, to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method. Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature. In an online study, on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator platform, with more than 2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation characteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations. These results suggest that future research on presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in online news environments.","Mulder, Mats; Inel, Oana; Oosterman, Jasper; Tintarev, Nava",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06141v1.pdf,760

Through an evocative autoethnography, I, as a blind person, aim to argue that help may become even more complicated for visually impaired persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since visually impaired persons often rely on help in the form of physical touch (for example when a sighted person guides them), help currently contains more than psychological dimensions - it also carries within it the very real potential for contracting a potential life-threatening illness. This vulnerable position, I will demonstrate, comes with its own set of psychological ramifications such as the fear of often much-needed or unsolicited touch. I will argue that what makes these feelings of vulnerability and anxiety even more acute, is the limits to freedom of choice for both help-receiver and help-recipient. I conclude that, during this health crisis, it is important to apply the approach of the relational ethics of care.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of students and personnel at a Chilean dental school during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phenomenological descriptive qualitative study reported staff and students' experiences during the pandemic through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. These were recorded on audio and video with a digital platform. Three researchers then transcribed and analyzed the recordings and codified the answers into categories to determine the emerging topics until a saturation point was reached. RESULTS: The core emerging themes among the staff group were (1) change in the personal/professional life balance, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) staff perceptions of students' learning experiences, and (4) concerns about the future. For students, the themes were (1) changes in the learning process, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) interpersonal relationships, and (4) concerns about the future. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of learning for our dental school staff and students. Even though online learning has been a useful tool for delivering didactic (theoretical) concepts, it has been unable to replace conventional education, including skills training. Students and teachers reported being overwhelmed at the beginning of the pandemic, but they have shown remarkable adaptability and resilience during this period.","Prieto, Diego; Tricio, Jorge; Cáceres, Felipe; Param, Fernanda; Meléndez, Catalina; Vásquez, Pamela; Prada, Pamela",Eur. j. dent. educ,,760

We implemented an innovative teaching proposal based on high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients. The purposes of our study were to describe this innovative teaching proposal and compare nursing competence acquisition in final year nursing students through virtual and in-person OSCE modalities. The study included 234 undergraduate students: 123 students were assessed through high-fidelity virtual OSCEs during May 2020, whereas 111 students were assessed through in-person OSCEs during May 2019. The structure of OSCEs, including its stations, clinical simulated scenarios, and checklists, was the same in both OSCE modalities. The effect size of the differences among the competence categories of checklists, including their total scores, was small. Regarding our virtual OSCEs was similarly successful to in-person OSCEs, this online format was found to be useful, feasible, and cost-saving when in-person OSCE was not possible. Therefore, high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients could be considered as another choice of OSCE not only in the current COVID-19 pandemic but could also be extended to normal situations, even post-pandemic.","Arrogante, Oscar; López-Torre, Eva María; Carrión-García, Laura; Polo, Alberto; Jiménez-Rodríguez, Diana",,,760

Over the past two decades, since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, a large body of research has accumulated on the virology, clinical symptoms and signs, and experimental treatments of Coronaviruses. In 2020, a new form of Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread rapidly throughout the globe. Given the wide-ranging clinical presentations of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, other viruses might be overlooked when evaluating at-risk patients. Furthermore, due to suboptimal testing capabilities, an early clinical diagnosis is not always possible. Here, we present a case of a patient with pneumonia thought to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 only to be found to have another Coronavirus. This emphasizes the need to be vigilant when evaluating patients with viral-like respiratory infections.","Flamenbaum, Matthew; Roman, Jesse",Am. j. med. sci,,760

How do we simultaneously ensure that these selection decisions are well balanced, fair, and unbiased by satisfying the key stakeholders' wishes? How much and what kinds of evidence must be used to make them? How can both the evidence and the procedures be made transparent and unambitious for everyone? In this paper, we suggest a set of so-called deep evidence-based analytics, which is applied on top of the collective awareness platform (portal for managing higher education processes). The deep evidence, in addition to the facts about the individual academic achievements of personnel, includes the evidence about individual rewards. However, what is more important is that such evidence also includes explicit individual value systems (formalized personal preferences in the self-assessment of both achievements and the rewards). We provide formalized procedures that can be used to drive the academic assessment and selection processes within universities based on advanced (deep) evidence and with different balances of decision power between administrations and personnel. We also show how this analytics enables computational evidence for some abstract properties of an academic organization related to its organizational culture, such as organizational democracy, justice, and work passion. We present the analytics together with examples of its actual use within Ukrainian higher education at the Trust portal.","Semenets, Valerii; Terziyan, Vagan; Gryshko, Svitlana; Golovianko, Mariia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10560v1.pdf,760

Case-based teaching formats under expert supervision can be used as a substitute for practical bedside teaching, where the focus is on teaching clinical reasoning skills. Methods: For medical students of LMU and TU Munich, the interactive, case-based, and supervised teaching format of Clinical Case Discussion (CCD) was digitised and implemented as dCCD in their respective curricula. Case discussions were realised as videoconferences, led by a student moderator, and took place under the supervision of a board-certified clinician. To prevent passive participation, additional cognitive activations were implemented. Acceptance, usability, and subjective learning outcomes were assessed in dCCDs by means of a special evaluation concept. Results: With regard to acceptance, students were of the opinion that they had learned effectively by participating in dCCDs (M=4.31; SD=1.37). The majority of students also stated that they would recommend the course to others (M=4.23; SD=1.62). The technical implementation of the teaching format was judged positively overall, but findings for usability were heterogeneous. Students rated their clinical reasoning skills at the end of the dCCDs (M=4.43; SD=0.66) as being significantly higher than at the beginning (M=4.33; SD=0.69), with low effect size, t(181)=-2.352, p=.020, d=0.15. Conclusion: Our evaluation data shows that the dCCD format is well-accepted by students as a substitute for face-to-face teaching. In the next step, we plan to examine the extent to which participation in dCCDs leads to an increase in objectively measured clinical reasoning skills, analogous to a face-to-face CCD with on-site attendance.","Zottmann, Jan M; Horrer, Anna; Chouchane, Amir; Huber, Johanna; Heuser, Sonja; Iwaki, Lica; Kowalski, Christian; Gartmeier, Martin; Berberat, Pascal O; Fischer, Martin R; Weidenbusch, Marc",GMS J Med Educ,,760

Although the infection is frequently asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms, in a small proportion of patients it can produce an intense inflammatory and prothrombotic state that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), highly expressed in the respiratory system, has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, ACE2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Importantly, patients with COVID-19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities promoting a hypercoagulable state, resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic events. This review will describe the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular involvement following infection by SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on thrombotic and thromboembolic manifestations and implications for antithrombotic management.","Ortega-Paz, Luis; Capodanno, Davide; Montalescot, Gilles; Angiolillo, Dominick J",J Am Heart Assoc,,760

We analysed real-world data using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess HCQ/CQ-associated cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs) in pre-COVID-19 reports. METHODS: We conducted disproportionality analysis of HCQ/CQ in the FAERS database (07/2014-9/2019), using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the lower bound of the information component 95% credibility interval (IC025 ). RESULTS: The full database contained 6 677 225 reports with a mean (±SD) age of 53 (±17) years and 74% females. We identified 4895 reports of HCQ/CQ related adverse events, of which 696 (14.2%) were CVAEs. Compared with the full database, HCQ/CQ use was associated with a higher reporting rate of major CVAEs, including cardiomyopathy (n = 86 [1.8%], ROR = 29.0 [23.3-35.9]), QT prolongation (n = 43 [0.9%], ROR = 4.5 [3.3-6.1]), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 117 [2.4%], ROR = 2.2 [1.8-2.7]) and heart failure (n = 136 [2.8%], ROR = 2.2 [1.9-2.7], all IC025 > 0). No statistically significant differences were observed between sex and age groups. CVAEs were reported more often in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs demonstrated subsequent hospitalization and mortality rates of 39% and 8%, respectively. Overdose reports demonstrated an increased frequency of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias (35% and 25%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, HCQ/CQ treatment is associated with higher reporting rates of various CVAEs, particularly cardiomyopathy, QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs result in high rates of severe outcomes and should be carefully considered as an off-label indication, especially for patients with cardiac disorders.","Goldman, Adam; Bomze, David; Dankner, Rachel; Hod, Hanoch; Meirson, Tomer; Boursi, Ben; Maor, Elad",,,760

Some countries conduct large-scale screenings for testing, whereas others test mainly people with high prior probability of infection such as showing severe symptoms and/or having an epidemiological link with a known or suspected case or cluster of cases. However, what a good testing strategy is and whether the difference in testing strategy shows a meaningful, measurable impact on the COVID-19 epidemic remain unknown. Here, we showed that patterns of association between effective reproduction number (Rt) and test positivity rate can illuminate differences in testing situation among different areas, using global and local data from Japan. This association can also evaluate the adequacy of current testing systems and what information is captured in COVID-19 surveillance. The differences in testing systems alone cannot predict the results of epidemic containment efforts. Furthermore, monitoring test positivity rates and severe case proportions among the nonelderly can predict imminent case count increases. Monitoring test positivity rates in conjunction with the concurrent Rt could be useful to assess and strengthen public health management and testing systems and deepen understanding of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics.","Furuse, Yuki; Ko, Yura K; Ninomiya, Kota; Suzuki, Motoi; Oshitani, Hitoshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,760
385712,Como estimar a mortalidade pela doença do novo coronavírus (COVID-19). Informe científico. 4 de agosto de 2020,2020,"The optimum titers play a pivotal role for the success of CPT;in the ICMR study, they have only mentioned that the titers were detectable but the percentage is high, moderate and low titers has not been mentioned. On the question of neutralising antibody titers, IgG titers are typically associated with the severity of disease and decline in the early convalescent phase in less severe forms of the disease. In the PLACID trial, most of the donors (94.2%) had mild disease. Moreover, the fact that antibody titers were not measured in CP before transfusion, due to lack of validated and reliable commercial tests for qualitative or quantitative antibody measurement, could be another key confounding factor. The heterogeneity of the PLACID trial across its 39 study sites, especially in the severity of disease of enrolled participants, estimation of nAB (timing and method), and the ""Standard of Care,"" could impinge on the reliability of the study data. Further, in the ICMR study, 67.9% of CPT group are PCR negative by day 7 when compared to 54.6% of non-CPT. This perhaps can be considered as beneficial impact of CPT which helps in decreasing community transmission. This data can also be used to tighten the discharge criteria to enable faster discharges, thus improving the availability of beds for a worsening pandemic. Notably, the dosage of CP administered is also variable. Some trials are administering doses as high as 600 ml, in single infusions or divided doses, up to five transfusion sessions. The consensus about effective CP dose is yet to be elucidated.","Vishal, Rao Ashish Gulia",Indian Journal of Medical Sciences,,760

RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Three PFA training models were commonly used in research studies. A broad selection of PFA training outcomes were observed including learning, behavior, satisfaction and practice in crisis mental and behavior health preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: Research evidence of reasonable quality demonstrates that PFA training significantly improves knowledge of appropriate psychosocial response and PFA skills in supporting people in acute distress, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and promoting resilience. However, this review highlights inadequate guidance on how PFA training should be applied and adapted, significant shortcomings of reporting PFA training delivery, limited training evaluation and unclear training outcomes. Whilst behavioral, knowledge and system impact of the PFA training are promising, methodologically stronger evaluations which include systematic training adaptation and selection of sensitive outcome measures is needed to strengthen future implementation of PFA training and thereby enhance population preparedness for future emergencies.","Wang, Ling; Norman, Ian; Xiao, Tao; Li, Yamin; Leamy, Mary",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,760

391160,Informe diário de evidências COVID-19: busca realizada em 5 de maio de 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. METHODS: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays' performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. RESULTS: Combined IgG + IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9 to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6 to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG + IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG + IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 µg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 µg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek. CONCLUSION: We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.","Trombetta, Bianca A; Kandigian, Savannah E; Kitchen, Robert R; Grauwet, Korneel; Webb, Pia Kivisäkk; Miller, Glenn A; Jennings, Charles G; Jain, Sejal; Miller, Samara; Kuo, Yikai; Sweeney, Thadryan; Gilboa, Tal; Norman, Maia; Simmons, Daimon P; Ramirez, Christopher E; Bedard, Melissa; Fink, Catherine; Ko, Jina; De León Peralta, Esmarline J; Watts, Gerald; Gomez-Rivas, Emma; Davis, Vannessa; Barilla, Rocky M; Wang, Jianing; Cunin, Pierre; Bates, Samuel; Morrison-Smith, Chevaun; Nicholson, Benjamin; Wong, Edmond; El-Mufti, Leena; Kann, Michael; Bolling, Anna; Fortin, Brooke; Ventresca, Hayden; Zhou, Wen; Pardo, Santiago; Kwock, Megan; Hazra, Aditi; Cheng, Leo; Ahmad, Q Rushdy; Toombs, James A; Larson, Rebecca; Pleskow, Haley; Luo, Nell Meosky; Samaha, Christina; Pandya, Unnati M; De Silva, Pushpamali; Zhou, Sally; Ganhadeiro, Zakary; Yohannes, Sara",BMC Infect Dis,,760

Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.","Wang, Dawei; Yin, Yimei; Hu, Chang; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Xingguo; Zhou, Shuliang; Jian, Mingzhi; Xu, Haibo; Prowle, John; Hu, Bo; Li, Yirong; Peng, Zhiyong",Crit Care,,760

Several studies have demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is also a potential route. As the pandemic is continuously evolving, and more data are made available, this article highlights the best evidence and practices regarding the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus relevant to GI practice. Published clinical studies have supported that SARS-CoV-2 affects the GI tract and the liver. The largest published dataset comprised of 4243 patients and showed a pooled prevalence of GI symptoms at 17.6%. GI symptoms varied and usually preceded pulmonary symptoms by 1–2 days. These include anorexia (26.8%), nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.5%), and abdominal pain (9.2%). Incidence of liver injury ranges from 15 to 53%. Evidence shows that the severity of COVID-19 infection is compounded by its effects on nutrition, most especially for the critically ill. As such, nutrition societies have recommended optimization of oral diets and oral nutritional supplements followed by early enteral nutrition if nutritional targets are not met, and parenteral nutrition in the distal end of the spectrum. In addition to possible fecal–oral transmission, GI endoscopy procedures, which are considered to be aerosol-generating procedures, contribute to increased risk to GI health-care professionals. Infection prevention measures and guidelines are essential in protecting both patients and personnel.","Aguila, Enrik John T.; Cua, Ian Homer Y.; Dumagpi, Joseph Erwin L.; Francisco, Carlos Paolo D.; Raymundo, Nikko Theodore V.; Sy-Janairo, Marianne Linley L.; Cabral-Prodigalidad, Patricia Anne I.; Lontok, Marie Antoinette DC.",JGH Open,,760

METHODS: Electronic medical records of 1053 consecutively hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 from one large medical center in the USA were retrospectively analyzed. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed with the calculation of areas under the curve (AUC) and concordance index (C-index). Patients were stratified into subgroups based on the presence of encephalopathy and its severity using survival statistics. In sensitivity analyses, patients with mild/moderate and severe encephalopathy (defined as coma) were separately considered. RESULTS: Of 1053 patients (mean age 52.4 years, 48.0% men [n = 505]), 35.1% (n = 370) had neurologic manifestations at admission, including 10.3% (n = 108) with encephalopathy. Encephalopathy was an independent predictor for death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.617, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.481-4.625) in multivariable Cox regression. The addition of encephalopathy to multivariable models comprising other predictors for adverse outcomes increased AUCs (mortality: 0.84-0.86, ventilation/ intensive care unit [ICU]: 0.76-0.78) and C-index (mortality: 0.78 to 0.81, ventilation/ICU: 0.85-0.86). In sensitivity analyses, risk stratification survival curves for mortality and ventilation/ICU based on severe encephalopathy (n = 15) versus mild/moderate encephalopathy (n = 93) versus no encephalopathy (n = 945) at admission were discriminative (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Encephalopathy at admission predicts later progression to death in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have important implications for risk stratification in clinical practice.","Tang, Lei; Liu, Shixin; Xiao, Yanhe; Tran, Thi My Linh; Choi, Ji Whae; Wu, Jing; Halsey, Kasey; Huang, Raymond Y; Boxerman, Jerrold; Patel, Sohil H; Kung, David; Liu, Renyu; Feldman, Michael D; Danoski, Daniel D; Liao, Wei-Hua; Kasner, Scott E; Liu, Tao; Xiao, Bo; Zhang, Paul J; Reznik, Michael; Bai, Harrison X; Yang, Li",CNS neurosc. ther.

This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. METHODS: A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. RESULTS: There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control. After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase. This paper offers key points and possible strategies to provide the highest level of safety to both the orthopaedic patient and the orthopaedic team including administrative staff and nurses, during the start-up phase.

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","Bambra, Clare; Albani, Viviana; Franklin, Paula",Scand J Public Health,,760

Objective: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Results: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; &#967;21 = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [-0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; &#967;21 = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions and Relevance: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses. SARS-CoV-2 clade assignment is an important factor that may aid in estimating patient outcomes.","Esper, Frank P; Cheng, Yu-Wei; Adhikari, Thamali M; Tu, Zheng Jin; Li, Derek; Li, Erik A; Farkas, Daniel H; Procop, Gary W; Ko, Jennifer S; Chan, Timothy A; Jehi, Lara; Rubin, Brian P; Li, Jing",JAMA Netw Open,,760

There is a shortage of effective therapeutic strategies or preventative vaccines for this disease to date. A rigorous investigation is needed for identifying and developing more effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis, has been identified as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. Smoking and vaping are potential risk factors for COVID-19 that are also shown to upregulate ACE2 expression. In this review, we have discussed the pathobiology of COVID-19 in the lungs and brain and the role of ACE2 in the transmission and pathobiology of this disease. Furthermore, we have shown possible interactions between nicotine/smoking and ACE2 in the lungs and brain, which could aggravate the transmission and pathobiology of COVID-19, resulting in a poor disease outcome. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review addresses the present global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with respect to its pathobiology in the lungs and brain. It focuses on the potential negative impact of tobacco and nicotine exposure on the outcomes of this disease by interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. It adds to the time-sensitive and critically important growing knowledge about the risk factors, transmission, pathobiology, and prognosis of COVID-19.","Sifat, Ali Ehsan; Nozohouri, Saeideh; Villalba, Heidi; Vaidya, Bhuvaneshwar; Abbruscato, Thomas J",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,760

Initially it was necessary to identity the categories of citizens who should be the first to receive the vaccines, on the basis of scientific evidence. On the basis of this information, elderly residents in nursing homes and the staff who care for them should be the highest priority subjects for vaccination. In this context, obtaining informed consent to Covid-19 vaccination presents a considerable challenge, as the advanced age and frequent comorbidities of a significant number of the residents may mean that they are incapable of expressing consent themselves. The legislation of various Western nations substantially agrees on the general principle that those capable of judgement must be asked for their consent for healthcare services, and that even those with psychological weaknesses that limit their full ability to decide must be involved in these decision-making processes. The article can help systematize the processes to be implemented to protect the health of individuals as members of a close and fragile community.","Cannovo, N.; Scendoni, R.; Fede, M.

An elevated level of intracellular calcium causes neuronal dysfunction, cell death, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of calcium has also been shown to increase the production of amyloid beta (Aß) protein, the hallmark of Alzheimer's dementia. Reversely, deposition of Aß is also responsible for calcium dysregulation. On the other hand, it has been well investigated that viruses can disturb host cell Ca2+ homeostasis as well as modulate signal transduction mechanisms. Viruses can also hijack the host cell calcium channels and pumps to release more intracellular Ca2+ to utilize for their life cycle. Even though evidence has not been reported on SARS-CoV-2 concerning Ca2+ regulation, however, it has been well established that Ca2+ is essential for viral entry, viral gene replication, and virion maturation and release. Recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV needs two Ca2+ ions to fuse with the host cell at the entry step. Furthermore, some calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as nimodipine, memantine, etc., have been reported to be effective in the treatment of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as have shown inhibition in various virus infections.","Danta, Chhanda Charan",ACS Chem Neurosci,,760

Here, we characterize overall health, physical health, and mental health of patients 1 month after discharge for severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients &#8805; 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 l of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status, and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS® Global Health-10. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs 47/152 (31%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p < 0.001. Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state (43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state, (54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p < 0.001. Physical and mental health means in the general US population are 50 (SD 10). A total of 52/148 (35.1%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148 (13.5%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID-19 disease typically experience sequelae affecting their respiratory status, physical health, and mental health for at least several weeks after hospital discharge.","Weerahandi, Himali; Hochman, Katherine A; Simon, Emma; Blaum, Caroline; Chodosh, Joshua; Duan, Emily; Garry, Kira; Kahan, Tamara; Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah L; Karpel, Hannah C; Mendoza, Felicia; Prete, Alexander M; Quintana, Lindsey; Rutishauser, Jennifer; Santos Martinez, Leticia; Shah, Kanan; Sharma, Sneha; Simon, Elias; Stirniman, Ana Z; Horwitz, Leora I",J Gen Intern Med,,760

In this work, we compared the sequences of experimentally verified SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and sequentially/structurally similar commercialized therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. We have identified three therapeutic antibodies, Tremelimumab, Ipilimumab and Afasevikumab. Interestingly, these antibodies target CTLA4 and IL17A, levels of which have been shown to be elevated during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The candidate antibodies were evaluated further for epitope restriction, interaction energy and interaction surface to gauge their repurposability to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work provides candidate antibody scaffolds with dual activities of plausible viral neutralization and immunosuppression. Further, these candidate antibodies can also be explored in diagnostic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We opine that this in silico workflow to screen and analyze antibodies for repurposing would have widespread applications.","Rawat, Puneet; Sharma, Divya; Srivastava, Ambuj; Janakiraman, Vani; Gromiha, M Michael",Sci Rep,,760

We use a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model with time dependent infection rate to simulate how the infection is spread under lockdown. The economic cost due to the loss of workforce and incurred medical expenses is evaluated with a simple model. We find the best strategy, meaning the smallest economic cost for the entire course of the pandemic, is to keep the strict lockdown as long as possible.","Chao, Sung-Po",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14072v1.pdf,760
434640,Doações De Sangue E a Pandemia De Covid-19: Experiência De Um Serviço De Hemoterapia,2020,"Herein, we consider venous immunothrombotic mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccination. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with systemic viral RNA release (RNAaemia) contributes to innate immune coagulation cascade activation, with both pulmonary and systemic immunothrombosis - including venous territory strokes. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccines -initially shown for the ChAdOx1 vaccine-may rarely exhibit autoimmunity with autoantibodies to Platelet Factor-4 (PF4) that is termed Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), an entity pathophysiologically similar to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The PF4 autoantigen is a polyanion molecule capable of independent interactions with negatively charged bacterial cellular wall, heparin and DNA molecules, thus linking intravascular innate immunity to both bacterial cell walls and pathogen-derived DNA. Crucially, negatively charged extracellular DNA is a powerful adjuvant that can break tolerance to positively charged nuclear histone proteins in many experimental autoimmunity settings, including SLE and scleroderma. Analogous to DNA-histone interactons, positively charged PF4-DNA complexes stimulate strong interferon responses via Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 engagement. A chain of events following intramuscular adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccine inoculation including microvascular damage; microbleeding and platelet activation with PF4 release, adenovirus cargo dispersement with DNA-PF4 engagement may rarely break immune tolerance, leading to rare PF4-directed autoimmunity. The VITT cavernous sinus cerebral and intestinal venous territory immunothrombosis proclivity may pertain to venous drainage of shared microbiotal-rich areas of the nose and in intestines that initiates local endovascular venous immunity by PF4/microbiotal engagement with PF4 autoantibody driven immunothrombosis reminiscent of HIT. According to the proposed model, any adenovirus-vectored-DNA vaccine could drive autoimmune VITT in susceptible individuals and alternative mechanism based on molecular mimicry, vaccine protein contaminants, adenovirus vector proteins, EDTA buffers or immunity against the viral spike protein are secondary factors. Hence, electrochemical DNA-PF4 interactions and PF4-heparin interactions, but at different locations, represent the common denominator in HIT and VITT related autoimmune-mediated thrombosis.","McGonagle, Dennis; De Marco, Gabriele; Bridgewood, Charles",J Autoimmun,,760

At the same time, COVID-19 is causing vulnerable elders to reconsider in-person provider visits. In that context, recently published research by Y. Mizrachi et al. examining obstacles to the use of online health services (OHS) among adults age 50 and up takes on new importance. An iconic Israeli song begins, ""Will you hear my voice?"" (Hebrew Songs. Zemer Nugeh (Hatishmah Koli), 2020). What makes Mizrachi et al.'s findings particularly intriguing, despite several caveats, is the manner in which they demonstrated a commitment to genuinely listen to individual voices. The researchers spoke ""openly and bluntly"" with interviewees as peers and were rewarded with ""specific, well-defined and applicable answers with the potential to be used."" The most striking findings came in candid answers that went beyond the factors intrinsic to the online offerings and addressed important factors in what regular Internet users often refer to as IRL (""in real life""), such as support from family. The necessity of avoiding preconceptions about the most effective manner to engage patients underscores the importance of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs). PFACs, increasingly being adopted by health care organizations globally, provide an ongoing ability to listen and respond to the ""patient voice."" Effectively addressing obstacles to older adults' use of the full range of online health resources will require the involvement not just of health plans and government, but also of voluntary organizations, providers, families and others integral to users' offline ""real lives."" Sustained, focused listening must be a central part of that effort.","Millenson, Michael L",Isr J Health Policy Res,,760

448413,Hacktivism and political participation: Between the criminalization of the unconventional and the constitution of new political actors,2020,"Objectives Public behaviour change is necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related).

Patients undergoing CABG from January 2008 to December 2016 reported to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: use of BIMA or use of SIMA and propensity matched. To assess the effect of preoperative HbA1c, both groups were further divided into 5 sub-groups: patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), or patients with diabetes mellitus and a preoperative HbA1c level in one of four groups (< 7%, 7-9%, 9-11%, or > 11%). The post-operative outcomes in both the BIMA and SIMA groups were compared. There were 700,504 and 28,115 patients with measured pre-operative HbA1c levels in the SIMA and BIMA groups, respectively. Propensity score matching identified 23,635 comparable patients in each group for analysis. There was no difference in postoperative mortality between the BIMA and SIMA groups (1.3% vs 1.2%). The incidences of sternal wound infection (SWI) in patients undergoing placement of BIMA versus SIMA were: 0.8% vs 0.4% with no DM (p<0.0001), 1.9% vs 1.0% with HbA1c < 7% (p<0.001), 2.4% vs 1.2% with HbA1c 7-9% (p<0.001), 2.8% vs 1.4% with HbA1c 9-11% (p=0.02), 4.1% vs 1.5% with HbA1c > 11% (p=0.01).

489215,Perception 0f virtual university education in the covid19,2020,"Over the last two decades, there have been three deadly human outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the current COVID-19 global pandemic. All three deadly CoVs originated from bats and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. It remains highly possible that other global COVID pandemics will emerge in the coming years caused by yet another spillover of a bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) into humans. Determining the Ag and the human B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal coronaviruses should inform in the development of future pan-coronavirus vaccines. In the current study, using several immunoinformatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in 1) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences identified in 190 countries on six continents; 2) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the common cold; 3) nine SL-CoVs isolated from bats; 4) nine SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; 5) three SL-CoVs isolated from civet cats; and 6) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, the identified epitopes: 1) recalled B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 2) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in humanized HLA-DR1/HLA-A*02:01 double-transgenic mice. The findings pave the way to develop a preemptive multiepitope pan-coronavirus vaccine to protect against past, current, and future outbreaks.","Prakash, Swayam; Srivastava, Ruchi; Coulon, Pierre-Gregoire; Dhanushkodi, Nisha R; Chentoufi, Aziz A; Tifrea, Delia F; Edwards, Robert A; Figueroa, Cesar J; Schubl, Sebastian D; Hsieh, Lanny; Buchmeier, Michael J; Bouziane, Mohammed; Nesburn, Anthony B; Kuppermann, Baruch D; BenMohamed, Lbachir",J Immunol,,760

Informe técnico, 7 de junho de 2020",2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread. In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients' respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.","Lie, Sui An; Wong, Sook Wai; Wong, Loong Tat; Wong, Theodore Gar Ling; Chong, Shin Yuet",Can J Anaesth,,760

Social media outlets have reportedly made efforts to limit false information yet untruths related to COVID-19 persist online. The purpose of this study was to describe the content on COVID-19 vaccination on TikTok, an emerging social media platform. One-hundred trending videos were identified from the hashtag #covidvaccine and were coded for content. Collectively, these videos garnered over 35 million views. The coding category with the highest number of videos was ""Discouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 38), followed by ""Encouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 36). While only 36 videos encouraged a vaccine, these videos garnered over 50% of the total cumulative views and just under 50% of the total likes; the 38 videos that discouraged a vaccine garnered 39.6% of the total cumulative views, 44.3% of likes, and 47.4% of comments. Of the 38 videos discouraging the vaccine, 25 (65.79%) showed a parody of an adverse reaction and, collectively, received 71.07% of the total views among videos in this category. Twenty-two of these 38 videos (57.89%) falsely conveyed that a vaccine was available, as they were not at the time of the study. Anti-vaccination messaging may undermine efforts to ensure widespread uptake of the various COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for young people who are more likely than other age cohorts to use TikTok.","Basch, Corey H; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe; Fera, Joseph; Jaime, Christie; Basch, Charles E",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,760

Following 4 weeks, biofilm developed on all plastics, resulting in an increased weight and concomitant decrease in UV transmission for most plastics. All plastics produced microplastic particles beginning at 4 weeks, with single-use bags producing the most microplastics over the 32-week period. At 32 weeks, SEM revealed microcracks and delamination for all plastics except PLA and MB, the latter of which degraded through embrittlement. IR spectral analysis indicated degradation for all plastics except PLA. Results suggest that degradation rates of bio-based and biodegradable plastics vary widely, with MB bags and bioPS plates demonstrating the greatest degradation, while PLA cups demonstrated the least degradation.","Weinstein, John E; Dekle, Jack L; Leads, Rachel R; Hunter, Rebecca A",Mar Pollut Bull,,760

Although many of the proteins associated with CRISPR-Cas mechanisms are characterized, some requisite enzymes remain elusive. Genetic studies have implicated host DNA polymerases in some CRISPR-Cas systems but CRISPR-specific replicases have not yet been discovered. We have identified and characterised a family of CRISPR-Associated Primase-Polymerases (CAPPs) in a range of prokaryotes that are operonically associated with Cas1 and Cas2. CAPPs belong to the Primase-Polymerase (Prim-Pol) superfamily of replicases that operate in various DNA repair and replication pathways that maintain genome stability. Here, we characterise the DNA synthesis activities of bacterial CAPP homologues from Type IIIA and IIIB CRISPR-Cas systems and establish that they possess a range of replicase activities including DNA priming, polymerisation and strand-displacement. We demonstrate that CAPPs operonically-associated partners, Cas1 and Cas2, form a complex that possesses spacer integration activity. We show that CAPPs physically associate with the Cas proteins to form bespoke CRISPR-Cas complexes. Finally, we propose how CAPPs activities, in conjunction with their partners, may function to undertake key roles in CRISPR-Cas adaptation.","Zabrady, Katerina; Zabrady, Matej; Kolesar, Peter; Li, Arthur W H; Doherty, Aidan J",Nat Commun,,760

No proven treatment for SARS-CoV-2 was available at that time, especially for severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. We determined whether the infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would help to improve pulmonary function and overall outcome in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. We offered MSC infusion as an extended indication to all critically ill COVID-19 patients with a Horovitz index <100. We treated 5 out of 23 patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS with an infusion of MSCs. One million MSCs/kg body weight was infused over 30 minutes, and the process was repeated in 3 patients twice and in 2 patients 3 times. RESULT: Four out of 5 MSC-treated patients compared to 50% of control patients (9 out of 18) received ECMO support (80%). The MSC group showed a higher Murray score on admission than control patients, reflecting more severe pulmonary compromise (3.5 ± 0.2 versus 2.8 ± 0.3). MSC infusion was safe and well tolerated. The MSC group had a significantly higher Horovitz score on discharge than the control group. Compared to controls, patients with MSC treatment showed a significantly lower Murray score upon discharge than controls. In the MSC group, 4 out of 5 patients (80%) survived to discharge and exhibited good pulmonary function, whereas only 8 out of 18 patients (45%) in the control group survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: MSC infusion is a safe treatment for COVID-19 ARDS that improves pulmonary function and overall outcome in this patient population.","Häberle, Helene; Magunia, Harry; Lang, Peter; Gloeckner, Henning; Körner, Andreas; Koeppen, Michael; Backchoul, Tamam; Malek, Nisar; Handgretinger, Rupert; Rosenberger, Peter; Mirakaj, Valbona",J Intensive Care Med,,760

The study examined ten atypical patients out of 909 severe or critical patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus between 25 January 2020 and 10 February 2020. Data were obtained from the electronic medical records of severe or critical patients without respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Among 943 COVID-19 patients, 909 (96.4%) were severe or critical type. Of the severe or critical patients, ten (1.1%) presented without respiratory symptoms or fever at admission. The median age of the ten participants was 63 years (interquartile range (IQR): 57-72), and seven participants were men. The median time from symptom onset to admission was 14 d (IQR: 7-20). Eight of the ten patients had chronic diseases. The patients had fatigue (n = 5), headache or dizziness (n = 4), diarrhea (n = 5), anorexia (n = 3), nausea or vomiting (n = 3), and eye discomfort (n = 1). Four patients were found to have lymphopenia. Imaging examination revealed that nine patients had bilateral pneumonia and one had unilateral pneumonia. Eventually, two patients died and eight were discharged. In the discharged patients, the median time from admission to discharge lasted 24 d (IQR: 13-43). In summary, some severe or critical COVID-19 patients were found to have no respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. All such atypical cases should be identified and quarantined as early as possible, since they tend to have a prolonged hospital stay or fatal outcomes. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan and nucleic acid detection should be performed immediately on close contacts of COVID-19 patients to screen out those with atypical infections, even if the contacts present without respiratory symptoms or fever at onset.","Xu, Juanjuan; Yin, Zhengrong; Liu, Yu; Wang, Sufei; Duan, Limin; An, Yi; Fan, Jinshuo; Liao, Tingting; Jin, Yang; Chen, Jianguo",,,760

We leveraged a large U.S. pharmacy-claims database to understand the use of evidence-based therapies in heart failure (HF) care during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 27,027,650 individual claims from an all-payer pharmacy-claims database across 56,155 chain, independent and mail-order pharmacies in 14,164 zip codes in 50 states. Prescriptions dispensed (in 2-week intervals) of evidence-based HF therapies in 2020 were indexed to comparable timeframes in 2019. We normalized these year-to-year changes in HF medical therapies relative to those observed with a stable basket of drugs. RESULTS: Fills of losartan, lisinopril, carvedilol, and metoprolol all peaked in the weeks of March 2020 and demonstrated trajectories thereafter that were relatively consistent with the reference set of drugs. Fills of spironolactone (+4%) and eplerenone (+18%) showed modest trends toward increased relative use during 2020. Fills of empagliflozin (+75%), dapagliflozin (+65%) and sacubitril/valsartan (+61%) showed striking longitudinal increases throughout 2020 that deviated substantially from year-to-year trends of the overall basket of drugs. For all 3 therapies, fills of all quantity sizes increased relatively throughout 2020. For both generic and brand-name therapies, prescription fill patterns from mail-order pharmacies increased substantially over expected trends beginning in March 2020 CONCLUSION: Prescription fills of most established generic therapies used in HF care were maintained, whereas those of sacubitril/valsartan and the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors steeply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. These nationwide pharmacy claims data provide reassurance about therapeutic access, during a public health crisis, to evidence-based medications used in HF care.","Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Li, Diane; Van Meijgaard, Jeroen; Warraich, Haider J",J. card. fail,,760

Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of our previously identified humanized cross-neutralizing antibody H014, we systematically analyzed a fully human naive antibody library and rationally identified a potent neutralizing antibody partner, P17, which confers effective protection in animal model. Cryo-EM studies dissected the nature of the P17 epitope, which is SARS-CoV-2 specific and distinctly different from that of H014. High-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with H014 and P17, together with functional investigations revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, synergistic neutralization was achieved by S1 shielding and conformational locking, thereby blocking receptor attachment and viral membrane fusion, conferring high potency as well as robustness against viral mutation escape. Furthermore, cluster analysis identified a hypothetical 3rd antibody partner for further reinforcing the cocktail as pan-SARS-CoVs therapeutics.","Yao, Hangping; Sun, Yao; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Wang, Nan; Tan, Yongcong; Zhang, Na-Na; Li, Xiao-Feng; Kong, Chao; Xu, Yan-Peng; Chen, Qi; Cao, Tian-Shu; Zhao, Hui; Yan, Xintian; Cao, Lei; Lv, Zhe; Zhu, Dandan; Feng, Rui; Wu, Nanping; Zhang, Wenhai; Hu, Yuhao; Chen, Keda; Zhang, Rong-Rong; Lv, Qingyu; Sun, Shihui; Zhou, Yunhua; Yan, Run; Yang, Guan; Sun, Xinglu; Liu, Chanjuan; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Qiu, Hongying; Huang, Xing-Yao; Weng, Tianhao; Shi, Danrong; Jiang, Weidong; Shao, Junbin; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Jie; Jiang, Tao; Lang, Guojun; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Li, Lanjuan; Wang, Xiangxi",Cell res,,760

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAMP Air was developed using an iterative process with input from stakeholders and incorporating usability testing results (n = 14 adolescents). To test CAMP Air's initial impact, 61 adolescents from two New York City public high schools (n = 37) and from clinics, community-based organizations, and third-party recruitment services (i.e., community sample; n = 24) were enrolled in a randomized pilot trial. Participants were randomized to CAMP Air (n = 30) or information-and-referral control intervention (n = 31). A point-person worked with school participants to complete CAMP Air. RESULTS: CAMP Air participants were satisfied with the intervention and its value for supporting self-management, completing on average 6 of 7 modules. Relative to controls, CAMP Air participants demonstrated significantly improved asthma knowledge, asthma control, night wakening and school absences, and less risk for urgent care visits. Adolescents enrolled in schools completed more modules and had significantly fewer nights woken and school absences than community enrollees. CONCLUSION: CAMP Air improves asthma outcomes among adolescents with uncontrolled asthma. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A web-based intervention CAMP Air is a promising intervention.

Whereas case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events in the SSA region. To capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries, a line list was developed from publicly available data on institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts. The availability of indicators—gender, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected—for each imported case was assessed. We evaluated the relationship between the time to first reported importation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) overall score; 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Of the 2,516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1,129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. Imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 6 weeks–88 years; IQR: 31–54 years). A country’s time to report its first importation was not related to the GHSI overall score, after controlling for air traffic.

625237,FREQUÊNCI33DE COVID-19 ENTRE PORTADORES DE NEOPLASIAS HEMATOLÓGICAS: RESULTADOS DE PROGRAMA DE TRIAGEM AMPLA NO DECORRER DA PANDEMIA,2020-11-30,"Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure is frequently managed with invasive mechanical ventilation with or without prone position (PP). We describe 13 cases of nonhypercapnic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) of varied etiology, who were treated successfully in PP without the need for intubation. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, supplementary oxygen with venturi face mask, or nasal cannula were used variedly in these patients. Mechanical ventilatory support is offered to patients with AHRF when other methods, such as NIV and oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, fail. Invasive mechanical ventilation is fraught with complications which could be immediate, ranging from worsening of hypoxemia, worsening hemodynamics, loss of airway, and even death. Late complications could be ventilator-associated pneumonia, biotrauma, tracheal stenosis, etc. Prone position is known to improve oxygenation and outcome in adult respiratory distress syndrome. We postulated that positioning an unintubated patient with AHRF in PP will improve oxygenation and avoid the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and thereby its complications. Here, we describe a series of 13 patients with hypoxemic respiratory of varied etiology, who were successfully treated in the PP without endotracheal intubation. Two patients (15.4%) had mild, nine (69.2%) had moderate, and two (15.4%) had severe hypoxemia. Oxygenation as assessed by PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in supine position was 154 ± 52, which improved to 328 ± 65 after PP. Alveolar to arterial (A-a) O(2) gradient improved from a median of 170.5 mm Hg interquartile range (IQR) (127.8, 309.7) in supine position to 49.1 mm Hg IQR (45.0, 56.6) after PP. This improvement in oxygenation took a median of 46 hours, IQR (24, 109). Thus, voluntary PP maneuver improved oxygenation and avoided endotracheal intubation in a select group of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. This maneuver may be relevant in the ongoing novel coronavirus disease pandemic by potentially reducing endotracheal intubation and the need for ventilator and therefore better utilization of critical care services.

The advent of electron microscopy and molecular biology showed that diarrhea could also be caused by viruses, both in humans and in other animals. In 1969, electron microcopy was used to show, for the first time, the responsibility of a virus in a case of calf diarrhea. This “ reo-like virus ” was subsequently identified as a rotavirus, and was shown only four years later to be responsible for severe diarrhea in young children. Noroviruses, and particularly the human virus Norwalk, were subsequently discovered, followed by coronavirus, sapovirus, pestivirus, astrovirus, enteric adenoviruses, torovirus, and picobirnavirus. Some of viruses found in animals, and particularly rotaviruses, can also infect humans. Rotaviruses have been identified in numerous animal species and are generally host-specific, but zoonotic transmission has been suggested by cross-infection (especially in experimental models), by genetic studies showing a close relationship between certain human and animal rotaviruses, and by the discovery of new animal genotypes during epidemiological surveillance of human rotaviroses.

677382,Increased incidence of idiopathic paediatric facial palsy during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2021-05-12,"The development of reliable biosensing platforms plays a key role in the detection of proteins in clinically and environmentally derived samples for diagnostics, as well as for process monitoring in biotechnological productions. For this purpose, the biosensor has to be stable and reproducible, and highly sensitive to detect potentially extremely low concentrations and prevent the nonspecific binding of interfering compounds. In this review, we present an overview of recently published (2017–2019) immobilization techniques for aptamers on gold electrodes for the electrochemical detection of proteins. These include the direct immobilization of thiolated aptamers and the utilization of short linkers, streptavidin/biotin interaction, as well as DNA nanostructures and reduced graphene oxide as immobilization platforms. Applied strategies for signal amplification and the prevention of biofouling are additionally discussed, as they play a crucial role in the design of biosensors. While a wide variety of amplification strategies are already available, future investigations should aim to establish suitable antifouling strategies that are compatible with electrochemical measurements. The focus of our review lies on the detailed discussion of the underlying principles and the presentation of utilized chemical protocols in order to provide the reader with promising ideas and profound knowledge of the subject, as well as an update on recent discoveries and achievements.","Oberhaus, Franziska V.; Frense, Dieter; Beckmann, Dieter",Biosensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bios10050045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354207/,760
678563,Correction to: Risk factors for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic in Belgium: a etrospective cohort study,2020-12-14,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating and life‐threatening syndrome that results in high morbidity and mortality. Current pharmacologic treatments and mechanical ventilation have limited value in targeting the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown potent therapeutic advantages in experimental and clinical trials through direct cell‐to‐cell interaction and paracrine signaling. However, safety concerns and the indeterminate effects of MSCs have resulted in the investigation of MSC‐derived extracellular vesicles (MSC‐EVs) due to their low immunogenicity and tumorigenicity. Over the past decades, soluble proteins, microRNAs, and organelles packaged in EVs have been identified as efficacious molecules to orchestrate nearby immune responses, which attenuate acute lung injury by facilitating pulmonary epithelium repair, reducing acute inflammation, and restoring pulmonary vascular leakage. Even though MSC‐EVs possess similar bio‐functional effects to their parental cells, there remains existing barriers to employing this alternative from bench to bedside. Here, we summarize the current established research in respect of molecular mechanisms of MSC‐EV effects in ARDS and highlight the future challenges of MSC‐EVs for clinical application.","Su, Yue; Guo, Haiyan; Liu, Qinghua",J Leukoc Biol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.3mr0321-545rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955590/,760

688209,ESTRATÉGIAS DE GESTÃO DO SERVIÇO DE ENFERMAGEM E MEDIDAS DE SEGURANÇA ADOTADAS DURANTE A PANDEMIA COVID-19: UM RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA,2020-11-30,"North of Italy was severely hit by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) pandemic. This induced the government to adopt severely restrictive measures to reduce the contagion risk, forcing most of the population to stop working and from leisure activities, and to remain at home for several weeks. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-related quarantine on smoking and dietary habits of a well-characterized northern Italian rural population. For this purpose, while lockdown restrictions were in place (February–April 2020), 359 subjects from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort underwent a phone interview about their lifestyle habit changes during COVID-19-related quarantine. Quarantine did not significantly modify smoking habit nor body mass index. Subjects significantly increased daily carbohydrates consumption, all fresh vegetables, healthy vegetable oils, milk and yogurt, alcoholic drinks, sugars and sweets, and coffee. The weekly consumption of low-fat meat, cured meat other than ham, cheeses, eggs, nuts and mixed seed oils significantly increased, while the weekly intake of fish, mussels, and legumes significantly decreased during lockdown. The Dietary Quality Index was reduced from 42.4 ± 4.1 to 37.8 ± 4.7 (p < 0.03). In accordance with our findings, COVID-19-related quarantine might worsen the quality of diet, also leading to an increased intake of almost all food categories.","Cicero, Arrigo F.
