2667,"Health workers perceptions and attitude about Ghana’s preparedness towards preventing, containing, and managing Ebola Virus Disease",2017-04-12,"BACKGROUND: Ebola virus is highly infectious and the disease can be very fatal. The World Health Organization has declared the 2014–2015 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In response to this, preparations were made in various health facilities and entry points across Ghana. This study explored health workers perceptions, and attitude about Ghana’s preparedness towards preventing and containing Ebola Virus Disease. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in five (5) of the ten (10) regions in Ghana. Five focus group discussions (N = 44) were conducted among nurses; one in each region. In addition, ten (10) health workers (2 in each region) who are members of regional Ebola Virus Disease task force were recruited and interviewed. In the Greater Accra, Volta and Western regions that have ports, six (6) port health officials: two in each of these regions were also interviewed. The interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the transcripts with the aid of NVivo 10 software. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that Ghanaian health workers perceived the screening at various ports as important and ongoing but felt that the screenings at in-land ports were being undermined by the use of unapproved routes. Training of health workers was also being carried out in all the regions, however, there was a general perception among 33 out of 44 nurses that majority of health workers have not received training on Ebola Virus Disease prevention and management. Logistical challenges were also reported as some health facilities did not have adequate Personal Protective Equipment. In facilities where equipment was available, they were stored in places which are not easily accessible to health workers at all times of the day. Human resource preparation was also perceived to be a challenge as health workers (38/44 of nurses) generally expressed fear and unwillingness to work in Ebola treatment centres in the event of an outbreak in Ghana. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that preparatory work for Ebola Virus Disease prevention and containment in Ghana is perceived as inadequate by health workers. Ghana needs to strengthen preparation in the area of training of health workers, provision and accessibility of Personal Protective Equipment and incentives for health workers to better position her to contain and manage any Ebola Virus Disease outbreak.","Adongo, Philip Baba; Tabong, Philip Teg-Nefaah; Asampong, Emmanuel; Ansong, Joana; Robalo, Magda; Adanu, Richard M.",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389014/,146
4252,"Paediatric nurses’ general self-efficacy, perceived organizational support and perceived professional benefits from Class A tertiary hospitals in Jilin province of China: the mediating effect of nursing practice environment",2020-01-03,"BACKGROUND: General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential parameters affecting the quality of clinical practice and nurses’ perceived professional benefits (NPPB). Perceived organizational support (POS) is regarded as being central in understanding job-related attitudes, and it is important to enhance POS for nurses to maintain their current employment. NPPB can further reduce nurses’ job burnout and turn-over intention. Many studies have explored the relationships among general self-efficacy, POS, nursing practice environment (NPE) and NPPB. However, a moderating effect of NPE has not been fully explored in nurses, especially among paediatric nurses. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2018 with 300 paediatric nurses from 3 Class A tertiary hospitals in Jilin Province. The respondents completed the General Self-Efficacy Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Scale, Practice Environment Scale and Nurses’ Perceived Professional Benefits Scale. The data were analyzed using path analysis and SPSS (version 23.0, IBM). RESULTS: General self-efficacy and POS were significantly positively associated with NPPB, which showed that the model had a good fit to the data. NPE was found to play a partial mediating role between POS and NPPB and also had a complete mediating role between general self-efficacy and NPPB. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that general self-efficacy indirectly influences NPPB, and POS directly and indirectly influences NPPB by NPE. Effective measures should be taken to improve nurses’ practice environment in hospitals to raise nurses’ enthusiasm and confidence in their work.","Cheng, Linan; Cui, Yajuan; Chen, Qian; Ye, Yansheng; Liu, Yingchun; Zhang, Fengying; Zeng, Weiyan; Hu, Xiuying",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942354/,146
4481,Working with patients suffering from chronic diseases can be a balancing act for health care professionals - a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies,2020-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000 person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression models. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents. CONCLUSIONS: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I risk.","Moyo, Patience; Zullo, Andrew R.; McConeghy, Kevin W.; Bosco, Elliott; van Aalst, Robertus; Chit, Ayman; Gravenstein, Stefan",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7011520/,146
13191,Operative and Technical Modifications to the Coriolis(®) µ Air Sampler That Improve Sample Recovery and Biosafety During Microbiological Air Sampling,2020-05-29,"INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is recognised globally as a prevalent, costly and disabling condition. Recurrences are common and contribute to much of the burden of LBP. Current evidence favours exercise and education for prevention of LBP recurrence, but an optimal intervention has not yet been established. Walking is a simple, widely accessible, low-cost intervention that has yet to be evaluated. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a progressive and individualised walking and education programme (intervention) for the prevention of LBP recurrences in adults compared with no treatment (control). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pragmatic, two-armed RCT comparing walking and education (n=349) with a no treatment control group (n=349). Inclusion criteria are adults recovered from an episode of non-specific LBP within the last 6 months. Those allocated to the intervention group will receive six sessions (three face to face and three telephone delivered) with a trained physiotherapist to facilitate a progressive walking programme and education over a 6-month period. The primary outcome will be days to first recurrence of an episode of activity-limiting LBP. The secondary outcomes include days to recurrence of an episode of LBP, days to recurrence of an episode of LBP leading to care seeking, disability and quality of life measured at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and costs associated with LBP recurrence. All participants will be followed up monthly for a minimum of 12 months. The primary intention-to-treat analysis will assess difference in survival curves (days to recurrence) using the log-rank statistic. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the societal perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approved by Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 5201949218164, May 2019). Findings will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

13464,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Intentions towards HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Nursing Students in Spain",2020-09-29,"Community-based nutritional intervention to improve the practice of dietary diversity and child nutrition by community health workers (CHWs) involving Nyumba Kumi as small neighborhood units (SNUs) in communities has not yet been explored. This study was conducted in two villages in rural Kenya between 2018 and 2019. In total, 662 participants (control vs. intervention: n = 339 vs. n = 323) were recruited. The intervention group received education on maternal and child nutrition and follow-up consultations. The custom-tailored educational guidelines were made based on Infant and Young Child Feeding and the mother and child health booklet. The educational effects on household caregivers’ feeding practice attitude and child nutritional status were analyzed using multiple linear regression. After the intervention, a total of 368 household caregivers (187 vs. 181) and 180 children (113 vs. 67) were analyzed separately. Between the groups, no significant difference was found in their background characteristics. This study successfully improved the dietary diversity score (β = 0.54; p < 0.01) and attitude score (β = 0.29; p < 0.01). The results revealed that the interventions using CHWs and SNUs were useful to improve dietary diversity and caregivers’ attitudes toward recommended feeding. This research has the potential to be successfully applied in other regions where child undernutrition remains.","Hitachi, Mami; Wanjihia, Violet; Nyandieka, Lilian; Francesca, Chepkirui; Wekesa, Norah; Changoma, Juma; Muniu, Erastus; Ndemwa, Phillip; Honda, Sumihisa; Hirayama, Kenji; Karama, Mohammed; Kaneko, Satoshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579186/,146
13467,Do Protected Areas Matter? A Systematic Review of the Social and Ecological Impacts of the Establishment of Protected Areas,2020-10-04,"The present study aimed to examine the relationship between the quality of undergraduate education perceived by novice nurses and their retrospective satisfaction with their education. It also studied the relationships between the perceived usefulness of their education for their current jobs and the quality of the jobs held by novice nursing professionals. The moderator role of mobility in this relationship was also analyzed, as it reflects a boundary condition in which additional preparation or job opportunities may occur. The study used data from the graduates’ survey carried out by the Agència per a la Qualitat del Sistema Universitari de Catalunya (AQU) in 2017. The analysis of data from 644 graduates of Catalan Universities in 2014 highlights different functions of two types of knowledge and skills; those directly related to science and the practice of nursing are stronger predictors of retrospective satisfaction with nursing education. In turn, the perception of the usefulness of horizontal skills, such as transversal and communication skills, plays a stronger role in predicting job quality. The results about the role of mobility were not conclusive, and more research is needed to clarify its influence on nursing education and subsequent professional practice.","Peiró, Teresa; Sora, Beatriz; Soriano, Aida; Yeves, Jesús",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579279/,146
14162,Incident reports involving hospital administrative staff: analysis of data from the Japan Council for Quality Health care nationwide database,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: The investigation of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-conditioned medium or extracellular vesicles (exosomes or microvesicles) as a remedy for acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has become a fast-growing field in recent years. Our purpose was to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of MSC-derived therapies (MDTs) for ALI/ARDS in animal models. METHODS: A meta-analysis of MDTs for ALI/ARDS in animal trials was performed. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to screen relevant preclinical trials with a predetermined search strategy. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies that compared MDT with the ALI control group were included in our study. The pooled result derived from the comparison of the two groups suggested that MDT could significantly reduce the lung injury score (standardized mean difference (SMD) = − 4.02, 95% CI [− 5.28, − 2.23], P < 0.0001) and improve animal survival (OR = − 6.45, 95% CI [2.78, 14.97], P < 0.0001). MDT mitigated the infiltration of neutrophils in alveoli (SMD = − 3.38, 95% CI [− 4.58, − 2.18], P < 0.00001). MDT also reduced the wet-dry weight ratio of the lung (SMD = − 2.34, 95% CI [− 3.42, − 1.26], P < 0.0001) and the total protein in BALF (SMD = − 2.23, 95% CI [− 3.07, − 1.40], P < 0.00001). Furthermore, MDT was found to downregulate proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a and to upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. CONCLUSION: MDT reduces lung injury and improves survival in animal ARDS models since it can ameliorate lung permeability, decrease inflammatory cell infiltration, downregulate proinflammatory mediators, and upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators. However, more animal studies and human trials are needed for further investigation.","Wang, Fengyun; Fang, Bin; Qiang, Xinhua; Shao, Jingsong; Zhou, Lixin",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677103/,146

Data supporting the role of JAK/STAT in the development of vasculitis are limited and mostly focused on large vessel vasculitis and Behçet’s disease. In this review, we provide a thorough picture of currently available evidence on the topic, gathered from in vitro experiments, animal models and human real-life data, analyzing the rationale for the use of JAK inhibitors for the management of vasculitis. Overall, despite a very strong biological and pathogenic basis, data are too few to recommend this therapeutic approach, beyond very severe and refractory forms of vasculitis. However, for the same reasons, a strong scientific effort in this direction is indeed worthwhile.","Bursi, Roberto; Cafaro, Giacomo; Perricone, Carlo; Riccucci, Ilenia; Calvacchi, Santina; Gerli, Roberto; Bartoloni, Elena",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039124/,146

19836,Healthcare Providers and Caregivers’ Perspectives on the Quality of Child Health Services in Urban Indonesia: A Mixed-Methods Study,2021-07-29,"Isobavachalcone (IBC) is an active substance from the medicinal plant Psoralea corylifolia. This prenylated chalcone was reported to possess antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer activities. Multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with the over-expression of the transporters of vast substrate specificity such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) belongs to the main causes of cancer chemotherapy failure. The cytotoxic, MDR reversing, and ABCB1-inhibiting potency of isobavachalcone was studied in two cellular models: human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line and its resistant counterpart HT29/Dx in which doxorubicin resistance was induced by prolonged drug treatment, and the variant of MDCK cells transfected with the human gene encoding ABCB1. Because MDR modulators are frequently membrane-active substances, the interaction of isobavachalcone with model phosphatidylcholine bilayers was studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry. Molecular modeling was employed to characterize the process of membrane permeation by isobavachalcone. IBC interacted with ABCB1 transporter, being a substrate and/or competitive inhibitor of ABCB1. Moreover, IBC intercalated into model membranes, significantly affecting the parameters of their main phospholipid phase transition. It was concluded that isobavachalcone interfered both with the lipid phase of cellular membrane and with ABCB1 transporter, and for this reason, its activity in MDR cancer cells was presumptively beneficial.","Palko-Łabuz, Anna; Błaszczyk, Maria; Środa-Pomianek, Kamila; Wesołowska, Olga",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347294/,146
20405,Occurrence of Mental Illness and Mental Health Risks among the Self-Employed: A Systematic Review,2021-08-15,"The correct diagnosis and recognition of crop diseases play an important role in ensuring crop yields and preventing food safety. The existing methods for crop disease recognition mainly focus on accuracy while ignoring the algorithm’s robustness. In practice, the acquired images are often accompanied by various noises. These noises lead to a huge challenge for improving the robustness and accuracy of the recognition algorithm. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a residual self-calibration and self-attention aggregation network (RCAA-Net) for crop disease recognition in actual scenarios. The proposed RCAA-Net is composed of three main modules: (1) multi-scale residual module, (2) feedback self-calibration module, and (3) self-attention aggregation module. Specifically, the multi-scale residual module is designed to learn multi-scale features and provide both global and local information for the appearance of the disease to improve the performance of the model. The feedback self-calibration is proposed to improve the robustness of the model by suppressing the background noise in the original deep features. The self-attention aggregation module is introduced to further improve the robustness and accuracy of the model by capturing multi-scale information in different semantic spaces. The experimental results on the challenging 2018ai_challenger crop disease recognition dataset show that the proposed RCAA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on robustness and accuracy for crop disease recognition in actual scenarios.","Zhang, Qiang; Sun, Banyong; Cheng, Yaxiong; Li, Xijie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394211/,146

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative epoch study of ELGANs with pPDA being considered for surgical ligation. ELGANs in epoch 1 (2009–2012) were referred for ligation, while infants in epoch 2 (2012–2015) were treated with oral acetaminophen and referred for ligation in the absence of improvement. The primary outcome was a composite of death/NDI at 18–24 months. RESULTS: Ninety-two ELGANs with median[IQR] GA 25.2 weeks [24.4, 26.3] had pPDA (43 in epoch 1, 49 in -epoch 2) with acetaminophen-exposed neonates receiving 7 days [7, 7] of treatment. ELGANs in epoch 2 had reduced ligation (aOR 0.30; 95%CI: [0.11, 0.87]), but there was no difference in death/NDI (aOR 1.03; 95%CI: [0.30, 3.56]). CONCLUSIONS: Late treatment with acetaminophen to avoid surgery for pPDA is associated with reduced ligation but no difference in death/NDI, supporting the safety and effectiveness of this approach.","Mashally, Sally; Banihani, Rudaina; Jasani, Bonny; Nield, Lynne E.; Martins, Fernando F.; Jain, Amish; Weisz, Dany E.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395383/,146
21717,Factors Affecting the Delivery and Acceptability of the ROWTATE Telehealth Vocational Rehabilitation Intervention for Traumatic Injury Survivors: A Mixed-Methods Study,2021-09-16,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), conditions of hyperinsulinaemia, have lower levels of osteocalcin and bone remodelling, and increased rates of fragility fractures. Unlike osteoporosis with lower bone mineral density (BMD), T2DM bone fragility “hyperinsulinaemia-osteofragilitas” phenotype presents with normal to increased BMD. Hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance positively associate with increased BMD and fragility fractures. Hyperinsulinaemia enforces glucose fuelling, which decreases NAD+-dependent antioxidant activity. This increases reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial fission, and decreases oxidative phosphorylation high-energy production capacity, required for osteoblasto/cytogenesis. Osteocytes directly mineralise and resorb bone, and inhibit mineralisation of their lacunocanalicular space via pyrophosphate. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases vitamin D availability via adipocyte sequestration, reducing dendrite connectivity, and compromising osteocyte viability. Decreased bone remodelling and micropetrosis ensues. Trapped/entombed magnesium within micropetrosis fossilisation spaces propagates magnesium deficiency (MgD), potentiating hyperinsulinaemia and decreases vitamin D transport. Vitamin D deficiency reduces osteocalcin synthesis and favours osteocyte apoptosis. Carbohydrate restriction/fasting/ketosis increases beta-oxidation, ketolysis, NAD+-dependent antioxidant activity, osteocyte viability and osteocalcin, and decreases excess insulin exposure. Osteocalcin is required for hydroxyapatite alignment, conferring bone structural integrity, decreasing fracture risk and improving metabolic/endocrine homeodynamics. Patients presenting with fracture and normal BMD should be investigated for T2DM and hyperinsulinaemia.","Cooper, Isabella D.; Brookler, Kenneth H.; Crofts, Catherine A.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Group Treatment Compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Group Treatment for Weight Loss Maintenance: An Individually Randomized Group Treatment Trial,2021-09-10,"In current seasonal influenza vaccines, neutralizing antibody titers directed against the hemagglutinin surface protein are the primary correlate of protection. These vaccines are, therefore, quantitated in terms of their hemagglutinin content. Adding other influenza surface proteins, such as neuraminidase and M2e, to current quadrivalent influenza vaccines would likely enhance vaccine efficacy. However, this would come with increased manufacturing complexity and cost. To address this issue, as a proof of principle, we have designed genetic fusions of hemagglutinin ectodomains from H3 and H1 influenza A subtypes. These recombinant H1-H3 hemagglutinin ectodomain fusions could be transiently expressed at high yield in mammalian cell culture using Expi293F suspension cells. Fusions were trimeric, and as stable in solution as their individual trimeric counterparts. Furthermore, the H1-H3 fusion constructs were antigenically intact based on their reactivity with a set of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. H1-H3 hemagglutinin ectodomain fusion immunogens, when formulated with the MF59 equivalent adjuvant squalene-in-water emulsion (SWE), induced H1 and H3-specific humoral immune responses equivalent to those induced with an equimolar mixture of individually expressed H1 and H3 ectodomains. Mice immunized with these ectodomain fusions were protected against challenge with heterologous H1N1 (Bel/09) and H3N2 (X-31) mouse-adapted viruses with higher neutralizing antibody titers against the H1N1 virus. Use of such ectodomain-fused immunogens would reduce the number of components in a vaccine formulation and allow for the inclusion of other protective antigens to increase influenza vaccine efficacy.","Mittal, Nidhi; Sengupta, Nayanika; Malladi, Sameer Kumar; Reddy, Poorvi; Bhat, Madhuraj; Rajmani, Raju S.; Sedeyn, Koen; Saelens, Xavier; Dutta, Somnath; Varadarajan, Raghavan",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473191/,146

Amidst the gloomy economic outlook, certain sectors seem to have survived better than others. This paper aims to investigate the sectors that have performed better even as market sentiment is affected by the pandemic. The daily closing stock prices of a total usable sample of 1,567 firms from 37 sectors are first analyzed using a combination of hierarchical clustering and shape-based distance (SBD) measures. Market sentiment is modeled from Google Trends on the COVID-19 pandemic. This is then analyzed against the time series of daily closing stock prices using augmented vector autoregression (VAR). The empirical results indicate that market sentiment towards the pandemic has significant effects on the stock prices of the sectors. Particularly, the stock price performance across sectors is differentiated by the level of the digital transformation of sectors, with those that are most digitally transformed, showing resilience towards negative market sentiment on the pandemic. This study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating search trends to analyze market sentiment, and by showing that digital transformation moderated the stock market resilience of firms against concern over the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ding, Ding; Guan, Chong; Chan, Calvin M.

47482,The Counterintuitive Concept of Ergodicity in the Context of a Business Simulation Game,2021-02-12,"After the bombings of 1943, the historic centre of Palermo was left with several crumbling buildings and a social situation of some concern. Therefore, over the last sixty years, all kinds of representations of Palermo have revolved around the presence of criminal organizations and the risks of living in the most dangerous areas of the city (including the city centre). These representations started to change around the beginning of the new century when the inner city of Palermo underwent an intense process of redefinition of its territorial identity. Several key factors may be used to explain this process: from traditional economic reasons concerning gentrification and touristification, to culture-led approaches and to urban policies that support the organization of megaevents (Manifesta 12, Italian Capital of Culture, etc.). Participation processes taking place in the city centre have also furthered the scope and range of these changes, trying to mark a distance from the past. This chapter aims to provide the results of ongoing action-research held in the inner city of Palermo, with the goal of describing the imageries that both local social actors, foreigners and tourists are shaping in their redefinition of what Palermo is or should be.","Picone, Marco",Representing Place and Territorial Identities in Europe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971984/,146

To develop antiviral interventions quickly, drugs used for the treatment of unrelated diseases are currently being repurposed to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that is used for the treatment of COVID-19 as it inhibits the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the African green monkey kidney-derived cell line Vero1-3. Here we show that engineered expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular protease that activates SARS-CoV-2 for entry into lung cells4, renders SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells insensitive to chloroquine. Moreover, we report that chloroquine does not block infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the TMPRSS2-expressing human lung cell line Calu-3. These results indicate that chloroquine targets a pathway for viral activation that is not active in lung cells and is unlikely to protect against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in and between patients.","Hoffmann, Markus; Mösbauer, Kirstin; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Kaul, Artur; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Krüger, Nadine; Gassen, Nils C; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Nature,,146

Early indication and detection of diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare resources. The latest developments in machine learning (more specifically, deep learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for EHR (electronic health records), capable of multitask prediction and disease trajectory mapping. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6 million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking absolute improvement of 8.0-10.8%, in terms of Average Precision Score, compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models (in terms of average precision, when predicting for the onset of 301 conditions). In addition to its superior prediction power, BEHRT provides a personalised view of disease trajectories through its attention mechanism; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to improve the accuracy of its predictions; and its (pre-)training results in disease and patient representations that can help us get a step closer to interpretable predictions.","Li, Yikuan; Rao, Shishir; Solares, Jose Roberto Ayala; Hassaine, Abdelaali; Canoy, Dexter; Zhu, Yajie; Rahimi, Kazem; Salimi-Khorshidi, Gholamreza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09538v1.pdf,146

This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID-19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID-19 infections. Methods and Results In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D-dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. Conclusions We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID-19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID-19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

310334,Dr Fahad Liaquat,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effectiveness of medication abortion with the implementation of telemedicine and a no-test protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a medication abortion up to 77 days gestation at the University of Hawai'i between April and November 2020. Patients had the option of traditional in clinic care or telemedicine with either in clinic pickup or mailing of medications. During this time, a no-test protocol for medication abortion without prior labs or ultrasound was in place for eligible patients. The primary outcome was the rate of successful medication abortion without surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included abortion-related complications. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients were dispensed mifepristone and misoprostol, 149 (44.6%) with telemedicine with in-person pickup of medications, 75 (22.5%) via telemedicine with medications mailed, and 110 (32.9%) via traditional in person visits. The overall rate of complete medication abortion without surgical intervention was 95.8%, with success rates of 96.8, 97.1, and 93.6% for the clinic pickup, mail, and clinic visit groups, respectively. Success for those without an ultrasound performed prior to the procedure was 96.6%, compared to 95.5% for those with ultrasound. We obtained follow-up data for 87.8% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Medication abortion was safe and effective while offering multiple modes of care delivery including telemedicine visits without an ultrasound performed prior to dispensing medications. IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating telemedicine and a no-test protocol for medication abortion is safe and has the potential to expand access to abortion care. All care models had low rates of adverse events, which contradicts the idea that the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategyincreases the safety of medication abortion.","Kerestes, Courtney; Murayama, Sarah; Tyson, Jasmine; Natavio, Melissa; Seamon, Elisabeth; Raidoo, Shandhini; Lacar, Lea; Bowen, Emory; Soon, Reni; Platais, Ingrida; Kaneshiro, Bliss; Stowers, Paris",Contraception,,146

This observational cross-sectional study aimed to explore the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among dental HCWs in Russia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The survey was carried out among 128 dental HCWs from three dental clinics of Ekaterinburg, Russia. The mean age of the sample was 38.6 years. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report (PSS-SR); subjective distress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The results indicated that 20.3-24.2% HCWs had mild to extremely severe symptoms of psychological distress, and 7.1-29.7% had clinical symptoms of PTSD. No differences between females and males were revealed. HCWs working directly with patients had significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and the risk of PTSD development compared to those working indirectly, whereas older HCWs had significantly higher levels of both psychological distress and PTSD symptoms compared to younger HCWs. Thus, dental HCWs are at high risk for psychological distress and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sarapultseva, Maria; Zolotareva, Alena; Kritsky, Igor; Nasretdinova, Natal039; ya,; Sarapultsev, Alexey",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,146

Atmospheric conditions can play a fundamental role in the transmission of a virus. The relationship between several atmospheric variables and the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are therefore investigated in this study, in which the State of Kuwait, which has a hot, arid climate, is considered during free movement (without restriction), partial lockdown (partial restrictions), and full lockdown (full restriction). The relationship between the infection rate, growth rate, and doubling time for SARS-CoV-2 and atmospheric variables are also investigated in this study. Daily data describing the number of COVID-19 cases and atmospheric variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, and solar radiation, were collected for the period February 24 to May 30, 2020. Stochastic models were employed to analyze how atmospheric variables can affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The normal and lognormal probability and cumulative density functions (PDF and CDF) were applied to analyze the relationship between atmospheric variables and COVID-19 cases. The Spearman's rank correlation test and multiple regression model were used to investigate the correlation of the studied variables with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to confirm the findings obtained from the stochastic models. The results indicate that relative humidity had a significant negative correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases, whereas positive correlations were observed for cases of infection and temperature, wind speed, and visibility. The infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 is directly proportional to the air temperature, wind speed, and visibility, whereas inversely related to the humidity. The lowest growth rate and longest doubling time of the COVID-19 infection occurred during the full lockdown period. The results in this study may help the World Health Organization (WHO) make specific recommendations about the outbreak of COVID-19 for decision-makers around the world.

396755,Professional Quality of Life and Mental Health Outcomes among Health Care Workers Exposed to Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19),2020,"Understanding factors that affect the infectivity of SARS CoV-2 is central to combatting COVID-19. The virus surface spike protein of SARS CoV-2 mediates viral entry into cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells and promoting fusion. We find that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces ACE2 expression when it enters the lytic replicative cycle in epithelial cells. By using VSV particles pseudotyped with the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, we show that lytic EBV replication enhances ACE2-dependent SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. We find that the ACE2 promoter contains response elements for Zta, an EBV transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV entry into the lytic cycle of replication. Zta preferentially acts on methylated promoters, allowing it to reactivate epigenetically silenced EBV promoters from latency. By using promoter assays, we show that Zta directly activates methylated ACE2 promoters. Infection of normal oral keratinocytes with EBV leads to lytic replication in some of the infected cells, induces ACE2 expression and enhances SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. These data suggest that subclinical EBV replication and lytic gene expression in epithelial cells, which is ubiquitous in the human population, may enhance the efficiency and extent of SARS CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells by transcriptionally activating ACE2 and increasing its cell surface expression.ImportanceSARS CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused a pandemic leading to millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Identifying the factors governing susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 is important in order to develop strategies to prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. We show that Epstein-Barr virus, which infects and persists in >90% of adult humans, increases susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection by SARS CoV-2. EBV, when it reactivates from latency or infects epithelial cells, increases expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS CoV-2, enhancing infection by SARS CoV-2. Inhibiting EBV replication with antivirals may therefore decrease susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 infection.","Verma, Dinesh; Mel Church, Trenton; Swaminathan, Sankar",J. virol,,146

METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, cohort survey study of EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fisher's Exact, and logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85 to 61% (p < 0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66 to 32% (p < 0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p = 0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected > 50% of respondents initially without significant change (p = 0.05 and p = 0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.82-5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10-5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four weeks (30 to 14%; p = 0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30 to 22%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: This survey of frontline EM providers, including physicians and APPs, during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, putting many at risk for burnout. The sustained impact of the pandemic on EM provider wellness deserves further investigation to guide targeted interventions.","Kelker, Heather; Yoder, Kyle; Musey, Paul; Harris, Madison; Johnson, Olivia; Sarmiento, Elisa; Vyas, Punit; Henderson, Brooke; Adams, Zachary; Welch, Julie",BMC Emerg Med,,146

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, China was the first country to impose lockdown. We aimed to study the influence of COVID-19 on the outpatient visits of rheumatic patients in a non-outbreak area of China. METHODS: We selected three provincial or ministerial hospitals in Jinan, and collected the outpatient appointments data in rheumatology and immunology departments during the Shandong Province first-level public health emergency response period from 25 January 2020 to 8 March 2020. RESULTS: In the early stage, the number of outpatient appointments in the rheumatology and immunology departments of the three provincial or ministerial hospitals were significantly reduced, and gradually restored in the late stage. It showed that in the face of major infectious diseases, strict quarantine measures with the cooperation of the public not only controls the epidemic in a short time, but also lifts the quarantine measures and opens general outpatient clinics in hospitals as soon as possible, thus minimizing the impact on other patients. INTERPRETATION: The impact on the western hospital was greater than that on the Chinese medicine hospital, and the impact on the back-up designated hospitals for COVID-19 was the greatest. Online appointment can reduce the risk of infection in outpatients, but not completely solve the follow-up problem of rheumatic patients. Telemedicine provides a new solution for both management of rheumatic patients and control of COVID-19.","Xie, Tianhua; Wang, Dong; Wang, Xia; Yang, Qingrui; Sun, Hongsheng; Liu, Ruihong; Li, Ming",Wien. klin.

417907,Addressing fundamental questions on MIS-C,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) have been considered potentially high risk for novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) mortality or other complications. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to define the impact of COVID-19 in adults with CHD and to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: Adults (age 18 years or older) with CHD and with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 were included from CHD centers worldwide. Data collection included anatomic diagnosis and subsequent interventions, comorbidities, medications, echocardiographic findings, presenting symptoms, course of illness, and outcomes. Predictors of death or severe infection were determined. RESULTS: From 58 adult CHD centers, the study included 1,044 infected patients (age: 35.1 ± 13.0 years; range 18 to 86 years; 51% women), 87% of whom had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. The cohort included 118 (11%) patients with single ventricle and/or Fontan physiology, 87 (8%) patients with cyanosis, and 73 (7%) patients with pulmonary hypertension. There were 24 COVID-related deaths (case/fatality: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.4% to 3.2%). Factors associated with death included male sex, diabetes, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency, and previous hospital admission for heart failure. Worse physiological stage was associated with mortality (p = 0.001), whereas anatomic complexity or defect group were not. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality in adults with CHD is commensurate with the general population. The most vulnerable patients are those with worse physiological stage, such as cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, whereas anatomic complexity does not appear to predict infection severity.","Broberg, Craig S; Kovacs, Adrienne H; Sadeghi, Soraya; Rosenbaum, Marlon S; Lewis, Matthew J; Carazo, Matthew R; Rodriguez, Fred H; Halpern, Dan G; Feinberg, Jodi; Galilea, Francisca Arancibia; Baraona, Fernando; Cedars, Ari M; Ko, Jong M; Porayette, Prashob; Maldonado, Jennifer; Sarubbi, Berardo; Fusco, Flavia; Frogoudaki, Alexandra A; Nir, Amiram; Chaudhry, Anisa; John, Anitha S; Karbassi, Arsha; Hoskoppal, Arvind K; Frischhertz, Benjamin P; Hendrickson, Benjamin; Bouma, Berto J; Rodriguez-Monserrate, Carla P; Broda, Christopher R; Tobler, Daniel; Gregg, David; Martinez-Quintana, Efren; Yeung, Elizabeth; Krieger, Eric V; Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco J; Giannakoulas, George; Lui, George K; Ephrem, Georges; Singh, Harsimran S; Almeneisi, Hassan Mk; Bartlett, Heather L; Lindsay, Ian; Grewal, Jasmine; Nicolarsen, Jeremy; Araujo, John J; Cramer, Jonathan W; Bouchardy, Judith; Al Najashi, Khalid; Ryan, Kristi; Alshawabkeh, Laith; Andrade, Lauren",J Am Coll Cardiol,,146

During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, patients with BC still require timely treatment and follow-up; however, hospitals are overwhelmed with infected patients and, if exposed, patients with BC are at higher risk for infection and serious complications if infected. Thus, health care providers need to evaluate each BC treatment and in-hospital visit to minimize pandemic-associated risks while maintaining adequate treatment efficacy. Here we present a set of guidelines regarding available options for BC patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the lack of evidence about COVID-19 infection, these recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion, medical organizations' and societies' recommendations, and some published evidence. We consider this a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in this health crisis situation we are facing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This work presents a set of guidelines regarding available options for breast cancer (BC) patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The situation was made worse by the spread of rumors and false information about what this virus is and ways to prevent it. Objective: Test how people interact with different information circulating through social media and online platforms. Methods: The DATA was taken from a survey conducted in 2020 on 1500 quarantined people between the ages 18-60 years old. A questionnaire was created containing most of the rumors and false information circulated, in addition to the correct information with a reliable source. The results were analyzed in the form of tables showing the proportions of supporters and opponents and expressed in numbers and percentages. Results: A total of 2000 quarantined people participated in the study with the mean age (30.35 ± 9.9 years). Where the response rate is 100%. The analysis showed a large percentage of support for health protections against the Corona virus, and a large rejection of most of the fake information and rumors circulating across the Internet platforms, in addition to their solidarity within the principles of social responsibility.

Outdoor environments that incorporate specialised exercise equipment suitable for older people are uniquely placed to promote physical activity and social connectedness amongst older people. The ENJOY project included the installation of specialised outdoor exercise equipment (the Seniors Exercise Park) and the delivery of a physical and social activity program for older people as part of a prospective pre-post research design. The installation of the specialised equipment in public sites and an aged care facility was also aimed at increasing usage of the equipment by older people from the wider community and to increase physical and social activities. METHOD: A conceptual framework for implementation and several engagement methods were utilised to guide the research and to support the participating partners throughout the project. This paper is a reflective narrative describing the collaborative process and approach utilised to engage local governments and community, and reports the challenges and the lessons learnt to inform future strategies for implementation. RESULTS: The conceptual framework for the implementation process that guided the conduct and delivery of the ENJOY project included the core elements of the Interactive Systems Framework and the ecologic framework. These models incorporate elements of research-to-practice and community-centred implementation to accommodate the unique perspectives of a range of stakeholders. CONCLUSION: Partner characteristics such as local governments’ structure and policy as well as community factors can impact on implementation. Partnership with local governments with effective communication, strategic planning and community and seniors engagement approaches are recommended for successful implementation. The lessons learnt can further assist public health research design around changes to the built environment to positively impact on older people’s physical activity levels.

592181,Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Healthcare Workers Dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support. METHODS: DisCoVeRy was a phase 3, open-label, adaptive, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 48 sites in Europe (France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg). Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness of any duration were eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxaemic pneumonia, or required oxygen supplementation. Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzymes, severe chronic kidney disease, any contraindication to one of the studied treatments or their use in the 29 days before random assignment, or use of ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive standard of care alone or in combination with remdesivir, lopinavir–ritonavir, lopinavir–ritonavir and interferon beta-1a, or hydroxychloroquine. Randomisation used computer-generated blocks of various sizes; it was stratified on severity of disease at inclusion and on European administrative region. Remdesivir was administered as 200 mg intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by once daily, 1-h infusions of 100 mg up to 9 days, for a total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant was discharged. The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15 measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population and was one of the secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT2020-000936-23, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 21, 2021, 857 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to remdesivir plus standard of care (n=429) or standard of care only (n=428). 15 participants were excluded from analysis in the remdesivir group, and ten in the control group. At day 15, the distribution of the WHO ordinal scale was: (1) not hospitalised, no limitations on activities (61 [15%] of 414 in the remdesivir group vs 73 [17%] of 418 in the control group); (2) not hospitalised, limitation on activities (129 [31%] vs 132 [32%]); (3) hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen (50 [12%] vs 29 [7%]); (4) hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen (76 [18%] vs 67 [16%]); (5) hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (15 [4%] vs 14 [3%]); (6) hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (62 [15%] vs 79 [19%]); (7) death (21 [5%] vs 24 [6%]). The difference between treatment groups was not significant (odds ratio 0·98 [95% CI 0·77–1·25]; p=0·85). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups (remdesivir, 135 [33%] of 406 vs control, 130 [31%] of 418; p=0·48). Three deaths (acute respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial infection, and hepatorenal syndrome) were considered related to remdesivir by the investigators, but only one by the sponsor's safety team (hepatorenal syndrome). INTERPRETATION: No clinical benefit was observed from the use of remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support.

594233,Pharmacological Treatment of Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review,2021-07-05,"PURPOSE: Cancer patients undergoing active anti-cancer treatment experience multiple symptoms concurrently. Over the years, studies to improve patients’ physical and psychological discomfort by focusing on patients’ needs and preferences have reported promising outcomes. This study aims to explore perceived patient-centered care and its association to symptoms experienced by cancer patients undergoing active anti-cancer treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at an outpatient cancer center between August 2018 and July 2019 among adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and biological therapy. Participants were asked by their oncology nurse to complete a self-administered questionnaire which included the three subscales (physical, psychological, and global distress) of the Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale as well as the perceived patient-centered care questionnaire. To examine the association between participants’ perceived patient-centered care and each of the symptoms scale scores, three hierarchical (block-wise) linear regression models were performed. RESULTS: Of the 125 participants, 57 (45.6%) were diagnosed with breast cancer and were treated with chemotherapy either alone (n = 62, 49.6%), with radiotherapy (n = 4, 3.2%), or with biological therapy (n = 45, 36.0%). Hierarchical regression models found that perceived patient-centered care contributed to 11.3%, β = − .351 (p < 0.001); 8.9%, β = − .311 (p < 0.001); and 10.3% β = −.336 (p < 0.001) of the variance of the global distress index, physical symptoms, and psychological symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of perceived patient-centered care in alleviating physical and psychological symptoms and overall distress in cancer patients undergoing active anti-cancer therapy. Our findings call for oncology teams to adopt and implement patient-centered care as part of their routine work.","Tsvitman, Inna; Castel, Orit Cohen; Dagan, Efrat",Support Care Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06200-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855611/,146
594934,Environmental and Psychosocial Interventions in Age-Friendly Communities and Active Ageing: A Systematic Review,2020-11-10,"Objective: To measure the mental health effects (perceived stress, anxiety, and depression) among health care workers and medical students in Lebanon during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent to the Beirut blast.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered online questionnaire was developed and distributed between late December 2020 and early February 2021 among health care workers and medical students via social media. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) were administered. P values between variables were calculated using &#967;2 test.Results: Overall, 98% of the respondents had a low PSS-10 score and 89% had a low PHQ-4 score. About 58.1% of health care workers and 69.0% of student respondents had moderate to severe stress on the PSS-10, and 48.7% and 46.8%, respectively, reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression on the PHQ-4. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was relatively higher among health care workers with monthly incomes < LBP 4 million (57.1%) and higher in women (39.9%) compared to men (17.2%). Furthermore, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among health care workers traveling between different districts (63.0%) compared to those with residence and work location within the same district and was higher among females (65.4%) compared to males (34.6%).Conclusions: The resilience of the Lebanese people as well as their ability to adapt in the face of trauma, tragedy, threats, or any significant source of stress is remarkable and seen in their everyday lives, especially subsequent to the Beirut blast. However, the psychological well-being and mental health of health care workers and medical students in Lebanon should be carefully surveilled and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially within the ongoing socioeconomic crisis.","Abed, Ahed El; Razzak, Rawane Abdul; Hashim, Hashim Talib",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

596392,Measurement and determinants of financial protection in health in Afghanistan,2021-07-04,"COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a pattern of consecutive declines and regrowth in European countries in 2020. After being partially regressed during the summer, the reappearance of the infection during fall 2020 in many temperate countries strongly suggests that temperature and cold may play a role in influencing the infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. While promoting medicine as an art, Hippocrates interpreted with logical reasoning the occurrence of diseases such as epidemics, as a consequence of environmental factors, in particular climatic variations. During the Renaissance, Sanctorius was one of the first to perform quantitative measurements, and Harvey discovered the circulation of blood by performing experimental procedures in animals. We think that a reasoning mixing various observations, measurements and experiments is fundamental to understand how cold increases infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. By this review, we provide evidence linking cold, angiotensin-II, vasoconstriction, hypoxia and aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to explain how cold affects the epidemiology of COVID-19. Also, a low humidity increases virus transmissibility, while a warm atmosphere, a moderate airway humidity, and the production of vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 by ACE2 are less favorable to the virus entry and/or its development. The meteorological and environmental parameters impacting COVID-19 pandemic should be reintegrated into a whole perspective by taking into account the different factors influencing transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To understand the modern enigma represented by COVID-19, an interdisciplinary approach is surely essential.","Icard, Philippe; Simula, Luca; Rei, Joana; Fournel, Ludovic; De Pauw, Vincent; Alifano, Marco",Biochimie,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908421002212; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2021.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555456/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908421002212,146

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of electronic media in families, including in adolescents, has been increasing. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at describing the association between electronic media use and sleep disturbances in adolescents in Palembang. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in January to February 2021. Participants were 14–17-year-old high school students who completed a questionnaire to assess electronic media use and a Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire to assess sleep disturbances. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven participants enrolled in this study. The majority of the participants were 16 years old or older (56.7%) and used smartphones (93%) with a median of media use of 10 hours a day. None of the participants' characteristic variables showed statistically significant correlations. Similarly, none of the electronic media use variables showed statistically significant correlations. CONCLUSION: Most of adolescents in this study have used electronic media for more than 6 years, with median use of 10 hours per day, for noneducative purposes. Despite findings that most of them experience sleep disturbances, there was no statistically significant association between electronic media use and sleep disturbances in adolescents.","Argiansya, Fandi; Soedjadhi, Rismarini; Indra, Raden Muhammad; Kesuma, Yudianita",Sleep Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34457364/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/2096944,146

A Cross-Sectional Survey,2020-07-20,"CONTEXTE: Les interventions non pharmacologiques demeurent le principal moyen de maîtriser le coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) d’ici à ce que la couverture vaccinale soit suffisante pour donner lieu à une immunité collective. Nous avons utilisé des données de mobilité anonymisées de téléphones intelligents afin de quantifier le niveau de mobilité requis pour maîtriser le SRAS-CoV-2 (c.-à-d., seuil de mobilité), et la différence par rapport au niveau de mobilité observé (c.-à-d., écart de mobilité). MÉTHODES: Nous avons procédé à une analyse de séries chronologiques sur l’incidence hebdomadaire du SRAS-CoV-2 au Canada entre le 15 mars 2020 et le 6 mars 2021. Le paramètre mesuré était le taux de croissance hebdomadaire, défini comme le rapport entre les cas d’une semaine donnée et ceux de la semaine précédente. Nous avons mesuré les effets du temps moyen passé hors domicile au cours des 3 semaines précédentes à l’aide d’un modèle de régression log-normal, en tenant compte de la province, de la semaine et de la température moyenne. Nous avons calculé le seuil de mobilité et l’écart de mobilité pour le SRAS-CoV-2. RÉSULTATS: Au cours des 51 semaines de l’étude, en tout, 888 751 personnes ont contracté le SRAS-CoV-2. Chaque augmentation de 10 % de l’écart de mobilité a été associée à une augmentation de 25 % du taux de croissance des cas hebdomadaires de SRAS-CoV-2 (rapport 1,25, intervalle de confiance à 95 % 1,20–1,29). Comparativement à la mobilité prépandémique de référence de 100 %, le seuil de mobilité a été plus élevé au cours de l’été (69 %, écart interquartile [EI] 67 %–70 %), et a chuté à 54 % pendant l’hiver 2021 (EI 52 %–55 %); un écart de mobilité a été observé au Canada entre juillet 2020 et la dernière semaine de décembre 2020. INTERPRÉTATION: La mobilité permet de prédire avec fiabilité et constance la croissance des cas hebdomadaires et il faut maintenir des niveaux faibles de mobilité pour maîtriser le SRAS-CoV-2 jusqu’à la fin du printemps 2021. Les données de mobilité anonymisées des téléphones intelligents peuvent servir à guider le relâchement ou le resserrement des mesures de distanciation physique provinciales et régionales.","Brown, Kevin A.; Soucy, Jean-Paul R.; Buchan, Sarah A.; Sturrock, Shelby L.; Berry, Isha; Stall, Nathan M.; Jüni, Peter; Ghasemi, Amir; Gibb, Nicholas; MacFadden, Derek R.; Daneman, Nick",CMAJ,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.210132-f,146

Before 2015, the national health information system was fragmented, underfunded, of limited utility and accessed infrequently by health authorities. We built an electronic system that integrated mobile technologies and geographic information system data sets of every house, village and health facility in the country. We piloted the system in 184 health facilities across five provinces between 2015 and 2016. By the end of 2020, the system’s mobile tablets were rolled out to 473 facilities in 13 provinces, while the online platform was available in health authorities of all 22 provinces, including church health services. Fractured data siloes of legacy health programmes have been integrated and a platform for civil registration systems established. We discuss how mobile technologies and geographic information systems have transformed health information systems in Papua New Guinea over the past 6 years by increasing the timeliness, completeness, quality, accessibility, flexibility, acceptability and utility of national health data. To achieve this transformation, we highlight the importance of considering the benefits of mobile tools and using rich geographic information systems data sets for health workers in primary care in addition to the needs of public health authorities.","Rosewell, Alexander; Shearman, Phil; Ramamurthy, Sundar; Akers, Rob",Bull World Health Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958826/; https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.267823,146

Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety.

From March 2020, hospitals in the UK saw a dramatic reduction in patients with cancer presenting due to multifactorial reasons. The impact of the pandemic on patients with cancer in the South East London Cancer Alliance was studied. The specific aims were (1) to examine the reduction in cancer diagnoses during the first wave of the pandemic and (2) to examine the stage of diagnosis of patients with cancer presenting during the pandemic compared with that of patients presenting before the pandemic. There was an 18.2% reduction in new cancer diagnoses (an estimate of 987 cancers), when compared with 2019. This fall in cancer diagnoses was most marked in patients with prostate (51.4%), gynaecological (29.7%), breast (29.5%) and lung (23.4%) cancers. There was an overall 3.9% increase in advanced stage presentation (Stages 3 and 4), with an overall 6.8% increase in Stage 4 cancers during this period. The greatest shifts were seen in lung (increase of 6.3%, with an 11.2% increase in Stage 4 cancer alone) and colorectal (5.4%) cancers. For prostate cancer, there was an increase in 3.8% in those presenting with Stage 4 disease. For breast cancer, there was an 8% reduction in patients diagnosed with Stage 1 cancer with commensurate increases in the proportion of those with Stage 2 disease. The experiences in cancer are a salient warning that pandemic control measures and policy need to balance all health and welfare. Alternative strategies need to be adopted during further waves of the current and any future pandemic to ensure that patients with cancer are prioritised for diagnosis and treatment to prevent late-stage presentation and an increase in avoidable deaths.","Purushotham, Arnie; Roberts, Graham; Haire, Kate; Dodkins, Joanna; Harvey-Jones, Elizabeth; Han, Lu; Rigg, Anne; Twinn, Claire; Pramesh, Conjeevaram; Ranganathan, Priya; Sullivan, Richard; Aggarwal, Ajay",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777173/,146

Therefore, a sense of alarm over infection because of droplets that may be released during digestive endoscopy examination is increasing. This study aimed to investigate the droplets released during digestive endoscopy using a high-speed camera. METHODS: We utilized a high-speed camera (FASTCAM SA-3, Photron Limited) capable of recording small, transparent droplets with a black background and high-brightness lighting. The obtained video files were analyzed using post-processing software. We divided the 20 models into the control (a spray bottle model and a cough model) and experimental groups (digestive endoscopy models). The sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy and the amount of gas injected were modulated to change the level of released droplets. RESULTS: For the control groups, droplets were clearly observed using a high-speed camera. However, no droplet larger than 10 µm in size was observed in the experimental groups. Furthermore, the changes in the sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy, and amount of gas injected did not affect droplet formation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on high-speed camera photography, the risk of droplet generation during digestive endoscopy was not higher than that during violent expiratory events, such as coughing and sneezing.

We sought a common denominator in lung transplant recipients, analyzing risk factors that trigger immune responses that lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. METHODS: We collected blood from patients who underwent lung transplant at our institution. Exosomes were isolated from the sera of recipients with risk factors for chronic rejection and from stable recipients. Exosomes were analyzed with western blot, using antibodies to lung self-antigens K alpha 1 tubulin and collagen-V, costimulatory molecules (costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), and 20S proteasome. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients included, we identified 5 with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, 5 without, 15 with respiratory viral infection, 10 with acute rejection, 10 with donor-specific antibodies (DSA), 5 without DSA, and 10 who were stable for exosome isolation. Recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and DSA had exosomes containing self-antigens; exosomes from stable recipients did not. Exosomes from recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and DSA also demonstrated costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factor, and 20S proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: Transplanted lungs with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, symptomatic respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and immune responses induce exosomes that contain self-antigens, costimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factors, and 20S proteasome. Release of circulating exosomes post-transplant from the aforementioned stress-inducing insults augment immunity and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.","Mohanakumar, Thalachallour; Sharma, Monal; Bansal, Sandhya; Ravichandran, Ranjithkumar; Smith, Michael A.; Bremner, Ross M.",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288367/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522319303435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.12.105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522319303435,146

Neutropenia is a relatively uncommon finding, especially in asymptomatic patients with no other evidence of systemic infection. A young, healthy male undergoing training for the Navy was admitted with rhabdomyolysis following intense physical activity. He was incidentally noted to have severe neutropenia with the white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.1 × 10(9)/L and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 355 cells/μL one month following prior asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Further evaluation was negative for other infectious processes, nutritional deficiency, or underlying malignancy. Given young age without comorbidities and lack of febrile illness, watchful waiting was recommended in lieu of bone marrow biopsy which resulted in spontaneous resolution of neutropenia and normalization of WBC. The authors argue that although most hematologic complications of COVID-19 are reported in symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients also appear to have a risk of developing hematologic complications including bone marrow suppression. Watchful waiting may be an appropriate diagnostic approach in such young, healthy individuals.","Desai, Shreya; Quraishi, Javairia; Citrin, Dennis",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290941/,146

Multiple clinical studies are investigating griffithsin's utility as topical HIV microbicide. HIV microbicides are an extremely cost-sensitive market and plant-based griffithsin protein expression has the potential to meet those demands. The griffithsin product used in the clinic has been expressed and purified in N. benthamiana, using a TMV-based viral vector system, Geneware®. Outdoor pharming of biopharmaceuticals would further alleviate startup costs for biotechnology firms and may allow broader product accessibility. Therefore, this study assessed expression in a hybrid tobacco line, N. excelsiana, that is susceptible to TMV-based viral vectors and can be grown outdoors. In addition to using this hybrid line we expand on methods for in planta storage of griffithsin in leafy plants by ensiling kilogram quantities of griffithsin. The ensiling process allows year-round biomanufacturing, minimal environmental-controlled storage, and reduces the industry need for multiple growth areas to maintain multi-product manufacturing of plant-based pharmaceuticals. This study shows that griffithsin can be expressed in N. excelsiana and is stable, recoverable, and active from ensiled tissue. These studies can pave the way for future plant-based pharmaceuticals to be expressed and stored in this manner.","Eapen, Paul; Cates, Jennifer; Mundell, Rich; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Fuqua, Joshua L.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32258012/,146

Methods: an online survey of patients in quarantine. Questions targeted the conditions of quarantine, sleep related behaviours and exposure to factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (light exposure and sport). Results: 1 777 participants were included: 77% women and 72 % aged 25-54 years. Quarantine conditions were most frequently in couples with children (36 %) and in a house with a garden (51 %). 47 % of participants reported a decrease in sleep quality during quarantine. Factors associated with a reduction in sleep quality by logistic regression were sleep reduction (OR 15.52 p<0.001), going to bed later (OR 1.72 p<0.001), getting up earlier (2.18 p=0.01), an increase in sleep-wake irregularity (OR 2.29 p<0.001), reduced exposure to daylight (OR 1.46 p=0.01) and increased screen use in the evenings (OR 1.33 p=0.04). Conclusion: Sleep quality tended to reduce during quarantine and this was associated with changes in sleep behaviours and light exposure, especially in the evening. In order to optimise sleep during quarantine, regular sleep and wake times, at least 1 hour exposure to daylight and a reduction of screen use in the evenings are suggested.","Hartley, Sarah; Francs, Claire Colas des; Aussert, Frédérique; Martinot, Céline; Dagneaux, Sylvain; Londe, Violaine; Waldron, Lucy; Royant-Parola, Sylvie",Encephale,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300889; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300889?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475692/,146
630221,Validation of the Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre database: a comprehensive database containing records of all inter-facility patient transfers in the province of Ontario,2006-10-06,"Gaze behavior is an important social signal between humans as it communicates locations of interest. People typically orient their attention to where others look as this informs about others' intentions and future actions. Studies have shown that humans can engage in similar gaze behavior with robots but presumably more so when they adopt the intentional stance toward them (i.e., believing robot behaviors are intentional). In laboratory settings, the phenomenon of attending toward the direction of others' gaze has been examined with the use of the gaze-cueing paradigm. While the gaze-cueing paradigm has been successful in investigating the relationship between adopting the intentional stance toward robots and attention orienting to gaze cues, it is unclear if the repetitiveness of the gaze-cueing paradigm influences adopting the intentional stance. Here, we examined if the duration of exposure to repetitive robot gaze behavior in a gaze-cueing task has a negative impact on subjective attribution of intentionality. Participants performed a short, medium, or long face-to-face gaze-cueing paradigm with an embodied robot while subjective ratings were collected pre and post the interaction. Results show that participants in the long exposure condition had the smallest change in their intention attribution scores, if any, while those in the short exposure condition had a positive change in their intention attribution, indicating that participants attributed more intention to the robot after short interactions. The results also show that attention orienting to robot gaze-cues was positively related to how much intention was attributed to the robot, but this relationship became more negative as the length of exposure increased. In contrast to subjective ratings, the gaze-cueing effects (GCEs) increased as a function of the duration of exposure to repetitive behavior. The data suggest a tradeoff between the desired number of trials needed for observing various mechanisms of social cognition, such as GCEs, and the likelihood of adopting the intentional stance toward a robot.","Abubshait, Abdulaziz; Wykowska, Agnieszka",Front Robot AI,https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2020.565825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501328/,146

Aim of this study is to evaluate mid-term clinical impact of COVID-19 on respiratory function. METHODS: 379 patients were evaluated 4 months after SARS-COV-2 diagnosis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the presence of pneumonia during COVID. Clinical conditions, quality of life, symptomatology, 6-min walking test, pulmonary function test with spirometry and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide were analysed. Data were compared to clinical evolution during COVID (development of acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], needing of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], partial oxygen saturation/ fraction of inspired oxygen [SpO(2)/FiO(2)] ratio and pneumonia severity index [PSI]). RESULTS: After a median of 135 days, 260 (68.6%) of 379 patients referred almost one symptom. Patients who developed pneumonia during COVID-19 showed lower SpO(2) at rest (p<0.001), SpO(2) during 6-min walking test (p<0.001), total lung capacity (p<0.001), airway occlusion pressure after 0.1 s [P0.1] (p=0.02), P0.1/maximal inspiratory pressure [MIP] ratio (p=0.005) and higher Borg category-ratio scale (p=0.006) and modified Medical Research Council breathlessness scale (p=0.003), compared to patients without pneumonia. SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and PSI during SARS-COV-2 pneumonia were directly associated with mid-term alteration of partial oxygen saturation at rest (p<0.001), SpO(2) during 6-min walking test (p<0.001), residual volume (p<0.001), total lung capacity (respectively p<0.001 and p=0.003) and forced vital capacity (respectively p=0.004, p=0.03).

Studying an observational homogenous, geographically isolated population of individuals seeking eye care may identify unique clinical, demographic, environmental and genetic risk factors for blinding eye disease that can inform targeted and effective screening strategies to achieve better and improved health care distribution. This study served to: (a) identify the ocular health needs within this population; and (b) identify any possible modifiable risk factors contributing to disease pathophysiology within this population. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 126 participants. Each participant completed a comprehensive eye examination, provided a blood sample for genetic analysis, and received a structured core baseline interview for a standardized epidemiological questionnaire at the Salama Lions Club Eye Hospital in Salama, Guatemala. Interpreters were available for translation to the patients’ native dialect, to assist participants during their visit. We performed a genome-wide association study for ocular disease association on the blood samples using Illumina’s HumanOmni2.5-8 chip to examine single nucleotide polymorphism SNPs in this population. After implementing quality control measures, we performed adjusted logistic regression analysis to determine which genetic and epidemiological factors were associated with eye disease. We found that the most prevalent eye conditions were cataracts (54.8%) followed by pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) (24.6%). The population with both conditions was 22.2%. In our epidemiological analysis, we found that eye disease was significantly associated with advanced age. Cataracts were significantly more common among those living in the 10 districts with the least resources. Furthermore, having cataracts was associated with a greater likelihood of PXF after adjusting for both age and sex. In our genetic analysis, the SNP most nominally significantly associated with PXF lay within the gene KSR2 (p < 1 × 10(−5)). Several SNPs were associated with cataracts at genome-wide significance after adjusting for covariates (p < 5 × 10(−8)). About seventy five percent of the 33 cataract-associated SNPs lie within 13 genes, with the majority of genes having only one significant SNP (5 × 10(−8)). Using bioinformatic tools including PhenGenI, the Ensembl genome browser and literature review, these SNPs and genes have not previously been associated with PXF or cataracts, separately or in combination. This study can aid in understanding the prevalence of eye conditions in this population to better help inform public health planning and the delivery of quality, accessible, and relevant health and preventative care within Salama, Guatemala.","Hicks, Patrice M.; Au, Elizabeth; Self, William; Haaland, Benjamin; Feehan, Michael; Owen, Leah A.; Siedlecki, Adam; Nuttall, Elizabeth; Harrison, Deborah; Reynolds, Andrew L.; Lillvis, John H.; Sieminski, Sandra; Shulman, Julia P.; Barnoya, Margarita; Noguera Prera, Juan Jose; Gonzalez, Orlando; Murtaugh, Maureen A.; Williams, Lloyd B.; Farkas, Michael H.; Crandall, Alan S.; DeAngelis, Margaret M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299682/,146

To address this need, we have evaluated the expression and purification of two previously reported S protein constructs in Expi293F and ExpiCHO-S cells, two different cell lines selected for increased protein expression. We show that ExpiCHO-S cells produce enhanced yields of both SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Biochemical, biophysical, and structural (cryo-EM) characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in both cell lines demonstrate that the reported purification strategy yields high-quality S protein (nonaggregated, uniform material with appropriate biochemical and biophysical properties), and analysis of 20 deposited S protein cryo-EM structures reveals conformation plasticity in the region composed of amino acids 614–642 and 828–854. Importantly, we show that multiple preparations of these two recombinant S proteins from either cell line exhibit identical behavior in two different serology assays. We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human secretome and report no novel binding partners and notably fail to validate the Spike:CD147 interaction. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs and in a flexible protein microarray format. Collectively, we establish an array of metrics for ensuring the production of high-quality S protein to support clinical, biological, biochemical, structural, and mechanistic studies to combat the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Herrera, Natalia G.; Morano, Nicholas C.; Celikgil, Alev; Georgiev, George I.; Malonis, Ryan J.; Lee, James H.; Tong, Karen; Vergnolle, Olivia; Massimi, Aldo B.; Yen, Laura Y.; Noble, Alex J.; Kopylov, Mykhailo; Bonanno, Jeffrey B.; Garrett-Thomson, Sarah C.; Hayes, David B.; Bortz, Robert H.; Wirchnianski, Ariel S.; Florez, Catalina; Laudermilch, Ethan; Haslwanter, Denise; Fels, J.

In addition, a multitude of both novel and repurposed therapeutic agents were used empirically and studied within clinical trials. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The majority of trialed agents have failed to provide reproducible, definitive proof of efficacy in reducing the mortality of COVID-19 with the exception of corticosteroids in moderate to severe disease. Recently, evidence has emerged that the oral antiparasitic agent ivermectin exhibits numerous antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanisms with trial results reporting significant outcome benefits. Given some have not passed peer review, several expert groups including Unitaid/World Health Organization have undertaken a systematic global effort to contact all active trial investigators to rapidly gather the data needed to grade and perform meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Data were sourced from published peer-reviewed studies, manuscripts posted to preprint servers, expert meta-analyses, and numerous epidemiological analyses of regions with ivermectin distribution campaigns. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: A large majority of randomized and observational controlled trials of ivermectin are reporting repeated, large magnitude improvements in clinical outcomes. Numerous prophylaxis trials demonstrate that regular ivermectin use leads to large reductions in transmission. Multiple, large “natural experiments” occurred in regions that initiated “ivermectin distribution” campaigns followed by tight, reproducible, temporally associated decreases in case counts and case fatality rates compared with nearby regions without such campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified.","Kory, Pierre; Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto; Varon, Joseph; Iglesias, Jose; Marik, Paul E.",Am J Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375047/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0000000000001377,146

We aimed to assess the construct validity of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale among adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19. METHODS: Adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19, who were members of an online panel and two Facebook groups for subjects with COVID-19 with persistent symptoms, completed an online survey after the onset of infection-related symptoms. The number and intensity of symptoms were evaluated with the Utrecht Symptom Diary, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) with the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire, impairment in work and activities with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire and functional status with the PCFS Scale. RESULTS: 1939 subjects were included in the analyses (85% women, 95% non-hospitalized during infection) about 3 months after the onset of infection-related symptoms. Subjects classified as experiencing ‘slight’, ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’ functional limitations presented a gradual increase in the number/intensity of symptoms, reduction of HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities. No differences were found regarding the number and intensity of symptoms, HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities between subjects classified as experiencing ‘negligible’ and ‘no’ functional limitations. We found weak-to-strong statistical associations between functional status and all domains of HrQoL (r: 0.233–0.661). Notably, the strongest association found was with the ‘usual activities’ domain of the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire.

It has also been associated with acute liver failure. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical ICU. PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients critically ill with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive review of critically ill hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients admitted to a tertiary-care medical ICU from January 2012 to December 2018. Most patients presented with constitutional symptoms and elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia were common upon hospital admission. ICU admission laboratory and clinical variables were used to calculate Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, hemophagocytic syndrome diagnostic score, and model for end-stage liver disease. Mean age of the cohort was 48.1 years, and 45% were male. The mortality rate was 65% at 28 days and 77% at 1 year. About 28-day survivors were younger, had lower mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (16.5 vs 23.0; p = 0.004), and higher mean hemophagocytic syndrome diagnostic score (249.1 vs 226.0; p = 0.032) compared with nonsurvivors. Survivors were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, or vasopressor support and were more likely to receive chemotherapy for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In this ICU cohort, 29% were diagnosed with acute liver failure, of whom only 22% developed acute liver failure early during their hospital stay. Acute liver failure was associated with a higher model for end-stage liver disease score upon hospital admission. Available histology in those that developed acute liver failure showed massive hepatic necrosis, or histiocytic or lymphocytic infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to the ICU with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis have a high mortality. Those who survived had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores, had higher hemophagocytic syndrome diagnostic scores, are more likely to receive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis specific chemotherapy, and are less likely to have organ failure. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can be associated with acute liver failure especially when model for end-stage liver disease score is elevated upon admission.","Al Nasrallah, Nawar; Al-Hader, Ahmad; Samala, Niharika; Sears, Catherine R.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458685/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000318,146

Several tools and protocols have been shared since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they need to be timely adapted to cope with SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus genetic material has been widely used, it still presents practical difficulties such as high cost, shortage of available reagents in the global market, need of a specialized laboratorial infrastructure and well-trained staff. These limitations result in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance blackouts across several countries. Here we propose a rapid and accessible protocol based on Sanger sequencing of a single PCR fragment that is able to identify and discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) identified so far, according to each characteristic mutational profile at the Spike-RBD region (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, A570D). Twelve COVID-19 samples from Brazilian patients were evaluated for both WGS and Sanger sequencing: three P.2, two P.1, six B.1.1 and one B.1.1.117 lineage. All results from the Sanger sequencing method perfectly matched the mutational profile of VOCs and non-VOCs RBD's characterized by WGS. In summary, this approach allows a much broader network of laboratories to perform molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and report results within a shorter time frame, which is of utmost importance in the context of rapid public health decisions in a fast evolving worldwide pandemic.","Bezerra, Matheus Filgueira; Machado, Lais Ceschini; De Carvalho, Viviane do Carmo Vasconcelos; Docena, Cássia; Brandão-Filho, Sinval Pinto; Ayres, Constância Flávia Junqueira; Paiva, Marcelo Henrique Santos; Wallau, Gabriel Luz",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821002070?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975021/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821002070,146

Abstract Objectives We have to become aware of the current development of international travels which has contributed to amplify circulation of all sorts of infectious agents. We will describe the current situation. Observations Infectious agents are carried by means of travellers, immigrants, as well as by animals, goods and merchandise.

In Common Sport Study,2021-03-21,"Dried blood spot samples (DBS) provide an alternative sample type to venous blood samples for antibody testing. DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain. The study aimed to compare antibody detection in DBS eluates using the Roche Elecsys ® immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test). The study was in one Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England; it comprised of 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using an experimental cut-off, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance. Alternatives, including the collection of capillary blood samples, should be considered for screening programs.","Mulchandani, Ranya; Brown, Ben; Brooks, Tim; Semper, Amanda; Machin, Nicholas; Linley, Ezra; Borrow, Ray; Wyllie, David",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588354/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104739; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221000068?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221000068,146

649011,Real-Time Communication: Creating a Path to COVID-19 Public Health Activism in Adolescents Using Social Media,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: The SARS outbreak of 2002–2003 presented clinicians with a new, life-threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options. The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria. In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture. In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm. Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive. In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful. Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.","Stockman, Lauren J; Bellamy, Richard; Garner, Paul",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968120/,146
649381,Alcohol Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of US Adults,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND: Reducing suicidal behaviour (SB) is a critical public health issue globally. The complex interplay of social determinants, service system factors, population demographics, and behavioural dynamics makes it extraordinarily difficult for decision makers to determine the nature and balance of investments required to have the greatest impacts on SB. Real-world experimentation to establish the optimal targeting, timing, scale, frequency, and intensity of investments required across the determinants is unfeasible. Therefore, this study harnesses systems modelling and simulation to guide population-level decision making that represent best strategic allocation of limited resources. METHODS: Using a participatory approach, and informed by a range of national, state, and local datasets, a system dynamics model was developed, tested, and validated for a regional population catchment. The model incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and SB. Intervention scenarios were investigated to forecast their impact on SB over a 20-year period. RESULTS: A combination of social connectedness programs, technology-enabled coordinated care, post-attempt assertive aftercare, reductions in childhood adversity, and increasing youth employment projected the greatest impacts on SB, particularly in a youth population, reducing self-harm hospitalisations (suicide attempts) by 28.5% (95% interval 26.3–30.8%) and suicide deaths by 29.3% (95% interval 27.1–31.5%). Introducing additional interventions beyond the best performing suite of interventions produced only marginal improvement in population level impacts, highlighting that ‘more is not necessarily better.’ CONCLUSION: Results indicate that targeted investments in addressing the social determinants and in mental health services provides the best opportunity to reduce SB and suicide. Systems modelling and simulation offers a robust approach to leveraging best available research, data, and expert knowledge in a way that helps decision makers respond to the unique characteristics and drivers of SB in their catchments and more effectively focus limited health resources.

A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptual framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking and was based on a creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organization (which includes expertise and the administrative program), and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which can be viewed as a process. The population health surveillance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) surveillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit. CONCLUSIONS: The population health surveillance theory provides a systematic way of understanding, organizing and evaluating the population health surveillance process.","El Allaki, Farouk; Bigras-Poulin, Michel; Michel, Pascal; Ravel, André",Epidemiol Health,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih/e2012007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251837/,146
652690,Neighborhood-Level Influences and Adolescent Health Risk Behaviors in Rural and Urban Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review,2021-07-18,"The systematic removal of death from social life in the West has exposed people living in areas affected by COVID-19 to the risk of being unable to adequately manage the anxiety caused by mortality salience. Death education is a type of intervention that helps people manage their fear of death by offering them effective strategies to deal with loss and anxiety. To that end, a path of death education has been carried out with University students of psychology. The main purpose of the research is to understand how students who participated in the death education course perceive the lockdown experience in light of course teachings. The research was carried out at a University in northern Italy in an area severely affected by COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic. The group of participants included 38 students, 30 women and 8 men, with an average age of 25.45 years (SD = 7). At the end of the course, the students could respond on an optional basis to the request to comment on the training experience according to what they experienced during the pandemic. A thematic analysis was subsequently carried out on the texts, which made it possible to identify the most relevant thematic areas for the students. The qualitative analyses permitted recognition of three main forms of discovery: the removal of death in contemporary culture; the importance of community, ritual and funeral, and spirituality; and the significance of death education for future health professionals. The texts have highlighted how the removal of these issues exposes people to the risk of being unable to handle extremely painful events such as those related to dying. The results show the positivity of death education pathways conducted at the University level to help students reflect on these issues and manage the related anguish.","Testoni, Ines; Iacona, Erika; Corso, Cecilia; Pompele, Sara; Dal Corso, Laura; Orkibi, Hod; Wieser, Michael Alexander",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937167/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.625756,146

Here we use a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its pharmacokinetics. When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials. Notably, the highest dose of favipiravir tested is associated with signs of toxicity in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.","Driouich, Jean-Sélim; Cochin, Maxime; Lingas, Guillaume; Moureau, Grégory; Touret, Franck; Petit, Paul-Rémi; Piorkowski, Géraldine; Barthélémy, Karine; Laprie, Caroline; Coutard, Bruno; Guedj, Jérémie; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Solas, Caroline; Nougairède, Antoine",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741945/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21992-w,146
655522,A 20-Year Follow-Up Study of Objectively Measured Physical Activity,2021-03-17,"Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models has been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.","Dattilo, Wesley; Silva, Alcides Castro e; Guevara, Roger; MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Ribeiro, Servio Pontes",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061192,146

DESIGN: A prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Postcoronavirus disease 2019 clinics of three hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 to the ICU, who visited the postcoronavirus disease 2019 follow-up clinic. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcomes were psychologic distress and overall and mental health-related quality of life, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short-Form 36, and European Quality of Life 5D, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post hospital discharge. Second, we compared 3-month psychologic and mental health-related quality of life outcomes with a historical critical illness survivor cohort and overall and mental health-related quality of life with the Dutch population. We included 118 patients with a median age of 61 years (95% range, 36–77 yr) of whom 79 (68%) were male. At 6 weeks, 13 patients (23%) reported psychologic distress, copresence of probable psychiatric disorders was common, and no decline in psychologic distress was observed throughout follow-up. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients tend to suffer less from posttraumatic stress disorder and reported less severe symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety Score: 3 [0–17] vs 5 [0–16]; estimated mean difference 2.3 [95% CI, 0.0–4.7]; p = 0.05) and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression Score: 3 [0–15] vs 5 [0–16]; estimated mean difference 2.4 [95% CI, 0.1–2.4]; p = 0.04) than the historical critical illness cohort. Overall and mental health-related quality of life increased over time. Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors reported better mental health-related quality of life than our historical cohort, but overall and mental health-related quality of life was still poorer than the Dutch population. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologic distress was common in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors and remained similar until 6 months after hospital discharge. Health-related quality of life increased over time and was higher than in a historical cohort, but was lower than in the Dutch population. Our findings highlight that coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors should be monitored after ICU treatment to detect possible psychologic distress.","Vlake, Johan H.; Van Bommel, Jasper; Hellemons, Merel E.; Wils, Evert-Jan; Bienvenu, O.

We therefore explored the association between age, respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma. METHODS: We investigated viruses in nasal secretions from 88 patients with acute exacerbation of childhood asthma by using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. We also measured peripheral eosinophil counts, and the serum levels of ECP and 27 types of cytokines/chemokines in 71 virus-induced acute asthma cases and 13 controls. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 71(80.7%) of the 88 samples. The three major viruses detected were rhinoviruses, RS viruses, and enteroviruses; enteroviruses were found to be dominant in patients aged ≥3 years. There was no change in the levels of rhinoviruses and RS viruses between the two age groups, defined as children aged <3 years and children aged ≥3 years. Serum concentrations of ECP, IL-5, and IP-10 were significantly elevated in virus-induced acute asthma cases compared with controls. Serum ECP values were significantly higher in patients with virus-induced asthma at age ≥3 years compared with those aged <3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients <3 years than in those ≥3 years. Serum ECP and IL-5 production correlated significantly with age, whereas serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age.

METHODS: We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support–free days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of −1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support–free days, or both. RESULTS: Both tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support–free days was 10 (interquartile range, −1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, −1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9% and of 99.5%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9%.

This literature review article accounted for the aforesaid drawbacks and attempted to assess the effect of drought on food insecurity in African countries. This article further sought to dissect the resilience and climate change adaptation strategies applied by African countries to mitigate the adverse effects of drought on food insecurity in rural livelihoods. The hermeneutic framework was adopted in this study, where the secondary data sources were searched from credible bibliographic and multidisciplinary databases and organizational websites. Thereafter, it was classified, mapped, and critically assessed using the qualitative data analysis software NVivo to generate patterns and themes. The NVivo program is a qualitative data analysis software package produced by QSR International and which helps qualitative researchers to organize, analyze, and find insights in qualitative data; for example, in journal articles where multilayered analysis on small or large volumes of data are required. This article has the potential to contribute in theory, concept, policy, and practice regarding best practices, resilience, and climate change adaptation strategies that can be harnessed by rural people. Furthermore, this article has the potential to shed light on the role played by traditional leadership and policy improvements in ensuring there is sufficient food during periods of drought.","Ngcamu, Bethuel Sibongiseni; Chari, Felix",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823825/,146

668034,Health Impact and Psychosocial Perceptions among French Medical Residents during the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Survey,2021-08-09,"INTRODUCTION: One of the serious consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the shortage of protective equipment for health personnel. N95 masks are considered one of the essential protective equipment in the management of patients with COVID-19. The shortage of N95 masks implies potential health risks for health personnel and significant economic losses for the health institution. The objective of this work was to investigate the disinfection of N95 masks artificially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria by using hydrogen peroxide plasma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the disinfection capacity of hydrogen peroxide plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 and two members of the ESKAPE bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus) through a study of artificial contamination in situ of N95 masks. Amplification of specific genes by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 and microbiological culture of ESKAPE bacteria was performed before and after the disinfection process. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all assays using five different concentrations of the virus, and A. baumannii and S. aureus were not cultivable with inoculums of 10(2) to 10(6) CFU after disinfection tests of N95 masks with hydrogen peroxide plasma. CONCLUSION: Disinfection of N95 masks by using the hydrogen peroxide plasma technology can be an alternative for their reuse in a shortage situation. Implications for the use of disinfection technologies of N95 masks and the safety of health personnel are discussed.","Ibáñez-Cervantes, Gabriela; Bravata-Alcántara, Juan Carlos; Nájera-Cortés, Alan Steve; Meneses-Cruz, Sergio; Delgado-Balbuena, Laura; Cruz-Cruz, Clemente; Durán-Manuel, Emilio Mariano; Cureño-Díaz, Monica Alethia; Gómez-Zamora, Erika; Chávez-Juárez, Sonia; Sosa-Hernández, Oscar; Aguilar-Rojas, Antonio; Bello-López, Juan Manuel",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320306398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320306398?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645473/,146

However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infection. To determine whether IL-6 inhibition is associated with an increased occurrence of secondary infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of patients during an 8-week span and compared the incidence of secondary infection in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. The study was approved by the IRB. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. The study was conducted in a cohorted COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary care university medical center. Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the adult COVID-19 intensive care unit with COVID-19 were randomly selected. We reviewed the occurrence and nature of secondary infections and clinical outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Measures were formulated prior to the study. For autopsy findings, we were interested in the lung pathology. 60 patients were selected of which 28 had received tocilizumab while 32 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (64.3% vs. 31.3%, p=0.010) and fungal (7.1% vs. 0%, p=0.096) infections. 7 cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases, tocilizumab had previously been given. All 3 patients demonstrated evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.","Kimmig, L. M.; Wu, D.; Gold, M.; Pettit, N.

Furthermore, we report a pre-clinical characterisation package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralisation capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralised four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability, strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections.","Ferrari, Mathieu; Mekkaoui, Leila; Ilca, F.

The symptoms associated with asthma were reported to be prevalent in children from the period of 1993 to 2013, in many low- and middle-income countries, due to changes in environmental conditions, such as domestic lifestyle, and urban and industrial developments. (1) Background: Several studies have also shown that children are prone to a severe type of asthma, because of their narrow respiratory airways and susceptibility to irritation from environmental agents. This study aimed to assess the association between environmental exposure and asthma among children in King Williams Town, South Africa. (2) Methodology: This study adopted a cross-sectional design method, with an estimated sample size of 262 participants. The eligible study participants were enrolled while attending Grey hospital in King Williams Town, for asthma management. Information will be collected from eligible, stable participants, on asthma treatment, through in-person interviewing in 2021. A semi-structured questionnaire will be administered to the participants. However, as a result of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, data may be abstracted from the asthma medical record of the eligible participants. Multivariate regression will be utilized, to describe the correlation between the variables, and the odds ratio will be calculated as well. (3) Discussion and conclusion: The study will objectively identify the local environmental agents that are associated with asthma among children in King Williams Town, in order to reprioritize treatment and preventative strategies.
