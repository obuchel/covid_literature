17459,Respiratory morbidity and mortality of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury at a level I trauma center in India,2021-05-13,"OBJECTIVES: Epitope-driven vaccines carrying highly conserved and immunodominant epitopes have emerged as promising approaches to overcome human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. METHODS: Two multiepitope DNA constructs encoding T cell epitopes from HIV-1 Gag, Pol, Env, Nef and Rev proteins alone and/or linked to the immunogenic epitopes derived from heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as an immunostimulatory agent were designed. In silico analyses were applied including MHC-I and MHC-II binding, MHC-I immunogenicity and antigen processing, population coverage, conservancy, allergenicity, toxicity and hemotoxicity. The peptide-MHC-I/MHC-II molecular docking and cytokine production analyses were carried out for predicted epitopes. The selected highly immunogenic T-cell epitopes were then used to design two multiepitope fusion constructs. Next, prediction of the physicochemical and structural properties, B cell epitopes, and constructs-toll-like receptors (TLRs) molecular docking were performed for each construct. Finally, the eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring totally 12 cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) and 10 helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes from HIV-1 proteins (i.e., pEGFP-N1-gag-pol-env-nef-rev), and linked to 2 CTL and 2 HTL epitopes from Hsp70 (i.e., pEGFP-N1-hsp70-gag-pol-env-nef-rev) were generated and transfected into HEK-293 T cells for evaluating the percentage of multiepitope peptides expression using flow cytometry and western blotting. RESULTS: The designed DNA constructs could be successfully expressed in mammalian cells. The expression rates of Gag-Pol-Env-Nef-Rev-GFP and Hsp70-Gag-Pol-Env-Nef-Rev-GFP were about 56–60% as the bands of ~ 63 and ~ 72 kDa confirmed in western blotting, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combined in silico/in vitro methods indicated two multiepitope constructs can be produced and used as probable effective immunogens for HIV-1 vaccine development.

46140,ISMP releases Top 10 list of medication errors and hazards in 2020,2021-02-27,"Viruses are some of the most abundant biological entities on Earth, and prokaryote virus are the dominant members of the viral community. Because of the diversity of prokaryote virus, functional annotation cannot be performed on a large number of genes from newly discovered prokaryote virus by searching the current database; therefore, the development of an alignment-free algorithm for functional annotation of prokaryote virus proteins is important to understand the viral community. The identification of prokaryote virus proteins (PVVPs) is a critical step for many viral analyses, such as species classification, phylogenetic analysis and the exploration of how prokaryote virus interact with their hosts. Although a series of PVVP prediction tools have been developed, the performance of these tools is still not satisfactory. Moreover, viral metagenomic data contains fragmented sequences, leading to the existence of some incomplete genes. Therefore, a tool that can identify partial prokaryote virus proteins is also needed. In this work, we present a novel algorithm, called VirionFinder, to identify the complete and partial PVVPs from non-prokaryote virus virion proteins (non-PVVPs). VirionFinder uses the sequence and biochemical properties of 20 amino acids as the mathematical model to encode the protein sequences and uses a deep learning technique to identify whether a given protein is a PVVP. Compared with the state-of-the-art tools using artificial benchmark datasets, the results show that under the same specificity (Sp), the sensitivity (Sn) of VirionFinder is approximately 10–34% much higher than the Sn of these tools on both complete and partial proteins. When evaluating related tools using real virome data, the recognition rate of PVVP-like sequences of VirionFinder is also much higher than that of the other tools. We expect that VirionFinder will be a powerful tool for identifying novel virion proteins from both complete prokaryote virus genomes and viral metagenomic data.

Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing problem because the quantity and the rate at which it is generated has increased exponentially in the last 5 years. The rapid changes or upgradation in technologies, IT requirements for working or learning from home during COVID-19, manufacturers releasing new electronic gadgets and devices that serves the consumers comfort and a declension in services has contributed to an increase in the e-waste or waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) generation rates. The current status of e-waste generation, handling procedures and regulatory directives in USA, EU, China, India, Vietnam and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are presented in this review. The recent developments in e-waste recycling methods/recovery of base and precious metals, the advantages and limitations of hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, biohydrometallurgy and pyrolysis are discussed. Considering the impediments in the present technologies, the extraction of valuable resources, i.e. precious metals, from e-waste using suitable biocatalysts shows promising applications.

Current treatments are palliative, and treatments improving lymphedema are lacking. Preclinical studies have suggested that adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) can alleviate lymphedema. We, therefore, aimed to assess whether ADRCs can alleviate lymphedema in clinical reality with long-term follow-up. We treated 10 patients with BCRL using ADRCs and a scar-releasing lipotransfer to the axillary region, and all patients were followed 1, 3, 6, 12, and 48 months after treatment. The primary endpoint was change in arm volume. Secondary endpoints were safety, change in lymphedema symptoms, quality of life, lymphedema-associated cellulitis, and conservative treatment use. There was no significant decrease in BCRL volume after treatment. However, self-reported upper extremity disability and arm heaviness and tension improved. Six patients reduced their use of conservative BCRL treatment. Five patients felt that their BCRL had improved substantially, and four of these would redo the treatment. We did not observe any cases of locoregional breast cancer recurrence. In this phase I study with 4 years of follow-up, axillary delivered ADRCs and lipotransfer were safe and feasible and improved BCRL symptoms and upper extremity function. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this study.","Jørgensen, Mads Gustaf; Toyserkani, Navid Mohamadpour; Jensen, Charlotte Harken; Andersen, Ditte Caroline; Sheikh, Søren Paludan; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",Stem cells translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594819/,689
62547,Single-port laparoscopic surgery: an overview.,2009,"The color of light is a fundamental property of electromagnetic radiation; as such, control of the frequency is a cornerstone of modern optics. Nonlinear materials are typically used to generate new frequencies, however the use of time-variant systems provides an alternative approach. Utilizing a metasurface that supports a high-quality factor resonance, we demonstrate that a rapidly shifting refractive index will induce frequency conversion of light that is confined in the nanoresonator meta-atoms. We experimentally observe this frequency conversion and develop a time-dependent coupled mode theory model that well describes the system. The intersection of high quality-factor resonances, active materials, and ultrafast transient spectroscopy leads to the demonstration of metasurfaces operating in a time-variant regime that enables enhanced control over light-matter interaction.","Karl, Nicholas; Vabishchevich, Polina P; Shcherbakov, Maxim R; Liu, Sheng; Sinclair, Michael B; Shvets, Gennady; Brener, Igal",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940476/,689
62983,Single-port transgastric access for repeated debridement of infected pancreatic necrotic tissue.,2010,"Tracheomalacia or tracheobronchomalacia (TM or TBM) is a common problem especially for elderly patients often unfit for surgical techniques. Several surgical or minimally invasive techniques have already been described. Stenting is one option but in general long-time stenting is accompanied by a high complication rate. Stent removal is more difficult in case of self-expandable nitinol stents or metallic stents in general in comparison to silicone stents. The main disadvantage of silicone stents in comparison to uncovered metallic stents is migration and plugging. We compared the operation time and in particular the duration of a sufficient Dumon stent fixation with different techniques in a patient with severe posttracheotomy TM and strongly reduced mobility of the vocal cords due to Parkinson's disease. The combined approach with simultaneous Dumon stenting and endoluminal transtracheal externalized suture under cone-beam computer tomography guidance with the Berci needle was by far the fastest approach compared to a (not performed) surgical intervention, or even purely endoluminal suturing through the rigid bronchoscope. The duration of the endoluminal transtracheal externalized suture was between 5 minutes and 9 minutes with the Berci needle; the pure endoluminal approach needed 51 minutes. The alternative of tracheobronchoplasty was refused by the patient. In general, 180 minutes for this surgical approach is calculated. The costs of the different approaches are supposed to vary widely due to the fact that in Germany 1 minute in an operation room costs on average approximately 50-60€ inclusive of taxes. In our own hospital (tertiary level), it is nearly 30€ per minute in an operation room for a surgical approach. Calculating an additional 15 minutes for patient preparation and transfer to wake-up room, therefore a total duration inside the investigation room of 30 minutes, the cost per flexible bronchoscopy is per minute on average less than 6€. Although the Dumon stenting requires a set-up with more expensive anesthesiology accompaniment, which takes longer than a flexible investigation estimated at 1 hour in an operation room, still without calculation of the costs of the materials and specialized staff that the surgical approach would consume at least 3,000€ more than a minimally invasive approach performed with the Berci needle. This difference is due to the longer time of the surgical intervention which is calculated at approximately 180 minutes in comparison to the achieved non-surgical approach of 60 minutes in the operation suite.","Hohenforst-Schmidt, Wolfgang; Linsmeier, Bernd; Zarogoulidis, Paul; Freitag, Lutz; Darwiche, Kaid; Browning, Robert; Turner, J Francis; Huang, Haidong; Li, Qiang; Vogl, Thomas; Zarogoulidis, Konstantinos; Brachmann, Johannes; Rittger, Harald",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,https://doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s83230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045666/,689

63786,Single-incision Laparoscopic Surgery for Appendiceal Mucoceles: Safety and Feasibility in a Series of 16 Consecutive Cases.,2011,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 remains a threat for a fear of a second pandemic. Emergency orthopaedic operations are still among the most commonly performed procedures with increased risk of transmission of SARS CoV-2 to the patients and the healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to present the evidence available into best practices limiting the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare setting during current and future pandemics. METHODS A review of the literature was performed in multiple databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control), using 'COVID-19' with other relevant keywords in different combinations. Owing to the limited and heterogenous evidence available, data were presented in a narrative manner. FINDINGS From the evidence gathered it was noted that a multimodal approach to minimising pathogen transmission is required. This primarily comprises the wider engineering and administrative controls to reduce the concentration of the pathogen and to separate staff and patients from it. Theatre isolation and traffic control bundling, theatre flow and logistics, ventilation and waste management form a pivotal role in the environmental/engineering controls. Administrative measures include policies for both patients and staff. For patients, isolation and preoperative screening are of utmost value. For staff, testing for COVID-19, risk assessment, redeployment and provision of persona; protective equipment, together with the necessary training are important administrative controls. CONCLUSION We believe these measures are likely to improve the sustainability of resources and can be carried to elective settings in order to return to some form of normality and help to mitigate the effects of future pandemics.","Khalefa, M A; Khadabadi, N A; Moores, T S; Hossain, F S",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559552/,689

The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of different forage species on plasma AA concentrations and protein synthesis. Research was conducted in July in St. Paul, MN, USA. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), mixed perennial cool-season grasses (CSGs), and teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) pastures were grazed by six horses randomly assigned to one of three forage types in a replicated Latin-square design. Horses had access to pasture each day. Jugular venous blood samples were collected from each horse before being turned out (0 hours) and then at 2 and 4 hours after turnout. Corresponding forage samples were taken by hand harvest and analyzed for AA concentrations. Equine muscle satellite cell cultures were treated with sera from grazing horses to assess de novo protein synthesis. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS. When evaluating forage, AA concentrations were generally lowest in teff and highest in CSG (P ≤ .05). Significant differences in threonine concentration in the plasma were observed; there was no effect on de novo protein synthesis of cultured equine myotubes treated with plasma obtained from the grazing horses (P ≥ .20). As a result, although there were significant differences in forage AA content, only plasma threonine concentration was different at 4 hours with no effect on protein synthesis of cultured equine satellite cells.","DeBoer, Michelle L; Martinson, Krishona L; Kuhle, Kerry J; Sheaffer, Craig C; Hathaway, Marcia R",Journal of equine veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.10.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929786/,689

STUDY DESIGN Animal study. METHODS A subperichondrial cartilaginous defect was created within the base of the pinna of 31 New Zealand white rabbits. Autologous costal cartilage grafts were electromechanically reshaped to resemble the rabbit auricular base framework and mechanically secured into the pinna base defect. Forty-nine costal cartilage specimens (four control and 45 experimental) successfully underwent EMR using a paired set of voltage-time combinations and survived for 6 or 12 weeks. Shape change was measured, and specimens were analyzed using digital imaging, tissue histology, and confocal microscopy with LIVE-DEAD viability assays. RESULTS Shape change was proportional to charge transfer in all experimental specimens (P < .01) and increased with voltage. All experimental specimens contoured to the auricular base. Focal cartilage degeneration and fibrosis was observed where needle electrodes were inserted, ranging from 2.2 to 3.9 mm. The response to injury increased with increasing charge transfer and survival duration. CONCLUSIONS EMR results in appropriate shape change in cartilage grafts with chondrocyte injury highly localized. These studies suggest that elements of auricular reconstruction may be feasible using EMR. Extended survival periods and further optimization of voltage-time pairs are necessary to evaluate the long-term effects and shape-change potential of EMR.

Due to immunological and physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women have a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to collect and integrate the results of previous studies to get an accurate representation and interpretation of the clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiological findings, and characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19. We conducted a scientific search in main databases with a combination of related MESH terms and keywords. The outcomes included common clinical symptoms at the time of onset of the disease, common laboratory and radiological findings, the rates of vaginal delivery and Cesarean section, Cesarean section indications, maternal complications, and vertical transmission rates. A total of 51 studies comprising 571 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and ground-glass opacities were the most common laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. A total of 114 Cesarean sections were performed due to COVID-19-related concerns. There were 55 cases of intubation (11.6%) and 13 maternal deaths (2.3%). The vertical transmission rate was 7.9%.

67754,"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of unintentional thermal injury from the monopolar ""Bovie"" instrument in comparison with traditional laparoscopy.",2017,"BACKGROUND Despite the benefits of whole-body hypothermia therapy, many infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) die or have significant long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Prospectively identifying neonates at risk of poor outcome is essential but not straightforward. The cerebellum is not classically considered to be a brain region vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic insults; recent literature suggests, however, that the cerebellum may be involved in neonatal HIE. In this study, we aimed to assess the microstructural integrity of cerebellar and linked supratentorial structures in neonates with HIE compared to neurologically healthy neonatal controls. METHODS In this prospective cohort study, we performed a quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of the structural pathways of connectivity, which may be affected in neonatal cerebellar injury by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and thalami. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were grouped into 4 categories of severity based on a qualitative evaluation of conventional and advanced MRI sequences. Multivariable linear regression analysis of cerebellar scalars of patients and controls was performed, controlling for gestational age, age at the time of MRI, and HIE severity. Spearman rank correlation was performed to correlate DTI scalars of the cerebellum and thalami. RESULTS Fifty-seven (23 females, 40%) neonates with HIE and 12 (6 females, 50%) neonatal controls were included. There were 8 patients (14%) in HIE severity groups 3 and 4 (injury of the basal ganglia/thalamus and/or cortex). Based on a qualitative analysis of conventional and DTI images, no patients had evidence of cerebellar injury. No significant differences between patients and controls were found in the FA and MD scalars. However, FA values of the middle cerebellar peduncles (0.294 vs. 0.380, p < 0.001) and MD values of the superior cerebellar peduncles (0.920 vs. 1.007 × 10-3 mm/s2, p = 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with evidence of moderate or severe injury on MRI (categories 3 and 4) than in controls. In patients, cerebellar DTI scalars correlated positively with DTI scalars within the thalami. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that infants with moderate-to-severe HIE may have occult injury of cerebellar white-matter tracts, which is not detectable by the qualitative analysis of neuroimaging data alone. Cerebellar DTI scalars correlate with thalamic measures, highlighting that cerebellar injury is unlikely to occur in isolation and may reflect the severity of HIE. The impact of concomitant cerebellar injury in HIE on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome warrants further study.","Lemmon, Monica E; Wagner, Matthias W; Bosemani, Thangamadhan; Carson, Kathryn A; Northington, Frances J; Huisman, Thierry A G M; Poretti, Andrea",Developmental neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1159/000454856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095379/,689

In this study, we quantified the endogenous melatonin levels in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The melatonin concentrations in root, stem, and leaf were 150.60, 37.92, and 40.58 ng g fresh weight- 1, respectively. The effects of exogenous melatonin (1 µM) on plant growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity, and ion homeostasis in upland cotton seedlings exposed to 100 mM NaCl treatment were determined. Pretreatment (prior to exposure to salt stress) of seedlings with exogenous melatonin significantly alleviated plant growth inhibition by salt stress and maintained an improved photosynthetic capacity. The application of melatonin also significantly reduced the salt-induced oxidative damage, possibly through the accumulation of osmotic regulatory substances and the activation of antioxidant enzymes. We also showed that exogenous melatonin regulated the expression of stress-responsive and ion-channel genes under salinity, which could contribute to improved salt tolerance in cotton. Taken together, our study provides evidence that cotton contains endogenous melatonin, and it may have unraveled crucial evidence of the role of melatonin in cotton against salt stress.","Shen, Jian; Chen, Dongdong; Zhang, Xiaopei; Song, Lirong; Dong, Jie; Xu, Qingjiang; Hu, Mengjiao; Cheng, Yingying; Shen, Fafu; Wang, Wei",Journal of plant research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10265-021-01284-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763804/,689

72421,Preoperative Progressive Pneumoperitoneum Enables Defect Closure and Laparoscopic Repair of Large Parastomal Hernias.,2020-01-23,"AIM To study the significance of the rs1378942 polymorphisms of the CSK gene and rs2200733 (chromosome 4q25) in the progression of AF in men with AH and AO. MATERIALS AND METHODS In an observational cohort study, 116 men aged 4565 years were followed. Of these, 57 patients with AF, AH and AO and a control group including 59 patients with AF, AH and without AO. Testing of polymorphism rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. All statistical calculations were performed using the Rstudio program (version 0.99.879 20092016 RStudio, Inc., USA). RESULTS The average age of all studied patients was 53.37.1 years. When dividing patients with AF and AH into groups based on the presence/absence of AO, it turned out that in the subgroups of carriers of different genotypes of the rs1378942 polymorphism of the CSK gene there are significant differences in BMI: in the group with BMI, there is an increase in the indicator in the series of CC, AC, AA genotypes. The highest BMI value in carriers of the CC genotype (p0.03) was in the group with AO. In the subgroups of carriers of different rs2200733 genotypes of chromosome 4q25, CC has the highest BMI (p0.05). It was proved that in the group with AO, the progression of AF occurred 2.57 times more often than in the group without AO (p0.003). CONCLUSION In men with AF and AH, single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 are associated with BMI. The heterozygous genotype AC rs1378942 in the CSK gene is significantly more common in patients, regardless of the presence of AO. In the group with AO, the progression of AF occurred 2.57 times more often than in the group without AO.","Hidirova, L D; Yakhontov, D A; Maksimov, V N",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720624/,689

Independently, both psychological distress and transitions impair patients' quality of life, and together their adverse impact may be intensified. Self-management allows patients to engage in tasks that influence the disease experience and can include strategies to help mitigate distress associated with transitions. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine research on the relationship between self-management interventions and distress in adult cancer patients receiving active tumor-directed therapy. From a search of seven electronic databases, 5,156 articles were identified; however, nine studies met inclusion criteria. Our review suggested that self-management interventions may help address psychological distress in patients receiving cancer treatment but that the current evidence is not robust enough to support a definitive conclusion.","Goldberg, Jessica I; Schulman-Green, Dena; Hernandez, Marisol; Nelson, Judith E; Capezuti, Elizabeth",Western journal of nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945919845104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007160/,689

Methods In six swine (mean body weight 53.5 kg), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was created and then end-to-side anastomosis between the left renal artery and AAA sac was performed. And then, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed, leading to creation of a type II endoleak model. As control group, EVAR without sac embolization was performed in two swine. In four swine, AAA sac was embolized using NLE immediately after EVAR via the microcatheter placed in AAA sac (NLE embolization group). Follow-up aortography was performed immediately and three days after the procedure, and then the aneurysms were extracted. Results The AAA sac and type II endoleak model were successfully created in all cases. In control group, type II endoleak persisted three days after the procedure. In NLE embolization group, endoleak disappeared immediately and three days after the procedure. In NLE embolization group, AAA sac was occupied with thrombus and embolic material. Inflammatory changes were recognized in aneurysmal sac wall in NLE embolization group. Conclusions This experimental study suggests that creation of a type II endoleak model in swine is feasible and that intraoperative AAA sac embolization with NLE during EVAR might reduce the occurrence of type II endoleak.","Nakai, Motoki; Ikoma, Akira; Loffroy, Romaric; Midulla, Marco; Kamisako, Atsufumi; Higashino, Nobuyuki; Fukuda, Kodai; Sonomura, Tetsuo",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims.2018.10.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505718/,689

Material and Methods A randomized, split-mouth design was conducted using 20 adult subjects requiring scaling and root planing (Sc/RP) in all four quadrants. Each side of the mouth (maxillary/mandibular) received Sc/RP with local anesthetic with or without the use of a stress-ball distraction over two separate sessions. Subjects completed two pre-procedural questionnaires (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI; Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, MDAS) before and after each treatment session. A Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (Neulog) was used throughout each session to measure skin conductance or sweat. Results No significant difference in GSR scores was found during treatment with or without the use of the stress ball. Also, no significant differences in the change in STAI or MDAS scores were found with or without the use of a stress ball. Conclusions The results of this study found that the use of a stress ball as a distraction technique did not result in any significant reduction in stress levels in subjects undergoing scaling and root planing with local anesthesia.

77184,Katrina: Stories from the storm.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Research on the relationship between digital media exposure and child development is complex, inconsistent and fraught with debate. A highlighted area of inadequacy surrounds the methodological limitations of measuring digital media use for both researchers and clinicians, alike. This protocol aims to (1) identify core concepts in the area of screen time and digital media use in children and adolescents (2) map existing research paradigms and screening/measurement tools that serve to underpin and operationalise core concepts and (3) provide an initial step in integrating these findings into a consolidated screening toolkit. It is expected this enterprise will help advance research and clinical evaluation in fields concerned with digital media use, namely medicine, child development and the social sciences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned scoping review will search relevant electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus, in addition to grey literature. All empirical investigations and presentation of original research will be considered, and measurement/screening tools for digital media usage in children and adolescents will be identified and reported on. Two reviewers will pilot test the screening criteria, and data extraction forms prior to independently screening all relevant literature and extracting the data. A three-stage synthesis process will be used to map the existent measurement and screening tools for digital media usage in children and adolescents. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical considerations for this scoping review. Plans for dissemination include publication in a top-tier, open-access journal, public presentations and conference proceedings. Presentation of the full scoping review has been accepted to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry 66th Annual Meeting.","Browne, Dillon Thomas; May, Shealyn; Hurst-Della Pietra, Pamela; Christakis, Dimitri; Asamoah, Tracy; Hale, Lauren; Delrahim-Howlett, Katia; Emond, Jennifer A; Fiks, Alexander G; Madigan, Sheri; Prime, Heather; Perlman, Greg; Rumpf, Hans-Jürgen; Thompson, Darcy; Uzzo, Stephen; Stapleton, Jackie; Neville, Ross",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772098/,689

To create a tool to rapidly determine where pandemic demand for critical care overwhelms county-level surge capacity and to compare public health and medical responses.Methods. In March 2020, COVID-19 cases requiring critical care were estimated using an adaptive metapopulation SEIR (susceptible‒exposed‒infectious‒recovered) model for all 3142 US counties for future 21-day and 42-day periods from April 2, 2020, to May 13, 2020, in 4 reactive patterns of contact reduction-0%, 20%, 30%, and 40%-and 4 surge response scenarios-very low, low, medium, and high.Results. In areas with increased demand, surge response measures could avert 104 120 additional deaths-55% through high clearance of critical care beds and 45% through measures such as greater ventilator access. The percentages of lives saved from high levels of contact reduction were 1.9 to 4.2 times greater than high levels of hospital surge response. Differences in projected versus actual COVID-19 demands were reasonably small over time.Conclusions. Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions had greater impact in minimizing preventable deaths during the pandemic than did hospital critical care surge response. Ready-to-go spatiotemporal supply and demand data visualization and analytics tools should be advanced for future preparedness and all-hazards disaster response. (Am J Public Health.

It may exist prior to ICU admission and may precipitate the need for mechanical ventilation but it also frequently develops during the ICU stay. Several risk factors for diaphragm weakness have been identified; among them sepsis and mechanical ventilation play central roles. We employ the term critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness to refer to the collective effects of all mechanisms of diaphragm injury and weakness occurring in critically ill patients. Critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness is consistently associated with poor outcomes including increased ICU mortality, difficult weaning, and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Bedside techniques for assessing the respiratory muscles promise to improve detection of diaphragm weakness and enable preventive or curative strategies.

Management of these injuries is complicated by associated injuries and the proximity to vital neurovascular structures. This study was designed to review the clinical experience with retained sinonasal and skull base projectile foreign bodies at a single academic tertiary care institution. METHODS A retrospective review of patients who suffered penetrating trauma to the head with retained metallic foreign bodies in the paranasal sinuses and/or skull base between January 2002 and August 2011 was performed at a single academic medical center. RESULTS There were 599 patients who suffered penetrating trauma to the head and neck, with 13 patients having retained metallic foreign bodies in the sinuses and/or skull base, mostly bullets or nails. Ten patients underwent urgent (n = 5) or delayed (n = 5) removal of foreign bodies accessible without compromise of adjacent structures either through an endoscopic or open approach. Three patients had multiple foreign bodies that were not removed. Three patients experienced traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistula managed with either conservative measures (n = 2) or intraoperative repair at the time of foreign body retrieval (n = 1). All patients received prophylactic antibiotic coverage. No patients suffered infectious complications such as sinusitis from retained foreign bodies. CONCLUSION Although not all retained foreign bodies after penetrating trauma to the head require removal, those that are safely accessible and at risk for infectious complications should be recovered. The timing and approach of retrieval are dictated by the clinical scenario.","Yarlagadda, Bharat; Jalisi, Scharukh; Burke, Peter; Platt, Michael",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22643952/,689

This is called ""postCOVID syndrome"", for which pulmonary fibrosis is one of the pathogenesis. Besides T-lymphocytes and macrophages, mast cells also contribute to the development of cytokine storm and thus stimulate the activity of fibroblasts. Additionally, by the exocytotic release of fibroblast-activating factors, mast cells directly facilitate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In our previous basic studies, anti-allergic drugs (olopatadine, ketotifen), antibiotics (clarithromycin) and corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone) inhibited the process of exocytosis and showed their potency as highly effective mast cell stabilizers. Given such pharmacological properties of these commonly used drugs, they may be useful in the treatment of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis and in relieving the symptoms of post-COVID syndrome.","Kazama, Itsuro",Drug discoveries & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5582/ddt.2020.03095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116043/,689
81804,Risk factors for complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND AIM The treat-to-target strategy has emerged in ulcerative colitis management. Mucosal healing is the best target, albeit not in induction therapy of acute diseases as clinical conditions vary over a short duration. To determine the targets during induction therapy for acute ulcerative colitis, we identified markers to predict mucosal healing at 3 and 12 months of initiating the induction therapy. METHODS This single-center prospective observational study enrolling 61 adult patients hospitalized for disease exacerbation collected the partial Mayo scores, ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity, fecal markers, and laboratory data (0 day, 2 weeks, and 3 and 12 months) of initiating induction therapy. RESULTS At 2 weeks, patients with mucosal healing at 3 months had had lower partial Mayo and ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity scores and higher white blood cell count and total cholesterol than those without mucosal healing. At 3 months, patients with mucosal healing at 12 months had had lower partial Mayo and ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity scores than those without mucosal healing. A kinetic analysis demonstrated a difference in the partial Mayo scores and total cholesterol and albumin levels at 2 weeks and in the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity, fecal calprotectin, and fecal immunochemical tests at 3 months between patients who achieved mucosal healing at 12 months and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS Partial Mayo scores and total cholesterol levels act as short-term therapeutic targets during induction therapy in patients with acute ulcerative colitis. Mucosal healing at 3 months correlates to longer time mucosal healing.","Motobayashi, Maiko; Matsuoka, Katsuyoshi; Takenaka, Kento; Fujii, Toshimitsu; Nagahori, Masakazu; Ohtsuka, Kazuo; Iwamoto, Fumihiko; Tsuchiya, Kiichiro; Negi, Mariko; Eishi, Yoshinobu; Watanabe, Mamoru",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551266/,689

Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge toward a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomenon characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.","Dimarco, Giacomo; Pareschi, Lorenzo; Toscani, Giuseppe; Zanella, Mattia",Physical review.

METHODS Subjects with Class I to II obesity were randomized (2:1) to receive active or sham procedure, after each investigator performed unblinded lead-in cases. All subjects were provided low-intensity lifestyle therapy. Efficacy end points were the mean difference in percent total body weight loss (%TBWL) at 12 months between randomized groups, and responder rate achieving ≥5% TBWL. The primary safety end point was incidence of reported adverse events. RESULTS Three hundred thirty-two subjects were randomized (active, n = 221; sham, n = 111); thirty-four subjects were included in the unblinded lead-in cohort. Twelve-month results were mean TBWL 7.0 ± 7.4% in lead-in, 4.95 ± 7.04% in active, and 1.38 ± 5.58% in sham groups, respectively.

METHODS Multiple regression analysis estimated the influence of extra-cerebral oxygenation as exemplified by skin oxygenation (Sskin O2 ) on Sc O2 in 21 healthy subjects exposed to whole-body exercise in hypoxia (Fi O2 = 12%; n = 10) and normoxia (n = 12), whole-body heating, hyperventilation (n = 21), administration of norepinephrine with and without petCO2 -correction (n = 15), phenylephrine and head-up tilt (n = 7). Sc O2 was assessed simultaneously by NIRO-200NX (Sniro O2 ) and INVOS-4100 (Sinvos O2 ). Arterial (Sa O2 ) and jugular bulb oxygen saturations (Sj O2 ) were obtained. RESULTS The regression analysis indicated that Sinvos O2 reflects 46% arterial, 14% jugular, 35% skin and 4% oxygenation of tissues not interrogated. Sinvos O2 follows a calculated estimate of cerebral capillary oxygenation (r = 0·67; P<0·0001). In contrast, the NIRO-200NX-determined Sc O2 did not correlate with the estimate of cerebral oxygenation (r = 0·026; P = 0·71). CONCLUSION For all interventions, 35% of the INVOS-4100 signal reflected extra-cerebral oxygenation while, on the other hand, NIRO-200NX did not follow changes in a calculated estimate of cerebral capillary oxygenation. Thus, the NIRO-200NX and INVOS-4100 do not provide for unbiased evaluation of the cerebral signal.","Sørensen, Henrik; Rasmussen, Peter; Siebenmann, Christoph; Zaar, Morten; Hvidtfeldt, Morten; Ogoh, Shigehiko; Sato, Kohei; Kohl-Bareis, Matthias; Secher, Niels H; Lundby, Carsten",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/cpf.12142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618369/,689

This study aimed to assess the associations among emotional reactions toward COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to this disease, and subjective health status. This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 1,085 Israeli adults who completed an online survey between April 23 and May 5, 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included questions about emotional reactions to COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, subjective health status, and sociodemographic variables. Participants (aged 18-96) reported high levels of emotional reactions to COVID-19. Most respondents were worried (77.4%), afraid (62.8%) or stressed (55.3%). Emotional reaction scores were higher among women than among men. In the regression model, emotional reactions were higher for older participants, those who rated their subjective health status as poorer, and those who were employed, with the final model explaining 11.6% of the variance in emotional reactions. Perceived susceptibility significantly mediated the relationship between subjective health status and emotional reactions. The high prevalence of emotional responses among women, older people and those with lower subjective health ratings points to the need for intervention programs primarily targeting these groups.","Inbar, Levkovich; Shinan-Altman, Shiri","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1858490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315513/,689

86912,Thermal spread and heat absorbance differences between open and laparoscopic surgeries during energized dissections by electrosurgical instruments.,2009,"Sinomenine (SINO), which is used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and neuralgia, is derived from the root and stems of Sinomenium acutum. SINO has been reported to exert analgesic, sedative and anti-inflammatory effects, and provides a protective role against shock and organ damage. Studies have suggested that SINO primarily exerts it anti-inflammatory function by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. There is also evidence to indicate that SINO may regulate inflammation Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling. The present study aimed to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory and cerebral protective effects of SINO were induced through Nrf2 both in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that SINO significantly upregulated Nrf2 protein expression levels, increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and the upregulated the protein expression levels of downstream factors. The treatment of a middle cerebral artery occlusion model mice with SINO effectively reduced cerebral damage and inflammation, and restored the balance in cerebral oxidative stress. In addition, SINO treatment also promoted Nrf2-dependent microglia M1/M2 polarization and inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα as well as NF-κB nuclear translocation. This revealed an important upstream event that contributed to its anti-inflammatory and cerebral tissue protective effects. In conclusion, the findings of the present study identified a novel pathway through which SINO may exert its anti-inflammatory and cerebral protective functions, and provided a molecular basis for the potential applications of SINO in the treatment of cerebral inflammatory disorders.","Bi, Fangfang; Zhang, Yiyong; Liu, Wenbo; Xie, Keliang",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968178/,689

The objective of this review was to synthesise qualitative and quantitative research on university students' menstrual experiences and educational impacts. METHODS Eligible studies were identified through systematic searching across eight peer-reviewed databases, websites for menstrual health organisations, grey literature databases, and reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies must have reported on at least one of the antecedents or components of menstrual experience outlined in the integrated model of menstrual experience in relation to university students or reported on the impact of their menstrual experiences on their education. Study characteristics and findings were extracted, analysed and presented as a narrative synthesis. The quality of evidence was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42020178470. RESULTS Eighty-three studies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies (n = 74; 89%) were quantitative and the highest proportion of studies were conducted in lower-middle-income countries (n = 31; 37%). Self-reported dysmenorrhea, other physical and emotional menstrual-related symptoms, and menstrual stigma contributed to negative menstrual experiences among female students. Very few studies considered the menstrual experiences of non-binary and transgender menstruating students, and culturally diverse students. Dysmenorrhea contributed to university absenteeism, impaired participation and concentration, and declining academic performance. Inadequate sanitation facilities for menstrual management and challenges containing menstruation also negatively impacted education. CONCLUSIONS Female university students' experiences of menstruation can negatively impact their education, highlighting the need for program and policy responses at university to improve students' wellbeing and educational engagement. Further research on the menstrual experiences of gender diverse, migrant and international students is needed as there is insufficient evidence to date.","Munro, Alana K; Hunter, Erin C; Hossain, Syeda Z; Keep, Melanie",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506544/,689

Whether improved outcomes are also associated with this regimen among patients with cytogenetically defined high-risk MM (HRMM) remains unclear. Objective To measure PFS associated with adding daratumumab to backbone MM regimens among patients with HRMM. Data Sources For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, clinical trials registries, and meeting libraries were searched from inception to January 2, 2020, using terms reflecting multiple myeloma and daratumumab. Study Selection Included studies were phase 3 randomized clinical trials that compared backbone MM regimens with the same regimen plus daratumumab in newly diagnosed or relapsed or refractory MM, such that the only difference between the intervention and control groups was use of daratumumab and reported outcomes by cytogenetic risk. High-risk MM was defined as the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), or del(17p). Data Extraction and Synthesis Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline, 2 investigators independently extracted study data, with disagreements resolved by a third investigator. Quality was assessed by the Cochrane risk-of-bias method. Main Outcomes and Measures Data on effectiveness were extracted using hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS. Relative log-HRs were pooled using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q and the I2 statistic. Results Of 5194 studies screened, 6 phase 3 trials were eligible, including 3 trials for newly diagnosed MM (2528 patients; 358 with HRMM) and 3 trials for relapsed or refractory MM (1533 patients; 222 with HRMM). Among patients with newly diagnosed HRMM, the addition of daratumumab to backbone regimens was associated with improved PFS (pooled HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02), with little evidence of heterogeneity (Cochran Q, P = .77; I2 = 0%). Similar results were seen among patients with relapsed or refractory HRMM (pooled HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.67; P < .001), again with little evidence of heterogeneity (Cochran Q, P = .63; I2 = 0%). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that incorporating daratumumab to backbone regimens may be associated with improved PFS among patients with newly diagnosed HRMM or relapsed or refractory HRMM.","Giri, Smith; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Bal, Susan; Godby, Kelly; Kharel, Prakash; Djulbegovic, Benjamin; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Facon, Thierry; Usmani, Saad Z; Mateos, María-Victoria; Costa, Luciano J",JAMA oncology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970151/,689

The aim of the present research was to investigate the reliability and validity of the Hungarian Core FertiQoL. Two independent samples of infertile women were merged (n = 320). While the model fit of the four-factor Confirmatory Factor Analysis was under the level of acceptability (χ2(246) = 626.36, p < 0.001, RMSEA = 0.070 [CI90 = 0.063-0.076], CFI = 0.878, SRMR = 0.071), the four-factor Exploratory Structural Equation Model showed much improved model fit (χ2(186) = 395.63, p < 0.001, RMSEA = 0.059 [CI90 = 0.051-0.067], CFI = 0.933, SRMR = 0.035). Good internal consistency (Cronbach's Alphas 0.77-0.92) and construct reliability (0.75-0.95) were found for both factor structures. Depression correlated negatively with fertility-specific quality of life. Almost a quarter of the sample suffered from moderate-to-severe depression. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that Beck Depression Inventory categories (mild, moderate etc.) co-occurred with significantly distinct FertiQoL score ranges, leading to a possible, clinically meaningful threshold on the Core FertiQoL.

METHODS We report the trial design, key demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings, and baseline therapies of 2964 patients randomised in the open-label (sponsor-blinded) active-controlled, parallel-group, randomised ASCEND-D clinical trial. We also compare baseline characteristics of ASCEND-D patients with patients who are on dialysis (CKD G5D) enrolled in other large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and in the most relevant registries. RESULTS The median age of patients was 58 years, 43% were female; 67% were white and 16% were black. The median haemoglobin at baseline was 10.4 g/dL. Among randomised patients, 89% were receiving haemodialysis and 11% peritoneal dialysis. Among key co-morbidities, 42% reported a history of diabetes mellitus, and 45% a history of cardiovascular disease. Median blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg. The median weekly dose of epoetin was 5751 units. Intravenous and oral iron use was noted in 64% and 11% of patients, respectively. Baseline demographics were similar to patients with CKD G5D enrolled in other CVOTs and renal patient registries.

94780,Incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: incidence and predictive factors.,2016,"PURPOSE Thoracoscopic lobectomy for congenital cystic lung lesions is an accepted technique in pediatric surgery. Since an increasing number of these lesions are detected prenatally, the safety and efficacy of infant resections have been questioned. We reviewed our experience over a 10-year period to evaluate early resection of these lesions. METHODS From January 2001 to August 2009, 75 patients under 1 year of age and weighing <10 kg underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy at two institutions. Patients carried the following diagnoses: 52 had congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, 20 had bronchopulmonary sequestration, and 3 had congenital lobar emphysema. All lesions were confirmed after birth by computed tomography scan. Patient age at operation ranged from 4 days to 11 months and patient weight from 3.1 to 10 kg. RESULTS Seventy-four of 75 lobectomies were thoracoscopically completed. There were 16 upper lobectomies, 1 middle lobectomy, and 55 lower lobectomies. Operative time ranged from 45 to 225 minutes. Hospital length of stay ranged from 1 to 5 days. A subset of 26 patients had surgery younger than 3 months of age and <5 kg, despite being asymptomatic. Their operative time averaged 90 minutes, and mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lobectomy is safe for infants <10 kg and avoids the morbidity associated with thoracotomy. Operating early on younger patients may avoid the inflammatory changes associated with both clinically apparent and subclinical infections, even in patients weighing <5 kg. This may make the procedures less technically challenging and may result in lower complication and conversion rates.","Rothenberg, Steven S; Kuenzler, Keith A; Middlesworth, William; Kay, Saundra; Yoder, Suzanne; Shipman, Kristin; Rodriguez, Ruben; Stolar, Charles J",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

95377,Laparoscopic hybrid NOTES liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer.,2012,"Introduction Obesity has been declared a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this rapid review, we provide an overview of recently-published papers with clinical and epidemiological relevance on this topic. Methods As part of a weekly COVID-19 data mining meeting, we conducted a literature review regarding the role of obesity in COVID-19 outcomes, particularly in young patients with COVID-19. We utilized the PubMed, Upstate Medical University Health Sciences Library, Google Scholar, and LitCovid databases to identify the articles. Results Our group identified seven relevant publications (four retrospective case series and three reviews). Conclusion Our group's review of this topic illustrates that obesity is a common comorbidity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of intermittent mandatory ventilation within the first 10 days of hospitalization and a higher risk of admission to acute or critical hospital care, including in patients aged less than 60 years, with one study showing it to be a greater risk factor than cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions for critical COVID-19 illness. There are some indications that moderate-intensity exercise may be beneficial for promoting a healthy immune system in patients with and without obesity. Given these findings, hospitals should ensure their staff are prepared and their facilities are adequately equipped to provide high-quality care to patients with obesity (PWO) hospitalized with COVID-19. Family medicine and primary care physicians are encouraged to counsel their PWO about their increased risk for morbidity and mortality during this pandemic.","Long, Joshua D; Ward, Caitlin A; Khorasani-Zadeh, Arshia",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2020.104798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111042/,689

Twelve men with MetS expended 500 kcal by walking at 65% of VO2max before and after a 6-week regimen of niacin. Niacin doses were titrated by 500 mg/week from 500 to 1500 mg/day and maintained at 1500 mg/day for the last 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected before and 24 hours after each exercise session and analyzed for PON1 activity, PON1 concentration, myeloperoxidase (MPO), apolipoprotein A1, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oLDL), lipoprotein particle sizes and concentrations. PON1 activity, PON1 concentration, MPO, and oLDL were unaltered following the independent effects of exercise and niacin (P > 0.05 for all). High-density lipoprotein particle size decreased by 3% (P = 0.040) and concentrations of small very low-density lipoprotein increased (P = 0.016) following exercise. PON1 activity increased 6.1% (P = 0.037) and PON1 concentrations increased 11.3% (P = 0.015) with the combination of exercise and niacin. Exercise and niacin works synergistically to increase PON1 activity and concentration with little or no changes in lipoproteins or markers of lipid oxidation.","Taylor, James Kyle; Plaisance, Eric P; Mahurin, A Jack; Mestek, Michael L; Moncada-Jimenez, Jose; Grandjean, Peter W",Redox report : communications in free radical research,https://doi.org/10.1179/1351000214y.0000000103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180827/,689

STUDY DESIGN The Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT) ran a course series on 16 January 2016 across the UK and Ireland. A mandatory, self-reported, online questionnaire collected delegate feedback, using 5-point Likert Scales, and a NetPromoter feedback tool. Precourse and postcourse matched questionnaires were collected for 'Foundation Skills in Surgery' (FSS) courses. Paired economic analysis was performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using RStudio (V.3.1.1 Boston, Massachusetts, USA). RESULTS Forty courses were held across the UK and Ireland (65.0% technical, 35.0% non-technical), with 184 faculty members. Of 570 delegates, 529 fully completed the feedback survey (92.8% response rate); 56.5% were male. The median age was 26 years (range: 18-67 years). The mean overall course NetPromoter Score was 8.7 out of 10. On logistic regression high NetPromoter Score was associated with completing a Foundation Skills in Surgery course (R=0.44, OR: 1.49, p=0.025) and having clear learning outcomes (R=0.72, OR: 2.04, p=0.029) but not associated with specialty, course style or teaching style. For Foundation Skills in Surgery courses, delegates reported increased commitment to a career in surgery (p<0.001), confidence with basic surgical skills (p<0.001) and confidence with assisting in theatre (p<0.001).

96511,Clinical Outcome and Surgical Technique of Laparoscopic Posterior Rectopexy Using the Mesh With Anti-adhesion Coating.,2019,"Pestiviruses are members of the family Flaviviridae, a group of enveloped viruses that bud at intracellular membranes. Pestivirus particles contain three glycosylated envelope proteins, Erns, E1 and E2. Among them, E1 is the least characterized concerning both biochemical features and function. E1 from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain CP7 was analyzed with regard to its intracellular localization and membrane topology. Here, it is shown that even in the absence of other viral proteins, E1 is not secreted or expressed at the cell surface, but localizes predominantly in the ER. Using engineered chimeric TM domains with sequences from E1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, the E1 ER-retention signal could be narrowed down to six fully conserved polar residues in the middle part of the transmembrane domain of E1. Retention was observed even when several of these polar residues were exchanged for alanine. Mutations with a strong impact on E1 retention prevented recovery of infectious viruses when tested in the viral context. Analysis of the membrane topology of E1 before and after the signal peptide cleavage via a selective permeabilization and an in vivo labelling approach revealed that mature E1 is a typical type I transmembrane protein with a single span transmembrane anchor at its C-terminus whereas it adopts a hairpin-like structure with the C-terminus located in the ER lumen when the pre-cleavage situation is mimicked by blocking the cleavage site between E1 and E2.ImportanceThe shortage of specific antibodies against E1 making detection and further analysis of E1 difficult, resulted in a lack of knowledge on E1 compared to Erns and E2 with regard to biosynthesis, structure and function. It is known that pestiviruses bud intracellularly. Here, we show that E1 contains its own ER retention signal: six fully conserved polar residues in the middle part of the TM domain are shown to be the determinants for ER retention of E1. Moreover, those six polar residues could serve as a functional group that intensely affect the generation of infectious viral particles. In addition, the membrane topology of E1 has been determined. In this context, we also identified dynamic changes in membrane topology of E1 with the carboxy-terminus located on the luminal side of the ER in the pre-cleavage state and relocation of this sequence upon signal peptidase cleavage. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of the pestiviral E1 protein with regard to its biochemical and functional characteristics.","Mu, Yu; Radtke, Christina; Tews, Birke Andrea; Meyers, Gregor",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00521-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011544/,689

98845,Video-assisted thoracoscopic repair of a lung hernia in a child.,2011,"COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world. Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization. It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission. As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.","Hsieh, Tsung-Yen; Dedhia, Raj D; Chiao, Whitney; Dresner, Harley; Barta, Ruth J; Lyford-Pike, Sofia; Hamlar, David; Stephan, Scott J; Schubert, Warren; Hilger, Peter A",Facial plastic surgery & aesthetic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/fpsam.2020.0185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302216/,689

In this study, we performed a quantitative simulation to research the passive climate adaptability of a residential area, considering piloti as the main method for climate adaptation in a hot-summer and cold-winter city in China. Numerical simulations were performed with a coupled simulation method of convection, radiation, and conduction. A cubic non-linear k⁻ε model proposed by Craft et al. was selected as the turbulence model and three-dimensional multi-reflections of shortwave and longwave radiations were considered in the radiation simulation. Through the simulation, we found that setting the piloti at the two ends of the building was the optimal piloti arrangement for climate adaptation. Then the relationship between the piloti ratio (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) and the outdoor thermal environment was studied. It could be concluded that with the increasing piloti ratio, the wind velocity increased, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) decreased slightly, and the average standard effective temperature (SET*) decreased to 3.6 °C in summer, while in winter, with the increasing piloti ratio, the wind velocity, MRT, and SET* changed slightly. The wind environment significantly affected the SET* value, and the piloti ratio should be between 12% and 38% to avoid wind-induced discomfort.","Zhou, Zeng; Deng, Qinli; Yang, Guang; Lin, Yaolin",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15102202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304857/,689

100511,Evaluation of the use of serum C-reactive protein concentration to predict outcome in puppies infected with canine parvovirus.,2013,"BACKGROUND Immunomodulatory strategies in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) include the use of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). The optimal application of these therapies is unknown and outcomes data are limited. We investigated treatment categories and laboratory and clinical outcomes of IVIG and/or TPE in HIT with a systematic literature review. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science through December 2019 for studies combining controlled vocabulary and keywords related to thrombocytopenia, heparin, TPE, and IVIG. The primary outcome was treatment indication. Secondary outcomes were platelet recovery, HIT laboratory parameters, heparin re-exposure, and post-treatment course. Case-level data were analyzed by qualitative synthesis. RESULTS After 4241 references were screened, we identified 60 studies with four main categories of IVIG and/or TPE use as follows: (a) treatment of refractory HIT (n = 35; 31%); (b) initial therapy (n = 45; 40%); (c) cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (CPB; n = 30; 27%); and (d) other (n = 2; 2%). IVIG was most commonly used for the treatment of refractory HIT while TPE was primarily used to facilitate heparin exposure during CPB. Both IVIG and TPE were equally used as initial therapy. Heparin re-exposure occurred without thrombotic event in 29 TPE-treated patients and three IVIG-treated patients. CONCLUSION In patients with HIT, both TPE and IVIG are used for initial therapy or treatment of refractory HIT. However, TPE is more commonly used in patients undergoing CPB. Prospective studies may help clarify which treatment is indicated in HIT population subsets.","Onuoha, Chinonso; Barton, Karen D; Wong, Edward C C; Raval, Jay S; Rollins-Raval, Marian A; Ipe, Tina S; Kiss, Joseph E; Boral, Leonard I; Adamksi, Jill; Zantek, Nicole D; Onwuemene, Oluwatoyosi A",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812222/,689

The current study measures the knowledge, intentions and beliefs of third-year Australian nursing students on key infection prevention and control (IPC) concepts. METHODS A cross-sectional study of final-year undergraduate nursing students from Schools of Nursing at six Australian universities was undertaken. Students were asked to participate in an anonymous survey. The survey explored knowledge of standard precautions and transmission based precautions. In addition intentions and beliefs towards IPC were explored. RESULTS 349 students from six universities completed the study. 59.8% (95% CI 58.8-60.8%) of questions were answered correctly. Significantly more standard precaution questions were correctly answered than transmission-based precaution questions (p < 0.001). No association was found between self-reported compliance with IPC activities and gender or age. Certain infection control issues were correlated with the percentage of correctly answered transmission-based precaution questions. The participants were most likely to seek infection control information from an infection control professional. CONCLUSION Knowledge on transmission-based precautions was substandard. As transmission-based precautions are the foundation of IPC for serious organisms and infections, education institutions should reflect on the content and style of educational delivery on this topic.","Mitchell, Brett G; Say, Richard; Wells, Anne; Wilson, Fiona; Cloete, Linda; Matheson, Lucinda",BMC nursing,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-014-0043-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516721/,689
101197,Levetiracetam as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with suspected idiopathic epilepsy.,2008,"BACKGROUND Although human bocavirus type 1 (HBoV1) is a respiratory pathogen, presence of HBoV-DNA in secretions of asymptomatic children raised the question on the significance of HBoV-positive results. METHODS Archived specimens from a prospective, longitudinal study were tested for HBoV. A total of 94 children (aged 6-36 months) were HBoV(+) during 172 upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and/or acute otitis media (AOM) episodes. We used pyrosequencing of NP1, VP1 and VP2 genes to type HBoV and subtype HBoV1 in these specimens. RESULTS Of the specimens tested, HBoV-DNA were successfully sequenced in 128 (74%) samples from 70 children; all were HBoV type 1. Subtypes identified (n = 108) were LWK/TW (63%), LWK/BJ (20%), Bonn/BJ (16%) and LWK/KU3 (1%). Of 46 children for whom shedding pattern could be determined, viral clearance within 30 days (13-29 days) occurred in 28%; another 22% of children had no recurrence after 32-267 days. Prolonged virus presence of >30 days (34-181 days+) occurred in 22%; intermittent detection (61+ to 170+ days) in 20%. Infection with the same HBoV1 subtype after 4-5 negative samples (244 and 265 days interval) occurred in 4%. Infection with 2 different HBoV1 subtypes (29 and 87 days apart) occurred in only 4%. Newly acquired HBoV1-URI resulted in AOM in 53% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Children with HBoV1 infection commonly shed for a prolonged period leading to repeated viral DNA detection. Recurrence after 8-9 months suggests possible persistence and reactivation. Infections with 2 different HBoV1 subtypes within 1-year period are uncommon. Newly acquired HBoV1-URI is often complicated by AOM.","Wagner, Johana Castro; Pyles, Richard B; Miller, Aaron L; Nokso-Koivisto, J; Loeffelholz, Michael J; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000001058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26766144/,689

The recent rise of PEDV outbreaks in Asia and North America warrants an urgent search for effective vaccines. However, PEDV vaccine research has been hampered by difficulties in isolating and propagating the virus in mammalian cells, thereby complicating the recovery of infectious PEDV using a full-length infectious clone. Here, we engineered VeroE6 cells to stably express porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) and used them as a platform to obtain a high-growth variant of PEDV, termed PEDVAVCT12. Subsequently, the full-length cDNA clone was constructed by assembling contiguous cDNA fragments encompassing the complete genome of PEDVAVCT12 in a bacterial artificial chromosome. Infectious PEDV could be recovered, and the rescued virus displayed phenotypic properties identical to the parental virus. Interestingly, we found that PEDVAVCT12 contained a C-terminal deletion of the spike gene, resulting in disruption of the ORF3 start codon. When a functional ORF3 gene was restored, the recombinant virus could not be rescued, suggesting that ORF3 could suppress PEDV replication in vitro. In addition, a high-growth and genetically stable recombinant PEDV expressing a foreign protein could be rescued by replacing the ORF3 gene with the mCherry gene. Together, the results of this study provide a means to generate genetically defined PEDV as a promising vaccine candidate.","Jengarn, Juggragarn; Wongthida, Phonphimon; Wanasen, Nanchaya; Frantz, Phanramphoei Namprachan; Wanitchang, Asawin; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25979733/,689

METHODS This was a multinational retrospective cohort study including women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 from 73 centers from 22 different countries in Europe, United States, South America, Asia and Australia from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS 388 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The primary outcome was observed in 47/388 women (12.1%). 43/388 women (11.1%) were admitted to ICU, 36/388 (9.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3/388 women deceased (0.8%). Of the 388 women included in the study, 122 (31.4%) were still pregnant at the time of the study. Among the other 266 women, 6 had spontaneous first-trimester abortion, 3 had elective termination of pregnancy, 6 had stillbirth, and 251 delivered a live-born infant. The rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks of gestation was 26.3% (70/266). Of the 251 live-born infants, 69/251 (27.5%) were admitted to NICU, with 5 neonatal deaths (2.0%). The overall rate of perinatal death was 4.1% (11/266). Only one infant (1/251, 0.4%) born from a mother tested positive during the third trimester, was found positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women is associated with 0.8% rate of maternal mortality, but 11.1% rate of admission to ICU. The risk of vertical transmission seems to be negligible.

104249,Mesenteric defect closure in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized controlled trial.,2015,"OBJECTIVE During the past decade, the pediatric suicide rate has nearly tripled. Yet, little is known about suicide behavior (SB) in children. Identification of risk factors associated with SB during childhood may be critical to preventing future attempts. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neurocognitive performance and suicide ideation (SI) in children. METHOD The present study utilized baseline data from 11,875 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a longitudinal study that follows 9- and 10-year-old children through late adolescence to examine factors that influence developmental trajectories. Suicidality was assessed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (KSADS) suicide module completed by the parent. Neurocognitive ability was assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognition measures administered to the youth. RESULTS Children with a history of SI reported by their parent or concordant parent and youth report of SI demonstrated lower performance on the NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test compared to children without SI. The difference in performance on the memory task remained significant when including demographic characteristics, family history of suicide, and internalizing symptoms in the model as covariates. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify decreased episodic memory in children with SI. These findings are similar to results from adult and adolescent studies which have reported decreased memory performance among suicide attempters. Deficits in episodic memory may impact a child's ability to problem-solve and generate potential future outcomes, which may increase the risk for SB. Early identification of memory deficits in children may inform suicide prevention and intervention efforts. Highlights 6% of parents and children reported a history of active suicide ideation in children. Children with a history of suicide ideation had lower episodic memory performance. Early identification of memory deficits may inform suicide intervention efforts.","Huber, Rebekah S; Sheth, Chandni; Renshaw, Perry F; Yurgelun-Todd, Deborah A; McGlade, Erin C",Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2020.1818657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985363/,689

OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the effect of the Pipeline embolization device (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) on large and giant intracranial aneurysms with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and then correlate with clinical follow-up. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of aneurysms treated solely with Pipeline without adjunctive therapy. The largest aneurysm diameters were compared with pretreatment and post treatment MRI and correlated with DSA and clinical symptoms. RESULTS Twelve patients harboring large and giant saccular unruptured aneurysms, treated with Pipeline, were included. Mean follow-up times were as follows: MRI 22.8 months (range 1-57), DSA 18.2 months (range 1-33), and clinical 29 months (range 1-48). Ten (83%) of 12 treated aneurysms decreased in size on MRI, which was first seen at an average of 17 months (range 4-57). In 70% of patients the change was noted on MRI ≤1 year after treatment, at an average of 9.1 months (range 4-12). MRI reduction was more likely in angiographically occluded aneurysms. Five aneurysms with complete occlusion on early angiogram showed size reduction on MRI only at ≥12 months. Mean aneurysm size reduction was 57% (range 19.6-94.2), which correlated well with improvement of cranial neuropathies in 75% and headaches in 100% of patients. CONCLUSION Most aneurysms treated with Pipeline decreased in size, correlating with clinical improvement. Some aneurysms remained unchanged on MRI until a later time point despite early DSA occlusion. It may be reasonable to eliminate early postprocedural imaging and start follow-up only as late as 1 year after FD treatment in clinically stable, asymptomatic patients.","John, Seby; Bain, Mark D; Hussain, M Shazam; Bauer, Andrew M; Toth, Gabor",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27268315/,689

111348,Laparoscopic-assisted proximal gastrectomy in an obese patient with gastric cancer and myasthenia gravis.,2011,"Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA has the potential to form hairpin structures at the transcription start sequence (TSS) and reinitiation sites of internal genes, both on the genomic and antigenomic/mRNA level. Hairpin formation involving the TSS and the spacer sequence between promotor elements (PE) 1 and 2 was suggested to regulate viral transcription. Here, we provide evidence that such RNA structures form during RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase and affect its activity. This was analyzed using monocistronic minigenomes carrying hairpin structure variants in the TSS-spacer region that differ in length and stability. Transcription and replication were measured via reporter activity and by qRT-PCR quantification of the distinct viral RNA species. We demonstrate that viral RNA synthesis is remarkably tolerant to spacer extensions of up to ~54 nt, but declines beyond this length limit (~25% residual activity for a 66-nt extension). Minor incremental stabilizations of hairpin structures in the TSS-spacer region and on the mRNA/antigenomic level were found to rapidly abolish viral polymerase activity, which may be exploited for antisense strategies to inhibit viral RNA synthesis. Finally, balanced viral transcription and replication can still occur when any RNA structure formation potential at the TSS is eliminated, provided that hexamer phasing in the promoter region is maintained. Altogether, the findings deepen and refine our insight into structure and length constraints within the EBOV transcription and replication promoter and suggest a remarkable flexibility of the viral polymerase in recognition of PE1 and PE2.","Bach, Simone; Demper, Jana-Christin; Biedenkopf, Nadine; Becker, Stephan; Hartmann, Roland K",RNA biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2020.1818459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882148/,689

113434,A randomized clinical trial comparing Ligasure versus stapled hemorrhoidectomy.,2012,"BACKGROUND Domestic violence (DV) damages health and requires a global public health response and engagement of clinical services. Recent surveys show that 27% of married Palestinian women experienced some form of violence from their husbands over a 12 months' period, but only 5% had sought formal help, and rarely from health services. Across the globe, barriers to disclosure of DV have been recorded, including self-blame, fear of the consequences and lack of knowledge of services. This is the first qualitative study to address barriers to disclosure within health services for Palestinian women. METHODS In-depth interviews were carried out with 20 women who had experienced DV. They were recruited from a non-governmental organisation offering social and legal support. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated into English and the data were analysed thematically. RESULTS Women encountered barriers at individual, health care service and societal levels. Lack of knowledge of available services, concern about the health care primary focus on physical issues, lack of privacy in health consultations, lack of trust in confidentiality, fear of being labelled 'mentally ill' and losing access to their children were all highlighted. Women wished for health professionals to take the initiative in enquiring about DV. Wider issues concerned women's social and economic dependency on their husbands which led to fears about transgressing social and cultural norms by speaking out. Women feared being blamed and ostracised by family members and others, or experiencing an escalation of violence. CONCLUSIONS Palestinian women's agency to be proactive in help-seeking for DV is clearly limited. Our findings can inform training of health professionals in Palestine to address these barriers, to increase awareness of the link between DV and many common presentations such as depression, to ask sensitively about DV in private, reassure women about confidentiality, and increase awareness among women of the role that health services can play in DV.","Shaheen, Amira; Ashkar, Suzy; Alkaiyat, Abdulsalam; Bacchus, Loraine; Colombini, Manuela; Feder, Gene; Evans, Maggie",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09907-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243196/,689

118611,"SCAI 2021 Scienfic Sessions Virtual Conference April 28 - May 01, 2021.",2021-04-15,"OBJECTIVES Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) consists of the delivery of near-infrared (NIR) or red light to the scalp designed to penetrate to subjacent cortical areas of the brain. NIR t-PBM has recently emerged as a potential therapy for brain disorders. This study assessed the efficacy of repeated sessions of NIR t-PBM on sexual dysfunction. METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of a double-blind clinical trial on t-PBM for major depressive disorder (MDD). Twenty individuals received NIR t-PBM (n = 9) or sham therapy (n = 11) twice a week for 8 weeks. Sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm were assessed using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment-Emergent Effects-Specific Inquiry (SAFTEE-SI). RESULTS The mean improvement in sexual function (decrease in SAFTEE sex total score) in subjects receiving t-PBM in NIR-mode was significantly greater than in subjects receiving sham-mode in the whole sample (NIR [n = 9] -2.55 ± 1.88 vs. sham [n = 11] -0.45 ± 1.21; z = 2.548, P = 0.011]) and in the completers (NIR [n = 5] -3.4 ± 1.95 vs. sham [n = 7] -0.14 ± 1.21; z = 2.576, P = 0.010]). CONCLUSION This exploratory study with a small sample size indicates that repeated sessions of NIR t-PBM may be associated with therapeutic effects on sexual dysfunction. The latter appeared unrelated to the antidepressant effect of t-PBM in our cohort. Lasers Surg.

The measures taken in different countries spanned from complete isolation and lockdown to different degrees of restrictions to people's movement, contact between people, hygiene and sanitation. Accordingly, the success in containing the virus also differed. Italy was one among the worst-affected countries in the world despite the lockdown measures adopted. A combination of lockdown and Level-3 State of Emergency measures were adopted in Portugal and South Africa, which helped to delay and flatten the epidemic curve. The timely application of Level-3 State of Emergency in Mozambique resulted in recording low infection rates.

118821,Effect of acellular human dermis buttress on laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.,2015,"OBJECTIVES In mechanical ventilation, normoventilation in terms of PCO2 can be achieved by titration of the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume. Although a linear relationship has been found between changes in respiratory rate and resulting changes in end-tidal cO2 (△PetCO2) as well as between changes in respiratory rate and equilibration time (teq) for mechanically ventilated patients without lung injury, it is unclear whether a similar relationship holds for acute lung injury or altered hemodynamics. DESIGN We performed a prospective randomized controlled animal study of the change in PetCO2 with changes in respiratory rate in a lung-healthy, lung-injury, lung-healthy + altered hemodynamics, and lung-injury + altered hemodynamics pig model. SETTING University research laboratory. SUBJECTS Twenty mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS Moderate lung injury was induced by injection of oleic acid in 10 randomly assigned pigs, and after the first round of measurements, cardiac output was increased by approximately 30% by constant administration of noradrenalin in both groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We systematically increased and decreased changes in respiratory rate according to a set protocol: +2, -4, +6, -8, +10, -12, +14 breaths/min and awaited equilibration of Petco2. We found a linear relationship between changes in respiratory rate and △PetCO2 as well as between changes in respiratory rate and teq. A two-sample t test resulted in no significant differences between the lung injury and healthy control group before or after hemodynamic intervention. Furthermore, exponential extrapolation allowed prediction of the new PetCO2 equilibrium and teq after 5.7 ± 5.6 min. CONCLUSIONS The transition between PetCO2 equilibria after changes in respiratory rate might not be dependent on moderate lung injury or cardiac output but on the metabolic production or capacity of cO2 stores. Linear relationships previously found for lung-healthy patients and early prediction of PetCO2 equilibration could therefore also be used for the titration of respiratory rate on the PetCO2 for a wider range of pathologies by the physician or an automated ventilation system.","Buehler, Sarah; Lozano-Zahonero, Sara; Wirth, Steffen; Runck, Hanna; Gamerdinger, Katharina; Förster, Katharina; Haberstroh, Jörg; Guttmann, Josef; Schumann, Stefan",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657403/,689
118992,Restoration of gastrointestinal motility ameliorates nutritional deficiencies and body weight loss of patients who undergo laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Single cell sequencing of human heart tissue is technically challenging and methods to cryopreserve heart tissue for obtaining single cell information have not been standardized. Studies published to date have used varying methods to preserve and process human heart tissue, and have generated interesting datasets, but development of a biobanking standard has not yet been achieved. Heart transcription patterns are known to be regionally diverse, and there are few single cell datasets for normal human heart tissue. METHODS Using pig tissue, we developed a rigorous and reproducible method for tissue mincing and cryopreservation that allowed recovery of high quality single nuclei RNA. We subsequently tested this protocol on normal human heart tissue obtained from organ donors and were able to recover high quality nuclei for generation of single nuclei RNA-seq datasets, using a commercially available platform from 10× Genomics. We analyzed these datasets using standard software packages such as CellRanger and Seurat. RESULTS Human heart tissue preserved with our method consistently yielded nuclear RNA with RNA Integrity Numbers of greater than 8.5. We demonstrate the utility of this method for single nuclei RNA-sequencing of the normal human interventricular septum and delineating its cellular diversity. The human IVS showed unexpected diversity with detection of 23 distinct cell clusters that were subsequently categorized into different cell types. Cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were the most commonly identified cell types and could be further subdivided into 5 different cardiomyocyte subtypes and 6 different fibroblast subtypes that differed by gene expression patterns. Ingenuity Pathway analysis of these gene expression patterns suggested functional diversity in these cell subtypes. CONCLUSIONS Here we report a simple technical method for cryopreservation and subsequent nuclear isolation of human interventricular septum tissue that can be done with common laboratory equipment. We show how this method can be used to generate single nuclei transcriptomic datasets that rival those already published by larger groups in terms of cell diversity and complexity and suggest that this simple method can provide guidance for biobanking of human myocardial tissue for complex genomic analysis.","Larson, Amy; Chin, Michael T",BMC medical genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-021-01011-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130702/,689
119562,Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a prospective randomized study.,2012,To develop a quality control checklist for the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 （COVID-19） in fever clinic and isolation ward of the general hospital and to assess its application. Based on the relevant prevention and control plans and technical guidelines for COVID-19，Delphi method was used to identity items for evaluation，and a quality control checklist for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the fever clinic and isolation ward was developed in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. The checklists included 8 dimensions and 32 items for fever clinic，7 dimensions and 27 items for the isolation ward. The appointed inspectors conducted daily quality control for each shift with this checklist. The expert authority coefficient was 0.88，the mean of the importance of each index in the quality control table was not less than 4.8，and the coefficient of variation was not more than 0.07. During the entire February 2020，8 problems were found and rectified on-the-spot with the application of the checklist. Quality inspection rate was 100% in both isolation wards and fever clinic. The compliance rate and accuracy rate of hand hygiene were 100%; the correct rate of wearing and removing protective equipment increased from 96% to 100%. During the same period，a total of 1915 patients were admitted to the fever clinic，including 191 suspected patients （all were isolated in the hospital，3 were confirmed）. There were no medical staff infected with COVID-19，no cross infection of patients and their families in the hospital.

Our previous exome-wide analyses found a Val1937Ile variant (rs17848945) in the 34th exon of fatty acid synthase (FASN) that showed a strong association with the risk of ESCC. In this study, we performed a series of functional assays to investigate the biological functions underlying this variant in the development of ESCC. We demonstrated that FASN was upregulated in ESCC and both knockdown and knockout of FASN significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoter role for this gene in ESCC. Furthermore, the results showed that overexpression of FASN[I] in the ESCC cells substantially enhanced cell proliferation, compared with overexpression of FASN[V], or the control vector. Intriguingly, we found that the FASN[I] variant can enhance the enzyme activity of FASN, and, thus, increase the amount of the FASN end-product, palmitate in the ESCC cells. We also observed elevated palmitate levels in the plasma of the FASN[I] genotype carriers among a total of 632 healthy Chinese adults. In conclusion, our results suggested that the FASN V1937I variant influenced ESCC cell proliferation and susceptibility by altering the catabolic activity of FASN on palmitate. These findings may highlight an important role of palmitate metabolism in the development of ESCC and may contribute to the personalized medicine of this disease.","Wang, Xiaoyang; Tian, Jianbo; Zhao, Qianyu; Yang, Nan; Ying, Pingting; Peng, Xiating; Zou, Danyi; Zhu, Ying; Zhong, Rong; Gao, Ying; Chang, Jiang; Miao, Xiaoping",Archives of toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-020-02738-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388819/,689

120704,Endoscopic Vacuum Therapy (EVT) for Persistent Duodenal Stump Dehiscence After Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery in Selected Patients: A Tertiary Referral Center Case Series.,2021-02-02,"ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme, is involved in the ectodomain shedding of many integral membrane proteins. We have previously reported that ADAM17 is able to mediate the cleavage secretion of the ectodomain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this study, we demonstrate that purified recombinant human ADAM17 is able to cleave a 20-amino acid peptide mimetic corresponding to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of human ACE2 between Arg(708) and Ser(709). A series of peptide analogues were also synthesized, showing that glutamate subtitution at Arg(708) and/or Arg(710) attenuated the cleavage process, while alanine substitution at Arg(708) and/or Ser(709) did not inhibit peptide cleavage by recombinant ADAM17. Analysis of CD spectra showed a minimal difference in the secondary structure of the peptide analogues in the buffer system used for the ADAM17 cleavage assay. The observation of the shedding profiles of ACE2 mutants expressing CHO-K1 and CHO-P cells indicates that the Arg(708) → Glu(708) mutation and the Arg(708)Arg(710) → Glu(708)Glu(710) double mutation produced increases in the amount of ACE2 shed when stimulated by phorbol ester PMA. In summary, we have demonstrated that ADAM17 is able to cleave ACE2 peptide sequence analogues between Arg(708) and Ser(709). These findings also indicate that Arg(708) and Arg(710) play a role in site recognition in the regulation of ACE2 ectodomain shedding mediated by ADAM17.","Lai, Zon W; Hanchapola, Iresha; Steer, David L; Smith, A Ian",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi200525y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563828/,689

Group-based Pain Management Programs have been viewed as significant treatments aiding patients with self-management of chronic pain. The onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020, widely eliminated the in-person Group-based Pain Management Programs. The exploration of therapeutic contextual factors such as the therapeutic alliance and group dynamics in telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs appears warranted for which reason the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was developed. METHODS The therapeutic alliance and group dynamics items in the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire were developed from an extensive literature review and underwent examination of content validity, internal consistency, reliability, and validity through telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs. RESULTS Content validity of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was established in five separate stages and the psychometrics of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was found to be very good with high internal consistency and reliability (r = 0.85-0.97) and the ability of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire to differentiate between high and low scorers on the SF-36 emotional well-being measure. DISCUSSION The examination of therapeutic contextual factors via telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs using the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire appears possible in view of the very good psychometric properties described above. Investigation of therapeutic contextual factors through the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire may provide greater insight into the role that these factors may have in telehealth programs and their impact on pain outcomes. Future investigation of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire in non-telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs, as well as, other disorders being addressed via telehealth appears warranted.","Romm, Marnin J; Cahalin, Lawrence P",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211027410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160313/,689

123067,Proximal Gastrectomy Is a Viable Alternative to Total Gastrectomy in Early Stage Proximal Gastric Cancer.,2021,"Autoantibodies (aAB) to the presynaptic located enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) are a characteristic attribute for a variety of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system including subtypes of limbic encephalitis, stiff person-syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, and Batten's disease. Clinical signs of hyperexcitability and improvement of disease symptoms upon immunotherapy in some of these disorders suggest a possible pathogenic role of associated aAB. Recent experimental studies report inconsistent results regarding a direct pathogenic influence of anti-GAD65 aAB affecting inhibitory synaptic transmission in central GABAergic pathways. We here provide a method for direct evaluation of aAB-induced pathomechanisms in the intact hippocampal network. Purified patient IgG fractions containing aAB to GAD65 together with fixable lipophilic styryl dyes (FMdyes) are stereotactically injected into the hilus and the dentate gyrus in anesthetized mice. Twenty-four hours after intrahippocampal injection, acute hippocampal slices are prepared and transferred to a patch-clamp recording setup equipped with a fluorescence light source. Intraneural incorporated FMdyes show correct injection site for patch-clamp recording. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings are performed from granule cells in the dentate gyrus and extracellular stimulation is applied in the border area of the dentate gyrus-hilus region to stimulate GABAergic afferents arising from parvalbumin positive basket cells. GABA-A receptor mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) and miniature IPSC are recorded after blocking glutamatergic transmission. This approach allows investigation of potential aAB-induced effects on GABA-A receptor signaling ex vivo in an intact neuronal network. This offers several advantages compared to experimental procedures used in previous studies by in vitro AB preincubation of primary neurons or slice preparations. Furthermore, this method requires only small amounts of patient material that are often limited in rare diseases.","Haselmann, Holger; Röpke, Luise; Werner, Christian; Kunze, Albrecht; Geis, Christian",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2015.00136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26124746/,689

AIM To explore whether COVID-19 pandemic fears are associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and vice versa in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioural disorders. METHODS A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adolescents with pre-existing mental disorders. The extent of worrying related to the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the COVID-19 inventory whereas obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed using the obsessive-compulsive inventory-revised (OCI-R). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic fears and the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. RESULTS A total of 57 patients out of 63 participants (90.4%) had a COVID-19 inventory score of 12 or higher suggesting that a vast majority of young people with mental disorders had significant pandemic-related worries. Out of these 57 patients, over half (31) had an OCI-R modified score of 17 or higher indicating significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms. A positive correlation was found between the means of the two scores. This relationship was statistically significant - {r = 0.405, Sig. (two-tailed) = 0.001}.

Apart from respiratory complications, an increasing number of patients with ischemic stroke have been reporting. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the characteristics of ischemic stroke after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides valuable reference materials for subsequent clinical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid-Embase databases were searched up to 24th March 2021. We utilized the search strategy of medical subject headings combined with entry terms to search all related literatures. All studies identified with the electronic and manual searches were listed by citation, title, authors, and abstract. Only studies involving patients with COVID-19-related stroke were eligible. The references of included studies were also manually screened. RESULTS The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Ten articles, including 26,691 participants and 280 patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19, were selected. The pooled prevalence of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 was 2% (95% CI 1-2%; p < 0.01). The pooled proportions of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes in COVID-19-related ischemic stroke was 66% (95% CI 51-81%; p < 0.01), 48% (95% CI 19-76%; p < 0.01) and 40% (95% CI 29-51%; p < 0.01), respectively. Notably, the pooled proportions of female was 36% (95% CI 21-50%; p < 0.01) in patients with COVID-19 and stroke. In addition, in TOAST classification, cryptogenic stroke subtype was associated with a high trend, and its pooled proportion was 35% (95% CI 12-59%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Ischemic stroke caused by COVID-19 has its own unique clinical features. Although common high-risk factors can also be observed, its importance may have changed. The major inflammatory storm of COVID-19 is more likely to occur in male patients. The increase in the proportion of cryptogenic stroke has also made stroke related to COVID-19 complicated.","Luo, Wenzhang; Liu, Xiang; Bao, Kunyang; Huang, Changren",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10837-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652503/,689

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect and interaction of psychotic symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and attitudes concerning medication use with a three-month follow-up among methamphetamine-induced psychotic male patients. In this prospective, descriptive study, 42 male patients diagnosed with a methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder were selected on the last day of their admission period in Iran Psychiatry Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Each patient was evaluated using the Persian version of the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10), Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), as well as a sociodemographic questionnaire immediately, one month and three months after discharge. There was a significant difference in MPR between the first and third months. Moreover, the frequency of patients with a positive attitude toward their medications increased over time. Indeed, all participants stated a positive attitude at the last follow-up based on the DAI-10 cutoff. Based on our findings, medication adherence of male patients with methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder should be an essential aspect of treatment after discharge from psychiatry inpatient wards, more specifically, through the first months.","Asadi, Marzieh; Rashedi, Vahid; Khademoreza, Nooshin; Seddigh, Ruohollah; Keshavarz-Akhlaghi, Amir-Abbas; Ahmadkhaniha, Hamidreza; Rezvaniardestani, Seied-Mohamadhosein; Lotfi, Ali; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza",Journal of psychoactive drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2021.1883778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594958/,689
132076,Transvaginal extraction of the specimen after total laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis.,2008,"Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) help vertebrates maintain homeostasis during and following challenging events. Short-term elevations in GC levels are necessary for survival, whereas longer-term changes can lead to reduced reproductive output and immunosuppression. Persistent environmental contaminants (ECs) are widespread globally. Experimental exposure of individuals to ECs is associated with varying GC responses, within, and across, species and contaminants. Individuals exposed to ECs over long durations are expected to have prolonged GC elevations, which likely affect their health. We conducted a meta-analysis to test for a relationship between fish GC levels and experimental exposure to ECs, and to explore potential moderators, including duration of exposure, that could help explain the variation in effect sizes within and between studies. We report almost exclusively on cortisol responses of teleost fish to ECs. Although there was much variation in effect sizes, captive-bred fish exposed to ECs had baseline GC levels 1.5× higher than unexposed fish, and fish exposed to pharmaceuticals (estradiols and stimulants being mainly considered) had baseline GC levels approximately 2.5× higher than unexposed fish. We found that captive-bred and wild-caught fish did not differ in GC levels after exposure to the same classes of ECs - studies on captive bred fish may thus enable inferences about GC responses to ECs for wild species. Furthermore, effect sizes did not differ between baseline and challenge-induced GC measures. In different analyses, duration of exposure was negatively correlated to effect size, suggesting that the GC response may acclimate after chronic exposure to some ECs which could potentially alter the GC response of EC-exposed fish to novel stressors. Future studies should explore the effect of multiple stressors on the fish GC response and perform tests on a broader array of contaminant types and vertebrate classes.","Rohonczy, Jillian; O'Dwyer, Katie; Rochette, Alicia; Robinson, Stacey A; Forbes, Mark R",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399351/,689

A considerable knowledge gap exists for disentangling overlapping processes and driving conditions that control the fate of these pollutants. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the driving parameters for attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, tramadol and venlafaxine) under field conditions. The presented study was performed at a small river (Ammer River, mean discharge 0.87 m3 s-1) which is hydrologically complex due to karstification, numerous artificial discharges, and engineered modifications of the channel. We applied a Lagrangian sampling scheme at two sequential river reaches. In general, for the investigated compounds and over the length of the tested reaches, the absolute net attenuation representative for 24 h was low (≤ 23% net attenuation), yet calculated half-lives were comparable to literature. Photodegradation is specifically relevant for the first river reach characterized by a higher net attenuation of the photosensitive compound diclofenac (14.5% ±11.3%) compared to the second section (9.8% ±13.7%). This is likely due to a spatial difference in canopy shading, which is supported by significant correlations (R2 ≥ 0.8) of the temporally changing 'temperature' and 'solar radiation' with time-specific degradation rate constants of photosensitive compounds for consecutive hourly water parcels. In general, the presented spatially and temporally resolved approach is a suitable tool to determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants and to narrow down the interpretation of net attenuation to a few reasonable processes.","Glaser, Clarissa; Zarfl, Christiane; Werneburg, Martina; Böckmann, Matthias; Zwiener, Christian; Schwientek, Marc",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887017/,689

As part of ongoing work, AU$10000 was provided to the community to address important, self-determined, health priorities through the Can Get Health in Canterbury program. Program staff worked with community members to support the planning and implementation of two community-led events: a soccer (football) tournament and a picnic day. This paper explores the potential for this funding model and the effect of the project on both the community and health services. Data were qualitatively analysed using a range of data sources within the project. These included, attendance sheets, meeting minutes, qualitative field notes, staff reflections and transcripts of focus group and individual discussions. This analysis identified that the project: (1) enabled community empowerment and collective control over funding decisions relating to their health; (2) supported social connection among the Australian Rohingya community; (3) built capacity in the community welfare organisation -Burmese Rohingya Community Australia; and (4) enabled reflective practice and learnings.

140659,Comparison of postoperative pain between single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy: prospective case-control study.,2012,"BACKGROUND It is strongly recommended that adults aged 50-75 years be screened for colorectal cancer (CRC). Recommended screening options include colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, computed tomography colonography, guaiac fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), or the more recently introduced FIT-DNA (FIT in combination with a stool DNA test). CRC screening programs can benefit from knowledge of patterns of use by test type and within population subgroups. METHODS Using 2018 National Health Interview Survey data, we examined CRC screening test use for adults aged 50-75 years (N=10,595). We also examined time trends in CRC screening test use from 2010-2018. RESULTS In 2018, an estimated 66.9% of U.S. adults aged 50-75 years had a CRC screening test within recommended time intervals. However, the prevalence was less than 50% among those aged 50-54 years, those without a usual source of health care, those with no doctor visits in the past year, and those who were uninsured. The test types most commonly used within recommended time intervals were colonoscopy within 10 years (61.1%), FOBT or FIT in the past year (8.8%), and FIT-DNA within 3 years (2.7%). After age-standardization to the 2010 census population, the percentage up-to-date with CRC screening increased from 61.2% in 2015 to 65.3% in 2018, driven by increased use of stool testing, including FIT-DNA. CONCLUSIONS These results show some progress, driven by a modest increase in stool testing. However, CRC testing remains low in many population subgroups. IMPACT These results can inform efforts to achieve population CRC screening goals.","Shapiro, Jean A; Soman, Ashwini V; Berkowitz, Zahava; Fedewa, Stacey A; Sabatino, Susan A; de Moor, Janet S; Clarke, Tainya C; Doria-Rose, V Paul; Breslau, Erica S; Jamal, Ahmedin; Nadel, Marion R","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-1809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088751/,689

METHODS Over 21 months, 54 patients underwent robotic lobectomy for early-stage lung cancer at our institute. We used a da Vinci Robotic System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Mountain View, Calif) with three ports plus one utility incision to isolate hilum elements and perform vascular and bronchial resection using standard endoscopic staplers. Standard mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed subsequently. Surgical outcomes were compared with those in 54 patients who underwent open surgery over the same period and were matched to the robotic group using propensity scores for a series of preoperative variables. RESULTS Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 7 (13%) cases. Postoperative complications (11/54, 20%, in each group) and median number of lymph nodes removed (17.5 robotic vs 17 open) were similar in the 2 groups. Median robotic operating time decreased by 43 minutes (P = .02) from first tertile (18 patients) to the second-plus-third tertile (36 patients). Median postoperative hospitalization was significantly shorter after robotic (excluding first tertile) than after open operations (4.5 days vs 6 days; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS Robotic lobectomy with lymph node dissection is practicable, safe, and associated with shorter postoperative hospitalization than open surgery. From the number of lymph nodes removed it also appears oncologically acceptable for early lung cancer. Benefits in terms of postoperative pain, respiratory function, and quality of life still require evaluation. We expect that technologic developments will further simplify the robotic procedure.","Veronesi, Giulia; Galetta, Domenico; Maisonneuve, Patrick; Melfi, Franca; Schmid, Ralph Alexander; Borri, Alessandro; Vannucci, Fernando; Spaggiari, Lorenzo",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20038475/,689

To fight COVID-19, various traditional antiviral medicines have been prescribed in China to infected patients with mild to moderate symptoms and received unexpected success in controlling the disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these herbal medicines interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 have remained elusive. It is well known that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in maturation of many viral proteins such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the computationally determined top candidate, namely, rutin which is a key component in many traditional antiviral medicines such as Lianhuaqinwen and Shuanghuanlian, for inhibiting the viral target-Mpro. Using in silico methods (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we revealed the dynamics and energetics of rutin when interacting with the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the highly hydrophilic rutin molecule can be bound inside the Mpro's pocket (active site) and possibly inhibit its biological functions. In addition, we optimized the structure of rutin and designed two more hydrophobic analogs, M1 and M2, which satisfy the rule of five for western medicines and demonstrated that they (M2 in particular) possess much stronger binding affinities to the SARS-COV-2s Mpro than rutin, due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction as well as more hydrogen bonds. Therefore, our results provide invaluable insights into the mechanism of a ligand's binding inside the Mpro and shed light on future structure-based designs of high-potent inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Huynh, Tien; Wang, Haoran; Luan, Binquan",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp03867a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140777/,689

This study estimated the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants in sequencing databases of populations without known kidney disease. METHODS Predicted pathogenic variants were identified using filtering steps based on the ACMG/AMP criteria, which considered collagen IV α3-α5 position 1 Gly to be critical domains. The population frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants were then determined per mean number of sequenced alleles. Population frequencies for compound heterozygous and digenic combinations were calculated from the results for heterozygous variants. RESULTS COL4A3-COL4A5 variants resulting in position 1 Gly substitutions were confirmed to be associated with hematuria (for each, P<0.001). Predicted pathogenic COL4A5 variants were found in at least one in 2320 individuals. p.(Gly624Asp) represented nearly half (16 of 33, 48%) of the variants in Europeans. Most COL4A5 variants (54 of 59, 92%) had a biochemical feature that potentially mitigated the clinical effect. The predicted pathogenic heterozygous COL4A3 and COL4A4 variants affected one in 106 of the population, consistent with the finding of thin basement membrane nephropathy in normal donor kidney biopsy specimens. Predicted pathogenic compound heterozygous variants occurred in one in 88,866 individuals, and digenic variants in at least one in 44,793. CONCLUSIONS The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants, but must be adjusted for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions. Disease penetrance may depend on other genetic and environmental factors.","Gibson, Joel; Fieldhouse, Rachel; Chan, Melanie M Y; Sadeghi-Alavijeh, Omid; Burnett, Leslie; Izzi, Valerio; Persikov, Anton V; Gale, Daniel P; Storey, Helen; Savige, Judy",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020071065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400539/,689

ADT, however, may fail when PCa develops castration-resistance. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a critical enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis, is found to be upregulated in PCa. Since enzalutamide and ADT are frequently used for the treatment of PCa, this study aimed to unravel the underlying mechanism of combination of orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, and enzalutamide using PC3 cell line; and orlistat and castration in PC3 tumor-bearing animal model. Cytotoxicity was determined by AlamarBlue assay. Drug effects on the cell cycle and protein expressions were assayed by the flow cytometry and Western blot. Electromobility shift assay was used to evaluate the NF-κB activity. The tumor growth delay, expressions of the signaling-related proteins, and histopathology post treatments of orlistat and castration were evaluated in PC3 tumor-bearing mouse model. The results showed that orlistat arrested the PC3 cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of enzalutamide synergistically. Pretreatment with orlistat combined with castration inhibited the tumor growth significantly compared with those of castration and orlistat treatments alone in PC3 tumor-bearing mice. Combination treatment reduced both fatty acid synthase and NF-κB activities and their downstream effector proteins. The present study demonstrated the synergistic effects of orlistat combined with enzalutamide in vitro and castration in vivo on human prostate cancer.","Tyan, Yeu-Sheng; Lee, Yen-Po; Chuang, Hui-Yen; Wang, Wei-Hsun; Hwang, Jeng-Jong",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20204203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974005/,689

Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies had negative results in all patients. In all 3 patients who underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography, mild myopathic and neuropathic changes were seen.

Cost comparison of different surgical techniques.,2014,"PURPOSE To compare the safety of image-guided percutaneous cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective HIPAA-compliant study received institutional review board approval. Forty-two adult patients with cirrhosis underwent image-guided percutaneous ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma from 2003 to 2011. Twenty-five patients underwent 33 cryoablation procedures to treat 39 tumors, and 22 underwent 30 radiofrequency ablation procedures to treat 39 tumors. Five patients underwent both cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation procedures. Complication rates and severity per procedure were compared between the ablation groups. Potential confounding patient, procedure, and tumor-related variables were also compared. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon rank sum, and Fisher's exact tests. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS The overall complication rates, 13 (39.4%) of 33 cryoablation procedures versus eight (26.7%) of 30 radiofrequency ablation procedures and severe/fatal complication rates, two (6.1%) of 33 cryoablation procedures versus one (3.3%) of 30 radiofrequency ablation procedures, were not significantly different between the ablation groups (both P=0.26). Severe complications included pneumothoraces requiring chest tube insertion during two cryoablation procedures. One death occurred within 90 days of a radiofrequency ablation procedure; all other complications were managed successfully. CONCLUSION No significant difference was seen in the overall safety of image-guided percutaneous cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.","Dunne, Ruth M; Shyn, Paul B; Sung, Jeffrey C; Tatli, Servet; Morrison, Paul R; Catalano, Paul J; Silverman, Stuart G",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529593/,689
149094,A laparoscopic vagus-preserving Merendino procedure for early esophageal adenocarcinoma.,2010,". Care path for non-deferred elective hospitalizations in cardiology in the Covid-19 period. INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) has rapidly resulted in a global pandemic. Our hospital had to postpone all elective admissions to increase capacity for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a rearrangement of the elective admissions was necessary to guarantee a restart of ordinary procedures. AIM To describe the organizational model adopted for elective procedures during the Covid-19 pandemic, to guarantee maximum safety for patients and healthcare workers. METHODS Patients on waiting list for cardiac procedures were rearranged based on risks prioritization. Procedure of coronary angiography and cardiac devices (PM and ICD) implants or replacement took priority upon other cardiac procedures. Each patient underwent a telephone nurse triage to assess for any covid-19 symptoms. The hospital admissions were organized in accordance with health and safety measures declared by the National Institute of Health, with different paths according to the swab results. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were contacted and 40 accepted the hospital admission (26 refused it, for fear of infection or covid-19 related family problems). No patient resulted positive to the nasal swab. CONCLUSIONS In view of the impact on the health care system of this new pandemic, the choice of an appropriate pathway which can preserve patients' safety is essential, while guaranteeing the treatment of problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, with a high mortality rate.","Astegiano, Valentina; Condò, Carola; Sergi, Daniela; Busioc, Loredana; Bianco, Mara; Voronina, Lyudmila; Cossai, Franca; Puntil, Anna; Ban, Elisa Macario; Tognazzolo, Laura; Pelissero, Elisa; Senatore, Gaetano",Assistenza infermieristica e ricerca : AIR,https://doi.org/10.1702/3454.34428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077980/,689

Due to the spread of infection by SARS-CoV-2, many professionals have had to adapt their work to telerehabilitation practices, which require the best evidence at short notice and in summarized form. In this context, this protocol has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation as a care strategy in physical therapy for different conditions, populations, and contexts. Method and analysis An overview will be carried out in the format of a rapid review. It will include systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy. The outcomes considered will be clinical effectiveness depending on the specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. A search will be carried out of the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies will be selected in duplicate with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings will be reported qualitatively by tables and figures. Ethics and dissemination The principles of the value of the research question, the methodological rigor, scientifically qualified investigators, an independent evaluation of the protocol, and timely and accurate publication of the results will be complied with.

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Sixteen articles were finally included in the meta-analysis, and a random effects model was used. BMI was found to be higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild or moderate disease (MD 1.6, 95% CI, 0.8-2.4; p = .0002) in China; however, the heterogeneity was high (I2 = 75%). Elevated BMI was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use (MD 4.1, 95% CI, 2.1-6.1; p < .0001) in Western countries, and this result was consistent across studies (I2 = 0%). Additionally, there were increased odds ratios of IMV use (OR 2.0, 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; p < .0001) and hospitalization (OR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.3-1.60; p < .00001) in patients with obesity.

154538,Laparoscopic Appendectomy Is Safe: Influence of Appendectomy Technique on Surgical-site Infections and Intra-abdominal Abscesses.,2015,"An understanding of how broadly neutralizing activity develops in HIV-1-infected individuals is needed to guide vaccine design and immunization strategies. Here we used a large panel of 44 HIV-1 envelope variants (subtypes A, B, and C) to evaluate the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies in serum samples obtained 3 years after seroconversion from 40 women enrolled in the CAPRISA 002 acute infection cohort. Seven of 40 participants had serum antibodies that neutralized more than 40% of viruses tested and were considered to have neutralization breadth. Among the samples with breadth, CAP257 serum neutralized 82% (36/44 variants) of the panel, while CAP256 serum neutralized 77% (33/43 variants) of the panel. Analysis of longitudinal samples showed that breadth developed gradually starting from year 2, with the number of viruses neutralized as well as the antibody titer increasing over time. Interestingly, neutralization breadth peaked at 4 years postinfection, with no increase thereafter. The extent of cross-neutralizing activity correlated with CD4(+) T cell decline, viral load, and CD4(+) T cell count at 6 months postinfection but not at later time points, suggesting that early events set the stage for the development of breadth. However, in a multivariate analysis, CD4 decline was the major driver of this association, as viral load was not an independent predictor of breadth. Mapping of the epitopes targeted by cross-neutralizing antibodies revealed that in one individual these antibodies recognized the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), while in two other individuals, cross-neutralizing activity was adsorbed by monomeric gp120 and targeted epitopes that involved the N-linked glycan at position 332 in the C3 region. Serum antibodies from the other four participants targeted quaternary epitopes, at least 2 of which were PG9/16-like and depended on the N160 and/or L165 residue in the V2 region. These data indicate that fewer than 20% of HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals develop antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity after 3 years of infection and that these antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope, including as yet uncharacterized epitopes.","Gray, Elin S; Madiga, Maphuti C; Hermanus, Tandile; Moore, Penny L; Wibmer, Constantinos Kurt; Tumba, Nancy L; Werner, Lise; Mlisana, Koleka; Sibeko, Sengeziwe; Williamson, Carolyn; Abdool Karim, Salim S; Morris, Lynn",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00198-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21389135/,689

158296,"Lifestyle Intervention and Medical Management With vs Without Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Control of Hemoglobin A1c, LDL Cholesterol, and Systolic Blood Pressure at 5 Years in the Diabetes Surgery Study.",2018,"The decline of speech intelligibility in presbycusis can be regarded as resulting from the combined contribution of two main groups of factors: (1) audibility-related factors and (2) age-related factors. In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (n = 459, age = 42-92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.","Varnet, Léo; Léger, Agnès C; Boucher, Sophie; Bonnet, Crystel; Petit, Christine; Lorenzi, Christian",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732140/,689

New treatments have more recently become available. The aim of this paper is to examine the Crohn's disease patient population for whom anti-TNF treatments are not preferred and where new mechanisms of action should be considered. METHODS A representative sample of 100 Italian physicians with documented expertise with biological treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease were interviewed. A literature review on Crohn's disease treatment was also conducted to identify patient populations for whom anti-TNFs are unsuitable. RESULTS On the basis of the interviewed physicians, about 9% of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease patients were noneligible to anti-TNFα due to contraindication or possible risk of intolerance, while 11% had discontinued anti-TNFα treatment due to complications or intolerance/hypersensitivity. Patients with severe heart disease and at high risk of infections were more frequently considered unsuitable. The proportion of patients considered unsuitable among elderly patients and in those with recurrent infections, cancer, and other comorbidities ranged between 40 and 60%. CONCLUSIONS We provided additional quantitative and qualitative information to help identify patients who are less suitable to anti-TNF agents, who could benefit from newer biologic agents with different mechanisms of action.","Caprioli, Flavio; Daperno, Marco; Bravatà, Ivana; Brigido, Alessia; Frigerio, Daniela; Secchi, Ottavio; Rispo, Antonio",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213505/,689

This study examined the effect of MP versus SSA skills training on laparoscopic performance using surgically naive medical students. METHODS For the study, 40 medical students at the end of their first year were randomized into two groups. Both groups were trained in four basic laparoscopic drills (peg, rope, bean drop, pattern cutting) using a standard MP setup (group 1) and an SSA approach (group 2). The time and number of repetitions required to attain proficiency were recorded. Each group then crossed over to the alternate approach and repeated the sequence. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed, unpaired t test. RESULTS The total times required to attain proficiency for the SSA and MP approaches were not significantly different between the MP-trained group (234.0 ± 114.9 min) and the SSA-trained group (216.4 ± 106.5 min) (p = 0.67). The MP-trained group required less time to reach proficiency on the standard MP setup than the group using the SSA approach (119.1 ± 69.7 vs. 178.0 ± 93.4 min; p = 0.058) and significantly fewer repetitions (77.6 ± 42.6 vs. 118.8 ± 54.3; p = 0.027). The SSA-trained group required significantly less time to reach proficiency on the MP setup than the standard MP-trained group (38.4 ± 29.4 vs. 119.1 ± 69.7 min; p = 0.0013) and needed only a mean of 26.9 repetitions. When the standard MP trainees crossed over to the SSA setup, they required significantly less time to reach proficiency with the SSA approach than the SSA-trained group (114.8 ± 50.5 vs. 178.0 ± 93.4 min; p = 0.026) but required more repetitions than with the MP approach (86.2 ± 35.2 vs. 77.6 ± 42.6; nonsignificant difference). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic SSA skills training results in longer times and more repetitions to achieve proficiency than MP training, but the skills acquired transfer well to the MP approach.","Cox, Daniel R; Zeng, Wenjing; Frisella, Margaret M; Brunt, L Michael",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1349-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872019/,689

160193,Trends in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery® (FLS) certification exam over the past 9 years.,2018,"Background Beforehand transection and suturing (BTS) of the dorsal vascular complex (DVC), a novel technique in non-neurovascular bundle sparing (NVB-sparing) extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (eLRP), had been proposed; this study aimed to evaluate this technique in clinical laparoscopic procedures. Methods Using this new technique, the DVC was transected and sutured after dissection of the pelvic fascia and before dissection of the prostate, especially before ligation of the bilateral prostatic pedicles. This study retrospectively analyzed the data of 90 non NVB-sparing eLRP patients [traditional technique (n=60) and BTS technique (n=30)]. Results The surgical time in the BTS technique group was 121.73±24.53 min, which was significantly shorter (P=0.0015) than the traditional technique group (144.12±39.68 min). The calculated blood loss in the traditional technique group was 388.45±232.78 mL, and 264.16±130.70 mL in the BTS technique group (P=0.0016). The estimated blood loss in the traditional technique group was 350.34±311.80 mL, which was significantly greater than the BTS technique group (250.33±145.31 mL, P=0.0422). The transfusion rate in the traditional technique group was significantly greater than the BTS technique group (15.00% vs. 0.00%; P=0.0266). The biochemical recurrence rate in traditional technique group was 48.33%, which was higher than in the BTS group (30.00%) (P=0.0465). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the pre-operative hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, pre-operative hematocrit (HCT), post-operative Hb concentration, post-operative HCT, ΔHCT, pre-operative blood volume, rectal perforation, open conversion, apical capsule residue, false suture, post-operative bleeding, urinary leakage, re-operation, surgical site infection, post-operative stay, and emission time of urinary incontinence. Conclusions In managing the relationship between the DVC and prostate in patients undergoing non NVB-sparing eLRP, the BTS technique was shown to be more effective and safer than the traditional technique.","Pan, Jun-Wei; Jin, Xing-Wei; Luo, Fang-Xiu; Jin, Wei; Tu, Wei-Chao; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Xian-Jin; Huang, Bao-Xing; Xu, Da; Lu, Guo-Liang; Zhao, Yang; Shao, Yuan",Gland surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/gs-20-813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447562/,689
160290,Laparoscopic splenectomy is a safe method in cases of extremely large spleens.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging can provide in vivo assessment of the microvasculature in intracranial tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging derived vascular permeability parameters, including the volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma, for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty glioblastomas and 11 primary central nervous system lymphomas were included. Pretreatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with a 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Perfusion parameters (volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant) were measured on the basis of the Tofts-Kernmode model. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to compare those parameters between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma. Histopathologic correlation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging findings was performed by using reticulin staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Median volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values were significantly higher in primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.145 ± 0.057 and 0.396 ± 0.088) than in glioblastoma (0.064 ± 0.021 and 0.230 ± 0.058) (P < .001, respectively). Median volume of extravascular extracellular space values did not differ significantly between primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.434 ± 0.165) and glioblastoma (0.319 ± 0.107). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, volume transfer constant had the best discriminative value for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma (threshold, 0.093; sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 95.0%). Histopathologic evaluation revealed intact vascular integrity in glioblastoma despite endothelial proliferation, whereas primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated destroyed vessel architecture, thereby promoting vascular disintegrity. CONCLUSIONS Primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated significantly higher volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values compared with glioblastoma, implying a higher vascular permeability in primary central nervous system lymphoma. These findings confirm initial observations from perfusion CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies, correlating with underlying histopathologic features, and may be useful in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma.","Kickingereder, P; Sahm, F; Wiestler, B; Roethke, M; Heiland, S; Schlemmer, H-P; Wick, W; von Deimling, A; Bendszus, M; Radbruch, A",AJNR.

183827,Prolonged survival of a cat diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis by immunohistochemistry.,2015,Lyme Disease presents unique challenges for public health efforts. We hypothesized that transfer of protective antibodies between mothers and offspring should occur after oral vaccination of C3H-HeN mice with E. coli overexpressing OspA. We present new evidence for maternal transfer of vaccine induced neutralizing anti-OspA IgG antibodies to mouse pups through ingestion of colostrum. Protective levels of OspA antibodies in pups were present from 2-5 weeks after birth and they persisted in some mice until 9 weeks of age. This was corroborated by detection of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of all pups at 2-3 weeks after birth and in some mice at 9 weeks of age. A clear association was found between robust antibody responses in mothers and the length of antibody persistence in the respective pups using a novel longitudinal Bayesian model.

184194,Self-gripping Covidien™ ProGrip™ mesh versus polypropylene mesh in open inguinal hernia repair: multicenter short term results.,2013,"In the earlier phase of the pandemic situation, the governments of Bangladesh badly suffered to adhere their people to preventive measures probably due to less knowledge and attitude towards covid-19. To tackle the second wave of coronavirus, the governments again enforced an array of preventive measures, but still encountering the same problem after a year of the pandemic situation. In an attempt to find out the reasons behind this, our study aimed to assess the present knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear level of the people. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 15th to 25th April 2021. A total of 402 participants met all the inclusion criteria and were considered for performing all statistical analyses (Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Multiple logistic regression, Spearman rank-order correlation). Out of 402 participants, more than 90% participants were students and all were adults aged 16 to 30. 84.6%, 65.7%, 54%, and 21.6% participants had more adequate knowledge, more positive attitude, more frequent practice, and moderate to high fear towards covid-19, respectively. Knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear were interrelated directly or indirectly. It was found knowledgeable participants were more likely to have more positive attitude (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.14-3.95, P < 0.05) and very less fear (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.02-3.82, P < 0.05). More positive attitude was found as a good predictor of more frequent practice (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.66-7.04, P < 0.001), and very less fear had same negative impact on both attitude (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.25-0.91, P < 0.05) and practice (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27-0.85, P < 0.05). Our findings reflect that knowledge level has elevated but attitude level subsided, and practice level stayed same as was in the earlier phase of pandemic and people are no longer panicked.","Rupok, T.

Our analysis of data on COVID-19-related mortality in Spain, Italy, and Sweden has shown that, in the range of 30 to 90 years of age, each dependency of the logarithm of mortality upon age is linear, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to those related to the total mortality in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the stage and place of epidemic, mortality doubling time in this age range is close to 7,5 years. The rates of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and of being diagnosed due to the symptomatic manifestations of the infection are dependent on age to a far lesser degree. With account for these observations, three messages are put forth: 1) Older persons are the principal victims of both SARS-CoV-2 and measures undertaken to control its spread; 2) Older persons are not the principal driving force of SARS-CoV-2 spread; 3) Older persons can and should be engaged in combating the pandemic and its consequences; however, not via selective social distancing and other discriminative measures. People aged over 65 years constitute a significant part of the current population. They have specific interests and needs, which deserve no less respect than those of any other age group. This includes the right for the quality of life that remains sustained under the emergency conditions. Since the prospects for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 are dubious, those in charge of decisions concerning «people aged above 65» should mind that currently, unlike in the medieval ages, 65+ is the individual future of almost everyone.","Golubev, A G; Sidorenko, A V",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593259/,689
187430,An outbreak of diarrhea in piglets caused by a coronavirus antigenically distinct from transmissible gastroenteritis virus.,1985,"BACKGROUND Severe infections caused by the novel coronavirus 2 display similarities to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). However, HLH is a rare disease and has not been well described in critically ill patients. METHODS We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest all-payer inpatient care database publicly available in the United States to identify all adult discharges with Hemophagocytic syndrome (ICD-9 CM code 288.4) between 2007 and 2015. Critical illness was considered present if patient had either ICD-9 CM code indicating the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation or the presence of shock. We used ICD-9-CM codes to identify various infections (inf-HLH), malignancies (mal-HLH) and autoimmune diseases associated with HLH (MAS-HLH) and classified them in their respective groups. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. We developed multivariable regression model to examine variables associated with mortality in critically ill HLH patients. P value was kept at < 0.05. RESULTS Of the 7420 (95% CI 6959-7881) estimated discharges with HLH, 2313 (31%) were critically ill. Of the critically ill patients, 442 (34%) were mal-HLH, 422 (43.3%) were inf-HLH, 403 (30.7%) were MAS-HLH and 1046 (27.3%) were unable to be classified. In hospital mortality rates were 6.4% in non-critically ill and 48.4% in critically ill patients. Among the subtypes of HLH, in-hospital mortality was 53% in mal-HLH, 49.4% in inf-HLH, 26% in MAS-HLH and 54.6% in unclassified group. On multivariable regression analysis, development of acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.29-3.3, P=0.002) and acute hepatic failure (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52, P=0.001) were significantly associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION Inpatient mortality of critically ill patients is remarkably high. Patients with MAS-HLH had better outcomes when compared to other groups of HLH.","Kumar, Gagan; Hererra, Martin; Patel, Dhaval; Nanchal, Rahul; Guddati, Achuta K",American journal of blood research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489441/,689

MATERIAL AND METHODS The document is based on the scarce evidence on SARS/Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in handling COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Catalonia, Madrid and the Valencian Community. RESULTS The authors defined different priorities for the different clinical situations in PC. Emergency/urgency (life-threatening or urgent even in normal situation), highpriority/elective urgency (potentially dangerous if postponed for more than 1 month), intermediate/electivepriority (it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), low priority/delayed (can be postponed more than 6 months). According to this classification, the working panel agreed on the distribution of the different diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up scenarios for PC. The risk of severe morbidity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may out weigh the risk of PC morbidity/mortalityin many men; therefore, in the short term it is unlikely that delays in diagnosis or treatment can led to worse cancer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a challenge for our health system, which raises several considerations in the treatment of patients with PC. The redistribution of surgical procedures according to the degrees of priority is essential during the period of the pandemic and the transition to the new normality. The change of the out-clinics with the adequate security measures for healthcare practitioners and patients, andt he development of a telemedicine program is highly recommended.","Gómez Rivas, Juan; Domínguez, Mario; Gaya, Josep M; Ramírez-Backhaus, Miguel; Puche-Sanz, Ignacio; de Luna, Francisco; Juárez, Álvaro",Archivos espanoles de urologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538806/,689

On the basis of the complex epizootological, clinical and laboratory examination in four large calf-rearing facilities, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, the infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus and the bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus, and in some cases also the enteropathogenic E. coli, were found to be etiologically involved in the mass rise of diarrhoea, complicated by respiratory symptoms already during the first days after birth. The clinical picture of the disease, therapeutically difficult and reminding of ""pneumoenteritis"", has often been observed in stocks where, in addition to rotaviruses and coronaviruses in the faeces, the IBR or BVD viruses (sometimes both at the same time) were detected and identified in the respiratory and enteral tract. The serological examination of a higher number of animals in the stocks of calves under study confirmed the considerable rate of spreading of all the four viruses in the cattle population and, at the same time, demonstrated the very unfavourable immunological profile of the herds. The high percentage of animals low in antibody titres and the serologically negative animals constitute the infection-sensitive part of population in the affected herds. With the high culling rate and with the open herd turnover it is impossible to reach the required immunity through natural disinfection. Loss-free rearing of healthy calves will be achieved on the basis of a well-oriented vaccination programme with a good combination of inoculants.","Mensík, J; Pospísil, Z; Psikal, I; Valícek, L; Stĕpánek, J; Toman, I",Veterinarni medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3094227/,689

191875,Small intestinal strangulation caused by a mesodiverticular band and diverticulum on the mesenteric border of the small intestine in a horse.,2011,"Vacuolar degeneration was constantly induced in the CNS of 4-week-old ICR mice by intracerebral or intranasal inoculation of JHM-CC virus, a small plaque mutant of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM). Most animals showed no symptoms or only mild hindlimb paresis. Irrespective of clinical manifestations, the virus was isolated from the CNS up to days 14 to 16. Viral antigen expression in the CNS tissue was most extensive around days 5 to 7 and became undetectable on day 14. Viral antigens were localized almost exclusively to neurons, and the temporal sequence of viral antigen distribution after intranasal inoculation clearly indicated the virus spread through the olfactory and limbic systems into the brainstem and spinal cord, and possible cell-to cell transmission of the virus within the CNS. Vacuolar changes, most conspicuous in the brainstem and spinal cord, were steadily progressive up to 4 weeks after infection, but became indistinct by 4 months. Although the distribution of vacuolar lesions largely agreed with that of viral antigen-positive cells, the severity of vacuolation did not correlate with that of inflammation. Intramyelinic splitting, periaxonal edema, and swollen neurites were major ultrastructural substrates for vacuolar changes. This model could provide a better understanding of new types of neurologic disorders associated with viral infections, including vacuolar myelopathy in AIDS.","Tsukamoto, T; Hirano, N; Iwasaki, Y; Haga, S; Terunuma, H; Yamamoto, T",Neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2161091/,689
192074,Prospective randomized comparison of open versus laparoscopic management of splenic artery aneurysms: a 10-year study.,2012,"Background Probiotics are among the most commonly used dietary supplements and evidence of their efficacy is increasing. Despite the long historical use of probiotics, some experts suggest that additional research is necessary to understand their potential risks. Objectives Main aims of this study were to assess short-term tolerability and safety of a new, high colony-forming unit count, multi-strain probiotic supplement. Exploratory objectives included evaluating effects on gut microbial composition. Methods Ten healthy adults were enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. Over a 10-day period, participants consumed a once daily probiotic capsule (2.1 x 1011 CFU) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04, and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019. The primary measure of tolerability pertained to whether or not participants completed the study. Secondary safety measures included clinical biomarkers from a routine metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Exploratory measures included stool microbiota counts. Results All participants completed the study and there were no serious adverse events. All documented adverse events were prompted by the investigators and the most commonly reported symptoms were gastrointestinal. There was a single instance of a biomarker abnormality in one individual. Overall, decreases in total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase, and increases in stool levels of Lactobacillus species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Akkermansia muciniphila (P < .05) were observed over the course of the study. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest the multi-strain probiotic supplement was well-tolerated and most likely safe. Changes in liver function measures suggest the probiotics could potentially impact liver health. Stool microbiota changes suggest the probiotic could potentially impact gut health by affecting levels of intestinal microbiota that have been described as bioindicators of health and potential keystone species. However, additional research is necessary to follow up on the exploratory findings of this preliminary work.","Ryan, Jennifer Joan; Patno, Noelle M",Integrative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393673/,689
193140,Coronavirus-associated diarrhea (winter dysentery) in adult cattle.,1989,"Tobacco use is one of the major preventable causes of premature death and disease in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes approximately 5 million deaths per year to tobacco use, a number expected to exceed 8 million per year by 2030. In 1999, the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) was initiated by WHO, CDC, and the Canadian Public Health Association to monitor tobacco use, attitudes about tobacco use, and exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) among students aged 13-15 years. Since 1999, the survey has been completed by approximately 2 million students in 151 countries. A key goal of GYTS is for countries to repeat the survey every 4 years. This report summarizes results from GYTS conducted in Sri Lanka in 1999, 2003, and 2007. The findings indicated that during 1999-2007, the percentage of students aged 13-15 years who reported current cigarette smoking decreased, from 4.0% in 1999 to 1.2% in 2007. During this period, the percentage of never smokers in this age group likely to initiate smoking also decreased, from 5.1% in 1999 to 3.7% in 2007. Future declines in tobacco use in Sri Lanka will be enhanced through development and implementation of new tobacco-control measures and strengthening of existing measures that encourage smokers to quit, eliminate exposure to SHS, and encourage persons not to initiate tobacco use.",,MMWR.

The ZX10 MAb recognized a discontinuous epitope of the NTPase/helicase domain, of which the linear sequence GEIPFYGKAIPL at residues 1371 to 1382 constitutes one part. cDNAs from variable regions coding for the heavy and light chains were cloned, sequenced, and assembled into the NS3-ScFv, which was inserted into procaryotic and eucaryotic expression vectors. Escherichia coli-expressed NS3-ScFv inhibited the binding of the ZX10 MAb to NS3, confirming a retained specificity. However, the ability to bind the peptide 1371-1382 had been lost. In vitro-translated NS3-ScFv and HCV NS3/NS4A were coprecipitated by antibodies to HCV NS4A, confirming the in vitro activity of the NS3 ScFv.

It was reported by some that Chinese herbs played an important role in the treatment of SARS patients. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the possible effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for SARS patients. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the following electronic databases for reports of randomised controlled trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to September 2005); EMBASE (1990 to December 2004); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (lssue 2, 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for diagnosed SARS patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data from each trial. We extracted dichotomous and continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous data, relative risk (RR) was used. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model if heterogeneity existed between studies. If no heterogeneity was detected between the studies, we used the fixed effects model. Using the Z score and the chi square statistic with significance being set at p < 0.05 tested heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We finally included twelve randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized controlled trial. A total of 654 SARS patients and 12 Chinese herbs were identified. We did not find Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines decreased morbidity versus Western medicines alone. Two herbs may improve symptoms. Five herbs may improve lung infiltrate absorption. Four herbs may decrease the dosage of corticosteroids. Three herbs may improve the quality of life of SARS patients. One herb may shorten the length of stay in hospital. Only two trials reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines made no difference in decreasing morbidity versus Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life, and lung infiltrate absorption and decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials. Long-term of follow up of these included trials is needed.","Liu, X; Zhang, M; He, L; Li, Y P; Kang, Y K",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437501/,689

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of different point-of-entry screening strategies in achieving a reduction in imported COVID-19 transmission. METHODS A rapid evidence review was conducted, systematically searching PubMed and Google Scholar and grey literature on 27 March 2020. RESULTS We screened 1 194 records. Nine potential full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and included. Three articles investigated the effectiveness of entry-based thermal and body temperature scanning. Entry-based infrared thermal or body temperature scanning for COVID-19 was unlikely to be effective. Two systematic reviews found no additional benefit of travel restrictions/screening. In a COVID-19 modelling study, airport screening was not effective, with exit and entry thermal scanning identifying half and missing almost half of infected travellers. Two other modelling studies found that entry-based travel screening would achieve only modest delays in community transmission, while international travel quarantine could reduce case importations by 80%. CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support entry and exit screening at points of entry, as these strategies detect just over half of the infected cases, missing almost half at entry points. The benefits of airport screening therefore need to be context specific and weighed against the resources and cost of implementation, the contribution of imported cases to total cases, and the benefits of identifying 50% of cases in the South African context with the country's high HIV and tuberculosis prevalence and limited resources to deal with a pandemic of this nature.","Chetty, T; Daniels, B B; Ngandu, N K; Goga, A",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403987/,689

METHODS Data from legal communicable diseases surveillance reporting system was analyzed epidemiologically. RESULTS The first SARS case was reported in Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region on March 27, 2003. Up to May 20, there were 446 cumulative SARS cases in the whole region (with 287 confirmed cases and 159 suspected cases) and 61 cumulative recovered cases had been discharged from the hospitals (56 confirmed cases and 5 suspected cases). Another 131 cases were excluded the original diagnoses of SARS including 10 confirmed cases and 121 suspected cases. 25 confirmed cases died with a mortality rate of 8.7%. Cumulatively, the number of reported cases were distributed in 30 counties in 9 prefectures. Statistical analysis on time sequence of the occurrence of cases showed that majority (67.7% of the total) of the cases concentrated in between April 13 and April 29. The number of cases had started to decrease since April 24 with an average of 5.3 cases per day between May 3 and May 8 and an average of 0.3 cases per day between May 9 and today. CONCLUSIONS SARS epidemics in our region could be divided into three phases. The first phase fell in between March 18 and April 15 with the first case being imported, the number of cases rose sharply, covering 14 counties in 6 prefectures, having a feature of family clustering. The second phase was from April 16 to April 28, with the appearance of secondary infection, having sharp rise of the cases and spreading to 24 counties in 10 prefectures. One of the major features was that hospitals had become the important sources of secondary infection. Finally, the third phase was between April 29 and May 20, with small wave crests of cases, spreading to 38 counties in 10 prefectures with a high proportion of cases with no history of direct contact with diagnosed SARS patients. Thus, no obvious transmission chain was noticed at this phase.","Tao, Bo; Zhang, Bin; Zhi, Qiang; Ren, Li-min; Li, Xin; Li, Chun-ying; Zhang, Shao-zhuo; Wu, Bing-ren",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848909/,689
197671,Viruses and virus-like particles detected during examination of feces from calves and piglets with diarrhea.,1989,"BACKGROUND Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a newly discovered paramyxovirus, has been associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). However, the prevalence and molecular characteristics of HMPV in China are still unclear. METHODS A total of 661 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) specimens were collected from 661 children with ARTIs between December 2006 and November 2008. Specimens were screened for HMPV by reverse transcription-polymerase reaction. All positive amplification products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS HMPV was detected in 45 patients (6.80%) of the 661 children. The HMPV-infected patients were from 29 days to 9 years of age. A high incidence of HMPV infection (84.4%) was observed during the winter-spring season. Of the 45 HMPV-positive patients, 25 (55.6%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common additional respiratory virus. The most common clinical diagnosis was bronchopneumonia (57.8%) and cough (88.9%) was the most common clinical symptom. Phylogenetic analysis of the F gene revealed that 80% of the HMPV detected were A2, 2.2% were A1, and 17.8% were B1. Statistical analyses showed that sex, ages, seasons, and severity of the disease did not correlate with HMPV genotype (P = 0.986, 0.347, 0.660, 0.252), but viral coinfection with HMPV increased hospitalization rates (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS HMPV was frequently detected in the pediatric patients with ARTI in China. RSV was the most common coinfection virus and coinfection increased hospitalization rates. All HMPV subgroups except B2 cocirculated and there was no association found between HMPV genotypes and severity of disease.","Xiao, Ni-guang; Xie, Zhi-ping; Zhang, Bing; Yuan, Xin-hui; Song, Jing-rong; Gao, Han-chun; Zhang, Rong-fang; Hou, Yun-de; Duan, Zhao-jun",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20135829/,689

Basic demographic data, underlying medical conditions, clinical signs and symptoms, duration of the disease before the admission, laboratory tests, radiographic findings, treatment, and the final outcome (survived, died) were all noted. Factors associated with severe disease requiring ICU admission were determined by comparing the ICU cases with control groups of the patients admitted to the hospital but not to ICU. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 32.72 years. A total of 114 (38.9%) of the patients had an underlying medical condition. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were present in 44 (15.01%) of the patients, chronic cardiovascular diseases in 28 (9.56%), diabetes mellitus in 16 (5.46%), malignity in 15 (4.44%) of the patients and 11 (3.75%) of the patients were pregnant. Fever was registered in 282 (96.24%), myalgias in 119 (40.61%), headache in 48 (16.38%), cough in 240 (81.91%), sore throat in 25 (8.53%), runny nose and sneezing in 17 (5.8%) and dyspnea in 110 (37.54%) of the patients. A total of 192 (65.53%) had radiological findings that were consistent with pneumonia. A total of 154 (56.61%) of the patients received antiviral therapy within 48 h. A total of 280 (96.24%) patients were discharged and 13 (4.44%) were transferred to ICU. Fatal outcome was noticed in 2/13 (15.3%) ICU treated patients and 11/13 (84.7%) patients survived. The median time from the onset of illness to the initiation of antiviral treatment was 7.1 days for the patients admitted to ICU and 3.2 days for non-ICU patients (p < 0.05). Low blood oxygen saturation (SaO2 < or = 92%) was more common in ICU admitted patients, 10/13 (76,92%), compared to 28/280 (10%) non-ICU admitted ones (p < 0.01). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels > 200 mg/L were noticed in 9/13 (69.23%) patients admitted to ICU and 85/280 (30.35%) patients who were not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Most novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infections presented mild respiratory disease. Prompt antiviral therapy in patients with A (H1N1) virus infection seem to be the best approach to avoid serious form of the disease. Special attention should be payed to patients having low level of peripheral oxygen saturation and raised CRP serum level.","Canak, Grozdana; Kovacević, Nadica; Vukadinov, Jovan; Turkulov, Vesna; Sević, Sinisa; Doder, Radoslava; Somborac, Stevan; Potkonjak, Aleksandar",Vojnosanitetski pregled,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607182/,689

360531,Feasibility and Efficacy of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy As a Revisional Procedure After Failed Gastric Plication in Morbidly Obese Patients,2020,"While an FDA approved drug Ivermectin was reported to dramatically reduce the cell line of SARS-CoV-2 by â¼5000 folds within 48 h, the precise mechanism of action and the COVID-19 molecular target involved in interaction with this in-vitro effective drug are unknown yet. Among 12 different COVID-19 targets along with Importin-&#945; studied here, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with RNA and Helicase NCB site show the strongest affinity to Ivermectin amounting -10.4 kcal/mol and -9.6 kcal/mol, respectively, followed by Importin-&#945; with -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics of corresponding protein-drug complexes reveals that the drug bound state of RdRp with RNA has better structural stability than the Helicase NCB site and Importin-&#945;, with MM/PBSA free energy of -187.3 kJ/mol, almost twice that of Helicase (-94.6 kJ/mol) and even lower than that of Importin-&#945; (-156.7 kJ/mol). The selectivity of Ivermectin to RdRp is triggered by a cooperative interaction of RNA-RdRp by ternary complex formation. Identification of the target and its interaction profile with Ivermectin can lead to more powerful drug designs for COVID-19 and experimental exploration.","Sen Gupta, Parth Sarthi; Biswal, Satyaranjan; Panda, Saroj Kumar; Ray, Abhik Kumar; Rana, Malay Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,689

Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n. and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376 and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.","Shi, Yuejun; Shuai, Lei; Wen, Zhiyuan; Wang, Chong; Yan, Yuanyuan; Jiao, Zhe; Guo, Fenglin; Fu, Zhen F; Chen, Huanchun; Bu, Zhigao; Peng, Guiqing",Emerg Microbes Infect,,689
392950,Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis Due to Coronavirus in a Post Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Patient: a Case Report,2021,"BACKGROUND: Widespread access to the internet has boosted the emergence of online hospitals. A new outpatient service called ""internet hospital plus drug delivery"" (IHDD) has been developed in China, but little is known about this platform. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics, acceptance, and initial impact of IHDD during the outbreak of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in South China. METHODS: The total number of and detailed information on online prescriptions during the first 2 months after work resumption were obtained. Patients' gender, age, residence, associated prescription department, time of prescription, payment, and drug delivery region were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1380 prescriptions were picked up or delivered between March 2 and April 20, 2020. The largest group of patients were 36-59 years old (n=680, 49.3%), followed by the 18-35 years age category (n=573, 41.5%). In total, 39.4% (n=544) of the patients chose to get their medicine by self-pickup, while 60.6% (n=836) preferred to receive their medicine via drug delivery service. The top five online prescription departments were infectious diseases (n=572, 41.4%), nephrology (n=264, 19.1%), endocrinology (n=145, 10.5%), angiocardiopathy (n=107, 7.8%), and neurology (n=42, 3%). Of the 836 delivered prescriptions, 440 (52.6%) were sent to Guangdong Province (including 363 [43.4%] to Shenzhen), and 396 (47.4%) were sent to other provinces in China. CONCLUSIONS: The IHDD platform is efficient and convenient for various types of patients during the COVID-19 crisis. Although offline visits are essential for patients with severe conditions, IHDD can help to relieve pressure on hospitals by reducing an influx of patients with mild symptoms. Further efforts need to be made to improve the quality and acceptance of IHDD, as well as to regulate and standardize the management of this novel service.","Ding, Liang; She, Qiuru; Chen, Fengxian; Chen, Zitong; Jiang, Meifang; Huang, Huasi; Li, Yujin; Liao, Chaofeng",J Med Internet Res,,689

460386,Breites Arsenal zur Pandemie-Bekämpfung,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mental health competence (MHC) involves psychosocial capabilities such as regulating emotions, interacting well with peers and caring for others, and predicts a range of health and social outcomes. This study examines the course of MHC from childhood to adolescence and patterning by gender and disadvantage, in Australian and UK contexts. METHODS: Data: Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n=4983) and the Millennium Cohort Study (n=18 296). Measures: A measure capturing key aspects of MHC was derived summing items from the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, assessed at 4-5 years, 6-7 years, 10-11 years and 14-15 years. Analysis: Proportions of children with high MHC (scores &#8805;23 of range 8-24) were estimated by age and country. Random-effects models were used to define MHC trajectories according to baseline MHC and change over time. Sociodemographic patterns were described. RESULTS: The prevalence of high MHC steadily increased from 4 years to 15 years (from 13.6% to 15.8% and 20.6% to 26.2% in Australia and the UK, respectively). Examination of trajectories revealed that pathways of some children diverge from this normative MHC progression. For example, 7% and 9% of children in Australia and the UK, respectively, had a low starting point and decreased further in MHC by mid-adolescence. At all ages, and over time, MHC was lower for boys compared with girls and for children from disadvantaged compared with advantaged family backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: Approaches to promoting MHC require a sustained focus from the early years through to adolescence, with more intensive approaches likely needed to support disadvantaged groups and boys.","O039,; Connor, Meredith; Arnup, Sarah J; Mensah, Fiona; Olsson, Craig; Goldfeld, Sharon; Viner, Russell M; Hope, Steven",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,689
647581,Dysphagia in cervical spinal cord injury: How international literature trends can guide South African practice patterns – A scoping review,2021-05-10,"Cases of pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the time to onset and hospital stay have rarely been studied. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with these complications are described to determine the time to onset, associated comorbidities, and location and duration of pneumothorax. A search in PubMed yielded simple frequencies and a bivariate analysis of deaths. There were 113 confirmed cases in 67 articles. The median time from the date of hospital admission to the presence of pneumothorax was 8 days. Right hemithorax was the most frequent form of pneumothorax. Almost half of the patients required intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. Although the frequency of this phenomenon was not high among hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, it was high among those who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study contributes to the literature because it presents a large number of patients who developed pneumothorax after admission, which was characterized by clinical deterioration (dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema) and low oxygen saturation levels. Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum is recommended as a differential diagnosis, even without considering the presence of chronic pulmonary comorbidities or invasive mechanical ventilation.","Cabrera Gaytán, David Alejandro; Pérez Andrade, Yadira; Espíritu Valenzo, Yuridia",Respir Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007121001520?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336592/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007121001520,689
