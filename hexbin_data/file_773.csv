32514,Multiple drugs: Various toxicities: 18 case reports,2020-03-28,"Osteonecrosis, which is typically induced by trauma, glucocorticoid abuse, or alcoholism, is one of the most severe diseases in clinical orthopedics. Osteonecrosis often leads to joint destruction, and arthroplasty is eventually required. Enhancement of bone regeneration is a critical management strategy employed in osteonecrosis therapy. Bone tissue engineering based on engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with appropriate architecture and osteoconductive activity, alone or functionalized with bioactive factors, have been developed to enhance bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. In this review, we elaborate on the ideal properties of 3D scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis, including biocompatibility, degradability, porosity, and mechanical performance. In addition, we summarize the development of 3D scaffolds alone or functionalized with bioactive factors for accelerating bone regeneration in osteonecrosis and discuss their prospects for translation to clinical practice.","Zhu, Tongtong; Cui, Yutao; Zhang, Mingran; Zhao, Duoyi; Liu, Guangyao; Ding, Jianxun",Bioact Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7210379/,773
32535,"Ganciclovir/letermovir: Rebound Cytomegalovirus hepatitis, acquired resistance to ganciclovir and nephrotoxicity: case report",2020-04-11,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated causes of fever in the primary levels of care in Southeast Asia, and evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) could distinguish bacterial from viral pathogens. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were taken from children and adults with fever (>37.5˚C) or history of fever (<14 days) in Thailand and Myanmar. RESULTS: Of 773 patients with at least one blood or nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected, 227 (29.4%) had a target organism detected. Influenza virus type A was detected in 85/227 cases (37.5%), followed by dengue virus (30 cases, 13.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (24 cases, 10.6%) and Leptospira spp. (9 cases, 4.0%). Clinical outcome was similar between patients with a bacterial or a viral organism, regardless of antibiotic prescription. CRP was higher among patients with a bacterial organism compared to those with a viral organism (median 18 mg/L, interquartile range [10-49] versus 10 mg/L [≤8-22], p-value 0.003), with an area under the curve of 0.65, 95% confidence interval (0.55-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Serious bacterial infections requiring antibiotics are exceptions rather than the rule in the first lines of care. CRP-testing could assist in ruling out such cases in settings where diagnostic uncertainty is high and routine antibiotic prescription is common. The original CRP randomised-controlled trial (RCT) was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02758821.","Althaus, T.; Thaipadungpanit, J.; Greer, R.C; Swe, M.M.M; Dittrich, S.; Peerawaranun, P.; Smit, P.W; Wangrangsimakul, T.; Blacksell, S.; Winchell, J.M.; Diaz, M.H.; Day, N.P.J; Smithuis, F.; Turner, P.; Lubell, Y.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211754/,773

33280,Lopinavir: Various toxicities: 4 case reports,2020-05-30,"In a Stackelberg pricing problem a distinguished player, the leader, chooses prices for a set of items, and one or several other players, the followers, seeks to buy a feasible subset of the items with minimal costs. The leader’s goal is to maximize her revenue, which is determined by the sold items and their prices. We are interested in cases where the followers’ feasible subsets are given by a combinatorial optimization problem. For example, a pricing problem based on the shortest path problem was used by Labbé et al. [15] to model road-toll setting scenarios. In this paper, we consider Stackelberg pricing problems that are based on matroids. The followers seek to buy a subset that is a basis. More specifically, we consider uniform, partition and laminar matroids. We study the complexity of computing leader-optimal prices for a single and multiple followers. We show that optimal prices can be computed in polynomial time for all three matroids if there is one follower. In general, such pricing problems based on matroids are APX-hard (see [11]). For multiple followers, we show that computing optimal prices for uniform matroids can be done in polynomial time. However, for partition and laminar matroids the pricing problem becomes NP-hard .","Böhnlein, Toni; Schaudt, Oliver",Combinatorial Algorithms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254912/,773

The vital signs data are used to evaluate patient health status using heuristic approaches, such as the early warning scoring (EWS) approach. Several applications have been proposed based on the early warning scores approach to improve the recognition of patients at risk of deterioration. However, there is a lack of efficient tools that enable a personalized monitoring depending on the patient situations. This paper explores the publish-subscribe pattern to provide a self-adaptative early warning score system in smart hospital context. We propose an adaptative configuration of the vital sings monitoring process depending on the patient health status variation and the medical staff decisions.","Ben Ida, Imen; Balti, Moez; Chabaane, Sondès; Jemai, Abderrazak",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313304/,773

36467,Remdesivir: Various toxicities: 4 case reports,2020-07-11,"Dimensionality reduction is widely used in machine learning and big data analytics since it helps to analyze and to visualize large, high-dimensional datasets. In particular, it can considerably help to perform tasks like data clustering and classification. Recently, embedding methods have emerged as a promising direction for improving clustering accuracy. They can preserve the local structure and simultaneously reveal the global structure of data, thereby reasonably improving clustering performance. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance of several clustering algorithms using one of the most successful embedding techniques: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection or UMAP. This technique has recently been proposed as a manifold learning technique for dimensionality reduction. It is based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. Our main hypothesis is that UMAP would permit to find the best clusterable embedding manifold, and therefore, we applied it as a preprocessing step before performing clustering. We compare the results of many well-known clustering algorithms such ask-means, HDBSCAN, GMM and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering when they operate on the low-dimension feature space yielded by UMAP. A series of experiments on several image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method allows each of the clustering algorithms studied to improve its performance on each dataset considered.

The aim was to obtain a current picture of the population’s expectations from self-driving (automated) vehicles. Twelve questions were asked to get an overview of the participants’ opinions on the potential of self-driving vehicles regarding climate impact, time and monetary savings, the willingness to use automated vehicles, as well as their safety and risks. The results are compared to the current state of expert knowledge. The main finding is that the German population is skeptical towards self-driving vehicles. In comparison to a scientific perspective, the population is underestimating the potential and possible benefits of automated vehicles, while the risks are assessed similarly. In the conclusions, the findings of the studyare assessed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Halil, Yasmin; Meyer, Gereon",Road Vehicle Automation 7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360354/,773

Executive dysfunction is a common sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting in diminished cognitive-behavioral functioning. Problem-solving and emotion regulation are cognitive-behavioral functions that are often disrupted by changes in the executive control system. SwapMyMood is an electronic version of the Executive Plus/STEP program, a set of clinical techniques taught to people living with brain injury to help them 1) identify and implement solutions to problems encountered in daily life and 2) to utilize the emotion cycle to understand and regulate emotional responses to these problems. The Executive Plus/STEP program has until now relied on paper-based instruction and use. Input from target users – people with brain injury and clinical professionals who teach this program to their patients – has contributed to key refinements of features and functioning of the mobile app. Data gathered from target user participation in the user-centered design process are presented. Future directions for ongoing development of technologies to support executive function strategies are also discussed.","Wallace, Tracey D.; Morris, John T.",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479790/,773

The low molecular weight up to 14 kDa sulfated polysaccharides of seaweeds (Portieria hornemannii, Spyridia hypnoides, Asparagopsis taxiformis, Centroceras clavulatum and Padina pavonica) were evaluated for in vitro antioxidant activities and cytotoxic assay using HeLa cell line and also characterized by FTIR. The high yield (7.74% alga dry wt.) of sulfated polysaccharide was observed in P. hornemannii followed by S. hypnoides (0.69%), C. clavulaum (0.55%) and A. taxiformis (0.17%). In the brown seaweed P. pavonica, the sulfated polysaccharide yield was 2.07%. High amount of sulfate was recorded in the polysaccharide of A. taxiformis followed by C. clavulaum, P. pavonica, S. hypnoides and P. hornemannii as indicative for bioactivity. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis supports the sulfated polysaccharides of S. hypnoides, C. clavulatum and A. taxiformis are similar to agar polymer whereas the spectral characteristics of P. hornemannii have similarities to carrageenan. The higher DPPH activity and reducing power were recorded in the polysaccharide of brown seaweed P. pavonica than the red seaweeds as follows: DPPH activities: S. hypnoides > A. taxiformis > C. clavulatum > P. hornimanii; Reducing power: A. taxiformis > P. hornimanii > S. hypnoides > C. clavulatum. The polysaccharide fractions contain up to 14 kDa from red seaweeds P. hornemannii and S. hypnoides followed by brown seaweed P. pavonica exhibit cytotoxic activity in HeLa cancer cell line (and are similar to structural properties of carrageenan extracted from P. hornemannii).

SOP caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rare; indeed, it has not been reported as a sequela of disseminated tuberculosis. METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2018, we identified six cases of tuberculosis-associated SOP in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis was revealed by microbiological examination; one of the cases was miliary tuberculosis. RESULTS: Of the six cases, 17% were positive for acid fast bacillus (AFB) stain, but 100% were positive for M. tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (MTB PCR) and AFB culture. In all cases, transbronchial lung biopsy was performed and organizing pneumonia was confirmed pathologically. All survived after treatment with anti-tuberculosis therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary tuberculosis, which shows OP in lung biopsy, is diagnosed through MTB PCR and AFB culture, and the prognosis is thought to be good.","Kim, Eun Jin; Kim, Kyung Chan",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7507594/,773

To build resilience in supply chains, several authors suggest making them shorter, more domestic, and more diversified. This paper argues that before redesigning global supply chains, one needs to identify the concrete issues faced by firms during the crisis and the policies that can solve them. It highlights that the solutions that have been proposed tend to be disconnected from the conclusions of the supply chain literature, where reshoring does not lead to resilience, and could further benefit from the insights of international business and global value chain scholars. Lastly, the paper discusses the policies that can build resilience at the firm and global levels and the narrative that could replace the current one to reshape the debate on the policy implications of COVID-19 for global supply chains.","Miroudot, Sébastien",J Int Bus Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7548406/,773

We explore the predictive power of biological proxies, nutrients, and coupled (14)C datings to reveal early phases of human settlement and activity in a modern urban context with low visibility and difficult accessibility. Our records suggest that a farming centre was active on the Bergamo hilltop as early as the 15th century bc. Crop and animal husbandry reached a high point between the 11th-8th century bc. Plant and biogeochemical proxies predict extensive and diversified cereal cropping, flax and grapevine cultivation, as well as herd stalling at a watering pond, free range livestock growing in woodlands, and pastoralism, shown by hay making and overgrazing evidence. The suggestive hypothesis of carding wool is mentioned but is currently untenable. Furthermore, we identified a possible phase of abandonment starting from the 8th century bc, to be further investigated, and in agreement with archaeological data suggesting settlement decline in the 8th-6th century bc. Our research highlights the dedication to pastoralism of the Bergamo hill since prehistoric times. The settlement position was strategic for pastoralists to exploit biological and water resources in space, season and elevation, i.e. from the plain to higher Alpine pastures. Ethnographic examples and Middle Age written sources strongly support this picture.

Even though this initiative was welcomed by 171 governments, not even a short-term violence reduction has happened in central conflict areas. This contribution examines the effects of the Corona pandemic in two regionally and globally significant conflict countries, Colombia with its fragile pacification and Syria with its militarily almost decided war. The article asks how the Corona crisis influences the dynamics of violence and peace after respectively at the end of civil wars. Colombia is a prominent example of a comprehensive peace agreement in complex conflicts. Nonetheless, the short-term, peace-related trend in times of the pandemic is ambivalent at best: While the absolute number of murders has declined, it is human right defenders and demobilized ex-combatants who remain the main victims of violence - and the number of massacres has increased again. The still-active guerilla Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) initially called for a one-sided truce, yet ended again in late April. In Syria, the consequences of the pandemic on the conflict dynamic have ranged from contradictory to negative: In the last rebel stronghold Idlib COVID-19 directly contributed to the months-long stabilization of the Russian-Turkish truce from March 2020. In Northeastern Syria, which is partly controlled by Turkey and partly by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the humanitarian situation has clearly worsened since the beginning of the pandemic. The Assad regime does not allow international aid to pass through to the opposition territory. Despite diverse differences between Colombia and Syria, one crucial similarity is that the respective governments instrumentalize the crisis on the ground for the often violent consolidation of the political agenda. In the bigger picture, the experience from the two countries suggests that COVID-19 works locally less as a “game-changer”, but rather as intensifier or accelerator of pre-pandemic dynamics.","Bank, André; Kurtenbach, Sabine",Z Friedens und Konflforsch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607886/,773
41658,Immune globulin/prednisone: Lack of efficacy: case report,2020-10-31,"Understanding the effects mediated by a set of nanoparticle (NP)-bound host biomolecules, often indicated with the umbrella term of NP corona, is essential in nanomedicine, nanopharmacology, and nanotoxicology. Among the NP-adsorbed proteome, some factors mediate cell binding, endocytosis, and clearing by macrophages and other phagocytes (opsonins), while some others display few affinities for the cell surface (dysopsonins). The functional mapping of opsonins and dysopsonins is instrumental to design long-circulating and nanotoxicologically safe next-generation nanotheranostics. In this review, we critically analyze functional data identifying specific proteins with opsonin or dysopsonin properties. Special attention is dedicated to the following: (1) the simplicity or complexity of the NP proteome and its modulation, (2) the role of specific host proteins in mediating the stealth properties of uncoated or polymer-coated NPs, and (3) the ability of the innate immune system, and, in particular, of the complement proteins, to mediate NP clearance by phagocytes. Emerging species-specific peculiarities, differentiating humans from preclinical animal models (the murine especially), are highlighted throughout this overview. The operative definition of opsonin and dysopsonin and the measurement schemes to assess their in vitro efficacy is critically re-examined. This provides a shared and unbiased approach useful for NP opsonin and dysopsonin systematic identification.","Papini, Emanuele; Tavano, Regina; Mancin, Fabrizio",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587406/,773

As argued in this chapter, this is mainly because past studies on sending states’ policies and institutions for the diaspora have failed to systematically focus on social protection, while also ignoring that regional integration dynamics often constrain domestic responses to the welfare needs of nationals residing abroad. This volume aims to fill this research gap by comparatively examining the type of diaspora infrastructure through which EU Member States address the vulnerabilities faced by populations abroad in five core areas of social protection: health care, pensions, family, unemployment, and economic hardship. Drawing on data from two original surveys with national experts, we operationalize the concepts of descriptive infrastructure for non-residents (i.e. the presence of diaspora-related institutions) and substantive infrastructure (i.e. policies that provide and facilitate access to welfare for nationals abroad) in order to propose a new typology of states’ engagement with their diaspora in the area of social protection.","Lafleur, Jean-Michel; Vintila, Daniela",Migration and Social Protection in Europe and Beyond (Volume 2),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605455/,773

Our goal is to identify lessons for designing better public health policies in the post-pandemic era based on the past 6 months’ experiences of these 163 countries. Based on 2SLS regression, we derive the following lessons. First, providing universal health care is a significant public health strategy for countries to help deal with similar outbreaks in the future. Second, tackling air pollution is a win–win solution, not only for better preparedness against Covid-19 or other airborne diseases, but also for the environment and climate change. Third, lockdowns may help to reduce community spread, but its impact on reducing Covid-19 incidence is not statistically significant. Similarly, antimalarial drugs have no significant effect on reducing the spread of the disease. Fourth, countries should encourage home-based work as much as possible until some treatment or cure is found for the virus. Fifth, the lessons of past SARS experience helped contain the spread of the infection in East Asian countries; other countries must adjust their social and cultural life to the new normal: wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping a distance from others in public places.","Basher, Syed Abul; Haque, A.

42020,Multiple drugs: No response: case report,2020-11-14,"Advances in fundamental and applied immunology research often originate from pilot studies utilizing animal models. While cattle represent an ideal model for disease pathogenesis and vaccinology research for a number of human disease, optimized bovine culture models have yet to be fully established. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) are critical in activating adaptive immunity and are an attractive subset for experimental and clinical applications. The use of serum-supplemented culture medium in this ex vivo approach is undesirable as serum contains unknown quantities of immune-modulating components and may induce unwanted immune responses if not autologous. Here, we describe a standardized protocol for generating bovine MoDC in serum-free medium (AIM-V) and detail the MoDC phenotype, cytokine profile, and metabolic signature achieved using this culture methodology. MoDC generated from adult, barren cattle were used for a series of experiments that evaluated the following culture conditions: medium type, method of monocyte enrichment, culture duration, and concentration of differentiation additives. Viability and yield were assessed using flow cytometric propidium iodide staining and manual hemocytometer counting, respectively. MoDC phenotype and T cell activation and proliferation were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers (MHC class II, CD86, CD14, and CD205), and CD25 and CFSE respectively. Cytokine secretion was quantified using a multiplex bovine cytokine panel (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, MIP-1α, TNF-α, and IL-4). Changes in cell metabolism following stimulation were analyzed using an Extracellular Flux (XFe96) Seahorse Analyzer. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA. Immature MoDC generated in serum-free medium using magnetic-activated cell sorting with plate adhesion to enrich monocytes and cultured for 4 days have the following phenotypic profile: MHC class II(+++), CD86(+), CD205(++), and CD14(-). These MoDC can be matured with PMA and ionomycin as noted by increased CD86 and CD40 expression, increased cytokine secretion (IL-1α, IL-10, MIP-1α, and IL-17A), a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, and induction of T cell activation and proliferation following maturation.

At the individual firm level, such events also impact the likelihood of bankruptcy, a feature that is not well represented in the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model. This paper presents a functional form for equity asset pricing that is realistic, and reconciles the observed high equity risk premium with the observed lower than expected slope of the Security Market Line. Most importantly, we will demonstrate how including the potential for such large events changes traditional views of equity returns and the known factors that contribute to those returns. On the basis of empirical examination of a dataset stretching over 30 years without survivorship bias, we conclude that when the probabilities of rare extreme events are considered, strategies that focus on “alpha” (risk adjusted return) as defined in Jensen (J Finance 23(2):389–416, 1967) are structurally superior to “smart beta” strategies that seek to outperform a market index benchmark.","Kantos, Christopher; diBartolomeo, Dan",J Asset Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670287/,773

The challenge to develop such guidelines is largely related to the limited number of reported cases and lack of studies on this particular patient population. We present a 5-patient case series of glioma, detailing their baseline characteristics, treatment courses, lab abnormalities, and the changes made to their care after they developed COVID-19. The median age of the patient population was 66 years. All patients had IDH-wild type glioma (3 Grade IV, 1 Grade III, and 1 Grade II) and all of whom had received temozolomide chemotherapy shortly before COVID-19 diagnosis (median = 22 days). Three patients presented with mild non-respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization to two of them, and adjuvant Temozolomide chemotherapy was held in all. One patient developed severe symptoms of shortness of breath requiring ICU-stay and expired eight days later. One patient was asymptomatic, tested positive during a routine pre-chemotherapy screening, and initiation of temozolomide was delayed by two weeks after a negative repeat test. All four symptomatic patients were rehabilitation facility residents. The most common lab abnormality was lymphopenia seen in 4/5 patients. Other abnormalities seen included elevated ferretin/total bilirubin/CRP/LDH/procalcitonin/D-dimer, thrombocytopenia/leukopenia, and low sodium/vitamin D. Chest x-ray findings were normal in 3/5 patients and showed ground glass opacities in 1 patient. COVID-19 screening during different phases of glioma therapy is recommended. Therapy interruptions or shortening duration of treatment particularly of temozolomide given its risk on lymphopenia may be needed. lymphopenia thresholds, MGMT promoter methylation status, and residence in rehabilitation facilities may help stratify glioma patient COVID-19 risks further. Patients and their family will need to be involved in therapies’ risk:benefit discussions during this pandemic.","Daher, Ahmad",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650360/,773
43081,Antineoplastics: Various toxicities: 3 case reports,2020-12-12,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected cancer services. Our objective was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on decision making and the resulting outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial tumors. METHODS: We performed a multi-centre prospective study of all adult patients discussed in weekly neuro-oncology and skull base MDTs who had a newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial (excluding pituitary) tumor between 01 April and 31 May 2020. All patients had follow-up data at least 30-days after the index MDT date. Descriptive statistical reporting was used. RESULTS: There were 1357 referrals for newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial tumors across fifteen neuro-oncology centres. Of centres with all intracranial tumors, a change in initial MDT management was reported in 8.6% of cases (n=104/1210). Decisions to change the MDT management plan reduced over time from a peak of 19% referrals at the start of the study to 0% by the end of the study period. Changes in management were reported in 16% (n=75/466) of cases previously recommended for surgery and 28% of cases previously recommended for chemotherapy (n=20/72). The reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was similar in surgical and non-surgical patients (2.6% vs. 2.4%, p >0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Disruption to neuro-oncology services in the UK caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was most marked in the first month, affecting all diagnoses. Patients considered for chemotherapy were most affected. In those recommended surgical treatment this was successfully completed. Longer-term outcome data will evaluate oncological treatments received by these patients and overall survival.","Fountain, Daniel; Piper, Rory; Poon, Michael; Solomou, Georgios; Brennan, Paul M; Chowdhury, Yasir; Colombo, Francesca; Elmoslemany, Tarek; Ewbank, Frederick; Grundy, Paul; Hasan, Md Tanvir; Hilling, Molly; Hutchinson, Peter; Karabatsou, Konstantina; Kolias, Angelos; McSorley, Nathan; Millward, Christopher; Phang, Isaac; Plaha, Puneet; Price, Stephen; Rominiyi, Ola; Sage, William; Shumon, Syed; Silva, Ines; Smith, Stuart; Surash, Surash; Thomson, Simon; Lau, Jun Yi; Watts, Colin; Jenkinson, Michael",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650395/,773
43440,Non-serious case reports,2020-12-19,"Probiotics are non-pathogenic microorganisms that can interact with the gastrointestinal microbiota. They have numerous beneficial health effects that include enhancement of the host immune response, antiallergic, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Probiotics are capable of restoring the impaired microbiome of a dysbiotic gut. They can be isolated from different environments. However, it is frequently suggested that probiotics for human use should come from human sources. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize novel probiotic strains from the saliva and feces of healthy human individuals. To meet the criteria for probiotic attributes, the isolates were subjected to numerous standard morphological and biochemical tests. These tests included Gram staining, catalase tests, antibiotic susceptibility testing, hemolytic and antagonistic evaluation, tolerance tests involving temperature, NaCl levels, pH and bile salts, adherence ability assays, and genotypic characterization involving 16S rRNA gene sequencing. From 26 saliva and 11 stool samples, 185 microbial strains were isolated. Based on morphological and biochemical characteristics, 14 potential probiotic candidates were selected and identified genotypically. The new strains belonged to Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hire. The selected strains were non-hemolytic, showed high tolerance to low pH and bile salts, and strong adherence abilities. Furthermore, the strains displayed a wide range of antimicrobial activities, particularly against antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, five of the selected isolates demonstrated antiproliferative features against human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2). The results of this investigation confirm the diversity of microbial populations in the human gut and saliva, and since these strains are of human origin, they will highly likely display maximal activities in food and drugs set for human use. Hence, the new strains of this study require additional in vivo experiments to assess their health-promoting effects.","Bazireh, Homa; Shariati, Parvin; Azimzadeh Jamalkandi, Sadegh; Ahmadi, Ali; Boroumand, Mohammad Ali",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746552/,773

HIV infection has not been found to be an independent factor for severe COVID-19, however, only small case series of HIV and COVID-19 have been reported. The aim of this study is to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of HIV positive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico City. METHODS: A single-center review of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was performed using medical records from March 1st, 2020 to May 20th, 2020. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes RESULTS: A total of 11 PLWH were diagnosed with COVID-19, only 9 were hospitalized and are described here. One died, 6 were discharged and 2 remain hospitalized (table 1). Overall, the median age was 46 years, all males and most (7/9) were on INSTI based ART regimen and undetectable HIV viral load (9/9), with a median of CD4 counts of 581 cell/mm3.

While, there is still no consensus on how is the best configuration to use BIMA. This study aims to compare intraoperative blood flow, early clinical results and early postoperative patency of different configurations of BIMA. METHODS: There were 74 patients who underwent CABGs with bilateral internal mammary artery with different configurations we included. According to the different target territories that RIMA grafted to, the patients were divided into bilateral group (group I) with 20 cases and left group (group II) with 54 cases. Intraoperative blood flow, early clinical results and early postoperative patency of different configurations of BIMA were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in the early postoperative death and major complications between group I and Group II(P>0.05). Compared with the LIMA in group II, the LIMA in group I had a slightly higher DF value (76.7 ± 6.2 vs 73.1 ± 6.8, P = 0.040). Compared with the RIMA in group II, the RIMA in group I had a slightly higher MGF (51.7 ± 34.4 ml/min vs 31.4 ± 21.4 ml/min, P = 0.024). There was no difference in the other TTFM parameters of LIMA and RIMA between group I and Group II(P>0.05). Further subgroup analysis revealed that compared with free RIMA in group II, in situ RIMA had a higher DF value (71.4 ± 7.8 vs 61.8 ± 18.1,P = 0.025). The PI of LIMA in free RIMA subgroup was higher than the PI of LIMA in in-situ RIMA subgroup (3.0 ± 1.6 vs 2.1 ± 1.0,P = 0.018). The results of early postoperative CTA examination showed that all IMAs grafts were completely patent. CONCLUSIONS: The use of BIMA for CABG is safe and efficacious, RIMA used in right coronary artery received more satisfactory graft flow. BIMA with no stenosis and occlusion in the early stage, therefore is the ideal and stable coronary bypass graft.","Han, Zengqiang; Zhang, Guodong; Chen, Shenglong; Liu, Gang; Chen, Yu",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787227/,773

This study investigates how consumption values (i.e. the need for exclusivity, conformity, and hedonism) affect consumers’ acceptance of luxury brands’ sustainable efforts. It adopts a cross-cultural framework by analysing two countries, namely China and the UK, which differ substantially in some of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, namely power distance, individualism, and indulgence. Using the structural equation modelling in analysing 677 survey responses from actual luxury goods’ consumers in the two countries, we suggest that hedonic needs drive consumers’ purchase intentions in China and the UK. We find that the need for exclusivity in sustainable luxury items is negatively related to consumers’ purchase intentions in China, while the need for conformity is positively related. In contrast, these effects are reversed in the UK. Our study implies the need to align the marketing of sustainable luxury with consumption values of consumers to reflect the cultural differences. In theorizing sustainable luxury research, this study provides a deeper understanding of value perceptions pertaining to luxury product consumption and sustainability.

Such a narrow reading fails to appreciate the intersecting and interacting processes that underpin environmental (in)justices faced by Indigenous peoples. We argue that the theoretical discussions and empirical research into environmental (in)justice need to extend beyond Western liberal philosophies and instead consider pluralistic approach to Indigenous environment justice which is founded on Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies, which include intergenerational and more-human-human justice requirements.","Parsons, Meg; Fisher, Karen; Crease, Roa Petra",Decolonising Blue Spaces in the Anthropocene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883058/,773

Largely neglected in scholarly and public attention, however, are ‘bottom‐up’ solutions arising from the periphery of innovation systems. Drawing on inductive case research on a fringe doctor who invented the idea of the drive‐through testing system, and two university student teams that developed coronavirus applications, this study examines how peripheral actors generate innovative, bottom‐up solutions at speed in a time of crisis. Our findings reveal that, in a crisis situation, bottom‐up solutions transpire on the basis of three innovation drivers: (a) peripheral status, expediting the commence of innovation activities; (b) interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling access to a greater spectrum of knowledge and perspectives; and (c) prior knowledge, prescribing the direction of solution generation. We also identify that system intermediaries support the innovation activities of peripheral actors, thereby helping bottom‐up solutions to become more customer facing. Such functions of intermediaries include demand articulation, technical assistance, and promulgation of generated solutions. Our findings offer theoretical implications for the literature on innovation in a time of crisis and practical implications for governments and organizations preparing themselves for the potential second wave of coronavirus emergencies, or even a completely new form of future crisis.","Park, Hyunkyu; Lee, Miyoung; Ahn, Joon Mo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013467/,773

51595,Remdesivir: various toxicities: 7 case reports,2021-04-17,"This paper presents results of a close textual analysis of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economy’s (REPE’s) ‘Editorial Manifesto’ (Cincotti et al. Rev Evol Polit Econ 1:1–12, 2020), with special reference given to journal objectives, including making proactive editorial proposals for promoting, deepening and potentially modifying such objectives through time. In the process, it isolates six main objectives of the journal, including publishing papers on the big issues of the day using evolutionary themes; questions of integration and unification of schools and trends; studying the process of change through complex-systems, history and other methods; utilizing trans-, multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives; deepening international political economy (IPE) concerns within post-Keynesian and institutional schools; and scrutinizing differences between the schools and trends of evolutionary political economy (EPE). Ten proactive editorial proposals are made to mostly promote or in some cases adjust objectives. For instance, it suggests that special issues on big issues/problems apply especially EPE concepts and principles in some detail. It argues for papers on linkages between complexity theory and circular and cumulative causation. It encourages research on the positive and negative processes of innovation through the prism of the instrumental and ceremonial functions of technology and institutions. It suggests deepening an understanding of historical specificity and evolution vis-à-vis change and metamorphosis. It recommends scrutinizing the differences between trans-, multi- and interdisciplinary analyses; strengthening the IPE dimensions of all schools and trends of EPE; and encouraging papers on the emergent relationship between micro-meso-macro-global real world processes. It stresses the need to assess periodically the relative power of various schools and trends of EPE, and of publishing independent papers about editorial directions and problems. It outlines forms of editorial corruption of objectives and how they may be prevented or moderated, and proposes that objectives be kept firmly in mind when eliciting, refereeing and assessing awards, papers, symposia and special issues. Lastly it proposes the establishment of an independent Editorial Ombudsperson or committee for resolving disputes and anomalies; regular communication between REPE editors, boards and others on critical issues; and the publishing of yearly, five-yearly and decadal reviews and reports concerning progress with objectives for the journal.","O’Hara, Phillip Anthony",Rev Evol Polit Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039089/,773

51611,Multiple drugs: Various toxicities: 2 case reports,2021-04-17,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely through the world. Most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of the virus, and this worldwide scenario has motivated the development of researches in all areas of knowledge. In this context, this paper presents a study about how intervention measures such as lockdown, partial lockdown, and no-lockdown help to impede the extent of the severe outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: Since mathematical models are used to describe population dynamics and the behavior of epidemics, this paper presents a fuzzy approach to describe the behavior of new daily cases of COVID-19 in Brazil based on the p-fuzzy dynamic systems, considering as input variables, the infected population and the environment action. The evaluated output variable is the level of infestation. RESULTS: The results of a fuzzy model showed that intervention measures play a crucial role in determining the success of COVID-19 eradication programs, while there is no vaccine available for all the population. The proposed fuzzy model was developed by posing intervention measures and the results showed that to consider partial-lockdown helped to slow down the transmission rates of COVID-19 in the population, however the total lockdown is more effective, while the vaccine is not available. CONCLUSION: Therefore, mathematical models consist of an effective tool to investigate the situation with intervention strategies and estimate the potential benefits and costs of different strategies. The fuzzy model proposed assists government decision-making in order to minimize the economic impacts caused by the pandemic.","Stiegelmeier, Elenice Weber; Bressan, Glaucia Maria",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8040016/,773

So we partially answer a problem posted by Muñoz et al. (Eur J Math 6:430–452, 2020). In particular, if X is a generalized Grassmannian [Formula: see text] and the rank r is less than or equal to some number that depends only on X, then E splits as a direct sum of line bundles. So we improve the main theorem of Muñoz et al. (J Reine Angew Math (Crelles J) 664:141–162, 2012, Theorem 3.1) when X is a generalized Grassmannian. Moreover, by calculating the relative tangent bundles between two rational homogeneous spaces, we give explicit bounds for the generalized Grauert–Mülich–Barth theorem on rational homogeneous spaces.","Du, Rong; Fang, Xinyi; Gao, Yun",Ann Mat Pura Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8041262/,773

Nevertheless, prices are increasing and are confronting market players with challenges. In particular, project developers in the residential construction sector, who have to anticipate future demand in their developments, have to decide which apartment sizes will be in demand in the future and what influence the development of different apartment sizes will have on their earnings. This study takes up this aspect, which has so far only been treated to a limited extent in the literature. The trend in the development of apartment sizes at both federal and municipal level will be investigated using official statistics and the development of income and costs will be analyzed with the help of rental price statistics, supply data and expert interviews. The determined trend of the apartment size development towards smaller apartments implies an investigation of the resulting consequences. The analysis of rental price statistics and rental ads shows that this is accompanied by higher revenues per square meter of living space. The analysis of size effects on the calculation of project developers shows that especially the space efficiency and certain items of the construction costs should be given increased attention at an early stage. This suggests in combination with the analysis of the rents the development of smaller apartments under careful consideration of the constraints of the individual project.","Engel, Dominik; Gärtner, Philip; Linke, Hans-Joachim",Z Immobilien&#x000f6;konomie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8053893/,773

52306,Dobutamine/vasopressors: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-05-01,"Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) participates in the DNA repair system. It is believed that the main biological function of APE1 is Mg(2+)-dependent hydrolysis of AP-sites in DNA. On the base of structural data, kinetic studies, and mutation analysis, the key stages of APE1 interaction with damaged DNA were established. It has been shown recently that APE1 can act as an endoribonuclease that catalyzes mRNA hydrolysis at certain pyrimidine–purine sites and thus controls the level of certain transcripts. In addition, the presence of Mg(2+) ions was shown to be not required for the endoribonuclease activity of APE1, in contrast to the AP-endonuclease activity. This indicates differences in mechanisms of APE1 catalysis on RNA and DNA substrates, but the reasons for these differences remain unclear. Here, the analysis of endoribonuclease hydrolysis of model RNA substrates with wild type APE1 enzyme and its mutant forms Y171F, R177F, R181A, D210N, N212A, T268D, M270A, and D308A, was performed. It was shown that mutation of Asn212, Asp210, and Tyr171 residues leads to the decrease of AP-endonuclease activity while endoribonuclease activity is retained. Also, T268D and M270A APE1 mutants lose specificity to pyrimidine–purine sequences. R177F and R181A did not show a significant decrease in enzyme activity, whereas D308A demonstrated a decrease of endoribonuclease activity.","Kuznetsova, A. A.; Gavrilova, A. A.; Novopashina, D.

52310,Desmopressin/vasopressin: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-05-01,"[Image: see text] Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, demand for cloth face masks containing nanosilver has increased. Common product claims such as “antiviral” and “antimicrobial” can be attractive to buyers seeking to protect themselves from this respiratory disease, but it is important to note that filtration capabilities are the main factor to prevent virus transmission and that antimicrobial ability is a secondary protection factor. Silver has long been known to be antibacterial, and growing research supports additional antiviral properties. In this study, 40 masks claiming to contain silver were evaluated for substantiated antiviral and antimicrobial claims using methods available to the public. Criteria for determining the validity of substantiated claims included the use of patented technology, international certification for antimicrobial and/or antiviral textile by ISO or ASTM, EPA pesticide registration, and peer-reviewed literature. Our analysis showed that, of the 40 masks, 21 had substantiated claims. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two of the substantiated face masks (A and B) were examined for silver identification for further confirmation. Mask A uses silver and copper ions attached to zeolite particles; the zeolite particles discovered through SEM were approximately 90–200 nm in diameter. In mask B, particles of silver and titanium at the 250 nm size were found. In conclusion, these certifications or patents are not enough to determine credibility, and stricter regulations by federal agencies on product testing for manufacturers that make claims are necessary to ensure the efficacy of the product advertised, as well as a cloth face mask inhalation standard.","Blevens, Melissa S.; Pastrana, Homero F.; Mazzotta, Hannah C.; Tsai, Candace Su-Jung",J Chem Health Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084270/,773

Inevitably, evaluation is critical in navigating improvements in content delivery. However, as culture continues to shift away from didactic teaching, students are at risk of ‘feedback overload’. We propose a novel emoji scale to facilitate rapid appraisal. METHOD: A three-point emoji scale was developed within the novel virtual learning environment for core surgical training in the West Midlands. Engagement with the emoji system was assessed and correlated with conventional post-course questionnaires. RESULTS: The novel emoji system provided a rapid mechanism for trainees to express opinion on individual modules immediately following completion. Parallels to social media meant this modality felt familiar to trainees. Simplification of feedback permitted prompt, targeted review of modules for improvement, as opposed to laborious collection and analysis of standard post-course questionnaires. Literature review revealed limited research regarding similar emoji-based responses, or the validity of Likert or free-text based feedback systems. CONCLUSION: As virtual learning evolves following COVID-19, feedback systems help guide evolution. Emoji-based feedback may provide the key to prompt, accessible evaluation of VLE platforms.","Rajdev, K; Watts, E; Eastwood, M; Goh, S; Ahmed, U; Bowyer, D",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135842/,773

Herein, we report a 10 min nano-capture system that is used in conjunction with a modified reverse transcriptase-LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for the accurate detection of SARS CoV-2 virus. The nano-capture system employs in-house-designed probe-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles Co(2)FeAl (cobalt-based Heusler alloy) for efficient capture of contaminating amplicons from the reaction mixture preceding RT-LAMP. The nano-cleaned RT-LAMP assay along with engineered primers successfully detected the presence of 10 copies of SARS CoV-2 virus while completely eliminating the incidence of false positives. The presented contaminant-capture method has been compared with other approaches for elimination of contaminants and was found to be more effective. The insight brought in this work is the design of a rapid nano-capture system that hybridizes with contaminating amplicons (carry-over) with high specificity to enable easy removal from the assay for elimination of false positives. The method has been proven to be successful for RT-LAMP assays in the rapid and highly specific detection of SARS CoV-2, which is currently a major challenge for global health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work involving a nano-based cleaning strategy for reliable and rapid diagnosis using isothermal amplification approaches.","Dahiya, Ujjwal Ranjan; Gupt, Guru Dutt; Dhaka, Rajendra S.; Kalyanasundaram, Dinesh",ACS Appl Nano Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147461/,773

It is very difficult for these users to distinguish these videos as useful or harmful. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the scientific quality of YouTube video content on umbilical hernia. Methods: A total of 50 videos on YouTube pertaining to umbilical hernia were included in the study. All videos were evaluated by two experienced general surgeons. The uploader, video content, length, upload date, time since upload, number of views, numbers of comments, likes, and dislikes and Video Power Index (VPI) rates videos were recorded and evaluated. The videos were scored using the Quality Criteria for Consumer Health Information (DISCERN) and Global Quality Scale (GQS). Results: A total of 9,836 comments were made to the videos, 118,478 likes were made, and 15,009 dislikes were made. The mean DISCERN score given to the videos by the researchers was 2.57 ± 1.82 (min-max: 1-5) and the average GQS score was 2.62 ± 1.86. A statistically significant difference was found in terms of both DISCERN and GQS scores of videos uploaded by doctors compared to videos uploaded by nondoctors (p < 0.001). A statistically significant level of good agreement was found among investigators in terms of both DISCERN (p < 0.001, r = 0.778) and GQS (p < 0.001, r = 0.807) scores.

Microglia physiologically eliminate unnecessary synapses during the developmental period. The overactivation of synaptic pruning by microglia is involved in the pathology of brain disease. This paper focuses on the synaptic pruning function and its molecular machinery and introduces the hypothesis that excessive synaptic pruning plays a role in the development of schizophrenia. Finally, we suggest a strategy for diagnosis and medication based on modulation of the interaction between microglia and synapses.

However, due to their limited coding capacity, viruses must enact most, if not all, of these metabolic changes by influencing the function of available host cell regulatory proteins. Typically, certain viral proteins, some of which can function as viral oncoproteins, interact with these cellular regulatory proteins directly in order to effect changes in downstream metabolic pathways. This review highlights recent research into how four different DNA tumor viruses, namely human adenovirus, human papillomavirus, Epstein–Barr virus and Kaposi’s associated-sarcoma herpesvirus, can influence host cell metabolism through their interactions with either MYC, p53 or the pRb/E2F complex. Interestingly, some of these host cell regulators can be activated or inhibited by the same virus, depending on which viral oncoprotein is interacting with the regulatory protein. This review highlights how MYC, p53 and pRb/E2F regulate host cell metabolism, followed by an outline of how each of these DNA tumor viruses control their activities. Understanding how DNA tumor viruses regulate metabolism through viral oncoproteins could assist in the discovery or repurposing of metabolic inhibitors for antiviral therapy or treatment of virus-dependent cancers.","Prusinkiewicz, Martin A.; Mymryk, Joe S.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8148605/,773

Prior research has examined the implementation of training systems using augmented reality (AR) in other domains, such as welding, aviation, army, and mathematics, offering significant pedagogical affordances. Nevertheless, firefighting training systems using AR are still an under-researched area. The increasing penetration of AR for training is the driving force behind this study, and the scope is to analyze the main aspects affecting the acceptance of AR by firefighters. The current research uses a technology acceptance model, extended by the external constructs of perceived interactivity and personalization, to consider both the system and individual level. The proposed model was evaluated by a sample of 200 users, and the results show that both the external variables of perceived interactivity and perceived personalization are prerequisite factors in extending the TAM model. The findings reveal that the usability is the strongest predictor of firefighters’ behavioral intentions to use the AR system, followed by the ease of use with smaller, yet meaningful, direct and indirect effects on firefighters’ intentions.

Fermatean fuzzy sets were presented in order that uncertain information from quite general real-world decision-making situations could be mathematically tractable. To that purpose, these sets are more flexible and reliable than intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. This paper presents a novel hybrid model, namely, the Fermatean fuzzy bipolar soft set (FFBSS, in short) model as a general extension of two powerful existing models, that is, fuzzy bipolar soft set and Pythagorean fuzzy bipolar soft set models. Some fundamental properties of the proposed FFBSS model, namely, subset-hood, equal FFBSSs, relative null and relative absolute FFBSSs, restricted intersection and union, extended intersection and union, AND operation and OR operation are investigated along with numerical examples.

Pathogen components like bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate macrophage migration, phagocytotic activity and cytokine expression. Previously, we identified the poly(A)(+) RNA interactome of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Of the 402 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), 32 were classified as unique in macrophages, including nineteen not reported to interact with nucleic acids before. Remarkably, P23 a HSP90 co-chaperone, also known as cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase (PTGES3), exhibited differential poly(A)(+) RNA binding in untreated and LPS-induced macrophages. To identify mRNAs bound by P23 and to elucidate potential regulatory RBP functions in macrophages, we immunoprecipitated P23 from cytoplasmic extracts of cross-linked untreated and LPS-induced cells. RNAseq revealed that enrichment of 44 mRNAs was reduced in response to LPS. Kif15 mRNA, which encodes kinesin family member 15 (KIF15), a motor protein implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell mobility was selected for further analysis. Noteworthy, phagocytic activity of LPS-induced macrophages was enhanced by P23 depletion. Specifically, in untreated RAW 264.7 macrophages, decreased P23 results in Kif15 mRNA destabilization, diminished KIF15 expression and accelerated macrophage migration. We show that the unexpected RBP function of P23 contributes to the regulation of macrophage phagocytotic activity and migration.","de Vries, Sebastian; Benes, Vladimir; Naarmann-de Vries, Isabel S.; Rücklé, Cornelia; Zarnack, Katharina; Marx, Gernot; Ostareck, Dirk H.; Ostareck-Lederer, Antje",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226254/,773

This study aims to examine how the transmission of COVID‐19 is modulated by climate conditions, which is of great importance for better understanding of the seasonal feature of COVID‐19. Constrained by the accurate observations we can make, the basic reproduction numbers (R (0)) for each country were inferred and linked to temperature and relative humidity (RH) with statistical analysis. Using R (0) as the measure of COVID‐19 transmission potential, we find stronger transmission of COVID‐19 under mildly warm (0°C < T < 20°C) and humid (RH > 60%) climate conditions, while extremely low (T < −2°C) and high (T > 20°C) temperature or a dry climate (RH < 60%) weakens transmission. The established nonlinear relationships between COVID‐19 transmission and climate conditions suggest that seasonal climate variability may affect the spread and severity of COVID‐19 infection, and temperate coastal regions with mildly warm and humid climate would be susceptible to large‐scale outbreaks.","Gao, Meng; Zhou, Qiming; Yang, Xian; Li, Qingxiang; Zhang, Shiqing; Yung, Ken Kin Lam; Guo, Yike",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250298/,773

This paper is a first attempt to investigate whether that discontinuity also altered our relationship to the future, in particular through the production of scenarios of a “world after” significantly different from the world before. We analyzed the representations of the future produced at the height of the first wave of the crisis, between March and June 2020, through a selective review of these productions. From the 60 sources found, we selected 23 texts yielding 83 scenarios. We used a classic four‐category typology (Continued Growth, Discipline, Collapse and Transformation) that allowed us to identify scenarios of continuity and discontinuity. The results show a paradoxical predominance of continuity scenarios, contradicting our hypothesis that the crisis would have fostered creativity regarding the “world after.” The discussion focuses on potential explanatory elements. These relate essentially to the way the scenarios were produced, notably in terms of time horizon, explanation of the methods and selection of the variables structuring the scenarios. These elements seem to indicate that these scenarios were rather generated from a reactive posture, showing a reluctance to rethink the present as a moment of discontinuity opening up the horizon of possibilities. This initial work paves the way for a more systematic exploration of the practice of anticipation and the capacity to produce creative/imaginative futures in times of crisis.","Jahel, Camille; Bourgeois, Robin; Pesche, Denis; de Lattre‐Gasquet, Marie; Delay, Etienne",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250327/,773

Substantial support has been provided to farmers as part of $5 trillion of economy‐wide stimulus enacted. This included payments in 2020 under the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) of nearly $24 billion to producers of a wide array of products. These payments came on top of trade‐related support provided to agriculture in 2018 and 2019. The stimulus also included expansion of nutrition assistance programs for low‐income households which were among the hardest hit by the pandemic.

Within seconds of activation, they release various preformed biologically active products and initiate the process of de novo synthesis of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. This process is regulated at multiple levels. Besides the extensively studied IgE and IgG receptors, toll-like receptors, MRGPR, and other protein receptor signaling pathways, there is a critical activation pathway based on cholesterol-dependent, pore-forming cytolytic exotoxins produced by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. This pathway is initiated by binding the exotoxins to the cholesterol-rich membrane, followed by their dimerization, multimerization, pre-pore formation, and pore formation. At low sublytic concentrations, the exotoxins induce mast cell activation, including degranulation, intracellular calcium concentration changes, and transcriptional activation, resulting in production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Higher toxin concentrations lead to cell death. Similar activation events are observed when mast cells are exposed to sublytic concentrations of saponins or some other compounds interfering with the membrane integrity. We review the molecular mechanisms of mast cell activation by pore-forming bacterial exotoxins, and other compounds inducing cholesterol-dependent plasma membrane perturbations. We discuss the importance of these signaling pathways in innate and acquired immunity.","Draberova, Lubica; Tumova, Magda; Draber, Petr",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260682/,773

In the present study we investigate the use purposes and outcomes of three types of academic instant messaging groups or AIMGs. Formal AIMGs are created and managed by teaching staff, class AIMGs are created by students and joined by all members of a particular class, and study AIMGs are smaller groups created by students that know each other personally or collaborate in group assignments. To advance understanding of the role of these groups in students’ wellbeing and academic development, we pose research questions concerning their associations with academic performance, academic stress, and students’ course experiences. We adopt an exploratory frame and survey methodology to collect data from a large sample of undergraduate students (n = 1752). Our findings indicate that, at the institution where data were collected, high rates of AIMG participation is the norm, with class AIMGs emerging as particularly popular. We find statistically significant interaction between formal and study AIMGs and academic performance, as well as between study AIMGs and academic stress. Participation in these groups also predicts students’ social experience of a learning community, as well as their perception of the teaching they receive.

This research conducted a framework-based comparative country analysis to provide lessons learned for newcomers in the sphere of foresight-linked AG. By evaluating the AG levels of Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Korea, we found that the consequences of foresight-linked AGs were different in each country. At the same time, we also identified a common denominator, namely, future receptivity, a “human or people” capacity to accept and understand the value of foresight. Instead of temporary system changes or organizational modifications, future receptivity is an underlying element for newcomers to overcome lingering short-termism and facilitate the coordination of stakeholders concerning foresight. In conclusion, we suggest ways to promote future receptivity for newcomers. First, the government should educate and train the public and government officials to promote future literacy and future proficiency.

These infants require continuous care in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). Medical parameters are continuously monitored in premature infants in the NICU using a set of wired, sticky electrodes attached to the body. Medical adhesives used on the electrodes can be harmful to the baby, causing skin injuries, discomfort, and irritation. In addition, respiration rate (RR) monitoring in the NICU faces challenges of accuracy and clinical quality because RR is extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG). This research paper presents a design and validation of a smart textile pressure sensor system that addresses the existing challenges of medical monitoring in NICU. We designed two e-textile, piezoresistive pressure sensors made of Velostat for noninvasive RR monitoring; one was hand-stitched on a mattress topper material, and the other was embroidered on a denim fabric using an industrial embroidery machine. We developed a data acquisition system for validation experiments conducted on a high-fidelity, programmable NICU baby mannequin. We designed a signal processing pipeline to convert raw time-series signals into parameters including RR, rise and fall time, and comparison metrics. The results of the experiments showed that the relative accuracies of hand-stitched sensors were 98.68 (top sensor) and 98.07 (bottom sensor), while the accuracies of embroidered sensors were 99.37 (left sensor) and 99.39 (right sensor) for the 60 BrPM test case.

The main objective of this study was to develop an in-silico model of beta-barrel OMP present among the valid A. hydrophila pangenomes (n = 22). With a program named the β-barrel Outer Membrane Protein Predictor (BOMP), total beta-barrel OMPs (n = 3127) were predicted across 22 genomes with the estimated median number of 64 per genome. In pangenome analysis, only 32 OMPs were found to be conserved. These beta-barrel OMPs also showed variations among source of isolation, COG and KEGG classes. Among 32 conserved OMPs, a highly antigenic protein was identified by utilizing Vaxijen. With B cell epitope predictions, two fragments of amino acid sequences i.e. GLTLGAQFTGNNDPQNADRSN (21 mer) and FKPSLAYLRTDVKDNARGI DDTATEY (26 mer) bearing B-cell binding sites were selected.

Previous research suggests that self-compassion is negatively correlated with distress and positively correlated with wellbeing among healthy young people, as well as adults with chronic medical conditions. The current study aimed to extend these findings to a sample of adolescents and young adults with chronic medical conditions. This study also aimed to replicate findings observed in other populations by testing emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator of this relationship. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 25 with chronic physical medical conditions (N = 107) completed an online survey including measures of self-compassion, emotion-regulation, wellbeing, and distress. Two mediation models were tested using the PROCESS macro in SPSS, with distress and wellbeing as outcomes. RESULTS: Self-compassion had a significant direct negative association with distress and a significant direct positive association with wellbeing. While self-compassion and emotion regulation difficulties explained a large amount of variance in both wellbeing, R(2) = .31, p < .001, and distress, R(2) = .46, p < .001, no support was found for the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties between self-compassion and wellbeing. However, emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between self-compassion and distress.

Efficient extraction of the viral RNA and removal of interfering sample matrices are critical to the subsequent reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. We emphasize the importance of implementing appropriate controls and method validation, which include the use of surrogate viruses for assessing extraction efficiency and normalization against measurable chemical and biological components in wastewater.

Within a BlackCrit framework, we shake the grounds of the computer science field, where technologies are often promoted as objective, but reflect and reproduce existing inequalities. In tune with maintaining current systems of power, efforts to broaden participation in computer science have been heavily driven by industry, government, and military interests.

The objective of the current study was to gain a better understanding of Cuban hunters' general hunting practices, focusing on their knowledge and risk perception on avian influenza. An anonymous and voluntary semi-structured questionnaire was designed and applied to 398 hunters. Multiple correspondence analyses found relationships with potential exposure of AIVs to people and domestic animals. The main associated risks factors identified were not taking the annual flu vaccine (60.1%) and not cleaning hunting knives (26.3%); Direct contact with water (32.1%), cleaning wild birds at home (33.2%); receiving assistance during bird cleaning (41.9%), keeping poultry at home (56.5%) and feeding domestic animals with wild bird leftovers (30.3%) were also identified as significant risk factors. The lack of use of some protective measures reported by hunters had no relationship with their awareness on avian influenza, which may imply a lack of such knowledge.

Due to a significant focus on similar functions and structures, there appears to be much for origins of life researchers to learn from those working on LLPS in applicational fields, and vice versa, and we hope that such researchers can start meaningful cross-disciplinary collaborations in the future.","Jia, Tony Z; Wang, Po-Hsiang; Niwa, Tatsuya; Mamajanov, Irena",J Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8342986/,773
56629,Multiple drugs: Hepatic steatosis: case report,2021-08-07,"The change from face-to-face work to teleworking caused by the pandemic has induced multiple workers to spend more time than usual in front of a computer; in addition, the sudden installation of workstations in homes means that not all of them meet the necessary characteristics for the worker to be able to position himself/herself comfortably with the correct posture in front of their computer. Furthermore, from the point of view of the medical personnel in charge of occupational risk prevention, an automated tool able to quantify the degree of incorrectness of a postural habit in a worker is needed. For this purpose, in this work, a system based on the postural detection of the worker is designed, implemented and tested, using a specialized hardware system that processes video in real time through convolutional neural networks. This system is capable of detecting the posture of the neck, shoulders and arms, providing recommendations to the worker in order to prevent possible health problems, due to poor posture. The results of the proposed system show that this video processing can be carried out in real time (up to 25 processed frames/sec) with a low power consumption (less than 10 watts) using specialized hardware, obtaining an accuracy of over 80% in terms of the pattern detected.","Piñero-Fuentes, Enrique; Canas-Moreno, Salvador; Rios-Navarro, Antonio; Domínguez-Morales, Manuel; Sevillano, José Luis; Linares-Barranco, Alejandro",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347472/,773

It was based on a great number of animal studies. However, except for information from animal studies, there are merely any data of human studies for reference. METHODS: This study was conducted by a unique database including 1.6 million diabetic patients. From 1999 to 2013, a total of 145,327 type 2 diabetic patients, first admitted for sepsis, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was conducted in a 1 : 5 ratio between pioglitazone users and nonusers. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of hospital mortality in pioglitazone users. Further stratification analysis was done and Kaplan–Meier plot was used. RESULTS: A total of 9,310 sepsis pioglitazone users (defined as “ever” use of pioglitazone in any dose within 3 months prior to the first admission for sepsis) and 46,550 matched nonusers were retrieved, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the cohort of pioglitazone users (9,310) had a decreased aOR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89–1.02) of sepsis mortality. Further stratification analysis demonstrated that “chronic pioglitazone users” (defined as “at least” 4-week drug use within 3 months) (3,399) were more associated with significant aOR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.72–0.89) in reducing sepsis mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This first human cohort study demonstrated the potential protective effect of chronic pioglitazone use in type 2 diabetic sepsis patients.","Hsieh, Ming-Shun; Hu, Sung-Yuan; Liao, Shu-Hui; Chang, Chia-Ming; Hsieh, Vivian Chia-Rong; How, Chorng-Kuang",Emerg Med Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363455/,773

However, there is no consensus in the literature on what constitutes appropriate state intervention in this area. The article therefore develops a conceptual framework to empirically determine the restrictive character of state intervention more precisely. We make plausible our conceptual argument based on six short case studies on Germany, Austria, Turkey, Hungary, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In doing so, we contribute to the debate on shrinking civic spaces in three ways. First, we show that legal measures regarding foreign funding of civil society should not always be seen as part of a global repressive trend. Second, we propose a new classification of legal measures that goes beyond the hitherto dominant binary understanding that, especially regarding the Global South, assumes repressive tendencies to any adaptation of legal measures. Thirdly, we attempt to link a view of international human rights on the freedom of association with a perspective focused on national constitutional norms, to draw attention to the existing legal normative differences between these two levels in many countries around the world.","Richter, Thomas; Johansson, Jessica; Castro, Silvia Rojas",Z Politikwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8365273/,773

This paper examined the policy landscape around these efforts by exploring the following research questions: (1) What policy goals that may impact the availability of low-cost, basic bank accounts that have been introduced in Congress as legislation? (2) How far in the legislative process did the legislation advance? (3) What populations did these proposed laws target? and (4) What related policy goals were pursued most ardently over the past 20 years? We conducted a policy mapping content analysis of all bank account-related bills (N = 32) proposed in Congress between 1999 and 2020 (May) (106th–116th Congresses). Two researchers independently coded basic characteristics (e.g., type, status, sponsorship), focal populations, and illustrative mechanisms for policy goals using a taxonomy developed by the researchers. Researchers compared codes and addressed discrepancies through consensus. New codes were created as needed. Goals appearing most often were expanding access to bank accounts (81.2%), increasing consumer protection (81.2%), and reducing costs of basic accounts (78.2%). Increasing consumer disclosure (37.5%) and expanding the type of institutions that offer basic accounts (9.4%) were addressed infrequently in the legislation. No legislation addressed the policy goal of expanding account access in minority populations and communities. Explicit attention toward unbanked and underbanked households, racial/ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable populations was rare. This study represents the first systematic analysis of key features of the US congressional response to the problem of affordability and accessibility of bank accounts.

To find new anticonvulsive medications, we evaluated FDA‐approved drugs not known to be anticonvulsants. Using zebrafish larvae as an initial model system, we found that the opioid antagonist naltrexone exhibited an anticonvulsant effect. We validated this effect in three other epilepsy models and present naltrexone as a promising anticonvulsive candidate. METHODS: Candidate anticonvulsant drugs, determined by our prior transcriptomics analysis of hippocampal tissue, were evaluated in a larval zebrafish model of human Dravet syndrome (scn1Lab mutants), in wild‐type zebrafish larvae treated with the pro‐convulsant drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), in wild‐type C57bl/6J acute brain slices exposed to PTZ, and in wild‐type mice treated with PTZ in vivo. Abnormal locomotion was determined behaviorally in zebrafish and mice and by field potential in neocortex layer IV/V and CA1 stratum pyramidale in the hippocampus. RESULTS: The opioid antagonist naltrexone decreased abnormal locomotion in the larval zebrafish model of human Dravet syndrome (scn1Lab mutants) and wild‐type larvae treated with the pro‐convulsant drug PTZ. Naltrexone also decreased seizure‐like events in acute brain slices of wild‐type mice, and the duration and number of seizures in adult mice injected with PTZ. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data reveal that naltrexone has anticonvulsive properties and is a candidate drug for seizure treatment.","Sturgeon, Morgan L.; Langton, Rachel; Sharma, Shaunik; Cornell, Robert A.; Glykys, Joseph; Bassuk, Alexander G.",Epilepsia Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408599/,773

The purpose of this study is to update the literature on United States technology-assisted TKA trends of national utilization, regional utilization, and 90-day complication rates requiring readmission. METHODS: Patients who underwent primary, elective TKA between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively identified in the PearlDiver All Payer Claims Database (PearlDiver Technologies Inc.). TKAs were classified as conventional, CAN, or RA based on International Classification of Diseases nineth or tenth revision and Current Procedural Technology codes. Annual rates and regional trends of each type of TKA were reported. Ninety-day complications requiring readmission for each group were captured. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify odds ratios (OR) for all-cause readmission based on TKA modality. RESULTS: Of the 1,307,411 elective TKAs performed from 2010 to 2018, 92.8% were conventional, and 7.7% were technology-assisted (95.2% CAN and 4.9% RA). RA-TKA had the greatest increase in utilization (+2204%). The Western region had the highest utilization of technologies for TKA, while the Midwestern region had the lowest. Ninety-day postoperative complications requiring readmission were highest for conventional TKA and lowest for RA-TKA. RA-TKA (OR 0.68; 97.5% confidence interval 0.56-0.83, P < .001) and CAN-TKA (OR 0.93; 97.5% confidence interval 0.88-0.97, P < .05) had significantly lower odds of all-cause 90-day complications requiring readmission than conventional TKA. CONCLUSION: Utilization of RA-TKA and CAN-TKA continues to rise across the United States.

Using a pseudo first order approach, the rate of the redox reaction resulted to first order with respect to the [acriflavine, (AF)] and [l-cysteine, (CSH)] and second order total. Stoichiometric determination confirms that a mole of the acriflavine is consumed by a mole of l-cysteine at a time for the attainment of product formation.

However, the early phases of emergence can hinge upon ecological sustainability of the virus population, which is a product of both within-host population growth and between-host transmission. Insufficient growth or transmission can force virus extinction before the latter phases of emergence, where genetic adaptations that improve host use may occur. We examined the early phase of emergence by studying the population dynamics of RNA phages in replicated laboratory environments containing native and novel host bacteria. To predict the breadth of transmission rates allowing viral persistence on each species, we developed a simple model based on in vitro data for phage growth rate over a range of initial population densities on both hosts. Validation of these predictions using serial passage experiments revealed a range of transmission rates for which the native host was a source and the novel host was a sink. In this critical range of transmission rates, periodic exposure to the native host was sufficient for the maintenance of the viral population on the novel host. We argue that this effect should facilitate adaptation by the virus to utilize the novel host--often crucial in subsequent phases of emergence.","Dennehy, John J; Friedenberg, Nicholas A; Holt, Robert D; Turner, Paul E",The American naturalist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16673350/,773
