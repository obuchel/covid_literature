2213,2213,2213,The Saudi Thoracic Society pneumococcal vaccination guidelines-2016,18.264818,8.217178,2016,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Saudi Arabia is a host to millions of pilgrims who travel annually from all over the world for Umrah and the Hajj pilgrimages and are at risk of developing pneumococcal pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). There is also the risk of transmission of S. pneumoniae including antibiotic resistant strains between pilgrims and their potential global spread upon their return. The country also has unique challenges posed by susceptible population to IPD due to people with hemoglobinopathies, younger age groups with chronic conditions, and growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Since the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease is constantly changing, with an increase in nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes, vaccination policies on the effectiveness and usefulness of vaccines require regular revision. As part of the Saudi Thoracic Society (STS) commitment to promote the best practices in the field of respiratory diseases, we conducted a review of S. pneumoniae infections and the best evidence base available in the literature. The aim of the present study is to develop the STS pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. We recommend vaccination against pneumococcal infections for all children <5 years old, adults ≥50 years old, and people ≥6 years old with certain risk factors. These recommendations are based on the presence of a large number of comorbidities in Saudi Arabia population <50 years of age, many of whom have risk factors for contracting pneumococcal infections. A section for pneumococcal vaccination before the Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages is included as well.","Alharbi, N. S.; Al-Barrak, A. M.; Al-Moamary, M. S.; Zeitouni, M. O.; Idrees, M. M.; Al-Ghobain, M.

Regional alterations in permeability can also be noted using this radionuclide technique. We have measured the pulmonary epithelial permeability in normal subjects and the alteration in smokers, in glue-sniffers, in patients with inhalation burns, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in patients with lung metastases from thyroid cancer treated with radioiodine(131)I. In the normal volunteers, the time taken for 50% of inhaled(99m)Tc DTPA to be cleared from the lungs (T1/2) was 66 minutes ± lsd of 12 mins. The smokers had a mean T1/2 of 20 mins ± lsd 4 min. In the hard-core glue-sniffing group, the majority were smokers who had stopped smoking and gluesniffing for periods varying from 1 day to 42 days, and it was possible to note the changes in clearance times against period of abstinence. In the patients with inhalation burns, there was change in lung clearance arising from pulmonary epithelial damage; these patients showed increased rate of clearance (short T1/2) with mean T1/2 of 36 min ± 1 sd of 11 mins, while the retention images revealed regional lung damage in moderately severe inhalation burns. Twenty-four patients with COPD had inhalation scans done with Tc-99m tin colloid radioaerosol, and these images were compared with the perfusion lung scans done with(99m)Tc macroaggregated albumin (MAA); in general the perfusion images matched the defects noted in the inhalation scans. The(99m)Tc DTPA clearance rate in these patients was normal i.e. T1/2 = 78 ± 14 mins. In the thyroid cancer patients with lung metastases, who had high doses of radioiodine treatment, the T1/2 values were normal or prolonged slightly, mean T1/2 = 76 min ± 23.","Sundram, Felix X.",Ann Nucl Med,343,1

We investigated the influence of exogenous NO on airway responsiveness to acetylcholine aerosols (ACH) in normal and in hyperresponsive rabbits. White New Zealand rabbits were anesthetized, intubated, and breathed room air spontaneously. Responses of respiratory parameters in ACH challenge tests were measured. In group A the influence of NO on ACH infusion-induced airway constriction was measured. Airway responses to aerosols from 0.25 to 8.0% ACH solutions in saline were measured with 150 and 300 ppm NO inhalation (groups B and C) and compared with the same animals' responses without NO. Moreover, we examined the influence of NO synthase inhibition on airway responsiveness (group D) and the modulatory effect of NO in hyperresponsive animals (group E). 300 ppm NO inhalation significantly decreased the bronchoconstrictor response to intravenously administered ACH (group A). However, the baseline value of dynamic elastance (E(dyn)) was only marginally lower under the influence of 300 ppm NO. During inhalation of 150 or 300 ppm NO, responses to nebulized 2.0% and less ACH solutions remained nearly unaltered. Responses to aerosols of 4.0 and 8.0% diminished significantly (groups B and C). Following 40 min of aerosolized N-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME) solution (a NO synthase inhibitor, 1.2 mM) inhalation, the response of E(dyn) to ACH increased significantly in group D. In group E, animals inhaled 500 mg/m(3) ammonium persulfate (APS), an oxidant with various industrial applications, after the first ACH challenge test (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0% ACH). After 2 h of APS exposure, the ACH-induced broncho constriction was increased significantly in the challenge test. After another 2 h of APS inhalation, the airway responsiveness to ACH was tested under the influence of 300 ppm NO. NO significantly decreased the response to ACH to almost the same level as before APS exposure. The results indicate that responses to high ACH concentrations as well as an APS-induced increase in ACH responsiveness were effectively reduced by high concentrations of inhaled NO.","Mensing, T.; Marek, W.; Baur, X.",Lung,343,17

We examined the “metavirome” of four populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016 to 2017 in Manatee County, FL. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak. IMPORTANCE Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from countries where the disease is endemic. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks has been largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of DENV4 transmission to and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental United States in the absence of a human case during two consecutive years. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high-tourism areas of the United States may enable proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks.","Boyles, Sean M.; Mavian, Carla N.; Finol, Esteban; Ukhanova, Maria; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Hamerlinck, Gabriela; Kang, Seokyoung; Baumgartner, Caleb; Geesey, Mary; Stinton, Israel; Williams, Katie; Mathias, Derrick K.; Prosperi, Mattia; Mai, Volker; Salemi, Marco; Buckner, Eva A.; Lednicky, John A.; Rivers, Adam R.; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.",mSphere,343,22

The availability of a competency profile for this workforce supports efficient education and training. Although competency profiles for infectious disease control professionals are available, none addresses the complex airport environment. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a competency profile for professionals involved in infectious disease preparedness and response at airports in order to stimulate and direct further education and training. METHODS: We developed the competency profile through the following steps: 1) extraction of competencies from relevant literature, 2) assessment of the profile in a national RAND modified Delphi study with an interdisciplinary expert group (n = 9) and 3) assessment of the profile in an international RAND modified Delphi study with an airport infectious disease management panel of ten European countries (n = 10). RESULTS: We systematically studied two competency profiles on infectious disease control and three air transport guidelines on event management, and extracted 61 relevant competencies for airports. The two RAND modified Delphi procedures further refined the profile, mainly by specifying a competency’s target group, the organizational level it should be present on, and the exact actions that should be mastered. The final profile, consisting of 59 competencies, covers the whole process from infectious disease preparedness, through the response phase and the recovery at airports. CONCLUSION: We designed a profile to support training and exercising the multidisciplinary group of professionals in infectious disease management in the airport setting, and which is ready for use in practice. The many adaptations and adjustments that were needed to develop this profile out of existing profiles and air transport guidelines suggest that other setting-specific profiles in infectious disease control are desirable.","de Rooij, Doret; Rebel, Rebekka; Raab, Jörg; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos; Belfroid, Evelien; Timen, Aura",PLoS One,343,1

Methods Escalating doses of RO4929097 and temsirolimus were administered at three dose levels. Patients received once daily oral RO4929097 on a 3 days on/4 days off schedule every week, and weekly intravenous temsirolimus. Blood samples were collected for PK analysis. Archival tissue specimens were collected for Notch pathway biomarker analysis and genotyping of frequent oncogenic mutations. Results Seventeen patients with refractory advanced solid tumors were enrolled in three dose levels (DLs): DL1 (RO4929097 10 mg; Temsirolimus 25 mg), DL2 (RO4929097 20 mg; Temsirolimus 25 mg), and DL3 (RO4929097 20 mg; Temsirolimus 37.5 mg). The most common toxicities related to the study drug combination included: fatigue (82 %; grade 3 6 %), mucositis, (71 %; grade 3 6 %), neutropenia (59 %; grade 3 12 %), anemia (59 %; grade 3 0 %), and hypertriglyceridemia (59 %; grade 3 0 %). Two dose-limiting toxicities, grade 3 rash and grade 3 mucositis, were observed in the same patient in the first dose level prompting dose expansion. Eleven patients (73 %) had stable disease as their best response. Co-administration of RO4929097 was associated with increased clearance and reduced exposure to temsirolimus, suggestive of drug-drug interaction via CYP3A4 induction. No correlation between the expression of Notch pathway biomarkers or genotype and time to progression was noted. Conclusions RO4929097 can be safely combined with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors. The RP2D was established at 20 mg of RO4929097 combined with 37.5 mg of temsirolimus.

Dual-process models propose that, among substance users, implicit or automatically activated neurocognitive processes gain in relative influence on substance use behavior, while the influence of cognitive control or reflective processes weakens. There is evidence that a variety of implicit cognitive processes, such as attentional bias, biased action tendencies (approach bias), memory bias and at a neural level, cue reactivity, are associated with adolescent substance use. The impact of these implicit processes on the further development of addictive behaviors appears to depend on moderating factors, such as (premorbid) executive control functions. Clear negative effects of adolescent substance use on executive control functions generally have not been found using behavioral tasks, although some studies have identified subtle and specific effects on cognitive functioning.","Wiers, Reinout W.; Boelema, Sarai R.; Nikolaou, Kiki; Gladwin, Thomas E.",Curr Addict Rep,343,12

This study aimed to identify the proportion of patients among low-risk PTC patients who do not require hormone replacement therapy and to evaluate the risk factors for postoperative hypothyroidism after lobectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 190 PTC patients who underwent thyroid lobectomy from January 2017 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathological characteristics and follow-up data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with postoperative hypothyroidism and the recovery of thyroid function. RESULTS: In summary, 74.21% of patients (141/190) had normal thyroid function without levothyroxine supplementation, while 40.53% (77/190) developed temporary or permanent hypothyroidism. Multivariate analysis indicated that higher preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (>2.62 mIU/L), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), and right lobectomy were associated with hypothyroidism (all P<0.05). The Area Under Curve (AUC) by logistic analysis was 0.829. Twenty-eight (28/77, 36.4%) patients recovered to the euthyroid state in the first year after surgery, and this recovery was significantly associated with preoperative TSH level. Forty-nine (49/77, 63.6%) patients developed persistent hypothyroidism. The thyroid function of most patients (11/28, 39.3%) recovered in the third month after surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients with a lower level of preoperative TSH, with left lobectomy and without Hashimoto’s thyroiditis had a higher chance of normal thyroid function within the first year after lobectomy. The recovery of thyroid function was associated with the level of preoperative TSH.","Dou, Yi; Chen, Yingji; Hu, Daixing; Su, Xinliang",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),343,5

Although vaccine skepticism is not new, social media has amplified public concerns and facilitated their spread globally. Multiple studies have been conducted to monitor vaccination discussions on social media. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the best methods to perform social media monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the methods most commonly used for monitoring vaccination-related topics on different social media platforms, along with their effectiveness and limitations. METHODS: A systematic scoping review was conducted by applying a comprehensive search strategy to multiple databases in December 2018. The articles’ titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened by two reviewers using inclusion and exclusion criteria. After data extraction, a descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the methods used to monitor and analyze social media, including data extraction tools; ethical considerations; search strategies; periods monitored; geolocalization of content; and sentiments, content, and reach analyses. RESULTS: This review identified 86 articles on social media monitoring of vaccination, most of which were published after 2015. Although 35 out of the 86 studies used manual browser search tools to collect data from social media, this was time-consuming and only allowed for the analysis of small samples compared to social media application program interfaces or automated monitoring tools. Although simple search strategies were considered less precise, only 10 out of the 86 studies used comprehensive lists of keywords (eg, with hashtags or words related to specific events or concerns). Partly due to privacy settings, geolocalization of data was extremely difficult to obtain, limiting the possibility of performing country-specific analyses. Finally, 20 out of the 86 studies performed trend or content analyses, whereas most of the studies (70%, 60/86) analyzed sentiments toward vaccination. Automated sentiment analyses, performed using leverage, supervised machine learning, or automated software, were fast and provided strong and accurate results. Most studies focused on negative (n=33) and positive (n=31) sentiments toward vaccination, and may have failed to capture the nuances and complexity of emotions around vaccination. Finally, 49 out of the 86 studies determined the reach of social media posts by looking at numbers of followers and engagement (eg, retweets, shares, likes). CONCLUSIONS: Social media monitoring still constitutes a new means to research and understand public sentiments around vaccination. A wide range of methods are currently used by researchers. Future research should focus on evaluating these methods to offer more evidence and support the development of social media monitoring as a valuable research design.","Karafillakis, Emilie; Martin, Sam; Simas, Clarissa; Olsson, Kate; Takacs, Judit; Dada, Sara; Larson, Heidi Jane",JMIR Public Health Surveill,343,1

There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD. As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins (n=645) than uninfected ticks (n=376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. CONCLUSION: Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H(2)O(2) that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H(2)O(2), and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H(2)O(2) killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.

The occurrence of disease is often linked with the systemic invasion of the pathogen. Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), one of the key enzymes of glycolysis, was reported as a surface multifunctional molecule in several bacteria. Here, we investigated whether GAPDH could manifest binary functions; as an adhesin to promote colonization as well as a plasminogen receptor functioning in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation to promote systemic invasion. The surface localization of GAPDH was observed in M. hyorhinis with flow cytometry and colony blot analysis. Recombinant GAPDH (rGAPDH) was found to be able to bind porcine-derived PK-15 and human-derived NCI-H292 cells. The incubation with anti-GAPDH antibody significantly decreased the adherence of M. hyorhinis to both cell lines. To investigate its function in recruiting plasminogen, firstly, the interaction between rGAPDH and plasminogen was demonstrated by ELISA and Far-Western blot assay. The activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen into plasmin was proved by using a chromogenic substrate, and furtherly confirmed to degrade extracellular matrix by using a reconstituted ECM. Finally, the ability of rGAPDH to bind different ECM components was demonstrated, including fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and vitronectin. Collectively, our data imply GAPDH as an important adhesion factor of M. hyrohinis and a receptor for hijacking host plasminogen to degrade ECM. The multifunction of GAPDH to bind both plasminogen and ECM components is believed to increase the targeting of proteolysis and facilitate the dissemination of M. hyorhinis.

A widely-publicised falsified vaccine case in 2016, coupled with a significant financial deficit in the national insurance system, has contributed to concern that the rapid scale-up of UHC might undermine medicine quality. We investigated the political and economic factors that drive production and trade of poor-quality medicines in Indonesia. METHODS: We reviewed academic publications, government regulations, technical agency documents and news reports to develop a semi-structured questionnaire. We interviewed healthcare providers, policy-makers, medicine regulators, pharmaceutical manufacturers, patients and academics (n=31). We included those with in-depth knowledge about the falsified vaccine case or the pharmaceutical business, medicine regulation, prescribing practice and the implementation of UHC. We coded data using NVivo software and analysed by constant comparative method. RESULTS: The scale-up of UHC has cut revenues for physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the vaccine case, free, quality-assured vaccines were available but some physicians, seeking extra revenue, promoted expensive alternatives. Taking advantage of poor governance in private hospitals, they purchased cut-price ‘vaccines’ from freelance salespeople. A single-winner public procurement system which does not explicitly consider quality has slashed the price paid for covered medicines. Trade, industrial and religious policies simultaneously increased production costs, pressuring profit margins for manufacturers and distributors. They reacted by cutting costs (potentially threatening quality) or by market withdrawal (leading to shortages which provide a market for falsifiers). Shortages and physician-promoted irrational demand push patients to buy medicines in unregulated channels, increasing exposure to falsified medicines. CONCLUSION: Market factors, including political pressure to reduce medicine prices and healthcare provider incentives, can drive markets for substandard and falsified medicines. To protect progress towards UHC, policy-makers must consider the potential impact on medicine quality when formulating rules governing health financing, procurement, taxation and industry.","Hasnida, Amalia; Kok, Maarten Olivier; Pisani, Elizabeth",BMJ Glob Health,343,1

We conducted a nationwide survey to assess the research misconduct among the medical faculty members in Iran. METHODS: We used the Persian version of the research misconduct questionnaire (PRMQ) on the Google Forms platform. We sent the survey link to a systematic random sample of medical faculty members in Iran (N = 4986). Descriptive analyses were performed on the individual items of the PRMQ, with frequencies and percentages for categorical and Likert-type response items, and means and standard deviation (S.D.) for continuous variables. Chi-square analysis was conducted to test hypotheses examining differences in the frequency of responses related to factors influencing misconduct. We also defined four tenure categories (TC) based on the working years of the participants as tenured faculty members. All the analyses were performed using R 3.6.0. RESULTS: The response rate was 13.8% (692 responses). Nearly 70% of the respondents agreed that their publication output would be of higher quality if there were no publication pressure. Approximately three-quarters (N =499, 72.1%) of the respondents had been aware of some instances of research misconduct during the previous year according to their understanding of misconduct. Among the participants, 18.5% perceived the effectiveness of their associated organisation’s rules for reducing research misconduct to be high or very high. Pressure for tenure was identified as the item most frequently perceived with a strong behavioural influence on engaging in research misconduct (80.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that research misconduct needs to be actively addressed among the medical faculty members. Making policies with a focus on boosting awareness regarding the occasions of scientific misconduct and its management seems to be indispensable in the future in Iran.

Long-term outcomes and adequate treatment frequency of the recently recommended albendazole-ivermectin have not been studied to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Double-blind randomized controlled trials were conducted in Lao PDR, Pemba Island, Tanzania and Côte d’Ivoire between 2018 and 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole versus albendazole-placebo in Trichuris trichiura-infected individuals aged 6 to 60. In the framework of this study, in Lao PDR 466 and 413 participants and on Pemba Island, 558 and 515 participants were followed-up six and 12 months post-treatment, respectively. From each participant at least one stool sample was processed for Kato-Katz diagnosis and cure rates (CRs), egg reduction rates (ERRs) and apparent reinfection rates were calculated. If found helminth-positive at six months, participants were re-treated according to their allocated treatment. Long-term outcomes against T. trichiura based on CRs and ERRs of ivermectin-albendazole compared to albendazole were significantly higher at six months in Lao PDR (CR, 65.8 vs 13.4%, difference; 52.4; 95% CI 45.0–60.0; ERRs, 99.0 vs 79.6, difference 19.4; 95% CI 14.4–24.4) and Pemba Island (CR, 17.8 vs 1.4%, difference; 16.4; 95% CI 11.6–21.0; ERRs, 84.9 vs 21.2, difference 63.8; 95% CI 50.6–76.9) and also at 12 months in Lao PDR (CR, 74.0 vs 23.4%, difference; 50.6; 95% CI 42.6–61.0; ERRs, 99.6 vs 91.3, difference 8.3; 95% CI 5.7–10.8) and Pemba Island (CR, 19.5 vs 3.4%, difference; 16.1; 95% CI 10.7–21.5; ERRs, 92.9 vs 53.6, difference 39.3; 95% CI 31.2–47.4) respectively. Apparent reinfection rates with T. trichiura were considerably higher on Pemba Island (100.0%, 95% CI, 29.2–100.0) than in Lao PDR (10.0%, 95% CI, 0.2–44.5) at 12 months post-treatment for participants treated with albendazole alone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term outcomes against T. trichiura of ivermectin-albendazole are superior to albendazole in terms of CRs and ERRs and in reducing infection intensities. Our results will help to guide decisions on how to best use ivermectin-albendazole in the context of large-scale PC programs tailored to the local context to sustainably control STH infections.

Comprehensively dissecting the molecular characterization and the heterogeneity of ESCC paves the way for developing more promising therapeutics. METHODS: Expression profiles of multiple ESCC datasets were integrated. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq were combined to reveal the chromatin accessibility features. A prognosis-related subtype classifier (PrSC) was constructed, and its association with the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immunotherapy was assessed. The key gene signature was validated in clinical samples. Based on the TME heterogeneity of ESCC patients, potential subtype-specific therapeutic agents were screened. FINDINGS: The common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) in ESCC were identified. Up-regulated genes (HEATR1, TIMELESS, DTL, GINS1, RUVBL1, and ECT2) were found highly important in ESCC cell survival. The expression alterations of PRIM2, HPGD, NELL2, and TFAP2B were associated with chromatin accessibility changes. PrSC was a robust scoring tool that was not only associated with the prognosis of ESCC patients, but also could reflect the TME heterogeneity. TNS1(high) fibroblasts were associated with immune exclusion. TG-101348 and Vinorelbine were identified as potential subtype-specific therapeutic agents. Besides, the application of PrSC into two immunotherapy cohorts indicated its potential value in assessing treatment response to immunotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Our study depicted the multi-dimensional characterization of ESCC, established a robust scoring tool for the prognosis assessment, highlighted the role of TNS1(high) fibroblasts in TME, and identified potential drugs for clinical use.

Several animal models have been used to 1) study coronary atherosclerosis natural history and 2) propose predictive tools for this disease, that is asymptomatic for a long time, aiming for a direct translation of their findings to human coronary arteries. Among them, swine models are largely used due to the observed anatomical and pathophysiological similarities to humans. However, a direct comparison between swine and human models in terms of coronary hemodynamics, known to influence atherosclerotic onset/development, is still lacking. In this context, we performed a detailed comparative analysis between swine- and human-specific computational hemodynamic models of coronary arteries. The analysis involved several near-wall and intravascular flow descriptors, previously emerged as markers of coronary atherosclerosis initiation/progression, as well as anatomical features. To do that, non-culprit coronary arteries (18 right–RCA, 18 left anterior descending–LAD, 13 left circumflex–LCX coronary artery) from patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome were imaged by intravascular ultrasound and coronary computed tomography angiography. Similarly, the three main coronary arteries of ten adult mini-pigs were also imaged (10 RCA, 10 LAD, 10 LCX). The geometries of the imaged coronary arteries were reconstructed (49 human, 30 swine), and computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed by imposing individualized boundary conditions. Overall, no relevant differences in 1) wall shear stress-based quantities, 2) intravascular hemodynamics (in terms of helical flow features), and 3) anatomical features emerged between human- and swine-specific models. The findings of this study strongly support the use of swine-specific computational models to study and characterize the hemodynamic features linked to coronary atherosclerosis, sustaining the reliability of their translation to human vascular disease.","De Nisco, Giuseppe; Chiastra, Claudio; Hartman, Eline M.

Immunophenotyping of tumors is an essential tool to evaluate the immune function of patients with immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. Therefore, this study aims to find the potential tumor antigen of LGG and identify the suitable population for cancer vaccination based on the immune landscape. METHOD: The genomic and clinical data of 529 patients with LGG were obtained from TCGA, the mRNA_seq data of normal brain tissue were downloaded from GTEx. Differential expression gene and mutation analysis were performed to screen out potential antigens, K-M curves were carried out to investigate the correlation between the level of potential antigens and OS and DFS of patients. TIMER dataset was used to explore the correlation between genes and immune infiltrating cells. Immunophenotyping of 529 tumor samples was based on the single-sample gene sets enrichment analysis. Cibersort and Estimate algorithm were used to explore the tumor immune microenvironment characteristics in each immune subtype. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) clustered immune-related genes and screened the hub genes, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the hub modules related to immune subtype in the WGCNA. RESULTS: Selecting for the mutated, up-regulated, prognosis- and immune-related genes, four potential tumor antigens were identified in LGG. They were also significantly positively associated with the antigen-presenting immune cells (APCs). Three robust immune subtypes, IS1, IS2 and IS3, represented immune status ""desert"", ""immune inhibition"", and ""inflamed"" respectively, which might serve as a predictive parameter. Subsequently, clinicopathological features, including the codeletion status of 1p19q, IDH mutation status, tumor mutation burden, tumor stemness, etc., were significantly different among subtypes. CONCLUSION: FCGBP, FLNC, TLR7, and CSF2RA were potential antigens for developing cancer vaccination, and the patients in IS3 were considered the most suitable for vaccination in LGG.

The aim of this work was to establish guidelines regarding the prioritization and optimal timing of each step of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction management. METHODS: A steering committee included urologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation practitioners. Based on a literature review and their own expertise, they established a comprehensive risk-situation list and built a risk scale, allowing multiple other experts to score each clinical situation. New recommendations were generated using a Delphi process approach. RESULTS: Forty-nine experts participated in the rating group. Among the 206 initial items, 163 were selected and divided into four domains, diagnosis and assessment, treatment, follow-up, and complications, and two sub-domains, general (applicable for all neurological conditions) and condition-specific [varying according to the neurological condition (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, Parkinsonism, dysraphism, lower motor neuron lesions)]. The resulted guidelines are expert opinions established by a panel of French-speaking specialists, which could limit the scalability of this work.

Worse still, there is a paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries to inform rational antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE: Assess the feasibility of setting up microbiology capacity for AMR testing and estimate the cost of setting up microbiology testing capacity at rural district hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: Laboratory needs assessments were conducted, and based on identified equipment gaps, appropriate requisitions were processed. Laboratory technicians were trained on microbiology testing processes and open wound samples were collected and cultured at the district hospital (DH) laboratories before being transported to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Quality control (QC) assessments were performed at the DHs and NRL. We then estimated the cost of three scenarios for implementing a decentralized microbiology diagnostic testing system. RESULTS: There was an eight-month delay from the completion of the laboratory needs assessments to the initiation of sample collection due to the regional unavailability of appropriate supplies and equipment. When comparing study samples processed by study laboratory technicians and QC samples processed by other laboratory staff, there was 85.0% test result concordance for samples testing at the DHs and 90.0% concordance at the NRL. The cost for essential equipment and supplies for the three DHs was $245,871. The estimated costs for processing 600 samples ranged from $29,500 to $92,590. CONCLUSION: There are major gaps in equipment and supply availability needed to conduct basic microbiology assays at rural DHs. Despite these challenges, we demonstrated that it is feasible to establish microbiological testing capacity in Rwandan DHs. Building microbiological testing capacity is essential for improving clinical care, informing rational antibiotics use, and ultimately, contributing to the establishment of robust national antimicrobial stewardship programs in rural Rwanda and comparable settings.","Umutesi, Grace; Velin, Lotta; Muwanguzi, Moses; Faktor, Kara; Mugabo, Carol; Rukundo, Gilbert; Rucogoza, Aniceth; Yankurije, Marthe; Mazimpaka, Christian; de Dieu Gatete, Jean; Shyirambere, Cyprien; Hedt-Gauthier, Bethany; Riviello, Robert; Mpunga, Tharcisse; Mwikarago, Emil Ivan; Kateera, Fredrick",,343,27

This study aims to assess preliminary evidence about how obesity surgery patients evaluate social inclusion and exclusion through a ball-tossing game called Cyberball, looking at the influence of early maladaptive schemas. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with a history of obesity surgery interventions and 44 controls were recruited for this study. A psychological evaluation was performed before and after the Cyberball task with self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: In the ostracism condition, significant differences were seen across all the patients’ fundamental psychological needs with less perceived ostracization (p = 0.001) even if they recognized less interaction via fewer ball tosses than controls. Moreover, the ostracism paradigm resulted in patients experiencing a higher urge to binge (p = 0.010) and a higher urge to restrain (p = 0.012) than controls. Looking at differences due to the Cyberball paradigm applied, clear differences emerged only between controls subgroups at the specific self-report scales applied, corroborating the reduced perception of the exclusion. As evidenced by the schema domains, the study found a connection between the impaired limits-schema domain and the drive to binge. CONCLUSION: The results show that obesity surgery patients reported different effects of the Cyberball task than controls. Different possible interpretations are discussed, and future directions for studies are exposed, both for the evaluation of social interactions effects and in the assessment of the role of specific cognitive schemas.

Identifying stable protein substructures experimentally is the only available option at the moment because no suitable method exists to extract this information from a protein sequence. In previous research, we examined the mechanics of E. coli Hsp70 and found four mechanically stable (S class) and three unstable substructures (U class). Of the total 603 residues in the folded domains of Hsp70, 234 residues belong to one of four mechanically stable substructures, and 369 residues belong to one of three unstable substructures. Here our goal is to develop a machine learning model to categorize Hsp70 residues using sequence information. We applied three supervised methods: logistic regression (LR), random forest, and support vector machine. The LR method showed the highest accuracy, 0.925, to predict the correct class of a particular residue only when context-dependent physico-chemical features were included. The cross-validation of the LR model yielded a prediction accuracy of 0.879 and revealed that most of the misclassified residues lie at the borders between substructures. We foresee machine learning models being used to identify stable substructures as candidates for building blocks to engineer new proteins.","Gala, Michal; Žoldák, Gabriel",Nanomaterials (Basel),343,1

The idea is to perform (non-)reachability queries for the test goals and extract test cases from resulting counterexamples. However, in case of realistic programs, even simple coverage criteria (e.g., branch coverage) force model checkers to deal with several hundreds or even thousands of test goals. Processing each of these test goals in isolation with model checking techniques does not scale. Therefore, our tool HybridTiger builds on recent ideas on multi-property verification. However, since every additional property (i.e., test goal) reduces the model checker’s abstraction possibilities, we split the set of all test goals into different partitions. In Test-Comp 2019, we applied a random partitioning strategy and used predicate analysis as model checking technique. In Test-Comp 2020, we improved our technique in two ways. First, we exploit domination information among control-flow locations in our partitioning strategy to group test goals being located on (preferably) similar paths. Second, we account to inherent weaknesses of the predicate analysis by applying a hybrid software model-checking approach that switches between explicit model checking and predicate-based model checking on-the-fly. Our tool HybridTiger is integrated into the software analysis framework CPAchecker.","Ruland, Sebastian; Lochau, Malte; Jakobs, Marie-Christine",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,343,1

Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.","Garay, Patricia M.; Chen, Alex; Tsukahara, Takao; Rodríguez Díaz, Jean Carlos; Kohen, Rafi; Althaus, J.

Yet, IPC knowledge gaps often receive little prominence in AMR research agendas. In this article, we construct IPC research priorities, in order to draw attention to these critical research needs. METHODS: We developed a 4-step framework to identify IPC knowledge gaps from literature (narrative review). These gaps were then translated into research priorities and sent to two groups of European IPC experts for validation and critique through an online survey. RESULTS: Seventy-nine publications were retrieved from the literature review, identifying fifteen IPC research gaps. Forty-four IPC experts, clustered in two groups, vetted them. The experts classified all research gaps as medium or high priority. Overall agreement between both groups was average (Kendall’s τ = 0.43), with strong alignment on the highest priorities: (i) the assessment of organizational, socio-economic, and behavioural barriers/facilitators for the implementation of IPC programmes, (ii) the impact of overcrowding on the spread of infections and (iii) the impact of infrastructural changes, at facility level, on the reduction of infections. Feedback from experts also identified an additional research gap on the interaction between the human and hospital microbiomes.

As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.","Ironside, Natasha; Jean, Walter C; Sack, Kenneth; Felbaum, Daniel; Syed, Hasan R",Neurosurgery,343,1

Consequently, this study purpose was to investigate novel therapeutic methods for cancer. The bacterial toxin can result in cell death throughout the induction of apoptosis in cancer cell lines. We evaluated apoptosis and the expression levels of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PC3, ACHN and HDF cell lines that were transfected with pCDNA3.1(+)-seh and empty plasmid. pCDNA3.1(+)-seh treatment showed overexpression of GAS5 (p = 0.0033 and p = 0.0033) in PC3 and ACHN cells, down regulation of PCA3 and NEAT1 (p = 0.0092 and p = 0.0097) in the PC3 cells, and down regulation of PVT1 and MALAT1 (p = 0.0239 and p = 0.0133) in the ACHN cells in comparison with the empty plasmid, but there was no significant effect on HDF normal cells. Additionally, this study data demonstrated that the cell adhesion was down regulated. The flow cytometry data showed transfection by pCDNA3.1 (+)-seh could elevate PC3 and ACHN cell apoptosis levels in comparison with empty plasmid.

Adequate levels of chlorine allow immediate elimination of harmful bacteria and viruses and provide a protective residual throughout the drinking water distribution network (DWDN). Therefore, a residual chlorine decay model was developed to predict chlorine levels in a real drinking water distribution network. The model allowed determining human exposure to drinking water with a deficit of residual chlorine, considering that it is currently necessary for the population to have clean water to combat coronavirus Covid 19. The chlorine bulk decay rates (kb) and the reaction constant of chlorine with the pipe wall (kw) were experimentally determined. Average kb and kw values of 3.7 d(− 1) and 0.066 m d(− 1) were obtained, respectively. The values of kb and kw were used in EPANET to simulate the chlorine concentrations in a DWDN. The residual chlorine concentrations simulated by the properly calibrated and validated model were notably close to the actual concentrations measured at different points of the DWDN. The results showed that maintaining a chlorine concentration of 0.87 mg L(− 1) in the distribution tank, the residual chlorine values in the nodes complied with the Ecuadorian standard (0.3 mg L(− 1)); meanwhile, about 45% of the nodes did not comply with what is recommended by the WHO as a mechanism to combat the current pandemic (0.5 mg L(− 1)). This study demonstrated that residual chlorine modeling is a valuable tool for monitoring water quality in the distribution network, allowing to control residual chlorine levels in this pandemic season.","García-Ávila, Fernando; Avilés-Añazco, Alex; Ordoñez-Jara, Juan; Guanuchi-Quezada, Christian; Flores del Pino, Lisveth; Ramos-Fernández, Lía",Sustain Environ Res,343,16

In Autumn 2019, IM gold was withdrawn by the manufacturer due to supply issues, without consultation of the Rheumatology community. As such, a group of patients with difficult to manage disease have lost a key DMARD. We aimed to assess the impact of the withdrawal of gold on the management of IA within Northumbria Healthcare Trust. Methods Retrospective case note review. Results We identified 37 patients on gold as of Autumn 2019; 16 for seropositive RA; 4 for PsA; 16 for seronegative RA and 1 for axial spondyloarthritis. 28 were taking gold monotherapy, with 3 receiving regular glucocorticoid in addition. Eight were taking gold in combination with a csDMARD and one in combination with rituximab. Data are currently available for 30 patients regarding the circumstances of gold initiation. Of these, all had received at least one alternative csDMARD which was either inefficacious or intolerable. Reasons for avoiding biologics were not documented in all cases; concerns regarding frequent chest infections were common and documented as a clear contraindication in 5. Follow up has been impacted by COVID-19; only 19 patients have had follow up within the last 6 months, 7 have not been followed up since gold cessation. Fourteen (37.8%) have commenced an alternative DMARD. Six of these have commenced a high cost drug; rituximab (3), adalimumab (2) or tofacitinib (1). Five have commenced hydroxychloroquine (with one subsequently switching to leflunomide),2 methotrexate and 1 minocycline. Seropositive RA and PsA patients are more likely to have commenced an alternative DMARD, 8/16 and 2/4 respectively; compared to 4/16 with seronegative RA. Of 23 patients who have not commenced alternative DMARDs, 17 have been reviewed following gold cessation; 3 were felt to need additional treatment; 1 has been deferred due to COVID-19 and 2 did not meet criteria for biologic treatment when assessed in early 2020 and subsequent follow up has been delayed. Fourteen patients were felt not to need an additional DMARD, although 1 required an increase in methotrexate and 6 continued co-prescribed DMARDs at the usual dose. Conclusion The majority of patients have not required additional treatment although for some patients this may reflect the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly restricted routine follow up. This unusual case of forced DMARD cessation highlights the fact that drug free remission is possible and the ongoing need for immunosuppression should be reviewed. This also raised the ethical question of weather it is right to cease the production of medication which for some patients may be the only effective treatment option. Disclosure J. Stanway: None. D.

This study explored trajectories of anxiety in parents of children and young people (CYP) with rheumatic diseases and adults with rheumatic diseases in the six months following March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods CYP and adults recruited to the international COVID-19 European Patient Registry, a parent-led, online, self-referred prospective cohort recruiting participants globally, were selected if enrolled within 20(th) March to 17th April 2020. Anxiety scores (0-10, 10=Highest anxiety) were collected weekly for up to 28 weeks and denoted parent anxiety in the CYP cohort and self-reported anxiety in the adult cohort. Group-based trajectory models explored anxiety clusters using censored-normal models in the CYP and adult populations, separately. Linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials were tested within 1 to 10 clusters and optimal models selected based on a combination of model fit (BIC), parsimony and clinical plausibility. Demographic (country, age, gender) and clinical (diagnosis, disease control, respiratory comorbidity, immunosuppressive therapy) information and COVID-19 mitigation behaviours (isolation, distancing, none) were collected at initial enrolment and compared between clusters using Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results Among 498 CYP and 2640 adults, most were female (65%, 89%) and from the UK (50%, 84%), respectively. The most common diagnoses were polyarticular JIA (37%) and oligoarticular JIA (29%) among CYP and RA among the adults (63%). Respiratory comorbidities were uncommon in the CYP (10%) and adult (17%) cohorts, and most were taking any immunosuppressive therapies (85%, 87%), respectively. As of March 2020, 88% and 79% were self-isolating, respectively. In both the parents of CYP and adult cohorts, four trajectory clusters were identified with similar patterns: Persistent extremely high anxiety (32%, 17%), persistent high anxiety (43%, 41%), high anxiety that marginally improved (25%, 32%) and moderate anxiety that improved (11%, 10%). Among CYP, few characteristics distinguished the clusters. However, in the adult cohort, clusters with greater and more persistent anxiety were associated with higher levels of respiratory comorbidities, higher use of immunosuppressive therapies, higher initial levels of self-isolation and slightly older age than those with lower or improving anxiety over time. Conclusion This study reports four trajectories of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic that are consistent across parents of CYP with rheumatic diseases and among adults with these conditions. Despite relatively lower risks for CYP, parental anxiety regarding COVID-19 was high and not associated with characteristics of their child or of their child's disease. Among adults with rheumatic diseases, greater anxiety was associated with risk factors potentially associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Disclosure S.J.W. Shoop-Worrall: None. S.M.M.

The purpose of this study was to compare first year (M1) and second year (M2) medical student perceptions and exam performance between ASYNCH and SYNCH‐delivered anatomy content. MATERIALS/METHODS: University of Ottawa M1 and M2 perceptions were surveyed (with both close‐ and open‐ended items) regarding musculoskeletal (MSK; delivered to M1) and gastrointestinal/reproductive (GI/REPRO; delivered to M2) anatomy content delivery in Fall 2020. In both cohorts, approximately 50% of the sessions were delivered in each of ASYNCH (prerecorded lectures) and SYNCH (real‐time Microsoft Teams lectures) formats. Final examinations were also analyzed, comparing items that related to content from ASYNCH and SYNCH formats, with 50% of exam items tied to each approach. For both M1 and M2 cohorts, both ASYNCH‐ and SYNCH‐related examination components featured image‐based, multiple choice question (MCQ) items, with similar proportions of structure identification items and clinical application items. RESULTS: In M1 (n=101; response rate = 62%) and M2 (n=66; response rate = 40%) groups, the percentage of students indicating a preference for ASYNCH, a preference for SYNCH, or no preference regarding content delivery, was 45%, 38%, and 18%, for M1 students, and 48%, 32%, and 20% for M2 students, respectively. Thematic analysis of open‐ended feedback revealed strengths (more engaging formative assessment; being part of a learning community) and limitations (technical issues; time‐inefficient; more difficult to review) of SYNCH delivery. Similarly, commentary also revealed strengths (time efficiency; flexibility/control) and limits (less engaging formative assessment) of ASYNCH delivery. Commentary also revealed that many students were fine with either approach. While some students noted their preferred approach was beneficial to their learning, assessment data revealed no statistical differences in class performance between ASYNCH‐ vs. SYNCH‐delivered content, for either M1 (MSK) or M2 (GI/REPRO) anatomy. CONCLUSION: While medical students may have indicated a slight preference for ASYNCH (vs. SYNCH) anatomy learning, medical students were generally satisfied with both approaches. While open‐ended commentary revealed strengths and limitations regarding both formats, the perceived notion that either SYNCH or ASYNCH was more beneficial to student learning was not supported by assessment data. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: This study provides evidence to suggest that both ASYNCH and SYNCH approaches are appropriate for delivering anatomy content to medical students, given unique strengths attributed to each format, and that both approaches lead to similar performance on knowledge assessments. As such, medical anatomy educators should feel confident in choosing either ASYNCH and/or SYNCH formats when delivering their lectures.","Ramnanan, Christopher; Di Lorenzo, Gabrielle; Dong, Selina; Pak, Victor; Visva, Samantha",FASEB J,343,16

FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the properties of the obtained hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogel is suitable for the delivery of many hydrophilic drugs or species. Using a multi-walled carbon nanotube modified-glassy carbon electrode (CNT-GCE), the loading and release conditions of Nile Blue (NB) as an electroactive compound were evaluated utilizing the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The effect of various parameters on the electrochemical signal of NB was investigated, and the optimal conditions for the efficient performance of hydrogel to delivery of NB were obtained. The electrocatalytic current values show linear dependence to NB concentration in the range of 0.098 – 0.971 μM while the detection limit of this electrochemical platform was 12.3 nM.

We have developed a single incision approach to LVH repair. The technique was introduced in clinical practice to any consenting patients who were candidates for a standard multi-port laparoscopic hernia repair. A consecutive series of patients was then followed to evaluate feasibility. METHODS Over an 8-month period, 14 patients (9 females, 5 males) underwent LVH repair by an academic surgeon. One of 2 access methods was used in each patient through a single 1.5-cm to 2-cm skin incision. One technique utilized two 5-mm ports with a temporarily placed 11-mm port for mesh insertion. The second technique utilized the SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk, CT). Standard or roticulating laparoscopic instruments were used with both techniques. RESULTS Range (mean) BMI: 23 to 59 (38), Age: 26 to 73 years (53), DURATION: 37 to 87 minutes (57), Defect size: 1cm to 8cm (2), 3 with Swiss-cheese defect hernias. The procedure was successfully performed in all patients. No conversions to a multiple-port approach or to an open procedure were necessary. There were no mortalities, major complications, or recurrences during the mean follow-up period of 4 weeks. CONCLUSION Single incision ventral hernia repair is technically feasible, effective, and reproducible. The technique is easy to master, and safe for any patient who is a candidate for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Further data collection with long-term follow-up will be needed to ensure equivalent outcomes. There will be demand for this approach by patients for cosmetic reasons, and it may serve as a bridge to natural orifice techniques.","Bower, Curtis E; Love, Katie M",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,343,1

This paper draws on my own experiences of working in the care industry, and data collected during a 4-month ethnography in a Domiciliary Care company. Analysis of these data indicates that three differing conceptualisations of care are influential within the setting: business, medical/professional and familial. These conceptualisations are not discrete, and their interconnections are evident both in the literature and the data. Although the literature emphasises the superiority of familial conceptualisations of care, a more complex picture arose within the data as carers used contextualised definitions of care to draw boundaries around their emotional resources, times and energies in ways which relate to business and medical/professional conceptualisations of care. By exploring these definitions of care, this paper illustrates the often hidden and unrecognised set of skills around emotional management that carers must use in their everyday work in order to care for their clients, challenging notions that care work is both unskilled and a natural capacity. The data also challenge assumptions that commodification is inherently inimical to providing good care. As the need for paid care increases, creating a definition of paid care which incorporates such unquantifiable aspects of care becomes of vital importance for both policy makers and researchers.","Harrison, Rosie",Medical humanities,343,19

This observational study aimed to identify demographic and morphologic factors associated with difficult FB intubation. METHODS We recruited 420 adult elective surgery patients undergoing tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Patients characteristics were recorded including age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, history of snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati score, upper lip bite test score, neck circumference and skinfold thickness, maximal neck flexion and extension angles, absence of teeth, Cormack and Lehane grade, presence of blood or secretions during intubation, as well as the inter-incisor, thyromental, sternothyroid, and manubriomental distances. The time (duration) needed to complete intubation (primary endpoint) and the number of attempts needed were correlated with these patient characteristics in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS Intubation was successful on the first attempt in 409/420 patients (97%). Seven patients (1.7%) needed more than one attempt. Failure to intubate with the FB occurred in four patients (1%). A correlation was found between intubation duration and visibility impaired by secretions or blood (P < 0.001), higher neck skinfold thickness (P < 0.001), and larger endotracheal tube diameter (relative to a constant 5.5 mm FB; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of secretions or blood that impair FB glottic visualization, a larger diameter endotracheal tube on the same size FB, as well as higher neck skinfold thickness may prolong the duration of FB intubation under general anesthesia.

Current therapies are focused on the treatment of inflammation; however, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies promoting neuroregeneration, particularly myelin repair. It is demonstrated that testosterone can act through neural androgen receptors and several clinical observations stimulated an interest in the potential protective effects of testosterone treatment for MS. Here, we sought to demonstrate the effects of a testosterone supplementation in testosterone-deficient men with relapsing-remitting MS. METHODS/DESIGN This report presents the rationale and methodology of TOTEM RRMS, a French, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial, which aims to prevent the progression of MS in men with low testosterone levels by administration of testosterone undecanoate, who were kept under natalizumab (Tysabri®) to overcome the anti-inflammatory effect of testosterone. Forty patients will be randomized into two groups receiving either a testosterone treatment (Nebido®) or a matching placebo. The intervention period for each group will last 66 weeks (treatment will be injected at baseline, week 6, and then every 12 weeks). The main objective is to determine the neuroprotective and remyelinating effects of testosterone using tensor diffusion imaging techniques and thalamic atrophy analyses. As secondary objectives, impacts of the testosterone supplementation will be studied using other conventional and unconventional MRI parameters and with clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION The action of testosterone is observed in different experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models and epidemiological studies in humans. However, despite several preclinical data and some small clinical trials in MS, clear evidence for a therapeutic effect of hormone therapy is still missing. Therefore, our goal is to demonstrate the effects of testosterone therapies in MS. As there is no effective treatment currently available on fatigue in MS, careful attention should also be paid to secondary endpoints: fatigue, cognitive functions, and other symptoms that may improve life quality.

Of >70 TRIMs, TRIM56 is a restriction factor of several positive-strand RNA viruses, including three members of the family Flaviviridae(yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus) and a human coronavirus (OC43), and this ability invariably depends upon the E3 ligase activity of TRIM56. However, the impact of TRIM56 on negative-strand RNA viruses remains unclear. Here, we show that TRIM56 puts a check on replication of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture but does not inhibit Sendai virus or human metapneumovirus, two paramyxoviruses. Interestingly, the anti-influenza virus activity was independent of the E3 ligase activity, B-box, or coiled-coil domain. Rather, deletion of a 63-residue-long C-terminal-tail portion of TRIM56 abrogated the antiviral function. Moreover, expression of this short C-terminal segment curtailed the replication of influenza viruses as effectively as that of full-length TRIM56. Mechanistically, TRIM56 was found to specifically impede intracellular influenza virus RNA synthesis. Together, these data reveal a novel antiviral activity of TRIM56 against influenza A and B viruses and provide insights into the mechanism by which TRIM56 restricts these medically important orthomyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE Options to treat influenza are limited, and drug-resistant influenza virus strains can emerge through minor genetic changes. Understanding novel virus-host interactions that alter influenza virus fitness may reveal new targets/approaches for therapeutic interventions. We show here that TRIM56, a tripartite-motif protein, is an intrinsic host restriction factor of influenza A and B viruses. Unlike its antiviral actions against positive-strand RNA viruses, the anti-influenza virus activity of TRIM56 was independent of the E3 ligase activity. Rather, expression of a short segment within the very C-terminal tail of TRIM56 inhibited the replication of influenza viruses as effectively as that of full-length TRIM56 by specifically targeting viral RNA synthesis. These data reveal the remarkable multifaceted activity of TRIM56, which has developed multiple domains to inhibit multiple viral families. They also raise the possibility of developing a broad-spectrum, TRIM56-based antiviral approach for addition to influenza prophylaxis and/or control strategies.","Liu, Baoming; Li, Nan L; Shen, Yang; Bao, Xiaoyong; Fabrizio, Thomas; Elbahesh, Husni; Webby, Richard J; Li, Kui",Journal of virology,343,27

The authors conducted a scoping review to characterize the current state of knowledge about CETs' structure, content, and outcomes. METHOD Six databases were searched in January 2018 for English-language peer-reviewed articles published through 2017 to identify articles describing CETs in GME. To be included, the CET had to target GME learners (residents/fellows), be longitudinal, have the primary aim of developing trainees into clinician-educators (CEs), and address at least one CE core competency (direct teaching, curriculum development, mentorship/advising, leadership, assessment, educational scholarship). The authors extracted and analyzed data from included articles. RESULTS Of 1,434 articles identified, 19 were included in the review, representing 18 separate CETs. All but 2 CETs (11%) were specialty specific. Most included a core curriculum with classroom-based sessions (18; 100%), workplace-based opportunities to practice skills (17; 94%), and a required scholarly project (16; 89%). Seventeen (94%) focused on skills related to direct teaching. Four (22%) identified mentoring/advising as a core curriculum focus. Five (28%) required project dissemination. Time spent in CETs varied widely (median: 166 hours; range: 8 hours/4-month period to 1,288 hours/2-year period). The most common reported outcomes were learner reactions (7; 39%) and career tracking (11; 61%). CONCLUSIONS This review yields a composite picture of the current state of CETs in GME. The results highlight the paucity of outcomes data and areas for potential standardization and future research.","Friedman, Karen; Lester, Janice; Young, John Q",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,343,16

The effects on patients' interest of elective neurosurgical procedures are currently unexplored. METHODS Using Google Trends (GT), search terms of seven different neurosurgical procedure categories (Trauma, Spine, Tumor, Movement Disorder, Epilepsy, Endovascular, and Miscellaneous) were assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) between January 2015 and September 2020. Analyses of search terms were performed for over the short-term (Feb 18th, 2020-Apr 18th, 2020), intermediate-term (Jan 1st, 2020-May 31st, 2020) and long-term (Jan 2015-Sept 2020). State-level interest during phase I re-opening (Apr 28th, 2020-May 31st, 2020) was also evaluated. RESULTS In the short-term, RSV of four categories (epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the intermediate-term, RSV of five categories (miscellaneous, epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the long-term, RSV of nearly all categories (endovascular, epilepsy, miscellaneous, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. Only the movement disorder procedure category had significantly higher RSV in states that reopened early. CONCLUSION With the recommendation for cessation of elective surgeries, patient interest in overall elective neurosurgical procedures have dropped significantly. With gradual reopening, there has been a resurgence in some procedure types. GT has proven to be a useful tracker of patient interest and may be utilized by neurosurgical departments to facilitate outreach strategies.","Feng, Austin Y; Garcia, Cesar A; Jin, Michael C; Ho, Allen L; Li, Gordon; Grant, Gerald; Ratliff, John; Skirboll, Stephen L",World neurosurgery,343,5

Objective: To understand the predictors of abuse and discrimination of sexual minority men in healthcare settings by Healthcare workers in seven cities in Tanzania. Method: In total, 300 sexual minority men over the age of 18 were interviewed in 7 Tanzanian cities by trained local interviewers. Abuse from others (physical, verbal, sexual, discrimination/humiliation), and abuse from Healthcare workers, was ascertained. Gender role mannerisms were self-rated by the respondent, and at the end of the interview, by the interviewer, on a Likert scale from very feminine to very masculine. Respondents also indicated whether they had revealed their homosexual behavior or had it exposed in the health consultation. Results: Median age was 27. Verbal abuse and community discrimination were the most commonly reported forms of abuse. Eighty-four percent had visited a healthcare center with a sexually related complaint (usually a sexually transmitted infection); of these, 24% reported abuse or discrimination from from a healthcare worker. Correlation between self-rated gender role mannerisms and interviewer-rated was r = 0.84. Regression analysis indicated that the degree of perceived gender role nonconformity was the major and significant predictor from Healthcare worker abuse: confirmation of homosexual behavior was non-significant. Gender role nonconformity predicted 21% of the variance in health worker abuse. Conclusion: There is speculation that abuse of sexual minority men by Healthcare workers in public clinics is due to factors in addition to their sexual behavior as gay/bisexual, and that it is due to violating perceived gender roles. Data confirm that perceived feminine gender role is a significant predictor, of abuse in healthcare and other settings. Common confusion between homosexual behavior and gender role norms may trigger discrimination, which may be as much due to violation of perceived gender roles as having sex with other men.","Ross, Michael W; Kashiha, John; Mgopa, Lucy R",Global health action,343,24

It was noted in 2006 that there was opportunity for significant expansion of the use of HHD in many countries. China covers a vast area and has a large amount of end-stage renal failure patients. But in mainland China, all dialysis treatments are in-center, and the number of HHD patients is zero. In 2018, our hospital received the permission of the Shanghai government to carry out HHD. CASE PRESENTATION We initiated four incident hemodialysis patients on an HHD regimen, one patient has been dialyzed in the home safely for 8 months. The biochemical parameters of the first patient remained stable on the regimen and he achieved standard Kt/V urea targets. Treatment-related adverse events were not reported during the follow-up. We combined HHD with intelligent ""Internet Plus"" real-time remote monitoring and introduced the Internet, especially visualization software, to replace traditional telephone and home visit methods. It is more intuitive and quicker to assist patients in performing home hemodialysis and improve the safety of treatment. CONCLUSIONS HHD can be performed by selected trained patients in mainland China. Combined with the internet, visualization software, and traditional telephone and home visits, it is intuitive and quick to assist patients in carrying out HHD and improve the safety of treatment.

As a crucial member of the Rho GTPase family, Cdc42 serves a number of functions, such as regulating cell growth, migration, and cell movement. Several RNA viruses employ Cdc42-hijacking tactics in their target cell entry processes. However, the function of Cdc42 in shrimp antiviral immunity is not clear. In this study, we identified a Cdc42 protein in the kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) and named it MjCdc42. MjCdc42 was upregulated in shrimp challenged by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The knockdown of MjCdc42 and injection of Cdc42 inhibitors increased the proliferation of WSSV. Further experiments determined that MjCdc42 interacted with an arginine kinase (MjAK). By analyzing the binding activity and enzyme activity of MjAK and its mutant, ΔMjAK, we found that MjAK could enhance the replication of WSSV in shrimp. MjAK interacted with the envelope protein VP26 of WSSV. An inhibitor of AK activity, quercetin, could impair the function of MjAK in WSSV replication. Further study demonstrated that the binding of MjCdc42 and MjAK depends on Cys271 of MjAK and suppresses the WSSV replication-promoting effect of MjAK. By interacting with the active site of MjAK and suppressing its enzyme activity, MjCdc42 inhibits WSSV replication in shrimp. Our results demonstrate a new function of Cdc42 in the cellular defense against viral infection in addition to the regulation of actin and phagocytosis, which has been reported in previous studies. IMPORTANCE The interaction of Cdc42 with arginine kinase plays a crucial role in the host defense against WSSV infection. This study identifies a new mechanism of Cdc42 in innate immunity and enriches the knowledge of the antiviral innate immunity of invertebrates.","Xu, Ji-Dong; Jiang, Hai-Shan; Wei, Tian-Di; Zhang, Ke-Yi; Wang, Xian-Wei; Zhao, Xiao-Fan; Wang, Jin-Xing",Journal of virology,343,30

Due to the high prevalence, co-occurrence and possible interactive health effects of such health behaviours in pregnancy, antenatal interventions that support pregnant women to improve multiple SNAP behaviours have a greater potential impact on the health outcomes of women and their children than interventions addressing single behaviours. The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of interventions delivered as part of antenatal care that aim to improve multiple SNAP behaviours among pregnant women. METHODS Seven electronic databases will be searched for potentially eligible studies. Eligible studies will include those where pregnant women are attending antenatal care. Studies that examine the effect of an intervention that addresses multiple SNAP behaviours (≥ 2 behaviours) during pregnancy and are delivered or instigated through antenatal care in a healthcare service will be included. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RCTs, cluster RCTs, stepped-wedge RCTs and non-randomised control trials will be eligible. Studies that include a no-intervention control, wait-list control group, standard/usual care, or another active single behavioural intervention (e.g. addressing one behaviour only) will be considered. Two independent reviewers will conduct study screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or a third reviewer if required.

However, the contributions of CD4 T cell help to antiviral CD8 T cell immunity during central nervous system (CNS) infection are not well established. Encephalitis induced by the sublethal coronavirus JHMV was used to identify when CD4 T cells regulate CD8 T cell responses following CNS infection. Peripheral expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells was impaired when CD4 T cells were ablated prior to infection but not at 4 days postinfection. Delayed CD4 T cell depletion abrogated CD4 T cell recruitment to the CNS but only slightly diminished CD8 T cell recruitment. Nevertheless, the absence of CNS CD4 T cells was associated with reduced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and granzyme B expression by infiltrating CD8 T cells, increased CD8 T cell apoptosis, and impaired control of infectious virus. CD4 T cell depletion subsequent to CD4 T cell CNS migration restored CD8 T cell activity and virus control. Analysis of γc-dependent cytokine expression indicated interleukin-21 (IL-21) as a primary candidate optimizing CD8 T cell activity within the CNS. These results demonstrate that CD4 T cells play critical roles in both enhancing peripheral activation of CD8 T cells and prolonging their antiviral function within the CNS. The data highlight the necessity for temporally and spatially distinct CD4 T cell helper functions in sustaining CD8 T cell activity during CNS infection.","Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hwang, Mihyun; Min, Booki; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,343,31

With this service, hospital pharmacists develop a distinct role via the implementation of pharmacovigilance services and pharmaceutical care plans for patients with comorbidities, and for special populations as immunosuppressed patients.MethodsCross-sectional study involving hospital and community pharmacists actively practising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who could not come to the hospital pharmacy department were provided with a delivery service to the community pharmacy of their choice. RESULTS A total of 1186 patients requested this service. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the most in-demand medication, followed by rheumatoid arthritis and antiretroviral drugs. 125 patients responded to the telephone survey, most of whom stated that they would use the delivery service again, and expressed their desire to continue doing so. DISCUSSION Without a doubt, telepharmacy and medication delivery services have provided multiple benefits during home quarantine. The delivery service enabled us to provide drugs to patients in their immediate environment through a service that was free for both the patient and the hospital pharmacy service. However, at present, the available evidence of the impact of telepharmacy models is sparse. CONCLUSIONS This medication delivery service has provided multiple benefits to patients during home quarantine. Although the users of this service seem to be satisfied with the current model, in the future, we should consider which patients would benefit most from this service and shape it to individual needs.","Peláez Bejarano, Ana; Villar Santos, Pilar; Robustillo-Cortés, Maria de Las Aguas; Sánchez Gómez, Ernesto; Santos Rubio, Maria Dolores",European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice,343,20

However, a large number of SRs are published outside of The Cochrane Collaboration (Cochrane), impacting the comprehensiveness of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We surveyed authors who published child-relevant SRs with Cochrane and elsewhere in the medical literature to (1) understand their experiences in preparing and publishing SRs and (2) identify factors influencing choice of publication venue. METHODS We identified SRs published in the CDSR for the most recent complete year prior to our study (2013; n = 145). We searched the medical literature and randomly selected the same number of SRs published the same year. We developed an internet-based survey and contacted the corresponding author of each review via email. Data were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative analysis elicited common themes from open-ended questions. RESULTS Seventy-six (26 %) responded: 41 % Cochrane, 42 % non-Cochrane, and 17 % published in both venues. Among respondents who published their SR in both venues (n = 13), 46 % found it easier to publish in a non-Cochrane journal, 15 % easier with Cochrane, and 31 % similar. Main reasons for conducting SRs with Cochrane (n = 44) were Cochrane's positive reputation (82 %) and good impact factor (66 %). Among respondents who published their SR in a non-Cochrane journal (n = 32), most frequent reasons for not conducting their SR with Cochrane were time required to follow Cochrane processes (25 %), lack of knowledge about how to conduct an SR with Cochrane (19 %), administrative processes (16 %), and perception that non-Cochrane journals yielded more interest (16 %). Among respondents who published their SR in a non-Cochrane journal (n = 32), 78 % did not register their review and 22 % did not prepare a protocol. CONCLUSIONS Key reasons for publishing in Cochrane are its positive reputation and impact factor. Reasons for publishing in non-Cochrane sources include lack of familiarity or challenges with the Cochrane processes and desire to publish in a source more directly relevant to the topic of interest. End users looking for evidence in the form of SRs need to be aware that there is a vast number of SRs published across the medical literature. Efforts to optimize the identification of SRs in non-Cochrane sources (e.g., through effective labeling or protocol/review registration) and their content will help end users find the necessary synthesized evidence to support clinical practice.","Hartling, Lisa; Shave, Kassi; Thomson, Denise; Fernandes, Ricardo M; Wingert, Aireen; Williams, Katrina",Systematic reviews,343,26

The procedure of oral feeding requires the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing activities, and it is the most complex sensorimotor process for newborn infants. Premature infants often uneasily complete the procedure of oral feeding. However, the evaluation of the oral feeding disorders and severity are usually dependent on the subjective clinical experience of the physician. Monitoring the sucking-swallowing-breathing activities directly is difficult for preterm infants. In this study, a wireless monitoring system for oral-feeding evaluation of full term and preterm infants was proposed to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the coordination of suck-swallow-respiration function during oral feeding. Moreover, the ratios of the swallowing and breathing event numbers to the sucking event number were defined to evaluate the coordination of suck-swallow-respiration function during oral feeding. Finally, the system performance was validated and the coordination of suck-swallow-respiration function for full term and preterm infants during oral feeding was also investigated.","Chen, Chang-Ting; Wang, Yu-Lin; Wang, Chen-An; Ko, Mei-Ju; Fang, Wai-Chi; Lin, Bor-Shyh",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,343,31

Effects of curcumin and fenugreek soluble fiber on the physical working capacity at the fatigue threshold, peak oxygen consumption, and time to exhaustion. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of curcumin in combination with fenugreek soluble fiber (CUR + FEN) or fenugreek soluble fiber alone (FEN) on the neuromuscular fatigue threshold (PWCFT), peak oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak), and time to exhaustion (Tlim) on a graded exercise test (GXT), in untrained subjects. The PWCFT estimates the highest power output that can be maintained without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue. Forty-seven untrained, college-aged subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 supplementation groups; placebo (PLA, n = 15), CUR + FEN (500 mg·d, n = 18), or FEN (300 mg·d, n = 14). The subjects completed a maximal GXT on a cycle ergometer to determine the PWCFT, V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak, and Tlim before (PRE) and after (POST) 28 days of daily supplementation. Surface electromyographic signals were recorded from a bipolar electrode arrangement on the vastus lateralis of the right leg during each test. Separate one-way analysis of covariances were used to determine if there were between-group differences for adjusted POST-PWCFT, POST-V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak, and POST-Tlim values, covaried for the respective PRE-test scores. The adjusted POST-PWCFT for the CUR + FEN group (mean ± SD: 196 ± 58 W) was greater (p = 0.016) than the PLA group (168 ± 49 W) but the FEN group (185 ± 32 W) was not different from the CUR + FEN or PLA groups (p > 0.05). There were no differences for adjusted POST-V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak (p = 0.612) or POST-Tlim (p = 0.508) among the groups. These findings suggested curcumin combined with fenugreek soluble fiber might delay neuromuscular fatigue.","Herrick, Lauren P; Goh, Jensen; Menke, Walter; Campbell, Marilyn S; Fleenor, Bradley S; Abel, Mark G; Bergstrom, Haley C",Journal of strength and conditioning research,343,12

Rapid immuno-chromatography assay (ICA), a test with low sensitivity, is often used as point of care (POC) test. Recently, the rapid syndromic molecular test FilmArray, became available. This observational study aims to evaluate whether the use of FilmArray would decrease the use of antivirals and hospitalization rates among children presenting to the emergency room (ER) with influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected from children 0-16 years presenting with ILI at the ER of a tertiary hospital during the peak endemic period. Patients were allocated to be tested by either FilmArray or ICA. Use of antivirals and hospitalization rates were noted. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the impact of testing methods on decision making. RESULTS Overall, 80 children were included (mean age: 5 years). Admissions were more likely to occur if ICA test was performed (OR:3.16, 95%CI: 1.01-9.82, p=0.046). Oseltamivir administration was more likely among children who had undergone the ICA test (OR: 4.67, 95%CI: 1.06-20.43, p=0.041). The implementation of rapid molecular test had no impact on complementary diagnostic testing or antibacterial prescription. CONCLUSIONS The use of FilmArray significantly reduced both hospitalization and oseltamivir administration in children. Further education on the use of POC tests is needed to improve current management of children presenting with ILI and decrease associated health care costs. This article is protected by copyright.

One remarkable demonstration of this is the development of laparoscopic surgery. Once this proved to be a safe and reliable surgical approach, robotics seemed a logical progression of surgical technology. The aim of this project was to evaluate the utility of robotics in the context of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of robotic single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (RSILC) and traditional SILC performed by a single surgeon at our institution from July 2010 to August 2013 was queried. All consecutive patients undergoing RSILC and SILC during this time period were included. Primary outcomes include conversion rate and operative time. Secondary outcomes include length of stay, duration of narcotic use, time to independent performance of daily activities and cost. Categorical variables were evaluated using Chi-square analysis and continuous variables using t test or Wilcoxon's rank test. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients underwent RSILC and 44 underwent SILC. BMI was higher in the RSILC group, and the number of patients with prior abdominal surgeries was higher in the SILC group. Otherwise, demographics were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in conversion rate between RSILC and SILC (8 vs 11 %, p = 0.60). Mean operative time for RSILC was significantly greater compared with SILC (98 vs 68 min, p < 0.0001). RSILC was associated with a longer duration of narcotic use (2.3 vs 1.7 days, p = 0.0019) and time to independent performance of daily activities (4 vs 2.3 days, p < 0.0001). Total cost is greater in RSILC ($8961 vs $5379, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION While RSILC can be safely performed, it is associated with longer operative times and greater cost.","Gustafson, Monica; Lescouflair, Tariq; Kimball, Randall; Daoud, Ibrahim",Surgical endoscopy,343,19

Data Sources Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to February 2021, using a predefined search strategy. Study Selection Two blinded reviewers performed document selection by title, abstract, and full text according to the following criteria: mechanically ventilated adult patients performing any mobilization intervention, respiratory support adjustments, and/or monitoring of metabolic/respiratory real-time variables. Data Extraction Four physiotherapists extracted relevant information using a prespecified template. Data Synthesis From 1,208 references screened, 35 documents were selected for analysis, where 20 (57%) were published between 2016 and 2020. Respiratory support settings (ventilatory modes or respiratory variables) were reported in 21 documents (60%). Reported modes were assisted (n = 11) and assist-control (n = 9). Adjustment of variables and modes were identified in only seven documents (20%). The most frequent respiratory variable was the Fio2, and only four studies modified the level of ventilatory support. Mechanical ventilator brand/model used was not specified in 26 documents (74%). Monitoring of respiratory, metabolic, and both variables were reported in 22 documents (63%), four documents (11%) and 10 documents (29%), respectively. These variables were reported to assess the physiologic response (n = 21) or safety (n = 13). Monitored variables were mostly respiratory rate (n = 26), pulse oximetry (n = 22), and oxygen consumption (n = 9). Remarkably, no study assessed the work of breathing or effort during mobilization. Conclusions Little information on respiratory support adjustments during mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients was identified. Monitoring of metabolic and respiratory variables is also scant. More studies on the effects of adjustments of the level/mode of ventilatory support on exercise performance and respiratory muscle activity monitoring for safe and efficient implementation of early mobilization in mechanically ventilated patients are needed.","González-Seguel, Felipe; Camus-Molina, Agustín; Jasmén, Anita; Molina, Jorge; Pérez-Araos, Rodrigo; Graf, Jerónimo",Critical care explorations,343,19

In recent years, the use of durable, newer generation, continuous flow devices have increased substantially among adults with end-stage heart failure. We examined the extended role of this device in the pediatric population (aged less than 18 years). METHODS Between 2010 and 2015, 12 patients (median age 7.1 years; range, 3.7 to 17.0; one third of patients were aged 5 years or less) received a HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD; HeartWare, Framingham, MA), 11 for cardiomyopathy and 1 for posttransplant rejection. Right VAD support (n = 5; 42%) was provided by a short-term device (Levitronix, Zurich, Switzerland). RESULTS Overall, 1 patient died (day 638), 8 patients (67%) underwent transplantation, 1 patient (8.3%) recovered, and 2 patients (17%) remain on HVAD. The mean length of support was 150 days (range, 16 to 638). Four patients (33.3%) were discharged home (all left VAD). In the left VAD group (n = 7), 3 patients subsequently received transplants (days 185, 201, and 234, respectively), 1 recovered (day 149), 1 died (day 638), 1 remained on HVAD (day 198), and 1 needed conversion to biventricular assist device (BIVAD [day 73]). In the BIVAD group (n = 5), right VAD was weaned in 3 (60%), all subsequently received transplants, and 2 remained on BIVAD support until transplant (days 16 and 17, respectively). One BIVAD patient required conversion to central cannulation for longer-term support. Four BIVAD patients (80%) were in Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support level 1 before VAD compared with 2 (29%) in the left VAD group (p = not significant). The actuarial survival rate was 100% at 1 year with no neurologic events. CONCLUSIONS The third-generation, continuous flow device can provide durable support in the pediatric population. The selection strategy for patients who benefit most from the device continues to evolve. It is anticipated that a smaller design in the future will benefit an even wider pediatric population with heart failure.","Peng, Ed; Kirk, Richard; Wrightson, Neil; Duong, Phuoc; Ferguson, Lee; Griselli, Massimo; Butt, Tanveer; O'Sullivan, John J; MacGowan, Guy A; Crossland, David; Schueler, Stephan; Hasan, Asif",The Annals of thoracic surgery,343,17

In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8·5%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (12·1%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 3·6% (95% CI 1·4-5·8). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0·65 (95% CI 0·51-0·84; p=0·001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0·057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0·002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0·221). INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke.

Various researches have shown the bioactivity, physiological activity and potential health benefits of the two components. In this study, a simultaneous and rapid method for determination of sesamin and sesamolin in sesame oils was proposed. The excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of the oils were obtained after a simple pretreatment method, then the self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition were adopted to extract the quantitative information from the highly overlapped spectra. RESULTS It was found that reasonable quantification results can be obtained with the limits of detection for the two lignans were 0.05 mg/g and 0.24 mg/g, while limits of quantitation were 0.14 mg/g and 0.74 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the average recoveries for sesamin and sesamolin were 99.05% and 94.97%. CONCLUSION The results indicate that with simple sample pretreatment, the application for combining excitation-emission fluorescence spectra and self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition can be a useful and sensitive tool for the determination of lignans in sesame oil.

So far, only few data exist on the long-term outcome. OBJECTIVES This analysis evaluated the impact of valve therapy on the survival of emphysema patients. METHODS Survival rates of emphysema patients who underwent valve therapy were assessed according to their radiological outcome following valve placement. RESULTS From 2005 to 2013, 449 emphysema patients (mean age 64 ± 7 years) underwent valve therapy and were followed for a mean time of 37.3 ± 21.3 months. A total of 128 patients (29%) developed complete lobar atelectasis, 34 out of these also experienced a pneumothorax; 50 patients (11%) developed pneumothorax without lobar atelectasis, and 261 patients (58%) target lobe volume reduction or no volume change.

City Novi Pazar was the greatest coronavirus hotspot in Europe on July 1st, 2020, due to several hundred infected people. Even though united data was published at the state level, there is no data by region or city, so the interpretation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia at the regional level is difficult. Different levels of health care and health education of citizens and the degree of respect for the proposed epidemiological measures have led to significant differences in the number of tests, a large number of infected, and several deaths by regions and cities. Insufficiently precise and up-to-date keeping of records and statistical data on COVID-19 at the state and local level also complicates the pandemic's scientific and epidemiological analysis. Novi Pazar is a city in southwestern Serbia with a population of 100 000. It is similar in population to the city of Bergamo, in northern Italy in the Lombardy region.

METHODS A modified version of the validated Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire was completed by 816 individuals using crowd-sourcing methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine population characteristics associated with perceived difficulty using telehealth technology. RESULTS Most respondents (85%) believed that telehealth visits would be a convenient form of healthcare delivery, and 64% would prefer them over in-person office visits. The majority (92%) agreed that telehealth would save them time, but 81% had concerns regarding the lack of physical contact during a musculoskeletal examination. More respondents would feel comfortable using telehealth for routine follow-up care (81%) compared to initial assessment visits (59%) and first postoperative appointments (60%). Roughly 1 in 15 (7%) expressed difficulty with using telehealth; these respondents were more often unmarried, lower-income, and more medically infirm, and reported greater symptoms of depression. After multivariable adjustment, lower income and poor health were retained as predictors of difficulty with navigating telehealth technology (p = 0.027,p = 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION The majority of the public appears receptive to telehealth for orthopaedic care for both new patient visits and follow-up appointments. The finding that people with multiple chronic conditions and psychosocial needs struggle to engage with telehealth suggests that those who arguably stand to benefit the most from continued care are the ones being unintentionally left out of this digitization boom.","Puzzitiello, Richard N; Moverman, Michael A; Pagani, Nicholas R; Ryan, Scott P; Salzler, Matthew J; Jawa, Andrew; Menendez, Mariano E",Journal of the National Medical Association,343,19

Materials and Methods 209 cases of surgery for brain metastases were assessed. 41 cases with at least two follow-up MRIs were retrospectively included in this study. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the FLAIR signal intensity of the fluid within the resection cavity was performed in the MRI examination at recurrent disease/last contact and in the previous MRI examination. Results 3 of 6 cases with local tumor recurrence showed a FLAIR signal increase (sensitivity 50.0 %, specificity 100.0 %). In one case, this sign was observed even about 3 months before tumor recurrence. The specificity of FLAIR signal increase for overall tumor recurrence (local and distant) was also 100.0 %, but with a lower sensitivity of 13.0 %. Quantitative analysis showed significant differences for signal intensity of the resection cavity as well as for the change of signal intensity of the resection cavity in cases with or without local tumor recurrence. Conclusion An increase in FLAIR signal of the fluid within the resection cavity might be a highly specific and early sign of local tumor recurrence/tumor progression also for brain metastases. Key points: · An increase in FLAIR signal intensity of the fluid within the resection cavity is also observed in previously resected brain metastases.. · The pathophysiology of this sign might be due to a cell-proliferative process..

This study reviews the LGB experience at an urban academic center in terms of complications, reoperative rates, and comorbidities. METHODS In this study, 144 consecutive patients undergoing LGB were prospectively reviewed. Data were collected including weight, body mass index (BMI), excess weight loss (EWL), comorbidities, and complications. Demographics were analyzed using a t-test. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship of BMI, race, and age to EWL at 12 months. RESULTS The study participants were 130 women with a mean age of 43 ± 11 years, a mean weight of 127.1 kg ± 20.5 kg, and a mean BMI of 45.6 ± 6.1. The mean follow-up period was 16 months. The mean EWL was 20% ± 14% at 6 months (n = 118), 26% ± 16% at 12 months (n = 106), 30% ± 20% at 18 months (n = 68), and 34% ± 23% at 24 months (n = 43). Patients with a BMI higher than 50 kg/m(2) had a lower EWL at 12 months than patients with a BMI lower than 50 kg/m(2) (P = 0.00005). The mean EWL at 12 months was significantly less for African Americans than for Caucasians (P = 0.0046; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3-15%). Patients older than 50 years had a lower EWL, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Complete and partial resolution of comorbidities occurred for 10% and 4% of the patients, respectively. Removal of the band with revision to a sleeve gastrectomy for inadequate EWL was required for 14 patients (11.5%). Complications occurred for 8% of the patients (n = 15) including port flipping, stoma obstruction, tube disconnection, port infections, dysphagia, and band slippage. Overall, 16.7% of the patients (n = 24) required reoperation. CONCLUSION After LGB, a majority of the patients failed to achieve a 50% EWL, and 16.7% required reoperation. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding may not be the optimal bariatric procedure for patients older than 50 years, patients with a BMI higher than 50 kg/m(2), or African Americans.","Kasza, Jason; Brody, Fred; Vaziri, Khashayar; Scheffey, Carl; McMullan, Sheldon; Wallace, Brian; Khambaty, Fatima",Surgical endoscopy,343,24

AIM The purpose of this umbrella review was to identify the systematic reviews that explore the association between sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular disease specific to older people. METHODS An umbrella review was undertaken to systematically search five databases. Papers included were published between 2011 and 2015. RESULTS A search yielded 2,163 results. Six reviews met the inclusion criteria. While all six systematic reviews included older people in the overall sample, only one systematic review focused on an entirely older person population. Three of the six systematic reviews provided a meta-analysis, but none of the reviews reported a separate subgroup analysis for a discrete sample of older people CONCLUSION: This umbrella review demonstrates that while sedentary behaviour is associated with cardiovascular disease, a gap exists in the analysis on the relationship specific to older persons.

DESIGN Explanatory video demonstrating the technique and intraoperative findings. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT The 68-year-old patient was referred with a vaginal mesh erosion that resulted in abscess formation at the vaginal apex. The patient was symptomatic with an increasingly foul-smelling vaginal discharge for about 1 year. She had a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy in a remote hospital 22 months before the current operation and had a total abdominal hysterectomy 15 years ago. The, patient's history was uneventful without dyspareunia, incontinence or voiding difficulties, and she was otherwise content with the sacrocolpopexy result. The local institutional review board granted exemption for this publication. INTERVENTION Frequently, pelvic organ prolapse can only be effectively treated if the surgical procedure comprises support of the central compartment. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy shows superior outcomes for this indication, with success rates of up to 96%. However, a rare side effect of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is mesh erosion, occurring in up to 2.4% [1]. These erosions are usually treated laparoscopically [2]. In this video we show an alternative route for excision of a symptomatic exposed mesh by using a transvaginal approach: The SILS trocar is used vaginally for abscess irrigation and mesh excision with minimally invasive instruments. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS For treatment of the abscess and removal of the exposed mesh, the SILS trocar was placed vaginally, and laparoscopic instruments were used. The abscess was incised, cleansed and irrigated, debrided, and the mesh excised. Because no mesh material was exposed after excision, the vagina was not closed to avoid creating a cavity with the risk of promoting reabscess formation, and secondary wound healing was anticipated. Laparoscopy was used to confirm that no intra-abdominal lesion coexisted or occurred. There were no signs of further infection of the residual mesh beyond the area exposed in the vagina. The patient's only symptom was foul-smelling discharge, but no back pain or signs of systemic inflammation were found. Knowing that foreign body (mesh) infection usually needs to be treated by complete mesh removal, we did not have any clues of distant mesh infection and counseled the patient that if reinfection occurred a second surgery might be necessary. Nevertheless, we treated this patient with abscess drainage and removal of large parts of the mesh. Thus, the operation was not extended to a complete mesh excision to prevent major surgery and the risk of recurrent prolapse. Particularly, the area of the mesh excision was inspected with the rendezvous technique (light source vaginally, laparoscopic pelvic view with laparoscopic light source switched off) to identify the area of mesh excision from the intra-abdominal area. Sigmoid and rectum were distant to this area, suggesting that no bowel lesion occurred. No complications occurred in the postoperative course. In the follow-up visit 6 months postoperatively the patient was asymptomatic, and the vaginal examination was uneventful with no recurrent erosion. Although improved oversight and richness of detail achieved by the vaginal SILS method is helpful in patients like our case with a suspended vaginal vault, its costs need to be balanced against conventional vaginal approaches (e.g., use of a Lonestar retractor). CONCLUSION The SILS trocar and laparoscope used (SILS Port; Covidien, New Haven, CT) vaginally provide a magnificent and detailed view to allow for exact preparation by means of microinvasive instruments in vaginal surgery, even more in patients with a suspended vaginal vault where access to the apex can be tricky. The ""pneumovagina"" created by CO2 insufflation further helps to expose the vaginal apex. The rendezvous technique can additionally be used to identify intra-abominal lesions.","Mohr, Stefan; Siegenthaler, Franziska; Imboden, Sara; Kuhn, Annette; Mueller, Michael D",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,343,1

METHODS A secondary analysis was conducted of the official Acute Respiratory Syndrome Surveillance System database. Pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with COVID-19 ARDS until July 14, 2020, were included. Adverse outcomes were a composite endpoint of either death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or mechanical ventilation. Risk factors were examined by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS There were 2475 cases of COVID-19 ARDS. Among them, 23.8% of women had the composite endpoint and 8.2% died. Of those who died, 5.9% were not hospitalized, 39.7% were not admitted to the ICU, 42.6% did not receive mechanical ventilation, and 25.5% did not have access to respiratory support. Multivariate analysis showed that postpartum period, age over 35 years, obesity, diabetes, black ethnicity, living in a peri-urban area, no access to Family Health Strategy, or living more than 100 km from the notification hospital were associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.

Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are highly susceptible to environmental stress. In the current study, we aimed to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic psychologically affected patients with chronic progressive diseases such as AS and RA and the effects of these psychological factors on disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Age and gender-matched patients with AS (n=80), RA (n=80), and healthy controls (n=80) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with the ?Perceived COVID-19 Threat Form (PCTF)?, ?Suicide-Ideation Scale (SIS)?, ?Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)?, ?The Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT)? and ?Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB)? scales. BASDAI was used in patients with AS and DAS28 was used in patients with RA to assess disease severity. RESULTS Compared to healthy individuals, patients with RA and AS had lower PGWB scores and higher HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores. Almost all psychometric assessment test scores were worse in AS patients with high-disease activity compared to those in low-disease activity. PACT scores were higher in patients with moderate RA compared to patients with mild RA (p=0.006). While a positive correlation was identified between BASDAI and most of the psychometric assessment test scores (r=0 .36 for PCTF, r= 0.53 for depressive scores, r= 0.54 for anxiety scores, r= 0.57 for suicidal ideation), DAS28 scores were found to be associated only with PACT total and PACT perceived forward-focused subscale scores (r= -.26 and r= .33, respectively). CONCLUSION Psychologically, AS and RA patients were found to be worse off compared to healthy controls. The perceived COVID threat and psychological status were associated with disease activity in AS, but not RA patients. Patients with chronic illnesses may be more vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic, which can worsen disease activity.","Gica, Şakir; Akkubak, Yasemin; Aksoy, Zakire Kübra; Küçük, Adem; Cüre, Erkan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,343,19

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)is a critical regulator in the pathogenesis of this disease. We focused on two key RAS enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to elucidate the activation of the ACE-angiotensin II (Ang II)-angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) axis and the inhibition of the ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]-Mas receptor axis in C57BL/6mice following SiO2 treatment. Silica exposure caused nodule formation, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix, and impaired lung function in mice. These effects were attenuated by the inhibition of ACE (captopril), blockade of the AT1(losartan), or systemic knockdown of the Ace gene. These effects were exacerbated by the inhibition of ACE2 (MLN-4760), blockade of the Mas (A779), or knockdown of the Ace2 gene. N-Acetyl-Seryl-Asparyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP), an anti-fibrotic peptide, ameliorated the silica-exposure-induced pathological changes by targeting the RAS system by activating the protective ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis and inhibiting the deleterious ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis, thereby exerting a protective effect. This was confirmed in mouse lung type II epithelial cells (MLE-12) pretreated with Ang II and/or gene silencing separately targeting Ace and Ace2.The effects of Ac-SDKP were similar to those produced by Ace gene silencing and were partly attenuated by Ace2 deficiency. These findings suggested that RAS plays critical roles in the pathomechanism of silicosis fibrosis and that Ac-SDKP regulates lung RAS to inhibit EMT in silicotic mice and MLE-12 cells.","Li, Shumin; Li, Yaqian; Zhang, Yi; Li, Shifeng; Zhang, Min; Jin, Fuyu; Wei, Zhongqiu; Yang, Yi; Gao, Xuemin; Mao, Na; Ge, Xingchen; Xu, Hong; Yang, Fang",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,343,16

We aimed to investigate the effect of PNLA in human cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS Modified Boyden chamber was used to assess chemokine-induced migration of THP-1 monocytes. Macropinocytosis was assessed using lucifer yellow and ox-LDL uptake using Dil-oxLDL in THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). IL6, TNFα and PGE2 release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated PBMCs from RA patients and HCs were measured by ELISA. The transcriptomic profile of PNLA treated, LPS activated PBMCs was investigated by RNA-sequencing. RESULTS PNLA reduced THP-1 cell migration by 55% (p< 0.001). Macropinocytosis and Dil-oxLDL uptake were reduced by 50% (p< 0.001) and 40% (p< 0.01) in THP-1 macrophages and 40% (p< 0.01) and 25% (p< 0.05) in HMDM, respectively. PNLA reduced IL6 and TNFα release from LPS stimulated PBMCs from RA by 60% (p< 0.001) and by 50% and 35% respectively (p< 0.01) for HCs. PNLA also reduced PGE2 levels in such PBMCs from RA patients and HCs (p< 0.0001). Differentially expressed genes included upregulated expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fructose bisphosphatase 1 and N-Myc downstream-regulated gene, which have potential roles in regulating immune and metabolic pathways. Pathway analysis predicted upstream activation of nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors involved in anti-inflammatory processes, and inhibition of NF-κB and STAT1. CONCLUSIONS PNLA has immune-metabolic effects on monocytes and PBMC which are pathogenic in RA and atherosclerosis.

Screening programs and non-urgent tests have been postponed; clinical trials have suffered a setback. Similarly, in the area of cardiology care, a significant decline in ST-elevation myocardial infarction accesses and an increase in cases of late presenting heart attacks with increased mortality and complication rates have been reported. Health care systems must therefore get ready to tackle the ""rebound effect"" that will likely show a relative increase in the short and medium term incidence of diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and cardio- and cerebrovascular complications.

Establishing a national maternal health network, relying on mechanisms for timely reporting, monitoring, and following-up, preparing guidelines and protocols required for COVID-19 management in pregnant women though a multidisciplinary team working approach, and embedding the precautions of reducing transmission in maternity care were the main measures taken to cope with COVID-19 in pregnancy. Iran's experience in providing maternity care during the COVID-19 can guide other countries affected by COVID-19. However, it should be adapted to local health-care facilities, as well as in response to any further updates on COVID-19.","Changizi, Nasrin; Raeisi, Alireza; Barekati, Hamed; Habibolahi, Abbas; Sajadi, Haniye Sadat; Emami-Afshar, Nezhat; Radpooyan, Laleh",Archives of Iranian medicine,343,12

During February 5-March 17, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received and transmitted contact information for 11,574 international travelers to 51 of 61 local health jurisdictions at a cost of 1,694 hours of CDPH personnel time. If resources permitted, local health jurisdictions contacted travelers, interviewed them, and oversaw 14 days of quarantine, self-monitoring, or both, based on CDC risk assessment criteria for COVID-19. Challenges encountered during follow-up included errors in the recording of contact information and variation in the availability of resources in local health jurisdictions to address the substantial workload. Among COVID-19 patients reported to CDPH, three matched persons previously reported as travelers to CDPH. Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California. Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations. State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Myers, Jennifer F; Snyder, Robert E; Porse, Charsey Cole; Tecle, Selam; Lowenthal, Phil; Danforth, Mary E; Powers, Edward; Kamali, Amanda; Jain, Seema; Fritz, Curtis L; Chai, Shua J",MMWR.

This collection of cases describes some complications of endourological procedures and how they were treated. Case 1: A case of right ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrostomy found to be misplaced in the inferior vena cava. The case was safely managed, but it showed that ultrasound guidance alone may be insufficient so it is recommended that percutaneous nephrostomy should be always placed under fluoroscopic control, either alone or in combination with ultrasound guidance. Case 2: A case of renal subcapsular hematoma occurring on retrograde intrarenal surgery at high perfusion pressure. The hematoma was drained under combined ultrasonic and radiological guidance. Post treatment recovery was uneventful. Large stone size, severe ipsilateral hydronephrosis, long operation time, higher hydrostatic pressure of the irrigating solution and low ureteral wall compliance are supposed to be risks factors associated with renal subcapsular formation. Management strategy should be tailored to patient's clinical conditions. In hemodynamically stable patients, large hematoma drainage is recommended to prevent further complications and favours early recovery. Case 3: A case of double J stent fracture discovered one month after the insertion to relieve obstruction from a 1 cm stone in the right proximal ureter. The distal fragment of the stent was removed by cystoscopy while the proximal fragment was removed by semirigid ureteroscopy in two sessions due to fever and extensive calcification.

Many efforts have been made to study the population dynamics of such complex communities of cells, coexisting as well-coordinated units. Minimal models based on ordinary differential equations are powerful tools that can help us understand complex phenomena. They represent an appropriate compromise between complexity and tractability; they allow a profound and comprehensive analysis, which is still easy to understand. Evolutionary game theory is another powerful tool that can help us understand the costs and benefits of the decision a particular cell of a unicellular social organism takes when faced with the challenges of the biotic and abiotic environment. This work is a binocular view at the population dynamics of such a community through the objectives of minimal modelling and evolutionary game theory. We test the behaviour of the community of a unicellular social organism at three levels of antibiotic stress. Even in the absence of the antibiotic, spikes in the fraction of resistant cells can be observed indicating the importance of bet hedging. At moderate level of antibiotic stress, we witness cyclic dynamics reminiscent of the renowned rock-paper-scissors game. At a very high level, the resistant type of strategy is the most favourable.","Garde, Ravindra; Ewald, Jan; Kovács, Ákos T; Schuster, Stefan",Open biology,343,28

We have reported that mice treated before or soon after infection with a combination of inhaled Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 and 9 agonists (Pam2-ODN) are broadly protected against microbial pathogens including respiratory viruses, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES To validate strategies for immune modulation in a preclinical model of viral pneumonia and determine their mechanisms. METHODS Mice were challenged with the Sendai paramyxovirus in the presence or absence of Pam2-ODN treatment. Virus burden and host immune responses were assessed to elucidate Pam2-ODN mechanisms of action and to identify additional opportunities for therapeutic intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Enhanced survival of Sendai virus pneumonia with Pam2-ODN treatment was associated with reductions in lung virus burden and with virus inactivation prior to internalization. We noted that mortality in sham-treated mice corresponded with CD8+ T cell lung inflammation on days 11-12 after virus challenge, after the viral burden had declined. Pam2-ODN blocked this injurious inflammation by minimizing virus burden. As an alternative intervention, depleting CD8+ T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality. CONCLUSIONS Stimulation of local innate immunity within the lungs by TLR agonists early in disease or suppression of adaptive immunity by systemic CD8+ T cell depletion late in disease improves outcomes of viral pneumonia in mice. These data reveal opportunities for targeted immunomodulation to protect susceptible human subjects.","Wali, Shradha; Flores, Jose R; Jaramillo, Ana Maria; Goldblatt, David L; Pantaleón García, Jezreel; Tuvim, Michael J; Dickey, Burton F; Evans, Scott E",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,343,11

METHODS Patient databases between 2010 and 2020 were screened to identify children with an ISCEV-ERG recorded within four years of a GOSH-ERG. Electroretinogram (ERG) component peak times and amplitudes were re-measured, and data were analysed in terms of absolute abnormality and proportional deviation from respective reference ranges. Abnormality was defined by the retinal system affected and by individual ERG a- and b-wave component analysis. RESULTS A total of 59 patients were included: 38 patients had retinal disease defined by an abnormal ISCEV-ERG and 21 had normal ISCEV-ERGs. When absolute abnormality was defined by combined retinal systems, the GOSH-ERG showed an excellent overall sensitivity of 95% (accuracy 86%). Individual retinal systems showed good-excellent sensitivity (67%-100%) and specificity (68%-97%). Electroretinogram (ERG) component sensitivities ranged between 60% and 97% and specificities between 79% and 97% dependent upon the protocol step. The proportional relationship appeared mostly linear between protocols. Electroretinogram (ERG) morphology was comparable for both protocols in a range of retinal diseases including those with pathognomonic ERGs. CONCLUSION We demonstrate the high diagnostic accuracy of a paediatric ERG protocol (GOSH-ERG) relative to ISCEV standard ERGs. The close proportional deviation and similar waveform morphology indicate ERGs from each protocol are similarly affected in disease. This encourages the use of the GOSH-ERG protocol in the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of retinal disease in children who are unable to comply with the rigorous ISCEV-ERG protocol.","Marmoy, Oliver R; Moinuddin, Mohammed; Thompson, Dorothy A",Acta ophthalmologica,343,1

Thus, a cell line in which an early and distinct CPE occurs following HMPV inoculation is highly desired by clinical virology laboratories. In this study, it was demonstrated that, in the human malignant melanoma cell line MNT-1, obvious syncytium formation occurs shortly after inoculation with HMPV-positive clinical specimens. In addition, the growth and efficiency of isolation of HMPV were greater using MNT-1 than using any other conventional cell line.

We assessed contamination of skin, gloves, and scrubs after doffing Ebola-level PPE contaminated with surrogate viruses: bacteriophages MS2 and Φ6. Methods In a medical biocontainment unit, HCWs (n = 10) experienced in EVD care donned and doffed PPE following unit protocols that incorporate trained observer guidance and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR). A mixture of Φ6 (enveloped), MS2 (nonenveloped), and fluorescent marker was applied to 4 PPE sites, approximating body fluid viral load (Φ6, 105; MS2, 106). They performed a patient care task, then doffed. Inner gloves, face, hands, and scrubs were sampled for virus, as were environmental sites with visible fluorescent marker. Results Among 10 HCWs there was no Φ6 transfer to inner gloves, hands, or face; 1 participant had Φ6 on scrubs at low levels (1.4 × 102). MS2 transfer (range, 101-106) was observed to scrubs (n = 2), hands (n = 1), and inner gloves (n = 7), where it was highest. Most (n = 8) had only 1 positive site. Environmental samples with visible fluorescent marker (n = 21) were negative. Conclusions Among experienced HCWs, structured, observed doffing using ABHR protected against hand contamination with enveloped virus. Nonenveloped virus was infrequent on hands and scrubs but common on inner gloves, suggesting that inner gloves, but not necessarily ABHR, protect against hand contamination. Optimizing doffing protocols to protect against all types of viruses may require reinforcing careful handling of scrubs and good glove/hand hygiene with effective agents.","Casanova, Lisa M; Erukunuakpor, Kimberly; Kraft, Colleen S; Mumma, Joel M; Durso, Francis T; Ferguson, Ashley N; Gipson, Christina L; Walsh, Victoria L; Zimring, Craig; DuBose, Jennifer; Jacob, Jesse T",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,343,1

A quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) biomarker, the Antidepressant Treatment Response (ATR) index, has been associated with outcomes of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in patients with MDD. Here, we report the results of a post hoc analysis initiated to evaluate whether the ATR index may also be associated with reboxetine treatment outcome, given that its putative mechanism of action is via norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (NRI). Twenty-five adults with MDD underwent qEEG studies during open-label treatment with reboxetine at doses of 8 to 10 mg daily for 8 weeks. The ATR index calculated after 1 week of reboxetine treatment was significantly associated with overall Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) improvement at week 8 (r=0.605, P=.001), even after controlling for baseline depression severity (P=.002). The ATR index predicted response (≥50% reduction in HAM-D) with 70.6% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, and remission (final HAM-D≤7) with 87.5% sensitivity and 64.7% specificity. These results suggest that the ATR index may be a useful biomarker of clinical response during NRI treatment of adults with MDD.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients were regardless of KRAS status, included in this phase II trial. They were treated with the monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, and the chemotherapeutic drug, irinotecan, every second week. A F18-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was scheduled before the first and second treatment, respectively, and then after every fourth treatment. Early metabolic response after one treatment and best overall metabolic response was calculated according to EORTC criteria (responders: ≥15% decrease in ∑SUVmax) and PERCIST (responders: ≥30% decrease in SULpeak). Best overall radiologic response was calculated according to RECIST 1.0. RESULTS By EORTC criteria, early metabolic response predicted partial metabolic response (PMR) with a high positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.875 and a high negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.714. Partial radiologic response was predicted with a low PPV of 0.368 but a high NPV of 1.0. By PERCIST, PMR was predicted with a high PPV of 0.826 and an intermediate NPV of 0.667 and partial radiologic response was predicted with a low PPV of 0.5 but a high NPV of 1.0. Median OS was nearly the same with the two criteria sets; 14.1 months for early metabolic responders and 9.9 months for non-responders using EORTC criteria and 13.5 and 10.1 months, respectively, using PERCIST. CONCLUSIONS With both EORTC criteria and PERCIST, early reduction in FDG uptake was predictive of a later partial metabolic and partial radiologic response to treatment. It was also predictive of significantly longer survival of early metabolic responders compared to non-responders. However, the sensitivities and specificities were not high enough to support clinical routine use.","Skougaard, Kristin; Nielsen, Dorte; Jensen, Benny Vittrup; Pfeiffer, Per; Hendel, Helle Westergren",Acta oncologica,343,17

It will no longer be possible to cram the humblest into cramped areas, but priority must be given to prevention (certainly with physical barriers, hydro-alcoholic gel, face masks), biological diagnosis, isolation, and also the care of any infected person. COVID-19 has hit the most vulnerable first in terms of biological inequality, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Those with AD can have sensorial deficits and perception troubles, including visual difficulties and the inability to recognize faces and emotions. Face masks and physical distancing can disrupt facial familiarity and make it more difficult to recognize emotional facial expressions. It can provoke distress, which the visitor can perceive and feel obligated to take off the face mask. This gesture should not be considered as an act of indiscipline, but an act of empathy. Transparent face masks could improve the suffering of AD patients, distraught in the presence of their loved ones whose masks hide their faces. Wearing a mask should not be due to fear of punishment, but as an understanding of the responsibility of each individual in the control of the current pandemic. It may be necessary to convince more citizens of this civic duty, using clear and attractive messaging in order to standardize the wearing of face masks for the general public and to adapt them to the needs of patients.","Gil, Roger; Arroyo-Anlló, Eva M",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,343,1

Many Drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. Here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. We discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. Prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. Immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates validation in mammalian models of infection.","Panayidou, Stavria; Ioannidou, Eleni; Apidianakis, Yiorgos",Virulence,343,1

The three human FPRs (FPR1, FPR2/ALX, and FPR3) share significant sequence homology and are encoded by clustered genes. Collectively, these receptors bind an extraordinarily numerous and structurally diverse group of agonistic ligands, including N-formyl and nonformyl peptides of different composition, that chemoattract and activate phagocytes. N-formyl peptides, which are encoded in nature only by bacterial and mitochondrial genes and result from obligatory initiation of bacterial and mitochondrial protein synthesis with N-formylmethionine, is the only ligand class common to all three human receptors. Surprisingly, the endogenous anti-inflammatory peptide annexin 1 and its N-terminal fragments also bind human FPR1 and FPR2/ALX, and the anti-inflammatory eicosanoid lipoxin A4 is an agonist at FPR2/ALX. In comparison, fewer agonists have been identified for FPR3, the third member in this receptor family. Structural and functional studies of the FPRs have produced important information for understanding the general pharmacological principles governing all leukocyte chemoattractant receptors. This article aims to provide an overview of the discovery and pharmacological characterization of FPRs, to introduce an International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR)-recommended nomenclature, and to discuss unmet challenges, including the mechanisms used by these receptors to bind diverse ligands and mediate different biological functions.","Ye, Richard D; Boulay, François; Wang, Ji Ming; Dahlgren, Claes; Gerard, Craig; Parmentier, Marc; Serhan, Charles N; Murphy, Philip M",Pharmacological reviews,343,1

These data could be useful to improve the selection of patients for thrombectomy. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with the Solitaire FR device were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively collected database. We assessed the effect of selected demographic characteristics, clinical and imaging factors on poor outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin score 3-6), mortality at 3 months, and hemorrhage at day 1 (symptomatic and asymptomatic). RESULTS From May 2010 to April 2012, 59 consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke underwent mechanical thrombectomy. At 3 months, 57.6% of the patients were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and mortality was 20.4%. Multivariate analyses revealed that a thrombus length > 14 mm (p = 0.02; OR 7.55; 95% CI 1.35-42.31) and longer endovascular procedure duration (p = 0.01; OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07) were independently associated with poor outcome. A higher baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score (p = 0.04; OR 0.79 per point; 95% CI 0.63-0.99) and successful recanalization (p = 0.02; OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01-0.72) were independent predictors of good functional outcome. Baseline ASPECT score (p < 0.01; OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.54-0.78) independently predicted symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at day 1. CONCLUSION Absolute baseline ASPECT score reflects early symptomatic hemorrhage risk and functional outcome at 3 months. Thrombus length measured on MRI play an important role on functional outcome at 3 months after thrombectomy. Further analyses are needed to determine its importance in the selection of patients for mechanical thrombectomy.","Soize, Sébastien; Barbe, Coralie; Kadziolka, Krzysztof; Estrade, Laurent; Serre, Isabelle; Pierot, Laurent",Neuroradiology,343,26

The objective is to describe the process of lifting these mitigation measures. METHODS The Plan for the Transition to a New Normality, approved on April 28, contained four sequential phases with progressive increase in socio-economic activities and population mobility. In parallel, a new strategy for early diagnosis, surveillance and control was implemented. A bilateral decision mechanism was established between the Spanish Government and the autonomous communities (AC), guided by a set of qualitative and quantitative indicators capturing the epidemiological situation and core capacities. The territorial units were established ad-hoc and could be from Basic Health Zones to entire AC. RESULTS The process run from May 4 to June 21, 2020. AC implemented plans for reinforcement of core capacities. Incidence decreased from a median (50% of territories) of 7.4 per 100,000 in 7 days at the beginning to 2.5 at the end. Median PCR testing increased from 53% to 89% of suspected cases and PCR total capacity from 4.5 to 9.8 per 1000 inhabitants weekly; positivity rate decreased from 3.5% to 1.8%. Median proportion of cases with traced contacts increased from 82% to 100%. CONCLUSION Systematic data collection, analysis, and interterritorial dialogue allowed adequate process control. The epidemiological situation improved but, mostly, the process entailed a great reinforcement of core response capacities nation-wide, under common criteria. Maintaining and further reinforcing capacities remained crucial for responding to future waves.","Monge, Susana; Zamalloa, Pello Latasa; Moros, María José Sierra; Olaso, Oscar Pérez; Miguel, Lucía García San; Varela, Carmen; Ariza, Silvia Rivera; Torres, María C Vázquez; Lucerón, María Del Carmen Olmedo; Yuste, Paloma González; Crespo, Pilar Soler; Pozo, Javier Segura Del; Gullón, Pedro; Carrasco, José Miguel; Sánchez, Elena Vanessa Martínez; Bravo, Lidia Redondo; Castañeda, Myriam Pichiule; Hermida, María Jesús Purriños; Vidal, Xurxo Hervada; Gonzalez, Ismael Huerta; Margolles, Mario; Luna, Hermelinda Vanaclocha; Gómara, Enrique Ramalle; Martín, Jaime Jesús Pérez; López, María Dolores Chirlaque; Fernández, María Jesús López; Lorusso, Nicola; Ubago, Alberto Carmona; Perez, Ana Rivas; Marin, Violeta Ramos; Alvarez, Juan José Criado; Pérez, Daniel Castrillejo; Anés, Atanasio A Góméz; Frontera, Marga; Rodriguez, Pedro Macias; León, Eva Elisa Álvarez; Casañas, Miriam Díaz; Perez, Maria Angeles Lopaz; Ágreda, Juan Pablo Alonso Pérez de; Gutierrez, Paloma Navas; Aguilar, Ignacio Rosell; Axpe, Jose Mª Arteagoitia; Carril, Fernando Gonzalez; Azcárraga, Pilar Aparicio; Soria, Fernando Simón; Rodríguez, Berta Suarez",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,343,16

When heated to ≥40°C, LTLD locally releases a high concentration of doxorubicin. We aimed to determine whether adding LTLD improves the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions with a maximum diameter (dmax) of 3 to 7 cm.Experimental Design: The HEAT Study was a randomized, double-blind, dummy-controlled trial of RFA ± LTLD. The 701 enrolled patients had to have ≤4 unresectable HCC lesions, at least one of which had a dmax of 3 to 7 cm. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and a key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Post hoc subset analyses investigated whether RFA duration was associated with efficacy.Results: The primary endpoint was not met; in intention-to-treat analysis, the PFS HR of RFA + LTLD versus RFA alone was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.18; P = 0.71], and the OS HR ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.20; P = 0.67). Among 285 patients with a solitary HCC lesion who received ≥45 minutes RFA dwell time, the OS HR was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41-0.96; P < 0.05) in favor of combination therapy. RFA + LTLD had reversible myelosuppression similar to free doxorubicin.Conclusions: Adding LTLD to RFA was safe but did not increase PFS or OS in the overall study population. However, consistent with LTLD's heat-based mechanism of action, subgroup analysis suggested that RFA + LTLD efficacy is improved when RFA dwell time for a solitary lesion ≥45 minutes.

We previously conducted a drug repositioning screen using molecular data from human BCCs and identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a potential treatment for BCC. Here we conduct the first proof-of-principle study of a topical pan-HDAC inhibitor, remetinostat, in human BCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a phase II, open-label, single-arm, single-institution trial of a topical HDAC inhibitor. Participants with at least one BCC were recruited. All participants applied 1% remetinostat gel three times daily for 6 weeks, with measurements of tumor diameter conducted at baseline and week 8. Surgical excision of the remaining tumor was conducted at the end of the study and microscopic evaluation was performed. RESULTS Thirty-three per-protocol tumors from 25 participants were included in the analysis. The overall response rate, defined as the proportion of tumors achieving more than 30% decrease in the longest diameter from baseline to week 8, was 69.7% [90% confidence interval (CI), 54%-82.5%]. On pathologic examination, 54.8% of tumors demonstrated complete resolution. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated similar levels of acetylated histone H3 in skin tissue before and after treatment, however, phosphorylation was increased. No systemic adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS The HDAC inhibitor remetinostat is a well-tolerated and effective topical treatment for reducing BCC disease burden in a clinically significant manner. This provides in-human validation of HDAC inhibitors as a therapy for BCC.","Kilgour, James M; Shah, Aatman; Urman, Nicole M; Eichstadt, Shaundra; Do, Hanh N; Bailey, Irene; Mirza, Amar; Li, Shufeng; Oro, Anthony E; Aasi, Sumaira Z; Sarin, Kavita Y",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,343,1

The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the COVID-19 infection can further complicate pregnancies and thus if the protocol we usually use for GDM pregnancies is also applicable to patients who have contracted a Sars-Cov-2 infection. METHODS This is a retrospective study analysing all pregnant women with gestational diabetes and a concomitant COVID-19 infection admitted to our Institution for antenatal care between March 1st and April 30th 2020. RESULTS Among pregnant women with GD and a concomitant COVID-19 infection, the mean age was 32,9 (SD 5,6) years. Two patients (33%) were of Caucasian ethnicity while four (67%) were non-Caucasian. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy. Two women were asymptomatic while four were symptomatic. Only two patients (33,3%) received treatment with insulin. None of the patients required intensive care or mechanical ventilation. No complications were found among the newborns. CONCLUSION the COVID-19 infection was not found to worsen the prognosis of GD patients or of their offspring. Glycaemic monitoring, diet therapy and insulin, when needed, are sufficient for a good metabolic control and a favourable maternal and fetal outcome.","D'Ambrosi, F; Rossi, G; Soldavini, C M; Maggi, V; Cetera, G E; Carbone, I F; Di Martino, D; Di Maso, M; Ferrazzi, E",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,343,1

Interestingly, traditional and current definitions and attributes of professionalism do not include components of well-being; ideas of altruism and self-sacrifice predominate. However, it is imperative that student pharmacists are provided with the tools, resources, and time needed to invest in themselves to maintain their well-being, which in turn, allows them to fulfill our profession's standards of professional conduct and engagement. Thankfully, while seeming to conflict based on classic interpretations, practicing self-care to promote our personal well-being is not in conflict with being an altruistic, self-sacrificing professional.

This radiopharmaceutical, which is based on an aminopolycarboxylate ligand, is formed as a single species and has a dangling carboxylate group favoring tubular transport. METHODS Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] was prepared by using commercially available NTA and an IsoLink kit and isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The stability of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] in isotonic saline was assessed for 24 h and was further evaluated by incubation in 0.1 M cysteine and histidine for 4 h at 37 degrees C. The biodistribution of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)], coinjected with (131)I-OIH as an internal control, was evaluated in 5 normal Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 min, 5 normal Sprague-Dawley rats at 60 min (group A), and 6 rats with renal pedicle ligation at 60 min (group B) after injection. Clearance and extraction fraction studies were conducted in 2 normal Sprague-Dawley rats, and urine and plasma from 2 additional normal rats each were analyzed for metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS The radiochemical purity of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] was greater than 99%, the complex was stable for 24 h at physiologic pH, and the challenge experiments showed no degradation. In normal rats, the percentage dose in the urine at 10 and 60 min was 108% +/- 9% and 101% +/- 5%, respectively, that of (131)I-OIH; minimal hepatic or gastrointestinal activity was demonstrated. In group B rats, Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] was better retained in the blood and had less excretion into the bowel than did (131)I-OIH (P < 0.01). The plasma clearances of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] and (131)I-OIH were comparable, but the extraction fraction of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] was 93.5% +/- 3.8%, compared with 67.9% +/- 6.1% for (131)I-OIH. Plasma protein binding of Na(2)[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA)] averaged 67% +/- 7%, and red cell uptake was 7% +/- 2%.

To date, the only report of MERS-CoV seropositivity among humans in Kenya is of two livestock keepers with no known contact with camels. We assessed whether persons exposed to seropositive camels at household level had serological evidence of infection. In 2013, 760 human and 879 camel sera were collected from 275 and 85 households respectively in Marsabit County. Data on human and animal demographics and type of contact with camels were collected. Human and camel sera were tested for anti-MERS-CoV IgG using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Human samples were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with seropositivity. The median age of persons sampled was 30 years (range: 5-90) and 50% were males. A quarter (197/760) of the participants reported having had contact with camels defined as milking, feeding, watering, slaughtering, or herding. Of the human sera, 18 (2.4%) were positive on ELISA but negative by PRNT. Of the camel sera, 791 (90%) were positive on ELISA. On univariate analysis, higher prevalence was observed in female and older camels over 4 years of age (P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, only age remained significantly associated with increased odds of seropositivity. Despite high seroprevalence among camels, there was no serological confirmation of MERS-CoV infection among camel pastoralists in Marsabit County. The high seropositivity suggests that MERS-CoV or other closely related virus continues to circulate in camels and highlights ongoing potential for animal-to-human transmission.","Munyua, Peninah; Corman, Victor Max; Bitek, Austine; Osoro, Eric; Meyer, Benjamin; Müller, Marcel A; Lattwein, Erik; Thumbi, S M; Murithi, Rees; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Drosten, Christian; Njenga, M Kariuki",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,343,16

Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. RESULTS COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% received flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar proportion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs /sartans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, elderly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneumococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COVID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the territory, the probability of hospitalisation/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. CONCLUSIONS the greatest risk of hospitalisation/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, elderly, and for individuals with comorbidities. Flu vaccination seemed to have had a protective effect while pneumococcal vaccination likely identified a group of high-risk patients to be actively monitored. For patients infected in the territory, different hospitalisation strategies were implemented by the regional health districts.","Gobbato, Michele; Calagnan, Elena; Burba, Ivana; Rizzi, Laura; Grassetti, Luca; Del Zotto, Stefania; Dal Maso, Luigini; Serraiono, Diego; Tonutti, Giuseppe",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,343,12

The objectives of this study were (1) to determine if the MIR process can enhance the inactivation of Escherichia coli cells under anaerobic conditions and (2) to identify potential inactivation mechanisms. Laboratory microcosm experiments showed that the presence of MIR activity significantly enhanced E. coli inactivation, and the inactivation rate under the MIR condition was significantly larger than those under other anaerobic redox conditions. Under anoxic condition, higher Fe2+concentrations exhibited a linear function to larger E. coli inactivation rates, indicating that the production of Fe2+by MIR was one of the important roles in E. coli inactivation. When E. coli cells were amended as the sole electron source to the MIR process, increased Fe2+ production was observed, which corresponded to decreasing TOC concentration. Together, the results suggest that MIR enhanced E. coli inactivation through the production of Fe2+ as metabolic waste, and the inactivation benefited the MIR process as the inactivated cells were used as an electron source, which represents a potential new mechanism for bacterial inter-species competition. This knowledge could further improve our understanding of the fate of fecal bacteria in natural environments where the MIR process is prevalent, and may also be explored for enhanced removal of bacterial pathogens in engineering processes.","Kim, Lavane; Yan, Tao; Pham, Van Toan",Environmental science and pollution research international,343,8

This meta-analysis assessed whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) of the lower limbs was effective in reducing venous thromboembolism and whether combining pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with IPC would enhance its effectiveness. METHODS AND RESULTS Two reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane controlled trial register (1966-February 2013) for randomized, controlled trials and assessed the outcomes and quality of the trials independently. Trials comparing IPC with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, thromboembolic deterrent stockings, no prophylaxis, and a combination of IPC and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis were considered. Trials that used IPC <24 hours or compared different types of IPC were excluded. A total of 16 164 hospitalized patients from 70 trials met the inclusion criteria and were subjected to meta-analysis. IPC was more effective than no IPC prophylaxis in reducing deep vein thrombosis (7.3% versus 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 9.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-10.9; relative risk, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.52; P<0.01; I(2)=34%) and pulmonary embolism (1.2% versus 2.8%; absolute risk reduction, 1.6%; 95% CI, 0.9-2.3; relative risk, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.69; P<0.01; I(2)=0%). IPC was also more effective than thromboembolic deterrent stockings in reducing deep vein thrombosis and appeared to be as effective as pharmacological thromboprophylaxis but with a reduced risk of bleeding (relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.65; P<0.01; I(2)=0%). Adding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to IPC further reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis (relative risk, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91; P=0.02; I(2)=0%) compared with IPC alone. CONCLUSIONS IPC was effective in reducing venous thromboembolism, and combining pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with IPC was more effective than using IPC alone.","Ho, Kwok M; Tan, Jen Aik",Circulation,343,28

The onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome led this patient to receive endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and subsequent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for life support. He was isolated in the negative air pressure room in the intensive care unit for infection control for this emerging respiratory infectious disease. This patient was also confronted with emotional pressures arising from the general uncertainty regarding the progress of this novel disease and from being isolated from the outside world. The care period was from April 5th to May 12th, 2020. The data was collected through direct care, written conversations, physical communication, observation, medical record reviews, diagnosis reports, and nursing assessments of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress. The health problems of this patient were identified as gas exchange disorder, infection, anxiety, and other problems. Our chest physiotherapy team comprised nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists. After administering individualized treatments, including monitoring vital signs and installing an external life support system, the lung consolidation and lung collapse problems of the patient improved, allowing the ventilator to be removed. To address the patient's psychological problems, we used a humanoid diagram and whiteboard drawing as communication tools to explain to the patient the reasons for and functions of the different tubes on his body to reduce his anxiety and maintain the safe use of these tubes. Moreover, bedside care was replaced by mobile phone video and phone calls, allowing the patient to communicate with family members, which reduced his isolation-related anxiety and enhanced his compliance with treatment and care protocols. This experience supports the benefit of installing two-way video devices and viewing monitors in negative pressure rooms in the ICU to facilitate effective communications between patients, patient family members, and the medical team to reduce patient-perceived anxiety and social isolation. This case report provides a reference demonstrating a patient-centered caring model for treating COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","Wang, Yo-Ping; Chuang, Pao-Yu; Gone, Shu-Ing; Tseng, Chi-Ying",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,343,1

She had a concomitant metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.46, HCO3- 40 mmol/L, pCO2 54.6 mmHg). A history of significant Quick-Eze use (a calcium carbonate based antacid) for abdominal discomfort, for 2 weeks prior to presentation, suggested a diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome (MAS). Further investigations did not demonstrate malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism. Following management with i.v. fluid rehydration and a single dose of i.v. bisphosphonate, she developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia requiring oral and parenteral calcium replacement. She was discharged from the hospital with stable biochemistry on follow-up. This case demonstrates the importance of a detailed history in the diagnosis of severe hypercalcaemia, with MAS representing the third most common cause of hypercalcaemia. We discuss its pathophysiology and clinical importance, which can often present with severe hypercalcaemia that can respond precipitously to calcium-lowering therapy. Learning points Milk-alkali syndrome is an often unrecognised cause for hypercalcaemia, but is the third most common cause of admission for hypercalcaemia. Calcium ingestion leading to MAS can occur at intakes as low as 1.0-1.5 g per day in those with risk factors. Early recognition of this syndrome can avoid the use of calcium-lowering therapy such as bisphosphonates which can precipitate hypocalcaemia.","Wang, Mawson; Cho, Catherine; Gray, Callum; Chai, Thora Y; Daud, Ruhaida; Luttrell, Matthew","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",343,26

The current study examined the relationship between cognitive function and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress as well as the moderating effects of age, time since MBC diagnosis, and social support. METHODS Subjective and objective measures of cognitive function as well as self-reports of emotional vulnerability were completed by 59 women diagnosed with MBC who were recruited through social media and support groups. RESULTS Emotional vulnerability scores were associated with perceived measures of cognitive function. Additionally, low levels of perceived cognitive function were met with increased levels of depression with social support moderating this relationship buffering against depression. Age was found to moderate the relationship between cognitive function and post-traumatic stress with younger women at a greater risk of vulnerability. Out of all the emotional vulnerability measures, only anxiety negatively correlated with objective task performance. CONCLUSIONS This study established a relationship between cognitive function and emotional vulnerability in MBC patients. It emphasised how vulnerable younger MBC women are to post-traumatic stress, and the importance of the combined effects of cognitive function and social support in buffering against depression. Our results have important implications for developing new interventions and treatment plans that consider the roles of these factors in ensuring a better quality of life in MBC.

The degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine was predominantly contributed by chlorination (>60%), direct UV photolysis (>80%) and radical oxidation (>90%), respectively, during the treatment by the UV-LED/chlorine AOP at three tested UV wavelengths (i.e., 265, 285 and 300 nm). The most effective UV wavelengths for the degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine were 265, 285 and 300 nm, respectively. The degradation of all the three micropollutants was enhanced with increasing pH from 6 to 8, though the reasons for the pH dependence were different. The residues of the micropollutants and their degradation (by)products were removed by post-adsorption using granular activated carbon (GAC). Interestingly and more importantly, the adsorption rates of the degradation (by)products were 2-3 times higher than the adsorption rates of the corresponding micropollutants, indicating the formation of more adsorbable (by)products after the AOP pre-treatment. The UV-LED/chlorine AOP followed by GAC adsorption provides a multi-barrier treatment system for enhancing micropollutant removal in potable water. The findings also suggest the merit of the sequential use of UV-LEDs followed by GAC in treating chlorine-containing potable water in small-scale water treatment systems (e.g., point-of-use or point-of-entry water purifiers).","Yin, Ran; Shang, Chii",Water research,343,8

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed age restrictions on levonorgestrel EC and made it available over-the-counter to everyone in 2013. Despite improved availability and accessibility since the change in FDA regulations, community pharmacies have not uniformly embraced the policy. West Virginia is a rural state with high rates of poverty and teen pregnancy. DESIGN The investigators called community pharmacies in West Virginia to assess the availability and accessibility of levonorgestrel EC in addition to the pharmacy staff's knowledge of effectiveness for this cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study sample consisted of 509 community pharmacies throughout the state. OUTCOME MEASURES A structured script was employed to conduct phone calls to community pharmacies with items assessing availability, accessibility, and knowledge of effectiveness. RESULTS At the time of the phone calls, levonorgestrel EC was reported to be available in 48.9% of the community pharmacies in West Virginia. Chain pharmacies were more likely to report EC as being in stock (0.76) than independent pharmacies (0.15.). Other measures of accessibility also favored chain pharmacies versus independent pharmacies. The overall accessibility of EC at West Virginia community pharmacies was derived from a binary composite variable of ""completely accessible"" or ""not completely accessible"" by combining 5 predetermined items. Overall, EC was completely accessible to callers in 0.27 of all pharmacies with significant differences by pharmacy type (0.47 of chain pharmacies as compared with 0.03 of independent pharmacies). CONCLUSION Accessible EC could reduce unintended pregnancy and help break the state's generational cycle of poverty and poor educational, social, and health outcomes.

This modality is however underused, in part because of limitations in the available equipment. OBJECTIVE To develop a new flexible and moldable mouthpiece, aiming to address some of the issues of the currently available interfaces. METHODS We compared two commercially available and the newly developed mouthpieces in a bench test using four life-support home ventilators and three settings per ventilator. RESULTS The three interfaces showed marked differences in their resistive characteristics. In the volume-controlled setting (VC-CMV) with 500 mL tidal volume (VT ), the delivered VT , ranged between 459 ± 7 mL (-8%) and 501 ± 4 mL (+0.2%), according to the used ventilator. In the VC-CMV setting with VT 1000 mL, one of the ventilators did not assure the set VT with the new mouthpiece, because of the high-pressure limitation. In the pressure-controlled setting (PC-CMV at 20 cmH2 O), the effective pressure differed between the tested interfaces according to their resistance, resulting in a decrease in the delivered VT . CONCLUSIONS They found measurable differences in the ventilation's performances comparing the interfaces for mouthpiece ventilation, which seem to have a minor clinical relevance in the most settings, but should be systematically checked. They validated in-vitro the newly developed mouthpiece with respect to the ventilation performances; a clinical study is needed to investigate the potential advantages we expect from the new mouthpiece.","Ogna, Adam; Prigent, Helene; Falaize, Line; Leroux, Karl; Santos, Dante; Vaugier, Isabelle; Orlikowski, David; Lofaso, Frederic",The clinical respiratory journal,343,25

OBJECTIVE To present a large single-center experience with the endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms. METHODS The neurointerventional database at our institution was reviewed for all endovascular treatments of MCA aneurysms. Demographics, aneurysm characteristics, treatment modality, intraprocedural hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, 30-day neurological events, and follow-up angiographic studies were recorded. RESULTS From December 1996 to April 2013, 292 patients underwent endovascular treatment of 346 MCA aneurysms. Of these, 341 (98.6%) were successfully completed. Balloon neck remodeling was used in 230 procedures (66.5%). Ninety-five procedures (27.4%) were for ruptured aneurysms. The rate of intraprocedural hemorrhage was 2.6% (9 of 346). The overall rate of intraprocedural thromboembolic events was 13.6% (47 of 346), significantly more common in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (27.4%; P < .001). The 30-day major (modified Rankin Scale score > 2) neurological event rate was 2.9% (10 of 346), significantly more common in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (8.4%) compared with those without (0.8%; P < .001). The rate of complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion at was 90.6% ≥ 6 months and 91.8% at ≥ 2 years, with an average of 24 months of follow-up available for 247 procedures.

This study compares endoscopic vacuum therapy versus placement of covered stents for anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy. METHODS N = 45 consecutive patients with anastomotic leaks following esophagectomy (including patients referred to our center from other hospitals for complication management) were managed by endoscopic therapy at our institution from January 2009 to February 2015. Outcomes of stent and endoscopic vacuum therapy were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Thirty patients received endoscopic stent placement and 15 endoscopic vacuum therapy. In the stent group, seven patients were switched to endoscopic vacuum and four to surgery. Classified by type of initial endoscopic therapy, the success rate (anastomotic healing, patient recovered) was higher for endoscopic vacuum therapy (endoscopic vacuum 93.3%, stent 63.3 %; p = 0.038). Classified by final endoscopic therapy (after switches in therapy), success rates were 86.4 and 60.9% (p = 0.091), respectively. There was no difference observed in mortality, duration of therapy, and length of hospital stay between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic vacuum therapy might be more effective than endoscopic stent placement in the management of esophageal anastomotic leaks.","Mennigen, Rudolf; Harting, Carolin; Lindner, Kirsten; Vowinkel, Thorsten; Rijcken, Emile; Palmes, Daniel; Senninger, Norbert; Laukoetter, Mike G",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,343,1

Ideally, the incorporation of brain monitoring into routine practice would promote the maintenance of an optimal depth of anaesthesia, with an ultimate goal of avoiding the negative outcomes that have been associated with inadequate or excessive anaesthesia. A variety of processed electroencephalogram devices exist, of which the bispectral index is the most widely used, particularly in the research setting. Whether such devices prove to be useful will depend not only on their ability to influence anaesthetic management but also on whether the changes they promote can actually affect clinically important outcomes. This review highlights the evidence for the role of bispectral index monitoring, in particular, in guiding anaesthetic management and influencing clinical outcomes, specifically intra-operative awareness, measures of early recovery, mortality and neurocognitive outcomes.","Escallier, K E; Nadelson, M R; Zhou, D; Avidan, M S",Anaesthesia,343,16

Due to unavailability of vaccine or targeted novel drug therapy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), screening of existential medical treatments facilitates identification of promising drugs for the treatment and management of COVID-19. Areas covered: The review article highlights repurposing of antiviral, antimalarial, antineoplastic, antidiabetic, analgesic and immunomodulatory drugs. Furthermore, clinical trials, in-vitro studies, benefits, adverse effects, toxicities, mechanisms of action and regulatory status of drugs are covered in this article. Expert opinion: Lack of conclusive results from randomized clinical trials indicate absence of specific drugs for treatment of COVID-19. Unavailability of complete data regarding safety, efficacy and adverse reactions of drugs restricts the recommendation of clinical advice on dose and duration of the drug therapy. Remdesivir and favipiravir show promising outcomes but more clinical evidence is required for use in large populations. Experimental and repurposed drug therapies targeting spike and envelope proteins, Mpro, 3CLpro and PLpro enzymes and RdRp and TMPRSS2 genes show capability to produce effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 action.

The hematometra was drained, and the cervix was repositioned into the vagina with use of a combined vaginal and laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSION(S) Retraction of the cervix into the cul-de-sac can occur as a complication of excision of rectovaginal nodules that extend onto the posterior surface of the cervix.

In addition, to determine the clinical and procedural outcomes in six patients who underwent PDA balloon sizing with subsequent deployment of a PDA occluder device. BACKGROUND Transcatheter PDA closure in adults has excellent safety and procedural outcomes. However, PDA sizing in adults can be challenging due to variable defect size, high flow state, or anatomical complexity. We describe a series of six cases where the balloon- pull through technique was successfully performed for PDA sizing prior to transcatheter closure. METHODS Consecutive adult patients undergoing adult PDA closure at our institution were studied retrospectively. A partially inflated sizing balloon was pulled through the defect from the aorta into the pulmonary artery and the balloon waist diameter was measured. Procedural success and clinical outcomes were obtained. RESULTS Six adult patients underwent successful balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing during transcatheter PDA closure, since conventional angiography often gave suboptimal opacification of the defect. All PDAs were treated with closure devices based on balloon PDA sizing with complete closure and no complications. In three patients that underwent preprocedure computed tomography, the balloon size matched the CT derived measurements. CONCLUSION The balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing is a safe and accurate sizing modality in adults undergoing transcatheter PDA closure.","Shafi, Nabil A; Singh, Gagan D; Smith, Thomas W; Rogers, Jason H",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,343,1

BACKGROUND The prognostic value of ASB-related complications after STEMI is subject to debate. METHODS The prognostic value of ASB and non-ASB for 1-year mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and stroke was investigated in 2,002 STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of studies investigating the prognostic value of ASB and non-ASB in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. RESULTS Seventy-four patients (3.7%) were treated by radial access. ASB developed in 124 patients (6.3%) and non-ASB developed in 102 (5.2%). By multivariable analysis, ASB was not associated with a higher risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03; p = 0.89), recurrent MI (HR: 1.16; p = 0.64), stent thrombosis (HR: 0.55; p = 0.42), or stroke (HR: 0.47; p = 0.31). Non-ASB was independently associated with 1-year mortality (HR: 2.77; p < 0.001) and stent thrombosis (HR: 3.10; p = 0.021), but not with recurrent MI and stroke. In a meta-analysis including 495,630 patients, non-ASB was associated with a greater adjusted risk of subsequent 1-year mortality than ASB (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.56 to 1.76 and HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.31). CONCLUSIONS In STEMI, ASB was not significantly associated with 1-year clinical outcomes, whereas non-ASB was significantly associated with 1-year mortality and stent thrombosis.

Of at least 21 BBS-related genes that can carry multiple mutations, a pathogenic mutation, BBS1M390R, is the single most common mutation of clinically diagnosed BBS outcomes. While the deletion of BBS-related genes in mice can cause variable penetrance in different organ systems, the impact of the Bbs1M390R mutation in the olfactory system remains unclear. Using a clinically relevant knock-in mouse model homozygous for Bbs1M390R, we investigated the impact of the mutation on the olfactory system and tested the potential of viral-mediated, wildtype gene replacement therapy to rescue smell loss. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in Bbs1M390R/M390R mice were significantly shorter and fewer than those of wild-type mice. Also, both peripheral cellular odor detection and synaptic-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb were significantly decreased in the mutant mice. Furthermore, to gain insight into the degree to which perceptual features are impaired in the mutant mice, we used whole-body plethysmography to quantitatively measure odor-evoked sniffing. The Bbs1M390R/M390R mice showed significantly higher odor detection thresholds (reduced odor sensitivity) compared to wild-type mice; however, their odor discrimination acuity was still well maintained. Importantly, adenoviral expression of Bbs1 in OSNs restored cilia length and re-established both peripheral odorant detection and odor perception. Together, our findings further expand our understanding for the development of gene therapeutic treatment for congenital ciliopathies in the olfactory system.","Xie, Chao; Habif, Julien C; Uytingco, Cedric R; Ukhanov, Kirill; Zhang, Lian; de Celis, Carlos; Sheffield, Val C; Martens, Jeffrey R",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,343,33

Detection of risk factors could prevent respiratory problems and reduce permanent lung damage. We aimed to provide a multidisciplinary approach for the causes, frequency, and concomitant problems and solutions of respiratory problems of these patients. METHOD Medical records of CP patients who were followed-up and treated due to respiratory problems requiring hospitalization were examined retrospectively, and factors affecting the frequency and duration of hospitalization in wards and in the intensive care unit (ICU) were evaluated. RESULTS Among 292 hospitalizations of 83 CP patients, 91% of them were hospitalized for pneumonia, and only 15.4% of them had major aspiration-related pneumonia in the history. 97.4% of the hospitalized patients had swallowing dysfunction in detailed history, but videofluoroscopic swallowing studies could be performed only to 24 patients and aspiration had been demonstrated in 96%. Patients who had been hospitalized more than two times during the oral feeding period, before switching to artificial feeding (nasogastric tube, gastric tube +/- fundoplication), had higher total and ICU hospitalization frequency/duration than the patients who had been hospitalized twice or less (0.12 vs. 0.17/0.005106 vs. 0.005353). CONCLUSION The most common pulmonary complication in patients with CP is pneumonia due to chronic aspiration. To prevent recurrent lung infections and consequently chronic respiratory failure, it is necessary to evaluate these patients in terms of feeding difficulties in the early period with appropriate methods and apply interventions before affecting the lung parenchyma.","Kürtül Çakar, Meltem; Cinel, Güzin",Pediatric pulmonology,343,17

Six key elements of SDM can be distinguished: situation diagnosis, choice awareness, option clarification, discussion of harms and benefits, deliberation of patient preferences and making the decision. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that facilitate SDM. The impact of DAs for chronic illnesses on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes remains uncertain. METHODS We will perform a systematic review aiming to describe (a) which SDM elements are incorporated in DAs for adult patients with chronic conditions and (b) the effects of DA use on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes.

The results of a study in the population residing in Sicily Region (Southern Italy)].,18.155249,8.129695,2020,"BACKGROUND Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent; it places women at risk for other chronic pain conditions. There is a high degree of individual variability in menstrual pain severity, the number of painful sites, and co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Distinct dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were previously identified, but the biological underpinnings of these phenotypes are less known. One underexplored contributor is the vaginal microbiome. The vaginal microbiota differs significantly among reproductive-age women and may modulate as well as amplify reproductive tract inflammation, which may contribute to dysmenorrhea symptoms. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to examine associations between dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes and vaginal microbiome compositions on- and off-menses. METHODS We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, pilot study of 20 women (aged 15-24) grouped into three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes: ""mild localized pain,"" ""severe localized pain,"" and ""severe multiple pain and gastrointestinal symptoms."" Over one menstrual cycle, participants provided vaginal swabs when they were on-menses and off-menses. We assayed the vaginal microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance tests were used to compare microbiome compositions across phenotypes, with heat maps generated to visualize the relative abundance of bacterial taxa. RESULTS The vaginal microbiome compositions (n = 40) were different across the three phenotypes. After separating the on-menses (n = 20) and off-menses (n = 20) specimens, the statistically significant difference was seen on-menses, but not off-menses. Compared to the ""mild localized pain"" phenotype, participants in the ""multiple severe symptoms"" phenotype had a lower lactobacilli level and a higher abundance of Prevotella, Atopobium, and Gardnerella when on-menses. We also observed trends of differences across phenotypes in vaginal microbiome change from off- to on-menses. DISCUSSION The study provides proof-of-concept data to support larger studies on associations between dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes and vaginal microbiome that might lead to new intervention targets and/or biomarkers for dysmenorrhea. This line of research has the potential to inform precision dysmenorrhea treatment that can improve women's quality of life.","Chen, Chen X; Carpenter, Janet S; Gao, Xiang; Toh, Evelyn; Dong, Qunfeng; Nelson, David E; Mitchell, Caroline; Fortenberry, J Dennis",Nursing research,343,1

METHODS In 97 patients with CRC (n = 48) and NSCLC (n = 49), FDG-PET was performed before and during the course of chemotherapy. Relative changes in SUV (DeltaSUV) were determined after correction for injected dose and bodyweight, lean body mass, body surface area or a combination of bodyweight and plasma glucose. The predictive value for overall and progression-free survival with respect to the different normalized DeltaSUVs was assessed. RESULTS In both CRC and NSCLC, no differences were seen in the degree of change between the four SUV-normalizations during chemotherapy. Cox regression analysis for overall survival showed significant hazard ratios of 1.14-1.16 per 10% SUV change in CRC and 1.10-1.13 in NSCLC and for progression-free survival hazard ratios of 1.15 per 10% DeltaSUV change in CRC and 1.10-1.12 in NSCLC. CONCLUSION Relative changes in SUV is a strong predictor for survival in both CRC and NSCLC. None of the four normalization methods showed statistical advantage over the other. Therefore, simplifying the methods for analysis of FDG-PET data can improve the incorporation of FDG-PET in clinical treatment-response monitoring and may facilitate application in multicentre trials.","Vriens, Dennis; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W; Timmer-Bonte, Johanna N H; Krabbe, Paul F M; Visser, Eric P; Oyen, Wim J G",Nuclear medicine communications,343,17

METHODS Thirty-three predictors of clinical deterioration identified from literature were assessed in a modified two-stage Delphi-process. Sixty-eight clinicians (physicians and nurses) participated in the first round and 48 in the second round; all treating hospitalised patients in Danish emergency departments, some with prehospital experience. The panel rated the predictors for relevance (relevant marker of clinical deterioration) and applicability (change in clinical presentation over time, generic in nature and possible to detect bedside). They rated their level of agreement on a 9-point Likert scale and were also invited to propose additional generic predictors between the rounds. New predictors suggested by more than one clinician were included in the second round along with non-consensus predictors from the first round. Final decisions of non-consensus predictors after second round were made by a research group and an impartial physician. RESULTS The Delphi-process resulted in 19 clinically relevant and applicable predictors based on vital signs and parameters (respiratory rate, saturation, dyspnoea, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, abnormal electrocardiogram, altered mental state and temperature), biochemical tests (serum c-reactive protein, serum bicarbonate, serum lactate, serum pH, serum potassium, glucose, leucocyte counts and serum haemoglobin), objective clinical observations (skin conditions) and subjective clinical observations (pain reported as new or escalating, and relatives' concerns). CONCLUSION The Delphi-process led to consensus of 19 potential predictors of clinical deterioration widely accepted as relevant and applicable in emergency departments.","Tygesen, Gitte Boier; Kirkegaard, Hans; Raaber, Nikolaj; Rask, Mette Trøllund; Lisby, Marianne",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,343,1

Materials and Methods A web camera was modified by removing its infrared filter and mounted on a chin rest. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) operating at infrared and visible spectra were integrated to provide background and light stimulus, respectively. The LEDs were controlled by a microprocessor board. Stimulation was presented using a periodic paradigm with variable period and duty cycle. Videos of both pupils were recorded at 30 frames/second and processed offline using software developed in-house. The overall system was validated with data gathered from individuals with healthy vision under different stimulation paradigms. Temporal variations in pupil size were determined and analyzed statistically. Results The analysis revealed that the pupil sizes were accurately measured from the video frames provided that reflections from both infrared and visible lights remain outside the pupil. The system achieved moderate to excellent repeatability scores (87.8 and 86.8% for short 1 second and long 2 second pulses, respectively), which demonstrated its effectiveness and confirmed that it can be used reliably as a pupillometer. Conclusion The proposed pupillometer system produces useful, quantitative data characterizing pupillary light response. However, further development and implementation are needed to potentially turn it into a low-cost alternative for other studies involving the autonomic nervous system, cognitive function, drug metabolism, pain response, psychology, fatigue, and sleep disorders.","Kıylıoğlu, Nefati; Kılıç, Mahmut Alp; Kocatürk, Tolga; Özkan, Seyhan Bahar; Bilgen, Mehmet",Turkish journal of ophthalmology,343,1

Our objective was to describe the change in maximum urethral closure pressures (MUCPs) after MUS surgery using an 8F high-resolution manometry (HRM) system that can measure urethral pressures during cough and strain maneuvers (ManoScan® ESO; Covidien) without migration or withdrawal limitations. METHODS We measured rest, cough, and strain MUCPs in 26 women before and after retropubic or transobturator MUS for stress urinary incontinence using the HRM system. RESULTS The objective success rate after MUS was 92.3 % based on postoperative cough stress testing. Mean resting MUCPs measured by HRM did not change after surgery (59.3 before vs. 59.7 cm H2O after surgery; p = 1.0). Mean cough MUCPs measured by HRM increased from 36.9 to 100.7 cm H2O (p < 0.001), and strain MUCPs increased from 35.0 to 92.7 cm H2O (p < 0.001).

However, β-thalassemia disorder still has considerable lifetime treatment demands and heightened risk of frequent complications due to transfusion-transmitted infections and iron overload, which may affect thalassemic patients' functioning in different domains. OBJECTIVES The vast majority of published studies on thalassemic patients have focused on children and adolescent functioning, and little research has examined adults. Hence, the current study was planned to examine the functioning and resilience of adult thalassemic patients in a comprehensive way. METHODS We examined multidimensional resilience and functioning across different domains (psychological adjustment, treatment adherence, social functioning and occupational functioning). We also examined demographic and medical variables that may relate to resilience and functioning. Participants were adult patients [n = 38; age M = 31·63, standard deviation (SD) = 7·72; 72% female] with transfusion-dependent thalassemia in treatment in a hospital in the northeastern United States. RESULTS The results suggest that most adult thalassemic patients tend to be resilient, demonstrating good functioning in four main domains: psychological adjustment, treatment adherence, social functioning and occupational functioning. CONCLUSION Despite the considerable demands of their illness, adult thalassemic patients appeared to be adapting well, demonstrating evidence of multidimensional resilience.","Almahmoud, S Y; Coifman, K G; Ross, G S; Kleinert, D; Giardina, P",Transfusion medicine,343,7

A new temperature-time point comparison method was proposed to match TTIs with food. This method omits the step of calculating activation energy (Ea ). It only compares the difference between TTI response time and food shelf life to determine their matching degree. Taking gold nanoparticle-based TTIs and muffins as experimental objects, the new and the traditional matching methods were used to match the absorbance of TTI and the peroxide value of muffins. The two results are not significantly different. TTIs with gelatin solution and gold precursor solution concentration of 150.00 and 2.05 mg/mL, respectively, can show the quality of muffins. TTIs changed from light yellow to pink and finally appeared deep purple. The deep purple represented spoilage and inedibility of muffins. Comparing Ea of food and that of TTIs can preliminarily evaluate their matching degree, improving the experiment efficiency. Hence, it is reasonable to use the traditional matching method in most cases, and use the new method only when Ea of food cannot be obtained. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The deterioration rate of food is usually calculated by developing kinetic models of characteristic quality parameters. When the reaction rate is unavailable or inaccurate, the activation energy of food cannot be obtained. In this case, it is impossible to match TTIs with food based on the traditional method. This research develops a new matching method and helps TTIs and food to be matched without considering activation energy. It will promote the application of TTIs in more products.","Zhang, Lixuan; Sun, Ruonan; Yu, Hufei; Yu, Hailong; Xu, Gaolei; Deng, Liming; Qian, Jing",Journal of food science,343,1

In this review of methods, we aimed to: (i) classify and describe different complex systems methods in evaluation applied to public health; and (ii) examine the kinds of evaluative evidence generated by these different methods. METHODS We adapted critical review methods to identify evaluations of public health interventions that used systems methods. We conducted expert consultation, searched electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), and followed citations of relevant systematic reviews. Evaluations were included if they self-identified as using systems- or complexity-informed methods and if they evaluated existing or hypothetical public health interventions. Case studies were selected to illustrate different types of complex systems evaluation. FINDINGS Seventy-four unique studies met our inclusion criteria. A framework was developed to map the included studies onto different stages of the evaluation process, which parallels the planning, delivery, assessment, and further delivery phases of the interventions they seek to inform; these stages include: 1) theorising; 2) prediction (simulation); 3) process evaluation; 4) impact evaluation; and 5) further prediction (simulation). Within this framework, we broadly categorised methodological approaches as mapping, modelling, network analysis and 'system framing' (the application of a complex systems perspective to a range of study designs). Studies frequently applied more than one type of systems method. CONCLUSIONS A range of complex systems methods can be utilised, adapted, or combined to produce different types of evaluative evidence. Further methodological innovation in systems evaluation may generate stronger evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities in our complex world.","McGill, Elizabeth; Er, Vanessa; Penney, Tarra; Egan, Matt; White, Martin; Meier, Petra; Whitehead, Margaret; Lock, Karen; Anderson de Cuevas, Rachel; Smith, Richard; Savona, Natalie; Rutter, Harry; Marks, Dalya; de Vocht, Frank; Cummins, Steven; Popay, Jennie; Petticrew, Mark",Social science & medicine,343,1

CASE PRESENTATION A 40-year old woman and a 54-year old man with severe COVID-19 underwent corticosteroid therapy for immune-related lung injuries. The first case presented with a bilateral visual loss and complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye. The second case presented with vision loss, proptosis, orbital inflammation, and complete ophthalmoplegia on the left side. Histopathologic, nasal endoscopic examinations, and radiologic findings confirmed mucormycosis in both patients. The patients denied orbital exenteration and were managed with systemic amphotericin B and daily endoscopic sinus debridement and irrigation with diluted amphotericin B. Because of the intracranial space involvement, the first case died. The second case was successfully managed surgically and medically. CONCLUSION Rhino-orbital/cerebral mucormycosis may be developed in COVID-19 patients under treatment with corticosteroid, and requires prompt diagnosis and management.","Veisi, Amirreza; Bagheri, Abbas; Eshaghi, Mohammad; Rikhtehgar, Mohamad Hasan; Rezaei Kanavi, Mozhgan; Farjad, Reza",European journal of ophthalmology,343,1

Although the efficacy of these interventions has traditionally been measured by their ability to reduce the proportion of household contacts who exhibit symptoms [household secondary attack rate (hSAR)], this metric is difficult to interpret and makes only partial use of data collected by modern field studies. Here, we use Bayesian transmission model inference to analyze jointly both symptom reporting and viral shedding data from a three-armed study of influenza interventions. The reduction in hazard of infection in the increased hand hygiene intervention arm was 37.0% [8.3%, 57.8%], whereas the equivalent reduction in the other intervention arm was 27.2% [-0.46%, 52.3%] (increased hand hygiene and face masks). By imputing the presence and timing of unobserved infection, we estimated that only 61.7% [43.1%, 76.9%] of infections met the case criteria and were thus detected by the study design. An assessment of interventions using inferred infections produced more intuitively consistent attack rates when households were stratified by the speed of intervention, compared with the crude hSAR. Compared with adults, children were 2.29 [1.66, 3.23] times as infectious and 3.36 [2.31, 4.82] times as susceptible. The mean generation time was 3.39 d [3.06, 3.70]. Laboratory confirmation of infections by RT-PCR was only able to detect 79.6% [76.5%, 83.0%] of symptomatic infections, even at the peak of shedding. Our results highlight the potential use of robust inference with well-designed mechanistic transmission models to improve the design of intervention studies.","Lau, Max S Y; Cowling, Benjamin J; Cook, Alex R; Riley, Steven",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,343,1

We hypothesized that these biomarkers would improve the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to predict nodal disease among patients with suspected or confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS A cross-sectional study (2010-2013) was performed of patients prospectively enrolled in a lung nodule biorepository, staged by computed tomography (CT) and PET, and who underwent pathologic nodal evaluation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure biomarker levels in plasma from blood drawn before anesthesia. Likelihood ratio testing was used to compare the following logistic regression prediction models: ModelPET, ModelPET/VEGF-C, ModelPET/VEGF-D, and ModelPET/VEGF-C/VEGF-D. To account for 5 planned pairwise comparisons, P values <.01 were considered significant. RESULTS Among 62 patients (median age, 67 years; 48% men; 87% white; and 84% NSCLC), 58% had fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in hilar and/or mediastinal lymph nodes. The prevalence of pathologically confirmed lymph node metastases was 40%. Comparisons of prediction models revealed the following: ModelPET/VEGF-C versus ModelPET (P = .0069), ModelPET/VEGF-D versus ModelPET (P = .1886), ModelPET/VEGF-C/VEGF-D versus ModelPET (P = .0146), ModelPET/VEGF-C/VEGF-D versus ModelPET/VEGF-C (P = .2818), and ModelPET/VEGF-C/VEGF-D versus ModelPET/VEGF-D (P = .0095). In ModelPET/VEGF-C, higher VEGF-C levels were associated with an increased risk of nodal disease (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-6.90). CONCLUSIONS Plasma levels of VEGF-C complemented the ability of PET to predict nodal disease among patients with suspected or confirmed NSCLC. VEGF-D did not improve prediction.","Farjah, Farhood; Madtes, David K; Wood, Douglas E; Flum, David R; Zadworny, Megan E; Waworuntu, Rachel; Hwang, Billanna; Mulligan, Michael S",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,343,1
147719,147719,147719,Tapentadol prolonged release for patients with multiple myeloma suffering from moderate-to-severe cancer pain due to bone disease.,18.36733,8.021581,2015,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively. MAIN RESULTS We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. Since there are 22 ongoing studies that plan to evaluate more than 15,000 participants in this setting, we will add more robust evidence to this review in future updates.","Flumignan, Ronald Lg; Tinôco, Jéssica Dantas de Sá; Pascoal, Patricia If; Areias, Libnah L; Cossi, Marcelly S; Fernandes, Maria Icd; Costa, Isabelle Kf; Souza, Larissa; Matar, Charbel F; Tendal, Britta; Trevisani, Virginia Fm; Atallah, Álvaro N; Nakano, Luis Cu",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,343,7

In non-surgical patients, covert stroke is more common than overt stroke and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Little is known about covert stroke after non-cardiac surgery.NeuroVISION is a multicentre, international, prospective cohort study that will characterise the association between perioperative acute covert stroke and postoperative cognitive function. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We are recruiting study participants from 12 tertiary care hospitals in 10 countries on 5 continents. PARTICIPANTS We are enrolling patients ≥65 years of age, requiring hospital admission after non-cardiac surgery, who have an anticipated length of hospital stay of at least 2 days after elective non-cardiac surgery that occurs under general or neuraxial anaesthesia. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Patients are recruited before elective non-cardiac surgery, and their cognitive function is measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) instrument. After surgery, a brain MRI study is performed between postoperative days 2 and 9 to determine the presence of acute brain infarction. One year after surgery, the MoCA is used to assess postoperative cognitive function. Physicians and patients are blinded to the MRI study results until after the last patient follow-up visit to reduce outcome ascertainment bias.We will undertake a multivariable logistic regression analysis in which the dependent variable is the change in cognitive function 1 year after surgery, and the independent variables are acute perioperative covert stroke as well as other clinical variables that are associated with cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS The NeuroVISION study will characterise the epidemiology of covert stroke and its clinical consequences. This will be the largest and the most comprehensive study of perioperative stroke after non-cardiac surgery.

A definition of what constitutes a robotic thoracic operation and a nomenclature to detail the technique used is needed to accurately compare outcomes. METHODS The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline Committee appointed an expert consensus writing committee to construct definitions and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. A PubMed search was generated and after vetting and review of the literature a consensus statement was reached. RESULTS The proposed definition is: ""A robotic thoracic operation is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not spread, lift or remove any part of the chest or abdominal wall and is characterized by: the surgeon and the assistant's vision of the operative field is via a monitor only and the patient's tissue is manipulated by robotic instruments that follow a slave like mimic of human hands or thoughts via a computerized system."" In addition, a flexible nomenclature is proposed that should be applicable to current and future robotic systems that details the number of robotic arms used, the types of ports and/or incisions made, the use of insufflation, and the operation performed. CONCLUSIONS The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons writing committee proposes a definition and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. Definitions are needed to ensure that future studies accurately compare results and outcomes and nomenclatures allow surgeons and scientists from diverse countries and cultures to use the same language to allow accurate communication.","Cerfolio, Robert; Louie, Brian E; Farivar, Alexander S; Onaitis, Mark; Park, Bernard J",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,343,1

Substantial variance exists in outcome, not fully accounted for by baseline characteristics or injury severity, and genetic factors likely play a role in this variance. The aims of this systematic review were to examine the evidence for a link between the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism and TBI outcomes and where possible, to quantify the effect size via meta-analysis. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and gray literature in December 2017. We included studies of APOE genotype in relation to functional adult TBI outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies Risk of Bias Assessment Instrument and the prognostic studies adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. In addition, we contacted investigators and included an additional 160 patients whose data had not been made available for previous analyses, giving a total sample size of 2593 patients. Meta-analysis demonstrated higher odds of a favorable outcome following TBI in those not possessing an ApoE ɛ4 allele compared with ɛ4 carriers and homozygotes (odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.84; p = 0.02). The influence of APOE4 on neuropsychological functioning following TBI remained uncertain, with multiple conflicting studies. We conclude that the ApoE ɛ4 allele confers a small risk of poor outcome following TBI, with analysis by TBI severity not possible based on the currently available published data. Further research into the long-term neuropsychological impact and risk of dementia is warranted.","McFadyen, Charles A; Zeiler, Frederick A; Newcombe, Virginia; Synnot, Anneliese; Steyerberg, Ewout; Gruen, Russel L; Rosand, Jonathan; Palotie, Aarno; Maas, Andrew I R; Menon, David K",Journal of neurotrauma,343,1

The SITA and SU users were matched on duration of follow-up and propensity score (PS). Logistic regression analysis incorporated age, gender, comorbidities, and concomitant medications as independent variables. RESULTS Approximately 99 % of SITA patients were PS matched, resulting in 14 807 well-balanced PS-matched SITA/SU pairs. Mean proportion of days covered (PDC) was significantly higher for SITA (vs SU) + MET after 1 year (P < 0.001). Adherence (PDC ≥80 %) to SITA (vs SU) + MET was 59.1 % (vs 55.9 %; P < 0.001) at 1 year and 52.6 % (vs 49.9 %; P = 0.007) at 2 years.

Its population (37.5 percent White, 39.1 percent Latino, 5.3 percent Black, and 14.4 percent Asian) experienced 59,258 COVID-19 deaths through April 14, 2021-the most of any state. We analyzed California's racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 exposure risks, testing rates, test positivity, and case rates through October 2020, combining data from 15.4 million SARS-CoV-2 tests with subcounty exposure risk estimates from the American Community Survey. We defined ""high-exposure-risk"" households as those with one or more essential workers and fewer rooms than inhabitants. Latino people in California are 8.1 times more likely to live in high-exposure-risk households than White people (23.6 percent versus 2.9 percent), are overrepresented in cumulative cases (3,784 versus 1,112 per 100,000 people), and are underrepresented in cumulative testing (35,635 versus 48,930 per 100,000 people). These risks and outcomes were worse for Latino people than for members of other racial/ethnic minority groups. Subcounty disparity analyses can inform targeting of interventions and resources, including community-based testing and vaccine access measures.

The main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a homodimer and a key component involved in viral replication, and is considered as a prime target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Literature survey revealed that the phytochemicals present in Strychnos nux-vomica possess several therapeutic activities. Initially, in the light of drug likeness laws, the ligand library of phytoconstituents was subjected to drug likeness analysis. The resulting compounds were taken to binding site-specific consensus-based molecular docking studies and the results were compared with the positive control drug, lopinavir, which is a main protease inhibitor. The top compounds were tested for ADME-Tox properties and antiviral activity. Further molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA-based binding affinity estimation were carried out for top two lead compounds' complexes along with the apo form of main protease and positive control drug lopinavir complex, and the results were comparatively analysed.

The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males < females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone/low prenatal estrogen). AIM To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. STUDY DESIGN COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). SUBJECTS 103,482 men and 83,366 women. OUTCOME MEASURES Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. RESULTS Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. CONCLUSIONS At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone/high prenatal estrogen) is associated with high CFRs and percent male mortality. At the individual level, high 2D:4D may be a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 in males. We speculate that male 2D:4D is a negative correlate for expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2).","Manning, John T; Fink, Bernhard",Early human development,343,16

Methods: Based on SEIR dynamic model, considering the COVID-19 transmission mechanism, infection spectrum and prevention and control procedures, we developed SEIR(+ CAQ) dynamic model to fit the frequencies of laboratory confirmed cases obtained from the government official websites. The data from January 20, 2020 to February 7, 2020 were used to fit the model, while the left data between February 8-12 were used to evaluate the quality of forecasting. Results: According to the cumulative number of confirmed cases between January 29 to February 7, the fitting bias of SEIR(+ CAQ) model for overall China (except for cases of Hubei province), Hubei province (except for cases of Wuhan city) and Wuhan city was less than 5%. For the data of subsequent 5 days between February 8 to 12, which were not included in the model fitting, the prediction biases were less than 10%. Regardless of the cases diagnosed by clinical examines, the numbers of daily emerging cases of China (Hubei province not included), Hubei Province (Wuhan city not included) and Wuhan city reached the peak in the early February. Under the current strength of prevention and control, the total number of laboratory- confirmed cases in overall China will reach 80 417 till February 29, 2020, respectively.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify studies published between December 1, 2019, and June 23, 2020, without language restrictions. There was no restriction on the study design; therefore, observational studies, clinical trials, and case series were included. In addition, preprints were considered if data of interest were reported. REVIEW METHODS Two authors independently screened articles for eligibility. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CIs. Quality assessment was done with critical appraisal tools of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Fifty-nine studies were included (N = 29,349 patients, 64.4% female). The pooled prevalence of taste disorders in patients with COVID-19 was 48.1% (95% CI, 41.3%-54.8%). The prevalence of taste disorders in studies with objective assessments was higher as compared with subjective assessments (59.2% vs 47.3%).

We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of lifetime pneumonia diagnosis (N=266,277), that encompassed the largest collection of cases published to date. Genome-wide significant associations with pneumonia were uncovered for the first time beyond the major histocompatibility complex region, with three novel loci, including a signal fine-mapped to a cluster of mucin genes. Moreover, we demonstrated evidence of a polygenic effect of common and low frequency pneumonia associated variation impacting several other mucin genes and O-glycosylation, further suggesting a role for these processes in pneumonia pathophysiology. The pneumonia GWAS was then leveraged to identify drug repurposing opportunities, including evidence that supports the use of lipid modifying agents in the prevention and treatment of the disorder. We also propose how polygenic risk could be utilised for precision drug repurposing through pneumonia risk scores constructed using variants mapped to pathways with known drug targets.

Twenty patients were treated acutely with corticosteroids;median age 68 years (range 40-88);13 male. Seven of these patients were diabetic;6 type 2 DM;1 type 1 DM. The most common conditions requiring admission included COPD, IPF, pneumonia, asthma, covid-19 and lung cancer. Of the twenty patients included, 13/20 (65%) had CBG monitoring. Within the monitored group, 6/13 (46%) showed readings consistent with hyperglycaemia (>12mmol/L) on more than one reading, of whom all were diabetic. Patients who exhibited hyperglycaemia had appropriate escalation of CBG checks in 3/6 (50%) cases. One patient of six (17%) with persistent CIH was treated appropriately with oral hypoglycaemics. The remaining five patients remained untreated. After education of respiratory medical staff, re-audit revealed persistently infrequent CBG checks (8/15 monitored - 53%). However, of those monitored, escalation of treatment was undertaken in 2/3 cases (67%) in cases of CIH. A high proportion of respiratory inpatients require treatment acutely with corticosteroids.

Our goal is to prioritize and predict activating and inhibiting functional associations of genes, and to discover hidden relationships between functions. As an application, we are particularly interested in the automatic construction of networks that capture relevant biology in a given disease context. We evaluated several unsupervised gene embedding models leveraging literature-curated signed causal gene expression findings. Using linear regression, it is shown that, based on these gene embeddings, gene-function relationships can be predicted with about 95% precision for the highest scoring genes. Function embedding vectors, derived from parameters of the linear regression model, allow to infer relationships between different functions or diseases. We show for several diseases that gene and function embeddings can be used to recover key drivers of pathogenesis, as well as underlying cellular and physiological processes. These results are presented as disease-centric networks of genes and functions. To illustrate the applicability of the computed gene and function embeddings to other machine learning tasks we expanded the embedding approach to drug molecules, and used a simple neural network to predict drug-disease associations.","Krämer, Andreas; Green, Jeff; Billaud, Jean-Noël; Pasare, Nicoleta Andreea; Jones, Martin; Tugendreich, Stuart",bioRxiv,343,1

Results: We included 3355 individuals, of which 1814 (54.1%) were women, 697 (20.8%) were aged <18 years and 449 (13.4%) were aged [≥]65 years, 2161 (64.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies, and 906 (27.0%) tested positive for anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 66.1% (95% credible interval, 64.1-68.0). Considering the presence of anti-N antibodies, we estimated that 29.9% (28.0-31.9) of the population developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies only via vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates were similar across sexes, but differed markedly across age groups, being lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8% [15.5-26.7]) and highest among older adults aged [≥]75 years (93.1% [89.6-96.0]). Seroprevalence of antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among participants with a higher educational level. Conclusions: Most adults have developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while most teenagers and children remain vulnerable to infection. As the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spreads and vaccination rates stagnate, efforts are needed to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among younger individuals and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and to minimize spread among children.","Stringhini, S.; Zaballa, M.-E.; Pullen, N.; Perez-Saez, J.; de Mestral, C.; Loizeau, A.; Lamour, J.; Pennacchio, F.; Wisniak, A.; Dumont, R.; Baysson, H.; Richard, V.; Lorthe, E.; Semaani, C.; Balavoine, J.-F.; Pittet, D.; Vuilleumier, N.; Chappuis, F.; Kherad, O.; Azman, A.

From apps helping us to join and coordinate clinical trials to contact tracing apps, various are the instances in which digital technology has -at least attempted tocome to rescue to the scientific, public policy and political realms during the challenging times we are currently living in. Particularly in relation to contact tracing apps, ethical concerns have been raised over the level of transparency that they can guarantee, often stressing how the State needs to ensure a number of variables to be granted to citizens: from privacy to fairness of access and distribution through their compulsory status or not. In Western liberal democracies, the assumption has been that all risks associated with this digital technology would have to be dealt with by the State - hence making its misuse “only” public, albeit authoritarian in their most dystopian versions.

Primary studies have examined this population, but most had small sample sizes and conflicting results. Prior meta-analyses exclude most US and European data or only examine mortality. The present meta-analysis evaluates the prevalence of several clinical outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19, including new emerging data from Europe and the US. Methods: A systematic search of PubMED, medRxiv, JMIR and Embase by two independent investigators included peer-reviewed papers and preprints up to July 8, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality. Other outcomes were ICU and non-ICU admission, mild, moderate and severe complications, ARDS, invasive ventilation, stable, and clinically improved rates. Study quality was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random effects model was used to derive prevalence rates, their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: Thirty-four studies (N = 4,371) were included in the analysis. The mortality prevalence rate was 25.2% (95% CI: 21.1-29.7;95% PI: 9.8-51.1;I2= 85.4), with 11.9% ICU admissions (95% CI: 9.2-15.4;95% PI: 4.3- 28.9;I2= 77.8) and 25.2% clinically stable (95% CI: 21.1-29.7;95% PI: 9.8-51.1;I2= 85.4). Furthermore, 42.5% developed severe complications (95% CI: 30.4-55.7;95% PI: 8.2- 85.9;I2= 94.3), with 22.7% developing ARDS (95% CI: 15.4-32.2;95% PI: 5.8-58.6;I2= 82.4), and 11.3% needing invasive ventilation (95% CI: 6.7-18.4;95% PI: 2.3-41.1;I2= 79.8). Post-follow up, 49% clinically improved (95% CI: 35.6-62.6;95% PI: 9.8-89.4;I2= 92.5). All outcomes had large I2 , suggesting high levels of heterogeneity among studies, and wide PIs indicating high variability within outcomes. Despite this variability, the mortality rate in cancer patients with COVID-19, even at the lower end of the PI (9.8%), is higher than the 2% mortality rate of the non-cancer with COVID-19 population, but not as high as what other meta-analyses conclude, which is around 25%. Conclusions: Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 have a higher probability of mortality compared to the general population with COVID-19, but possibly not as high as previous studies have shown. A large proportion of them developed severe complications, but a larger proportion recovered. Prevalence of mortality and other outcomes published in prior meta-analyses did not report prediction intervals, which compromises the clinical utilization of such results.","Alasfour, M.; Alawadi, S.; AlMojel, M.; Costa, P.

However, studies centered on viral infection cases are scarce. It remains unclear with respect to the disparity structure, its geospatial characteristics, and the pre-infection determinants of risk (PIDRs) for people with the infection. This work aimed to assess the geospatial associations between PIDRs and COVID-19 infection at the county level in South Carolina by different timepoints during the pandemic. Method: We used global models including spatial error model (SEM), spatial lag model (SLM), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR), as well as geographically weighted regression model (GWR) as a local model to examine the associations between COVID-19 infection rate and PIDRs. The data were retrieved from multiple sources including USAFacts, US Census Bureau, and Population Estimates Program. Results: The percentage of males and the percentage of the unemployed population were statistically significant (p values < 0.05) with positive coefficients in the three global models (SEM, SLM, CAR) throughout the time. The percentage of white population and obesity rate showed divergent spatial correlations at different times of the pandemic. GWR models consistently have a better model fit than global models, suggesting non-stationary correlations between a region and its neighbors. Conclusion: Characterized by temporal-geospatial patterns, disparities and their PIDRs exist in COVID-19 incidence at the county level in South Carolina. The temporal-geospatial structure of disparities and their PIDRs found in COVID-19 incidence are different from mortality and morbidity for patients who are connected with clinical care. Our findings provided important evidence for prioritizing different populations and developing tailored interventions at different times of the pandemic. These findings provided implications on containing early viral transmission and mitigating consequences of infectious disease outbreaks for possible future pandemics.","Lyu, T.; Hair, N.; Yell, N.; Li, Z.; Qiao, S.; Liang, C.; Li, X.",,343,16

For this purpose, we utilized the multi-instrumental approach of satellite remote sensing and reanalysis model data to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of major air pollutants during December 2019–June 2020 in South Asia. The lockdown has to lead to a considerable decrease in aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over South China (−18.92%) and Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP;−24.29%) compared to its ordinary level for a couple of weeks. Noticeable reductions in tropospheric NO2 are observed over the Pearl River Delta (PRD;−0.3/cm2) followed by Central China (CC) with −0.21/cm2and IGP (−0.085/cm2), and the lowest (−0.0008/cm2) in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. The changes observed in PM2.5 and SO2 levels (from −58.56% to - 63.64%) are attributed to the decrease in anthropogenic emissions, vehicular exhaust, and industrial activities. However, the BC concentrations are reduced by approximately halved of its ordinary levels in the IGP (−2.28 μg/m3) followed by YRD (−1.56 μg/m3), CC (−1.5 μg/m3), NCP (−1.29 μg/m3), and PRD (−0.78 μg/m3) regions.

Since, its emergence in Wuhan, China by December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of human population along with many casualties globally. The transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 between humans has already been studied. Despite this transmission in human population, the primary origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with bats by the help of an intermediate (secondary) host. This study was assumed to investigate the possible secondary or intermediate host to shuttle down the SARS-CoV-2 transmission and further to mitigate future pandemics. The antigenic surface/spike (S) protein was used for the structural and genomic analysis through currently available computer assisted technology. For the In-silico analysis, 43 sequences of S-protein of coronaviruses originated in various species were retrieved from nucleotide database of NCBI. These sequences were matched to find any similarities/differences by employing pairwise and multiple sequence alignment. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted to observe the relation among different species through MEGA software. Finally, comparative analysis for structures of S-protein (superimposition) was done with reference structure by using UCSF Chimera software. The results of this study expressed maximum match of S-protein sequences of human coronavirus with Bat and with Pangolin sequences respectively. The Phylogenetic analysis between Bat and Pangolin showed that SARS-CoV-2 transmitted from bats to humans possibly through the intermediate host of Pangolin.","Raza, S.; Navid, M.

We located our investigation in current debates about the extent to which disciplinary knowledge can be linked to learners’ out-of-school experiences. We developed and analysed two tasks about COVID-19 that could support link-making and productive disciplinary engagement, and analysed one Grade 10 teacher teaching these tasks. We found that linking mathematics to learners’ lifeworlds is both possible and extremely difficult in relation to task design and how the teacher mediates the tasks. In relation to task design, we argue that teachers cannot do it alone;they need to be supported by the curriculum and textbooks. In relation to mediation, we saw that teacher practices are difficult to shift, even in the best of circumstances.

This change was mainly a consequence of the strong measures of isolation and social distancing taken by the different governments in most countries through the world. The specific measures adopted in each country, in combination with the particular characteristics of the spread of the virus, generated differentiated, although similar, behavioural changes. This article presents the analysis of a survey carried out in Spain in March 2020, where citizens were asked about their mobility preferences before, during and after the lockdown due to the virus. In turn, questions were asked about the preferred modes of transport in each of the situations and the perception of safety on public transport in their current conditions. The mobility questions were differentiated between commuting to work or studies, shopping and leisure. The results show that public transport was the most affected transport mode, with a considerable increase in the use of the bicycle and walking trips. At the same time, changes were observed in the behaviour of shopping trips, including a considerable decrease on the use of large supermarkets. Citizens perceived great uncertainty in planning leisure trips, the consequence of which could be that a higher proportion of people not being able to carry out their planned trips.","Echaniz, Eneko Rodríguez Andrés Cordera Rubén Benavente Juan Alonso Borja Sañudo Roberto",Transport Policy,343,1

Given that anxiety and depression screening are now part of routine care, the major aim was to identify the most important, future research priorities in mental health. Method: A 22-item online survey was sent out July 2020 to people with CF (pwCF), caregivers, and US providers in the CF community, who were given 3 weeks to respond. Questions focused on: ranking topics by importance and impact, identifying gaps in our understanding of mental health issues, and priorities and needs during COVID-19. Results: Response time was 7–11 minutes, with 693 community respondents (half pwCF, majority ages 26–45 years) and 352 CF clinicians (mainly social workers, center directors). Substantial agreement was found between community respondents and providers on the top 5 priorities:1) anxiety, 2) depression, 3) effects of psychological symptoms on physical health, 4) risk factors for anxiety/depression, and 5) effects on family functioning and parenting. Although ranked highly, differences emerged for substance misuse and disordered eating, with higher rankings endorsed by providers than community respondents. Priorities for improving outcomes were also similar: 1) greater access to mental health providers and 2) improving mental health interventions. Conclusion: A large-scale survey of CF community members and providers revealed clear consensus on the top research priorities. In addition to increased understanding of anxiety and depression (e.g., risk factors, long-term effects), new topics emerged, including substance misuse, disordered eating, and interactions between medications and mental health (e.g., modulators).

A layman may have difficulty communicating with a professional due to not understanding the specialized terms common to the domain. In healthcare, it is rare to find a layman knowledgeable in medical terminology which can lead to poor understanding of their condition and/or treatment. To bridge this gap, several professional vocabularies and ontologies have been created to map laymen medical terms to professional medical terms and vice versa. Objective: Many of the presented vocabularies are built manually or semi-automatically requiring large investments of time and human effort and consequently the slow growth of these vocabularies. In this paper, we present an automatic method to enrich laymen's vocabularies that has the benefit of being able to be applied to vocabularies in any domain. Methods: Our entirely automatic approach uses machine learning, specifically Global Vectors for Word Embeddings (GloVe), on a corpus collected from a social media healthcare platform to extend and enhance consumer health vocabularies (CHV). Our approach further improves the CHV by incorporating synonyms and hyponyms from the WordNet ontology. The basic GloVe and our novel algorithms incorporating WordNet were evaluated using two laymen datasets from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV) and MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary. Results: The results show that GloVe was able to find new laymen terms with an F-score of 48.44%.

While several medications are beneficial, achieving optimal Guideline-directed medical therapy is challenging. COVID-19 offered an opportunity to explore new ways of delivering care. Method: Fifty consecutive patients were identified following hospital discharge and taught to identify fluid congestion and monitor their vital signs using BP monitors & electronic scales, with nurse practitioner (NP)-led telephone support. Up-titration was facilitated by e-prescriptions and e-labforms. Quantitative data was collected, and a patient experience telephone interview was performed. Medication changes were notified to primary care in real time using an electronic template. Results: The majority (76%) of the cohort (mean age, 59 yrs;male, 76%;Māori or Pacific, 58%) had a new diagnosis of HFrEF, with 90% having an ejection fraction &lt;30%.

We report population-based, age- and-sex-specific background incidence rates of conditions representing potential vaccine adverse events of special interest (AESI) for the Swedish general population using register data. Methods We studied an age/sex-stratified random 10% sample of the Swedish population on 1 Jan 2020, followed for AESI outcomes during 1 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and developed, before the start of vaccinations. We selected and defined the following outcomes based on information from regulatory authorities, large-scale adverse events initiatives and previous studies: aseptic meningitis, febrile seizure, Kawasaki syndrome, MISC, post-infectious arthritis, arthritis, myocarditis, ARDS, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, kidney failure, liver failure, erythema multiforme, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and appendicitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex and time period (quarters of 2020), and classified them using Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. Results We included 972,723 study subjects, representing the Swedish national population on 1 Jan 2020. We found that AESI incidence rates vary greatly by age and in some cases sex. Several common AESIs showed expected increase with age, while some (e.g. appendicitis, aseptic meningitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Kawasaki syndrome and MISC) were more common in young people, and others exhibited a flatter age pattern (e.g. myocarditis, DIC and erythema multiforme). Consequently, the CIOMS classification for AESIs varied widely according to age. Considerable variability was suggested for some AESI rates across the 4 quarters of 2020, potentially related to pandemic waves, seasonal variation, healthcare system overload or other healthcare delivery effects.

Passenger shipping is an important part of local tourism, but ship owners are insufficiently involved in planning processes and their views on creating shipping development are underrepresented. The article aims to compare the vision of the development of passenger shipping in the Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon between local governments creating the spatial policy and ship owners offering transport services. We have made an attempt to verify the development prospects. The collation of these visions was based primarily on the qualitative analysis of the content of planning and strategic documents (desk research method) and a survey conducted among all six ship owners. Thanks to the comparative analysis, it was possible to show similarities and differences and to indicate recommendations. The paper presents review of the available literature on the subject, thanks to which the research area was identified as unique in Europe. On the one hand, it is a valuable natural area, which is an important tourist destination, on the other hand, there are organizational and infrastructural limitations in meeting the needs of tourists. Then, field research was conducted, unpublished materials were collected, and surveys were conducted with the operators of passenger ships operating in the Vistula Lagoon. The performed analyses allowed for the formulation of conclusions and recommendations. Similarities in the directions of promoting tourism in the region, improving the quality of infrastructure, eliminating obstacles in international traffic and discrepancies in the co-financing of ship owners' activities by local governments, shaping the future transport offer or the construction of the Vistula Spit canal are identified. Economic calculation, particularly vital for the private sector (ship owners), is an important criterion for verifying the assumed goals.","Puzdrakiewicz, K.; Polom, M.",Sustainability,343,1

High dose rehabilitation can result in clinically significant improvements in function even years after the incident, however there is still high variability in patient responsiveness to such interventions that cannot be explained by age, sex or time since stroke. This retrospective study investigated whether prescription of certain CNS-acting drug classes- GABA agonists, antiepileptics and antidepressants- influenced outcomes on the 3 week intensive Queen Square Upper-Limb (QSUL) programme. For 277 stroke or brain injury patients upper-limb impairment and activity was assessed at admission to the programme and at 6 months post-discharge, using the upper limb component of the Fugl-Meyer (FM), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI). Drug prescriptions were obtained from primary care physicians at referral. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to protect against selective reporting results and add robustness to the conclusions of this retrospective study. GABA agonist prescription had a significant negative effect on upper-limb scores at admission but did not impact programme-induced improvements. There were no effects of antiepileptic drug prescriptions on either admission scores, or improvement during the programme. Antidepressant prescriptions did not impact admission scores but resulted in reduced improvement in upper-limb function, even when accounting for anxiety and depression scores. These results demonstrate that, when prescribed appropriately, GABA agonists do not impair patient's ability to benefit from rehabilitation programmes. Patients prescribed antidepressants, however, performed poorer than expected on the QSUL rehabilitation programme. While the reasons for this effect are unclear, identifying these patients prior to admission may allow for better accommodation of differences in their rehabilitation needs.","Johnstone, A.; Brander, F.; Kelly, K.; Bestmann, S.; Ward, N.

The shift to remote learning practices was particularly difficult for courses, such as pedology, that rely heavily on place-based or active learning strategies. In this study, the authors investigate student response to remote delivery of field experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in an upper division pedology course that is typically taught in-person and outdoors. Five field practicums were delivered remotely throughout the semester, for which students were provided with a take-home field kit, soils from four profiles, and access to online resources needed to complete each assignment. Student perceptions on the efficacy of, value of, and engagement with remote delivery were assessed via pre- and post-surveys. Survey responses suggest that students' level of experience improved over the course of the semester and perceptions on the efficacy of, value of, and engagement with remote learning showed positive improvement. Although the majority of students were grateful for these alternative experiences, responses also expressed that remote delivery options are not favored over in-person field experiences. Remote delivery of field experiences also presents a potential solution to the limits in accessibility inherent to field-based courses.","Aleman, Ruben Duball Chelsea Schwyter Anna Vaughan Karen",Natural Sciences Education,343,16

To date, methods to predict the clinical course, which ranges from the asymptomatic carrier to the critically ill patient in devastating multi-system organ failure, have yet to be identified. In this study, we performed large-scale integrative multi-omics analyses of serum obtained from COVID-19 patients with the goal of uncovering novel pathogenic complexities of this disease and identifying molecular signatures that predict clinical outcomes. We assembled a novel network of protein-metabolite interactions in COVID-19 patients through targeted metabolomic and proteomic profiling of serum samples in 330 COVID-19 patients compared to 97 non-COVID, hospitalized controls. Our network identified distinct protein-metabolite cross talk related to immune modulation, energy and nucleotide metabolism, vascular homeostasis, and collagen catabolism. Additionally, our data linked multiple proteins and metabolites to clinical indices associated with long-term mortality and morbidity, such as acute kidney injury. Finally, we developed a novel composite outcome measure for COVID-19 disease severity and created a clinical prediction model using a set of 33 metabolites. The model significantly improved the identification of key events of critical illness such as prolonged hospitalization, supplemental oxygen requirement, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), beyond those achieved using the more traditional risk factors of age, gender, and BMI.","Alvarez-Mulett, S.; Buyukozkan, M.; Racanelli, A.

It was reported that majority of the infections were caused by the delta variant and only 9.8% percent cases required hospitalization whereas, only 0.4% fatality was observed. Sudden dropdown in COVID-19 infections was observed within a short timeframe, suggesting better host adaptation with evolved delta variant. Down regulation of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 by ORF8 induced MHC-I degradation has been reported earlier. The Delta variant carried mutations (deletion) at Asp119 and Phe120 amino acids which are critical for ORF8 dimerization. The deletions of amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 in ORF8 of delta variant results in structural instability of ORF8 dimer caused by disruption of hydrogen bonding and salt bridges as revealed by structural analysis and MD simulation studies of ORF8 dimer. Further, flexible docking of wild type and mutant ORF8 dimer revealed reduced interaction of mutant ORF8 dimer with MHC-I as compared to wild type ORF8 dimer with MHC-1, thus implicating its possible role in MHC-I expression and host immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We thus propose that mutant ORF8 may not hindering the MHC-I expression thereby resulting in better immune response against SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which partly explains the sudden drop of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 predominated by delta variant in India Graphical Abstract","Chaudhari, Armi M; Singh, Indra; Joshi, Madhvi; Patel, Amrutlal; Joshi, Chaitanya",bioRxiv,343,21

Prevented planting is primarily caused by excess moisture or rainfall such as the catastrophic flooding and widespread conditions that prevented active field work in the midwestern region of United States in 2019. While the Farm Service Agency reports the number of such ""prevent plant"" acres each year at the county scale, field-scale maps of prevent plant fields—which would enable analyses related to assessing and mitigating the impact of climate on agriculture—are not currently available. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a method for mapping likely prevent plant fields based on flood mapping and historical cropland maps. We focused on a study region in eastern South Dakota and created flood maps using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 images from 2018 and 2019. We used automatic threshold-based change detection using NDVI and NDWI to accentuate changes likely caused by flooding. The NDVI change detection map showed vegetation loss in the eastern parts of the study area while NDWI values showed increased water content, both indicating possible flooding events. The VH polarization of Sentinel 1 was also particularly useful in identifying potential flooded areas as the VH values for 2019 were substantially lower than those of 2018, especially in the northern part of the study area, likely indicating standing water or reduced biomass. We combined the flood maps from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 to form a complete flood likelihood map over the entire study area. We intersected this flood map with a map of fallow pixels extracted from the Cropland Data Layer to produce a map of predicted prevent plant acres across several counties in South Dakota. The predicted figures were within 10% error of Farm Service Agency reports, with low errors in the most affected counties in the state such as Beadle, Hanson, and Hand.

MPS is often dismissed by clinicians while patients remain in pain for years. MPS can evolve into fibromyalgia, however, effective treatments for both are lacking due to absence of a clear mechanism. Many studies focus on central sensitization. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to systematically search cross-disciplinary empirical studies of MPS, focusing on mechanical aspects, and suggest an organic mechanism explaining how it might evolve into fibromyalgia. Hopefully, it will advance our understanding of this disease. Methods: Systematically searched multiple phrases in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, PEDro and medrXiv, majority with no time limit. Inclusion/exclusion based on title and abstract, then full text inspection. Additional literature added on relevant side topics. Review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PROSPERO yet to adapt registration for scoping reviews. Findings: 734 records included. Fascia can adapt to various states by reversibly changing biomechanical and physical properties. Trigger points, tension, and pain are a hallmark of MPS. Myofibroblasts play a role in sustained myofascial tension. Tension can propagate in fascia, possibly supporting a tensegrity framework. Movement and mechanical interventions treat and prevent MPS, while living sedentarily predisposes to MPS and recurrence. Interpretation: MPS can be seen as a pathological state of imbalance in a natural process; manifesting from the inherent properties of the fascia, triggered by a disrupted biomechanical interplay. MPS might evolve into fibromyalgia through deranged myofibroblasts in connective tissue, or ""fascial armoring"", which may explain pain, distribution of pain, decreased pressure/pain threshold, and other phenomena eg, occasional complete resolution after surgery. Movement is an underemployed requisite in modern lifestyle. Lifestyle is linked to pain and suffering. The mechanism of needling is suggested to be more mechanical than currently thought. MPS should no longer be overlooked but solidified in the domain of common modern medicine.","plaut, s.",,343,19

It was staffed by advanced practitioners, doctors and other senior paramedics with range of diverse skills from critical to urgent care. We aimed to understand the patterns of use of a SCSC for emergency 999 calls during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsRoutinely collected call data was retrospectively analysed to understand the patterns of use in the first three months of the service. The reason for the call, patient demographic and any regional differences were described. An anonymous survey was distributed to frontline ambulance crews to understand the reasons for contacting the SCSC, or not, and the outcomes of that contact for patient care.Results7296 patient care episodes received either a telephone triage by SCSC for 999 calls or 111 calls transferred for an emergency ambulance response (3160) or had telephone support provided to crews on scene (4136). Telephone triage accounted for 3160 calls where 642 cases (20.3%) resulted in a hear-and-treat outcome, and the findings suggest a low re-contact rate within 24 hours at 2.4%.The primary reasons for crews seeking support/advice from the SCSC were discharge advice or permission (37%);support for pathways in their area (25%);or for cases where patients refused care or conveyance (11%).ConclusionsSCSC was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lessons can be learned to prepare for any future significant service challenges as a result of the rapid implementation of the SCSC and the clinical leadership required to support the pace of change and emerging clinical knowledge and practice.","Bell, Fiona Hodge Andrew Pilbery Richard Whiterod Sarah",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,343,28

We demonstrated that neither the disruption of a leucine zipper-like motif by multiple alanine substitutions nor the flanking charges of TM2 affected the topological reorientation of L. The dispensability of both putative subunit interaction modules argues against a link between preS post-translocation and envelope assembly.

The thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. In fact, many people died equally despite being intubated and treated for respiratory failure. In this review, we especially wanted to describe the virus effects on the cardiovascular system, probably the leading cause of death of thousands of deceased patients. Therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe COVID-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin I and inflammatory cytokines. The main activation of the signal pathways for the production of inflammatory cytokines are the toll-like receptors that recognize the presence of viral nucleic acids and the ACE-2 receptors, that the virus uses to infect the cells. The binding to ACE-2 also allows to promote high levels of angiotensin II by promoting high levels of blood pressure. High levels of IL-6, IL-1B and IL-8 have been associated with plaque instability and increased thrombotic risk. Furthermore IL-6 is involved in the stimulation of matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, and may contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome. In addition, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with coagulation activation and thrombin generation resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic microangiopathy. Considering these pathological effects of the virus, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant treatments are to be considered to avoid cardiovascular events. In this regard, heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant characteristics, has been shown to have good control over inflammation and to be a good anti-viral drug.","Lubrano, Valter; Balzan, Silvana",American journal of cardiovascular disease,343,17

Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions.

EAV particles contain seven structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein N, the unglycosylated envelope proteins M and E, and the N-glycosylated membrane proteins GP(2b) (previously named G(S)), GP(3), GP(4), and GP(5) (previously named G(L)). Proteins N, M, and GP(5) are major virion components, E occurs in virus particles in intermediate amounts, and GP(4), GP(3), and GP(2b) are minor structural proteins. The M and GP(5) proteins occur in virus particles as disulfide-linked heterodimers while the GP(4), GP(3), and GP(2b) proteins are incorporated into virions as a heterotrimeric complex. Here, we studied the effect on virus assembly of inactivating the structural protein genes one by one in the context of a (full-length) EAV cDNA clone. It appeared that the three major structural proteins are essential for particle formation, while the other four virion proteins are dispensable. When one of the GP(2b), GP(3), or GP(4) proteins was missing, the incorporation of the remaining two minor envelope glycoproteins was completely blocked while that of the E protein was greatly reduced. The absence of E entirely prevented the incorporation of the GP(2b), GP(3), and GP(4) proteins into viral particles. EAV particles lacking GP(2b), GP(3), GP(4), and E did not markedly differ from wild-type virions in buoyant density, major structural protein composition, electron microscopic appearance, and genomic RNA content. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the EAV particle in which the GP(2b)/GP(3)/GP(4) heterotrimers are positioned, in association with a defined number of E molecules, above the vertices of the putatively icosahedral nucleocapsid.","Wieringa, Roeland; de Vries, Antoine A F; van der Meulen, Jannes; Godeke, Gert-Jan; Onderwater, Jos J M; van Tol, Hans; Koerten, Henk K; Mommaas, A Mieke; Snijder, Eric J; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,343,12

The ferret was treated medically with oral prednisolone, improved dramatically, and was still doing well 22 mo after diagnosis. Although FSCD has been reported extensively, this case is noteworthy for the presence of suppurative pancreatitis and the positive long-term outcome after corticosteroid therapy.","Wills, Sarah E; Beaufrère, Hugues H; Brisson, Brigitte A; Fraser, Russell S; Smith, Dale A",Comparative medicine,343,1

A report regarding the translation procedure into French and its preliminary results has been previously published. We here describe the finalization of the translation process and cultural validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The translation process followed guidelines established by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research (ISPOR) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The process included two forward translations, one backward translation, a review by a panel of expert and cognitive debriefing interviews with patients. RESULTS The 26 scales of the BODY-Q were translated and adapted into French. Each step of the process allowed to make changes leading to a conceptually and culturally equivalent French version. Backward translation comparison to the English version led to the identification of 16 differences necessitating re-translation. Overall feedback from patients over the final version was excellent. CONCLUSIONS The BODY-Q proved to be a reliable and suited PRO for bariatric and body contouring patients. The thorough method of translation and cultural adaptation allowed us to achieve a conceptually and culturally valid French translation of the BODY-Q.","Schettini, Adriano-Valerio; Rillon, Perle; Pirson, Geneviene; De Coninck, Christine",Psychiatria Danubina,343,11

However, it remains unknown whether the infectivity and the virulence of the pathogen will change throughout the successive transmission. This study was conducted to compare the clinical features and management regimens of patients with SARS among the multiple generations from nosocomial transmission initiated by a super-spreader. METHODS The clinical data of 84 epidemiologically-linked SARS patients from a hospital outbreak were retrospectively studied. All patients, in whom a clear-cut transmission generation could be noted, had a direct or indirect exposure to the index patient and the epidemic successively propagated through the multiple generations of cases within a short period of time. RESULTS There were 66 women and 18 men with mean age of (29.2 +/- 10.3) years in this cluster; and 96.4% of whom were health care workers. Detailed contact tracing identified 35 (41.7%) first-generation cases, 34 (40.5%) second-generation cases, and 15 (17.8%) third-generation cases. No statistical differences among the multiple generations of transmission were found in terms of age, gender, incubation period and length of hospital stay. With the advanced transmission generations, the initial temperature lowered, the number of cases with dry cough decreased. There were no statistical differences in the peak temperature and duration of fever, other accompanying symptoms, leucopenia; however, the time from initial pulmonary infiltrates to radiographic recovery shortened (P < 0.05). No differences were found in maximum number of lung fields involved, duration from the onset of fever to the occurrence of pulmonary infiltrates and time from the initial pulmonary infiltrate to its peak among the multiple transmission generations (P > 0.05). No statistical differences were found in modes of oxygen therapy and sorts of antibiotics prescribed among the various transmission generations (P > 0.05); however, as with the advanced transmission generations, the number of cases prescribed with methylprednisolone, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, antiviral drugs (oral ribavirin or oseltamivir) increased (P < 0.05) and time from admission to starting these medication shortened (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS There is no evidence that SARS infection will evolve or transmit within a fashion that permits it to become less powerful throughout the successive transmission within a short time.","Wu, Wei; Wang, Jing-feng; Liu, Pin-ming; Jiang, Shan-ping; Chen, Qing-yu; Chen, Wei-xian; Yin, Song-mei; Yan, Li; Zhan, Jun; Chen, Xi-long; Li, Jian-guo",Chinese medical journal,343,0

We propose a technique to compare metabolic rates in a region of interest (ROI) based on fixed volumes rather than on fixed thresholds. This method involves change in lesion size. METHODS: In 49 patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and 50 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) scheduled for chemotherapy, FDG-PET was performed at baseline and during chemotherapy. A ROIfixed thresholds was determined by using a 50% threshold on both baseline and follow-up FDG-PET. A ROIfixed volumes was determined by using a 50% threshold, determined on the series with the largest tumor volume. This ROIfixed volumes is used on consecutive scans. Predictive effects of both methods were investigated by survival analysis for overall and progression free survival. RESULTS: In CRC, only ROIfixed volumes based DMRglu showed significant predictive ability. In NSCLC, both techniques showed significant predictive ability. During multivariate analysis, ROIfixed volumes determined DMRglu was an independent predictor for both overall and progression free survival in NSCLC whereas ROIfixed thresholds determined MRglu was not. After dichotomization at the median DMRglu, median survival ratio was higher in ROIfixed volumes than ROIfixed thresholds for CRC (overall survival: 1.78 vs 1.25, progression free survival: 1.57 vs 1.21) and NSCLC (overall survival: 2.01 vs 2.01, progression free survival: 2.93 vs 2.13). CONCLUSION: ROIfixed volumes based DMRglu shows better correlation with survival than DMRglu determined from a ROIfixed thresholds.","Vriens, D; De Geus-Oei, L F; Van Laarhoven, H W M; Van Der Heijden, H F M; Krabbe, P F M; Visser, E P; Oyen, W J G","The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...",343,1

A key enzyme for the maturation of this virus and, therefore, a target for drug development is the main protease 3CL(pro) (also termed SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)). We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the full-length SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) as well as a truncated form containing only the catalytic domains. The recombinant proteins have been characterized enzymatically using a fluorescently labeled substrate; their structural stability in solution has been determined by differential scanning calorimetry, and novel inhibitors have been discovered. Expression of the catalytic region alone yields a protein with a reduced catalytic efficiency consistent with the proposed regulatory role of the alpha-helical domain. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that the alpha-helical domain does not contribute to the structural stability of the catalytic domains. Analysis of the active site cavity reveals the presence of subsites that can be targeted with specific chemical functionalities. In particular, a cluster of serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) was identified near the active site cavity and was susceptible to being targeted by compounds containing boronic acid. This cluster is highly conserved in similar proteases from other coronaviruses, defining an attractive target for drug development. It was found that bifunctional aryl boronic acid compounds were particularly effective at inhibiting the protease, with inhibition constants as strong as 40 nM. Isothermal titration microcalorimetric experiments indicate that these inhibitors bind reversibly to 3CL(pro) in an enthalpically favorable fashion, implying that they establish strong interactions with the protease molecule, thus defining attractive molecular scaffolds for further optimization.","Bacha, Usman; Barrila, Jennifer; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian; Leavitt, Stephanie A; Freire, Ernesto",Biochemistry,343,1

Tocotrienols reportedly possess hypocholesterolaemic activity. This study examined the effect of tocotrienols (T3) in TOCOVIDTM Suprabio TM on serum lipids. Patients and Methods :A randomised (2:1), open-label study of patients with mild hypercholesterolaemia (= 5.18mmol/L to <7.77mmol/L) and one additional cardiovascular risk factor was carried out. Subjects received either tocotrienols (as TOCOVIDTM Suprabio TM ) (n=28) or vitamin E (a-tocopherol) 500mg daily (n=16). Fasting lipids were compared at baseline and after 4 weeks therapy. RESULTS Following 4 weeks therapy, mean +/- SD total cholesterol declined significantly in the tocotrienol group (from 6.10+/-0.66 to 5.47+/-1.16; P=0.02) compared to the a-tocopherol group (from 5.92+/-0.52 to 5.47+/-0.76; P>0.05). Mean LDL-C levels (mmol/L) were also significantly reduced in the tocotrienol group (3.82+/-0.85 to 3.24+/-1.26; P=0.04), but not in those on a-tocopherol (3.84+/-0.75 to 3.28+/-0.94; P>0.05). There were no significant changes in HDL-C and triglycerides in both groups. The tocotrienol group experienced a net decline in TG (7.1+/-31.4 %; P>0.05) while the a-tocopherol group had a net increase at week 4 (38.6+/-61.7%; P>0.05). CONCLUSION The study adds to existing evidence of the favourable effect of tocotrienols on total cholesterol and LDL-C. However, the results need further evaluation.","Ajuluchukwu, J N A; Okubadejo, N U; Mabayoje, M; Ojini, F I; Okwudiafor, R N; Mbakwem, A C; Fasanmade, O A; Oke, D A",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,343,26

The probes were reacted with homologous and heterologous serotypes of group A rotaviruses of human and animal origin. Hybridizations were conducted under relatively low-stringency (52 degrees C, no formamide, 5 x SSC) and high-stringency (52 degrees C, 50% formamide, formamide, 5 x SSC) conditions (1 x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate). Under conditions of relatively low stringency, the Gottfried and OSU gene 9 probes demonstrated broad cross-reactivity and were useful in the detection of homologous and heterologous serotypes of group A rotaviruses. Under conditions of relatively high stringency, the Gottfried and OSU gene 9 probes were serotype specific. The Gottfried gene 9 probe (serotype 4) hybridized with homologous Gottfried porcine rotavirus as well as the serotype 4 human rotaviruses ST3 and VA70.

Variants were isolated from the supernatants of monoclonal antibody hybridoma cell cultures which continued to secrete neutralizing antibodies after being infected with JHM. Comparative antigenic analysis and biological tests were performed in order to refine an operational epitope map and to characterize functional domains important for pathogenicity. The reaction patterns (neutralization, inhibition of cell fusion, immunofluorescence and binding in ELISA) between the variant viruses and the panel of monoclonal antibodies were very similar. Four groups of variants were characterized each of which revealed distinct changes affecting one defined antigenic site. These observations indicated that at least four independently mutable antigenic sites were associated with domains involved in cell fusion, neutralization and pathogenicity (E2-Aa, -Ab, -Ba and -Bb). JHM variants with alterations in the E2-Aa, -Ab or -Bb sites were similar to wild-type virus. These variants caused acute hepatitis and encephalomyelitis in mice.

The disease may progress in some of the patients leading to trigger of ""cytokine storm"" which is shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. Heat killed Mycobacterium w (Mw) is a known immunomodulator which is approved for the treatment of gram negative sepsis. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of Mw in the treatment of COVID-19 early in the course of the disease. Method In this retrospective observational study, 117 (84 males, 33 females) COVID-19 patients admitted between July 3, 2020 and Aug 26, 2020 in the covid ward of Fortis Hiranandani hospital, Mumbai, were enrolled. Patients were tested COVID-19 positive on RTPCR and were treated with standard of care treatment along with Mw 0.3 ml intradermal injection per day for 3 consecutive days. Patients were evaluated for live discharge as well as changes in the levels of inflammatory markers. Results Use of Mw was seen to be associated with rapid recovery in 116/117 patients from COVID-19 who were discharged from the hospital within 10 days. A decrease in the levels of CRP and IL6 was observed after the administration of Mw. This decrease was associated with improvement in the patients' condition. The use of Mw was seen to be associated with no systemic side effects. Conclusion The patients of COVID-19 may deteriorate due to exaggerated production of cytokines which may result in adverse outcomes. Mw used earlier in the disease not only effectively prevents excessive cytokine production but also contribute to rapid recovery. Mw was also found to be safe in use. Larger randomized controlled trials are recommended to assess the role of Mw in COVID-19.","Ingale, Atul; Ingale, Farah; Kunwar, Brajesh; Ahmed, Shakeel; Salvi, Kumar; Chavan, Vishwas; Sontakke, Manish; Chandrashekhar, T",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,343,20

A dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive heteroscedastic (DCC- GARCH) model is employed to estimate three important measures of tail dependence risk: conditional value at risk (CoVaR), delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR), and marginal expected shortfall (MES). Using daily data from January 2017 until May 2020, results point to significant systemic oil risk spillover in all GCC stock markets. In particular, the effect of oil price systemic risk on GCC stock market returns was significantly larger during COVID-19 than before the pandemic. Upon splitting COVID-19 into two phases based on severity, we identify Saudi Arabia as the only GCC market to have experienced significantly higher exposure to oil risk in Phase 1. Although all GCC stock markets received greater oil systemic risk spillover in Phase 2 of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appeared more vulnerable to oil extreme risk than other countries. Our empirical findings reveal that investors should carefully consider the extreme oil risk effects on GCC stock markets when designing optimal portfolio strategies, minimizing portfolio risk, and adopting dynamic diversification process.

Serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair, and the incubation period are key parameters in determining the control strategies for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case. The median incubation period was 3.99 (95% CI: 3.25-4.84) days. Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% developed symptoms within 9.49 (95% CI: 6.75-12.20) days after infection. CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval and the incubation period of COVID-19 in HCWs were shorter than in the general population. Rigorous contact tracing and isolation of infected HCWs could have resulted in shorter serial intervals.

Several factors come into play when determining the suitability of such methods including the quality of the decontamination technique, the targeted pathogen, cost, ease of installation and use, rate of sterilization, and the surface or material to be sterilized. The germicidal properties of ultraviolet-C are well known. This review will cover the most commonly described methods for the sterilization of N95 respirators, namely, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vaporization, microwave-generated steaming, and dry heating. These techniques have been tested previously and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens, although testing against SARS-CoV-2 specifically has not been done. Moreover, it must be emphasized that proper disposal after a single use is still ideal under normal circumstances.","Torres, Angeli Eloise; Lyons, Alexis B; Narla, Shanthi; Kohli, Indermeet; Parks-Miller, Angela; Ozog, David; Hamzavi, Iltefat H; Lim, Henry W",Protochem. photobiol. sci,343,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was designed and implemented from 100 cone-beam computed tomographic scans (CBCTs) of patients with age ranging from 18 to 65 years old. The primary outcome was to assess the incidence of mandibular third molars (Md3s) with existing lingual cortex perforation by their roots. Perforation was assessed at the level of root apex and the most lingual portion on the apical half of the root. Other outcome variables included average thickness of covering lingual bone in the nonperforation group, lingual cortex morphology, impaction, and demographics. Descriptive statistics were computed. RESULTS: More than half the radiographs showed lingual cortex perforation at the level of root apex and most lingual portion on the apical one half of the root (51.2% and 52.8%, respectively). The average thickness of the covering lingual bone was 1.25 mm around the root apex and 0.93 mm around the most lingual portion on the apical half of the root. The most common lingual cortex morphology was the undercut shape. There was statistically significant association between the presence of Md3 impaction and perforation at both root levels (P value < .001, Effect size = 0.378) and (P value < .001, Effect size = 0.445). CONCLUSIONS: Perforation of the lingual cortex by Md3s, whether erupted or impacted, was found in >50% of patients as determined by a preoperative CBCT scan. Therefore, the finding of lingual cortex perforation after removal of Md3s is likely to be evidence of a pre-existing condition rather than a result of surgery.","Amin, Sara A; Elsheikh, Ahmad K; Bagheri, Shahrokh C; Meyer, Roger A",J. oral maxillofac. surg,343,26

ARDS in influenza-infected mice is associated with reduced levels of liponucleotides (essential precursors for de novo phospholipid synthesis) in alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells. Because surfactant phospholipid synthesis is a primary function of ATII cells, we hypothesized that disrupting this process could contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza-induced ARDS. The goal of this study was to determine whether parenteral liponucleotide supplementation can attenuate ARDS. C57BL/6 mice inoculated intranasally with 10,000 pfu/mouse of H1N1 influenza A/WSN/33 virus were treated with CDP-choline (100 µg/mouse, i.p.) +/- CDP-diacylglycerol 16:0/16:0 (10 µg/mouse, i.p.) once daily from 1-5 days post-inoculation (to model post-exposure influenza prophylaxis) or as a single dose on day 5 (to model treatment of patients with ongoing influenza-induced ARDS). Daily post-exposure prophylaxis with CDP-choline attenuated influenza-induced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, alterations in lung mechanics, impairment of alveolar fluid clearance, and pulmonary inflammation without altering viral replication. These effects were not recapitulated by daily administration of CTP and/or choline. Daily co-administration of CDP-diacylglycerol significantly enhanced the beneficial effects of CDP-choline and also modified the ATII cell lipidome, reversing the infection-induced decrease in phosphatidylcholine and increasing levels of most other lipid classes in ATII cells. Single-dose treatment with both liponucleotides at 5 days post-inoculation also attenuated hypoxemia, altered lung mechanics, and inflammation. Overall, our data show that liponucleotides act rapidly to reduce disease severity in mice with severe influenza-induced ARDS.","Rosas, Lucia E; Doolittle, Lauren M; Joseph, Lisa M; El-Musa, Hasan; Novotny, Michael V; Hickman-Davis, Judy M; Hite, R Duncan; Davis, Ian C",Am. j. respir. cell mol. biol,343,21

Oral intake is an important interventional target for addressing these nutritional consequences. However, the efficacy of interventions remains poorly understood as prior syntheses have failed to examine the impact of intervention approaches on malnutrition and hypothesized mechanisms of action in persons with dementia. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve oral intake and nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia. Four databases yielded 1712 studies, resulting in 32 studies that met inclusion criteria. Studies included education, environmental modifications, feeding, oral supplementation, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions. While the majority of studies reported statistically significant improvements in at least 1 nutritional outcome, study design and outcome measures were heterogenous with many lacking adequate statistical power or blinding. Collectively, we found moderate evidence to suggest the efficacy of oral supplementation, and preliminary evidence to suggest that feeding interventions, education, and environmental modifications may confer improvements. Findings clarify the state of existing evidence regarding various interventional strategies for improving malnutrition in persons with dementia. While some approaches are promising, adequately powered and rigorously designed multidimensional intervention trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making in real-world contexts.","Borders, James C; Blanke, Samantha; Johnson, Stephen; Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea; Rogus-Pulia, Nicole",Alzheimer dis. assoc. disord.,343,16

In the 1960s, coronaviruses (CoVs) were recognized as disease agents in humans. In only two decades, three strains of CoVs have crossed species barriers rapidly emerging as human pathogens resulting in life-threatening disease with a pandemic potential: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of epidemiological, pathogenic and clinical features, along with diagnosis and treatment, of the ongoing epidemic of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the pediatric population in comparison to the first two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS. Literature analysis showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections seem to affect children less commonly and less severely as compared with adults. Since children are usually asymptomatic, they are often not tested, leading to an underestimate of the true numbers infected. Most of the documented infections belong to family clusters, so the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Like in SARS and MERS infection, there is the possibility that children are not an important reservoir for novel CoVs and this may have important implications for school attendance. While waiting for an effective against SARS-CoV-2, further prevalence studies in paediatric age are needed, in order to clarify the role of children in different age groups in the spread of the infection.","Iannarella, Rosanna; Lattanzi, Claudia; Cannata, Giulia; Argentiero, Alberto; Neglia, Cosimo; Fainardi, Valentina; Pisi, Giovanna; Esposito, Susanna",Acta Biomed,343,16

The lack of protective vaccine or treatment led most of the countries to follow the flattening of the infection curve with social isolation measures. There is evidence that socioeconomic inequalities have been shaping the COVID-19 burden among low and middle-income countries. This study described what sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were associated with the greatest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality and how did the importance of key neighbourhood-level socioeconomic factors change over time during the early stages of the pandemic in the Rio de Janeiro municipality, Brazil. METHODS: We linked socioeconomic attributes to confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 and computed age-standardised incidence and mortality rates by domains such as age, gender, crowding, education, income and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: The evidence suggests that although age-standardised incidence rates were higher in wealthy neighbourhoods, age-standardised mortality rates were higher in deprived areas during the first 2 months of the pandemic. The age-standardised mortality rates were also higher in males, and in areas with a predominance of people of colour, which are disproportionately represented in more vulnerable groups. The population also presented COVID-19 'rejuvenation', that is, people became risk group younger than in developed countries. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is a strong health gradient for COVID-19 death risk during the early stages of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases continued to move towards the urban periphery and to more vulnerable communities, threatening the health system functioning and increasing the health gradient.","Silva, Julio; Ribeiro-Alves, Marcelo",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),343,6

Small peripheral states generally increase in trade incomes yet at cost of sovereignty and agenda decisions. Recent studies in the field of political economy have demonstrated that concerted economic integration efforts actually lead to disproportional gains for bigger powers at the expense of smaller neighboring states. This differential in integration benefits results in political disintegration for the latter.1In the case of Asia Pacific, Taiwan is situated at the forefront of regional superpower China’s unification campaign. We examine the history of Taiwan’s cross-Straits relations highlighting its experience with China’s various forms of power. For other smaller states in the region, what lessons can be learnt from Taiwan’s experience in the last few decades characterized by China’s “peaceful ascendance” and regional bloc initiative? We suggest that Taiwan serves as a reference for other states in the region. We discuss on the implications of China’s economic integration projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the role of Taiwan in the political economy of regional relations. Not only can its experience provide reference data for other small states like canary in the mines,2but it can also be a facilitator of synergetic strategies among smaller state to broker new possibilities under China’s expansive influence.","Tan, Alexander C.; Ho, Karl; Clark, Cal",Asian Aff.,343,26

As these requirements can only be insufficiently fulfilled by systematic reviews due to the high amount of time required, abbreviated evidence syntheses in the form of rapid reviews are becoming increasingly popular. PURPOSE: This commentary aims to enhance methodological and methodical discussions and research about abbreviated evidence syntheses. METHODS: A selective literature search and evaluation focussing on research dealing with rapid reviews. RESULTS: In rapid reviews, a wide variety of methods can be used to speed up the process of literature search and evaluation, while at the same time maintaining the principles of methodological qualityand transparent reporting. But do rapid reviews currently keep what they promise? We discuss the increasing trend towards rapid reviews, giving the currently available evidence on the topic some critical reflection. Following this discussion, we will finally derive demands that go beyond the topic of rapid reviews alone.","Nordhausen, Thomas; Hirt, Julian","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen (Online)",343,12

As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19. To face this immediate global challenge, drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer this battle. Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19. However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed. In the present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural viroinformatics approach. Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2. Deep structural analysis of target molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3 (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)]. It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage. Thus, drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an obvious therapeutics' measures.","Bibi, Nousheen; Gul, Sana; Ali, Johar; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Eur J Pharmacol,343,1

Methods: We use data provided by Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency, National Medical Center, which include the clinical and epidemiological patient data of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who were discharged on, or prior to, April 30, 2020, in South Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with the severity of and mortality from COVID-19 disease. The outcome variable is the categorized clinical severity scores (CSS): mild case (O2 treatment not needed), severe case (O2 treatment needed), and death. Results: A total of 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD); odds ratio, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.19 to 5.61] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); odds ratio, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52] were significantly associated with case severity.

Presently, the human world is affected by a novel version of the coronavirus family known as SARS-CoV-2, which has an extremely high contagion rate. Although the infection fatality rate (IFR) of this rapidly spreading virus is not high (ranging from 0.00% to 1.54% across 51 different locations), the increasing number of infections and deaths has created a worldwide pandemic situation. To provide therapy to severely infected patients, instant therapeutic support is urgently needed and the repurposing of already approved drugs is presently in progress. In this regard, the development of nanoparticles as effective transporters for therapeutic drugs or as alternative medicines is highly encouraged and currently needed. The size range of the viruses is within 60-140 nm, which is slightly larger than the diameters of nanoparticles, making nanomaterials efficacious tools with antiviral properties. Silver-based nanomaterials (AgNMs) demonstrate antimicrobial and disinfectant effects mostly by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are presently considered as a versatile tool for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Other metal-based nanoparticles have been primarily reported as delivery agents or surface modifying agents, vaccine adjuvant against coronavirus. The present review summarizes and discusses the possible effectiveness of various surface-modified AgNMs against animal coronaviruses and presents a concept for AgNM-based therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in the near future.","Das, Chanchal; Paul, Subha Sankar; Saha, Arighna; Singh, Tejinder; Saha, Abhijit; Im, Jungkyun; Biswas, Goutam",Int J Nanomedicine,343,21

Recently, large pre-trained language models have shown great performance in few-shot learning for various downstream tasks, such as question answering and machine translation. Nevertheless, little exploration has been made to achieve few-shot learning for the fact-checking task. However, fact-checking is an important problem, especially when the amount of information online is growing exponentially every day. In this paper, we propose a new way of utilizing the powerful transfer learning ability of a language model via a perplexity score. The most notable strength of our methodology lies in its capability in few-shot learning. With only two training samples, our methodology can already outperform the Major Class baseline by more than absolute 10% on the F1-Macro metric across multiple datasets.

However, the effects of GPR40 full agonism on liver parameters are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of a GPR40 full agonist, SCO-267, on liver parameters in a non-diabetic mouse model with early-stage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). SCO-267 was orally administered to mice, which were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), a mouse model for NAFLD. An oral dose of SCO-267 increased levels of circulating glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 in CDAHFD-fed mice. In a chronic dose experiment, effects of SCO-267 were compared with those of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (alogliptin) and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin). SCO-267 decreased liver triglyceride content, weight, and collagen content, and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels without affecting food intake or glucose levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Furthermore, SCO-267 decreased levels of liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), markers of oxidative stress. Alogliptin and dapagliflozin had no effect on liver weight or levels of triglyceride, collagen, plasma ALT, and liver TBARS. SCO-267 elevated mRNA levels of molecules with roles in mitochondrial function and beta-oxidation, while inhibiting those with roles in lipogenesis, inflammation, reactive oxygen species generation, and fibrosis in the liver, all of which were less evident with alogliptin and dapagliflozin. This is the first study to show that the GPR40 full agonist, SCO-267, improves liver parameters without affecting glucose or body weight in a mouse model of NAFLD. Significance Statement Full agonism of GPR40/FFA1 receptor signaling stimulates islet and gut hormone secretions. The present study is the first to show the treatment effects of GPR40 full agonism on liver parameters in a mouse model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","Ookawara, Mitsugi; Matsuda, Keisuke; Watanabe, Masanori; Moritoh, Yusuke",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,343,16

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. Considering different starting times of infection, mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Based on the target cell limited model, the within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the broad values of human influenza infection. The best model to fit the data was including immune cell response, which suggests a slow immune response peaking between 5 to 10 days post-onset of symptoms. The model with the eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, all models predict that SARS-CoV-2 may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and viral load could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work. These models can serve for future evaluation of control theoretical approaches to tailor new potential drugs against COVID-19.","Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X",Annual reviews in control,343,1

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Medicine, Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar Cantt; Pakistan from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: Admitted patients with SARS-CoV-2 detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included. Patients with suggestive radiological findings but negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2, those with incomplete data or those leaving against medical advice were excluded. Serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and LDH levels were tested on admission. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was checked on nasopharyngeal samples. Disease severity was assessed using World Health Organization guidelines. RESULTS: There were 238 patients, aged 41.18 ± 16.74 years. Disease was mild in 157 (65.97%), moderate in 36 (15.13%), and severe in 45 (18.91%) cases. Twenty-two (9.24%) patients died in the hospital. Serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in 122 (51.26%), 83 (34.87%) and 184 (77.31%) patients, respectively; more frequently amongst patients with moderate/severe disease or mortality. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves and 95% confidence intervals for serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and LDH were 0.909 (0.854-0.964), 0.915 (0.835-0.995) and 0.863 (0.785-0.942), respectively.

In response to the pandemic, researchers have been rapidly studying different aspects of COVID-19, such as virus detection, vaccinations, and epidemiological aspects of the disease. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can induce uncontrolled inflammation and cause a lack of antiviral response, thereby aggravating the disease. Therefore, recovery of immune functions is key to COVID-19 treatment. Many clinical trials are exploring suitable therapies, and some progress has been made. Early administration of interferons may prevent COVID-19 exacerbation and/or promotes recovery from the diseases. Inhibitors of inflammation can prevent cytokine storms and multi-organ damage. Convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies has played an important role in therapeutic options at the beginning of the pandemic owing to the lack of other effective methods.

METHODS: A nationwide cohort study from Denmark between 1 March to 12 August 2020. The adjusted incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA; spondyloarthritis including psoriatic arthritis; connective tissue disease; vasculitides; and non-IRD individuals.Further, the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisation was estimated for patients with RA treated respectively non-treated with TNF-inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, or glucocorticoids.Lastly, the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection (intensive care, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death) among hospital-admitted patients was estimated for RA and non-IRD individudals. RESULTS: Patients with IRD (n = 58,052) had an increased partially adjusted incidence of hospitalisation with COVID-19 compared with the 4.5 million people in the general population (HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.86) with strongest associations for patients with RA (n = 29,440, HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.29 to 2.30) and vasculitides (n = 4072, HR 1.82, 95%CI 0.91 to 3.64).

The release of phenolic compounds from the food matrix during digestion is an important pre-requisite for their effectiveness within the human body, so it is fundamental to identify technological treatments able to preserve not only the concentration of phytochemicals but also their bioaccessibility. In this study we investigated the impact of high-pressure homogenization (HPH), alone and in the presence of 100 g kg-1 trehalose or Lactobacillus salivarius, on bioaccessibility of flavonoids in mandarin juice. In addition, digested mandarin juices were supplemented to liver cultured cells in basal and stressed condition to evaluate their protective effect in a biological system. RESULTS: HPH reduced the concentration of total phenolics and main flavonoids but increased their bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion (p < 0.001). In basal condition, supplementation with all digested juices significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration (p < 0.001). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in the medium was also reduced by supplementation with HPH-treated juices. Although pre-treatment with juices did not completely counteract the applied oxidative stress it preserved cell viability, and cells pre-treated with juices submitted to HPH in the presence of probiotics showed the lowest ROS concentration. CONCLUSION: Our study represents an important step ahead in the evaluation of the impact of processing on the nutritional and functional value of food, which cannot simply be assessed based on chemical composition.

Global spread, promptness, and dialogic potentials make these platforms ideal for public health monitoring and emergency communication in crises such as COVID-19. Objective Drawing on the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication framework, we sought to examine how leading health organizations use Instagram for communicating and engaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We manually retrieved Instagram posts together with relevant metadata of four health organizations (WHO, CDC, IFRC, and NHS) shared between January 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Two coders manually coded the analytical sample of 269 posts related to COVID-19 on dimensions including content theme, gender depiction, person portrayal, and image type. We further analyzed engagement indices associated with the coded dimensions. Results The CDC and WHO were the most active of all the assessed organizations with respect to the number of posts, reach, and engagement indices. Most of the posts were about personal preventive measures and mitigation, general advisory and vigilance, and showing gratitude and resilience. An overwhelming level of engagement was observed for posts representing celebrity, clarification, and infographics. Conclusions Instagram can be an effective tool for health organizations to convey their messages during crisis communication, notably through celebrity involvement, clarification posts, and the use of infographics. There is much opportunity to strengthen the role of health organizations in countering misinformation on social media by providing accurate information, directing users to credible sources, and serving as a fact-check for false information.","Malik, Aqdas Khan M.

Results of the observational studies published during this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-center, parallel group, randomized controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. METHODS: 60 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more liters of oxygen to maintain a saturation of &#8805;92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomized to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. RESULTS: In the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours.

Disasters, either man-made or natural, affect production and supply chains negatively with perilous effects. On the other hand, flexibility and resilience to manage the perpetuated risks in a manufacturing system are vital for achieving a controllable production rate. Still, these performances are strongly dependent on the multi-criteria decision making in the working environment with the policies launched during the crisis. Undoubtedly, health stability in a society generates ripple effects in the supply chain due to high demand fluctuation, likewise due to the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Incorporation of dependent demand factors to manage the risk from uncertainty during this pandemic has been a challenge to achieve a viable profit for the supply chain partners. A non-linear supply chain management model is developed with a controllable production rate to provide an economic benefit to the manufacturing firm in terms of the optimized total cost of production and to deal with the different situations under variable demand. The costs in the model are set as fuzzy to cope up with the uncertain conditions created by lasting pandemic. A numerical experiment is performed by utilizing the data set of the multi-stage manufacturing firm. The optimal results provide support for the industrial managers based on the proactive plan by the optimal utilization of the resources and controllable production rate to cope with the emergencies in a pandemic.","Alkahtani, Mohammed; Omair, Muhammad; Khalid, Qazi Salman; Hussain, Ghulam; Ahmad, Imran; Pruncu, Catalin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),343,20

Currently available antiviral drugs have found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The demand for efficient antiviral drugs has created a huge burden on physicians and health workers. Plasma therapy seems to be less accomplishable due to insufficient donors to donate plasma and low recovery rate from viral infection. Repurposing of antivirals has been evolved as a suitable strategy in the current treatment and preventive measures. The concept of drug repurposing represents new experimental approaches for effective therapeutic benefits. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits several complications such as lung damage, blood clot formation, respiratory illness and organ failures in most of the patients. Based on the accumulation of data, sulfated marine polysaccharides have exerted successful inhibition of virus entry, attachment and replication with known or unknown possible mechanisms against deadly animal and human viruses so far. Since the virus entry into the host cells is the key process, the prevention of such entry mechanism makes any antiviral strategy effective. Enveloped viruses are more sensitive to polyanions than non-enveloped viruses. Besides, the viral infection caused by RNA virus types embarks severe oxidative stress in the human body that leads to malfunction of tissues and organs. In this context, polysaccharides play a very significant role in providing shielding effect against the virus due to their polyanionic rich features and a molecular weight that hinders their reactive surface glycoproteins. Significantly the functional groups especially sulfate, sulfate pattern and addition, uronic acids, monosaccharides, glycosidic linkage and high molecular weight have greater influence in the antiviral activity. Moreover, they are very good antioxidants that can reduce the free radical generation and provokes intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, polysaccharides enable a host-virus immune response, activate phagocytosis and stimulate interferon systems. Therefore, polysaccharides can be used as candidate drugs, adjuvants in vaccines or combination with other antivirals, antioxidants and immune-activating nutritional supplements and antiviral materials in healthcare products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Andrew, Monic; Jayaraman, Gurunathan",Carbohydr Res,343,16

DESIGN: Longitudinal population-based study. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults (aged &#8805;60 years) living in a rural Ecuadorian village struck by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Of 282 enrolled individuals, 254 (90%) finished the study. MEASUREMENTS: HGS was measured 3 months before (January 2020) and 9 months after the introduction of the virus into the population (January 2021). SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was performed in two rounds: in May-June (early) and September-November (late), 2020. An independent association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HGS decline was assessed by fitting linear mixed models for longitudinal data. Changes in HGS scores in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive subjects, according to the time elapsed since seroconversion, were compared with those who remained seronegative. RESULTS: Overall, 149 (59%) individuals became seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean HGS (in kg) was 25.3 ± 8.3 at baseline and 23.7 ± 8.1 at follow-up (p = 0.028), with 140 individuals having >5% HGS decline between both measurements. The follow-up HGS measurement decreased by 1.72 kg in seropositive individuals, and by 0.57 kg in their seronegative counterparts (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals were 2.27 times more likely (95% CI: 1.33-3.87) to have a lower HGS measurement at the time of follow-up than those who remained seronegative. When compared with seronegative subjects, seropositive patients with early seroconversion were 3.41 times (95% CI: 1.73-6.74) more likely to have >5% HGS decline at the time of the follow-up than those with later, i.e., more recent, infections. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an independent deleterious impact of SARS-CoV-2 on HGS that is more marked among individuals with infections that occurred more than 8 months before follow-up HGS.

Data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients (CPs) undergoing or candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are lacking. We depicted the practice and adaptations in the management of patients with solid tumors eligible or receiving ICIs during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a special focus on Campania region. METHODS: This survey (25 questions), promoted by the young section of SCITO (Società Campana di ImmunoTerapia Oncologica) Group, was circulated among Italian young oncologists practicing in regions variously affected by the pandemic: high (group 1), medium (group 2) and low (group 3) prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. For Campania region, the physician responders were split into those working in cancer centers (CC), university hospitals (UH) and general hospitals (GH). Percentages of agreement, among High (H) versus Medium (M) and versus Low (L) group for Italy and among CC, UH and GH for Campania region, were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and &#967;2 test for trends relative to the questions with 3 or more options. RESULTS: This is the first Italian study to investigate the COVID-19 impact on cancer immunotherapy, unique in its type and very clear in the results. The COVID-19 pandemic seemed not to affect the standard practice in the prescription and delivery of ICIs in Italy. Telemedicine was widely used. There was high consensus to interrupt immunotherapy in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and to adopt ICIs with longer schedule interval. The majority of the responders tended not to delay the start of ICIs; there were no changes in supportive treatments, but some of the physicians opted for delaying surgeries (if part of patients' planned treatment approach). The results from responders in Campania did not differ significantly from the national ones. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the efforts of Italian oncologists to maintain high standards of care for CPs treated with ICIs, regardless the regional prevalence of COVID-19, suggesting the adoption of similar solutions. Research on patients treated with ICIs and experiencing COVID-19 will clarify the safety profile to continue the treatments, thus informing on the most appropriate clinical conducts.","Ottaviano, Margaret; Curvietto, Marcello; Rescigno, Pasquale; Tortora, Marianna; Palmieri, Giovannella; Giannarelli, Diana; Aieta, Michele; Assalone, Pasquale; Attademo, Laura; Avallone, Antonio; Bloise, Francesco; Bosso, Davide; Borzillo, Valentina; Buono, Giuseppe; Calderoni, Giuseppe; Caputo, Francesca; Cartenì, Giacomo; Cavallero, Diletta; Cavo, Alessia; Ciardiello, Fortunato; Conca, Raffaele; Conteduca, Vincenza; De Falco, Stefano; De Felice, Marco; De Laurentiis, Michelino; De Placido, Pietro; De Placido, Sabino; De Santo, Irene; De Stefano, Alfonso; Della Corte, Carminia Maria; Di Franco, Rossella; Di Lauro, Vincenzo; Fabbrocini, Antonietta; Federico, Piera; Festino, Lucia; Giordano, Pasqualina; Giuliano, Mario; Gridelli, Cesare; Grimaldi, Antonio Maria; Lia, Michela; Marretta, Antonella Lucia; Massa, Valentina; Mennitto, Alessia; Merler, Sara; Merz, Valeria; Messina, Carlo; Messina, Marco; Milano, Monica; Minisini, Alessandro Marco; Montesarchio, Vincenzo",J. immunotherap. cancer,343,24

Orf virus (ORFV) interferon resistance protein (VIR) is the principal virulence protein that encodes a dsRNA-binding protein to inhibit host antiviral response. p53 is one of the key proteins of the host antiviral innate immunity. It not only enhances type I interferon secretion but also induces apoptosis in infected cells, and plays a crucial role in the immune response against various viral infections. However, it remains to be elucidated what role p53 plays in ORFV replication and whether ORFV's own protein VIR regulates p53 expression to promote self-replication. In this study, we showed that p53 has an antiviral effect on ORFV and can inhibit ORFV replication. In addition, ORFV nonstructural protein VIR interacts with p53 and degrades p53, which inhibits p53-mediated positive regulation of downstream antiviral genes. This study provides new insight into the immune evasion mediated by ORFV and identifies VIR as an antagonistic factor for ORFV to evade the antiviral response.","Yan, Ming-Hao; Wang, Ling-Ling; Hao, Jun-Hong; Zhang, Xue-Gang; Shen, Chao-Chao; Zhang, Da-Jun; Zheng, Hai-Xue; Liu, Xiang-Tao; Zhang, Ke-Shan",Viral Immunol,343,26

Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, self-perceived health literacy, and successful implementation of the GCs. During the pilot, eight in-person GCs were delivered: once-monthly (Oct–Dec 2019), then twice-monthly (Jan–Feb 2020). Feedback was received from 49/53 patients. 100% felt more satisfied and heard, 100% felt more involved in decision-making, 98% had a better understanding of their condition, 96% felt more able to cope with their condition and keep themselves healthy, 94% rated this as a positive experience, and 90% reported improved access and more time with their clinician compared with existing 1:1 appointments. Since September 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to weekly virtual GCs, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback (median scores: patient satisfaction 9.5/10;being listened to by clinician 10/10;involved by clinician in treatment decisions 10/10;clinician explanation of treatment 10/10;and opportunity to discuss condition or treatment 10/10). GCs are safe and effective for IIH, and preferred in our patient cohort. This allowed ongoing high-quality, person-centred care despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

But unlike soldiers, healthcare professionals often take on these dangerous roles without any prior intention or explicit expectation that their work will place them in grave personal danger. This inevitably raises questions about their role-related obligations and whether they should be free to choose not to endanger themselves. In this article, I argue that it is helpful to view this situation not only through the lens of ""professional duty"" but also through the lens of ""role-related conflicts."" Doing so has the advantage of avoiding exceptionalism and allowing us to draw lessons not only from previous epidemics but also from a wide range of far more common role-related dilemmas in healthcare.","Lipworth, Wendy",J Bioeth Inq,343,24

Authors' reply,18.311,7.7401648,2021,"The COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and is known as a pandemic emergency that has led to a high rate of mortality throughout the world. Evidence has indicated that hyperinflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 are the main cause of pathogenicity in the severe cases of patients who have died during the current viral disease. Monocytes and macrophages as the most important cells of the innate arm of the immune system play a substantial part in the body's defense against viral infections. They mainly respond to the microbial antigens by producing inflammatory mediators to remove pathogens and repair tissue injury. Nevertheless, aberrant alterations in their function such as cytokine storm can be so harmful to the host in the acute respiratory distress syndrome cases caused by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, inflammatory responses stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 have affected the other vital organs of the body including the heart. As cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients have been reported in several studies. During the infection, monocytes and macrophages may be involved in the hypersensitive and exacerbated reactions that contribute to the tissue damage, especially lung injury resulted in its dysfunction and respiratory disorder. In this review, we discuss both advantageous and disadvantageous about the pathological potential of monocytes and macrophages during the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to clarify their mutual effects on immune processing as a fist line defender in the current disease.","Meidaninikjeh, Sepideh; Sabouni, Nasim; Marzouni, Hadi Zare; Bengar, Sajad; Khalili, Ahmad; Jafari, Reza",Life Sci,343,16

One of the ophthalmologic pathologies is optic neuritis. Optic neuritis in SARS-CoV-infected patients may precede the classical pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 and can be unilateral or bilateral. Optic neuritis has been repeatedly reported in COVID-19 patients and may occur with or without affection of other cranial nerves. Since cerebro-spinal fluid parameters can be abnormal in COVID-19 associated optic neuritis, these patients require a spinal tap. Before diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 associated optic neuritis various differentials need to be excluded. Since SARS-CoV-2 causes endothelial damage complicated by thrombus formation and thromboembolism, ophthalmologic vascular complication due to an infection with SARS-CoV-2 such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and retinal vein occlusion need to be excluded. CRAO may result from arterial hypertension, myocarditis, heart failure, Takotsubo syndrome, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter, frequent cardiac complications of COVID-19. Since CRAO can be accompanied by ischemic stroke, patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated optic neuritis need to undergo a cerebral MRI.","Finsterer, Josef; Scorza, Fulvio A; Scorza, Carla A; Fiorini, Ana C",Curr Eye Res,343,26

Interventions are not established. On the basis of the link between inflammation, fibrosis, aldosterone, and extracellular matrix regulation, we aimed to investigate the effect of an early intervention with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) eplerenone on cardiac remodelling in a murine model of persistent coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: SWR/J mice were infected with 5 × 104 plaque-forming units of CVB3 (Nancy strain) and daily treated either with eplerenone (200 mg/kg body weight) or with placebo starting from Day 1. At Day 8 or 28 post infection, mice were haemodynamically characterized and subsequently sacrificed for immunohistological and molecular biology analyses. Eplerenone did not influence CVB3 load. Already at Day 8, 1.8-fold (P < 0.05), 1.4-fold (P < 0.05), 3.2-fold (P < 0.01), and 2.1-fold (P < 0.001) reduction in LV intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression, presence of monocytes/macrophages, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, respectively, was observed in eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected mice. In vitro, eplerenone led to 1.4-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.2-fold (P < 0.01) less CVB3-induced cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, collagen production was 1.1-fold (P < 0.05) decreased in cardiac fibroblasts cultured with medium of eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected HL-1 cardiomyocytes. These ameliorations were in vivo translated into prevention of cardiac fibrosis, as shown by 1.4-fold (P < 0.01) and 2.1-fold (P < 0.001) lower collagen content in the LV of eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected mice at Days 8 and 28, respectively. This resulted in an early and long-lasting improvement of LV dimension and function, as indicated by reduced LV end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume, and an increase in LV contractility (dP/dtmax ) and LV relaxation (dP/dtmin ), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention with the MRA eplerenone modulates the acute host and defence reaction and prevents cardiac disease progression in experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis without aggravation of viral load. The findings advocate for an initiation of therapy of viral myocarditis as early as possible, even before the onset of inflammation-induced myocardial dysfunction. This may also have implications for coronavirus disease-19 therapy.","Tschöpe, Carsten; Van Linthout, Sophie; Jäger, Sebastian; Arndt, Robert; Trippel, Tobias; Müller, Irene; Elsanhoury, Ahmed; Rutschow, Susanne; Anker, Stefan D; Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Pauschinger, Matthias; Spillmann, Frank; Pappritz, Kathleen",ESC Heart Fail,343,26

The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreak, starts on 2nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2nd March, 2020 to 12th November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of implementing preventive measures in reducing the new cases. Our model projects the daily new COVID-19 cases in India during 13th November, 2020 to 25th February, 2021 for a range of intervention strength. We also investigate that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be increased over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.","Senapati, Abhishek; Rana, Sourav; Das, Tamalendu; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",J Theor Biol,343,12

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed from 1st April to May 3, 2020 on 157 ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients in Shahid Modarres Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Patients' clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, and subsequent complications, were collected and compared between MetS and non-MetS groups. RESULTS: 74 of all cases had MetS. Among the MetS components, waist circumference (p-value = 0.006 for men; p-value<0.0001 for women), Triglycerides (p-value = 0.002), and Fasting Blood Sugar (p-value = 0.007) were significantly higher in MetS group; with no statistical difference found in HDL levels (p-value = 0.21 for men; p-value = 0.13 for women), systolic blood pressure(p-value = 0.07), and diastolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.18) between two groups. Length of ICU admission (p-value = 0.009), the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (p-value = 0.0001), respiratory failure (p-value = 0.0008), and pressure ulcers (p-value = 0.02) were observed significantly more in MetS group. The Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality with 0(OR = 0.3660), 1(OR = 0.5155), 2(OR = 0.5397), 3(OR = 1.9511), 4(OR = 5.7018), and 5(OR = 8.3740) MetS components showed an increased mortality risk as the components' count increased. The patient with BMI>40 (OR = 6.9368) had more odds of fatality comparing to those with BMI>35 (OR = 4.0690) and BMI>30 (OR = 2.5287). Furthermore, the waist circumference (OR = 8.31; p-value<0.0001) and fasting blood sugar (OR = 2.4588; p-value = 0.0245) were obtained by multivariate logistic regression as independent prognostic factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a strong relationship between having MetS and increased risk of severe complications and mortality among COVID-19 ICU-admitted patients.","Alamdari, Nasser Malekpour; Rahimi, Fateme Sadat; Afaghi, Siamak; Zarghi, Afshin; Qaderi, Shohra; Tarki, Farzad Esmaeili; Ghafouri, Seyed Reshad; Besharat, Sara",Diabetes Metab Syndr,343,24

The COVID-19 pandemic hasrequired us to adapt how we communicate with patients' familiesdue to hospital visiting restrictions. In an era where tragicallydeterioration and death have been much more commonplace, welooked to identify areas where junior doctors felt theircommunication skills could be improved, and implemented ateaching programme to deliver this. Methods Pre-teaching questionnaires were distributed to a range of grades of junior doctors working in University Hospital of Llandough,Cardiff. The questionnaires were distributed at the beginning of June 2020, after 3 months of working in pandemic conditions. Ateaching session on telephone and video communication skillswas delivered by a local palliative care consultant. Post-teaching, arepeat questionnaire was undertaken to assess response and identify key learning points. Results Pre-teaching, 100% of the 22 respondents had had to participatein difficult conversations over the phone, 82% had had no formalphone based communication skills training and 81.82% felt someform of formal teaching would be helpful. Post-teaching, 12 juniordoctors provided feedback with an average 37% increase inconfidence to undertake difficult conversations. Key learning points from the session highlighted the importance of preparation, regularly updating the family to build trust and rapport, and integrating family updates via tele-communicationinto daily ward life. Conclusions Education around telephone communication skills is critical toenable us to adapt our skills in accordance with the demands of thepandemic, to continue to support relatives and to engage withtechnology with confidence. Increased preparation is required tonavigate difficult conversations via technology, and successfulcommunication requires clinicians to take responsibility forinitiating regular family updates.","Pyrke, B.; Abdalla, B.; Cartwright, G.; Figg, K.; Murphy, E.; Tuck, A.; White, H.",Age and Ageing,343,24

The challenge now is to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic without overburdening economic and social activities. An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions. Interventions considered included encouraging telecommuting, reducing contacts to high-risk persons, and reductions to contacts outside of the home, among others. Removing all existing interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy.

Masks reduce the expulsion of aerosols of respiratory fluids into the environment (called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer. Masks are often characterized using filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and manikin or human fit factors, which are standard metrics used for personal protective devices. However, none of these metrics are direct measurements of how effectively a mask blocks coughed and exhaled aerosols. We studied the source control performance of 15 cloth masks (face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators by measuring their ability to block aerosols ≤7 µm expelled during simulated coughing and exhalation (called source control collection efficiency). These measurements were compared with filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors measured on manikin headforms and humans. Collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation. Filtration efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on headforms and 1.0 to 4.0 on human subjects. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the source control collection efficiencies and the standard metrics ranged from 0.03 to 0.68 and were significant in all but two cases. However, none of the standard metrics were strongly correlated with source control performance. A better understanding of the relationships between source control collection efficiency, filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor is needed.

While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting. The aim of this study was to share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors. A group of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services. In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peripheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric. We analyze all these consequences and propose some practical treatment options, based on current evidence and clinical experience, as well as several suggestions for management of rehabilitation services and patients with suspected or confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 survivors have some specific rehabilitation needs. Experience from other centers may help colleagues in organizing their services and providing better care to their patients.","Carda, Stefano; Invernizzi, Marco; Bavikatte, Ganesh; Bensmaïl, Djamel; Bianchi, Francesca; Deltombe, Thierry; Draulans, Nathalie; Esquenazi, Alberto; Francisco, Gerard E; Gross, Raphaël; Jacinto, Luis J; Moraleda Pérez, Susana; O039,; dell, Michael W; Reebye, Rajiv; Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica; Wissel, Jörg; Molteni, Franco",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,343,29

The established method of evaluating trainees for their clinical knowledge and surgical proficiency in the operating room is not feasible in the current time of SARS-COV19 pandemic. Objective: The feasibility of conducting such an assessment using case modules on an online meeting platform is discussed. Methods: Six candidates were evaluated on two consecutive days with two internal examiners located at the examination site and two external examiners situated at their own institutions elsewhere in the country. Clinical details, including images and videos of patients managed at our institute were recorded and provided to the candidates as case modules. Four sessions were conducted in the form of long and short cases, operative neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and neuropathology and a general viva-voce using ""Zoom"" (Zoom-Video-Communications, Inc. USA) platform. Feedback from the examinee and the examiners were obtained for any modification in the current format. Result: The online platform worked well without any interruption except for slight lag in the audio-visual system and occasional difficulty in using microphone and screen simultaneously. Trainees were able to interpret the clinical details and rated this format close to actual clinical evaluation. The examiners uniformly agreed that the online format for assessment was satisfactory and made some suggestions for improvement. Conclusion: Clinical and surgical skill evaluation is feasible using case modules and online meeting platforms. Use of original patient's data, images, videos demonstrating clinical signs, and operative procedures makes this assessment more objective.","Salunke, Pravin; Sahoo, Sushanta Kumar; Chacko, Ari G; Baishya, Basant K; Tripathi, Manjul; Chabbra, Rajesh; Karthigeyan, Madhivanan; Aggarwal, Ashish; Singh, Apinderpreet; Gupta, Sunil Kumar",Neurol India,343,6

Data from independent groups have identified that platelets are hyperreactive during COVID-19. Platelet hyperreactivity is accompanied by changes in platelet gene expression, and enhanced interactions between platelets and leukocytes. In some patients, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA has been detected in platelets. Together, this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with platelets. However, controversy remains on which receptors mediate SARS-CoV-2 platelet interactions. Most, but not all, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses fail to observe the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2, or the cellular serine protease necessary for viral entry, TMPRSS2, on platelets and megakaryocytes. Interestingly, platelets express other known SARS-CoV-2 receptors, which induce similar patterns of activation to those observed when platelets are incubated with SARS-CoV-2. This article explores these findings and discusses ongoing areas of controversy and uncertainty with regard to SARS-CoV-2 platelet interactions.","Campbell, Robert A; Boilard, Eric; Rondina, Matthew T",J Thromb Haemost,343,20

A growing body of evidence indicates the correlation between splicing disorders and carcinoma. Nevertheless, an overall analysis of AS signatures in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is absent and urgently needed. RESULTS: 2042 splicing events were confirmed as prognostic molecular events. Furthermore, the final prognostic signature constructed by 10 AS events gave good result with an area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve up to 0.902 for 5 years, showing high potency in predicting patient outcome. We built the splicing regulatory network to show the internal regulation mechanism of splicing events in STAD. QKI may play a significant part in the prognosis induced by splicing events. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, a high-efficiency prognostic prediction model was built for STAD patients, and the results showed that AS events could become potential prognostic biomarkers for STAD. Meanwhile, QKI may become an important target for drug design in the future.","Zhang, Yuanyuan; Ma, Shengling; Niu, Qian; Han, Yun; Liu, Xingyu; Jiang, Jie; Chen, Simiao; Lin, Haolong",BMC Genomics,343,10

Design/methodology/approach: The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used, in experiment 1, to select and prioritise the most relevant criteria for improvement of PWB. A multi-criteria method is used to analyse and compare the importance of four main criteria and 16 sub-criteria identified from previous studies. The structural equation modelling (SEM) is also used to validate the findings of experiment 1. Findings: This study revealed that not all criteria are considered important for improving PWB. Flexibility and job specifications were the top-scored criteria. These criteria collectively accounted for more than 65% of the four studied criteria. The SEM emphasised the significance of flexibility and job description of the changing dynamics of organisational regulation during the contemporary economic and managerial turmoil. Research limitations/implications: This study explored the criteria required to improve PWB. The findings recommend that future studies should be designed to identify new elements and add new criteria and test the newly introduced variables at a physical workplace after the outbreak ends. Practical implications: Knowledge of the differential impacts of the criteria on the performance of PWB govern decision-makers in private and governmental organisation, especially at such times of economic turmoil and need for innovative strategies. Originality/value: Few studies have explored workplace behaviour and the environment in the government sector. Therefore, the focus of this study is the comprehensive coverage of workplace behaviour and the criteria influencing its productivity before and during the coronavirus outbreak.","Abdallah, Amna; Abdallah, Salam",J.

Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt.","Davahli, M. R.; Fiok, K.; Karwowski, W.; Aljuaid, A.

Following the instructions is very important to achieve that. This study aimed to evaluate awareness and practices related to the COVID-19 quarantine instructions among the home quarantine COVID-19 patients, and persons who contacted them at home quarantine. METHODS: During May and June 2020, the home quarantine COVID-19 patients (mild and moderate cases who need not be admitted to hospital) and the contacting persons were asked to fill an online structured questionnaire. Data were collected to assess the awareness regarding the quarantine instructions. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, consisting of 35 questions for a total possible score of 0-35. The first section was to assess the participants' awareness [19 items]; the second was to assess the awareness of the participants' families [11 items]; the third was to assessing awareness and attitude regarding the efforts provided to face COVID-19 [5 items]. RESULTS: A total of 300 subjects participated, 96% of them were committed not to leave the house till the end of the self-isolation period; 85% cared for house cleanliness and good ventilation of rooms; 63% maintained a balanced diet without fats, oil, and sugar; 70% used vitamins D and A to strengthen the immune system. The important role of the media in informing subjects of COVID-19 was known by 90%, while 63% of the participants are not satisfied with the hospital services in the area where they live.

Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: ""COVID-19"" and ""basic reproduction number"" or ""R0."" The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.38±1.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic. The estimated overall R0 was higher than the World Health Organization estimate.","Alimohamadi, Yousef; Taghdir, Maryam; Sepandi, Mojtaba",J Prev Med Public Health,343,1

Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.","Irvine, Michael; Coombs, Daniel; Skarha, Julianne; Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah; Taxman, Faye; Green, Traci C",J Urban Health,343,16

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site insertion in contrast to SARS-CoV, which may be related to its stronger communicability. An avian coronavirus with an extra furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2' site) infected monocyte cells and neuron cells leading to viremia or encephalitis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells. TNF-&#945;, which has a key role in blood-brain barrier permeability, was highly induced by avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site compared with the parent avian coronavirus. We demonstrated the process involved in mutant avian coronavirus-induced disease and that the addition of a furin-S2' site changed the virus cell tropism.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses have broken out three times in two decades. Spike (S) protein plays a key role in the process of infection. To clarify importance of furin cleavage site in spike protein for coronavirus, we investigated the pathogenesis of neurotropic avian coronavirus whose spike protein contains an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2' site). By combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects brain instead of trachea when its S protein contains furin-S2' site. Moreover, the virus was shown to increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, infect neuron cells and induce high expression of TNF-&#945;. Based on these results we further show that furin cleavage site in S protein plays an important role in coronavirus pathogenicity and cell tropism. Our study extends previous publications on function of S protein of coronavirus, increasing the understanding of researchers to coronavirus.","Cheng, Jinlong; Zhao, Ye; Hu, Yanxin; Zhao, Jing; Xue, Jia; Zhang, Guozhong",J. virol,343,16

Little, however, is known about the cognition of most birds with these traits, thus studying cognition in seabirds with these traits provides insight into how slow life-histories and complex social environments relate more generally to predicting cognitive ability. Object permanence is a cognitive ability shared by highly intelligent animals and is an ecologically relevant ability for many seabirds. I used a simple experimental setup in a semi-controlled environment to test object permanence in captive horned puffins (Fratercula corniculata) by hiding a reward to be retrieved, first partially and then completely. I discovered that the horned puffins performed poorly on the object permanence task when the reward was hidden completely.

Governments, decision-makers and policy-makers broadly need information about the effectiveness of a control intervention concerning its cost-benefit to evaluate whether a control intervention offers the best value for money. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number R c , to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied. The main finding is that having two controls (transmission reduction and case isolation) is better than having one control, but is economically expensive. In case only one control is affordable, then transmission reduction is better than case isolation. Hopefully, the results of this research should help policy-makers when dealing with multiple waves of COVID-19.","Asamoah, Joshua Kiddy K; Jin, Zhen; Sun, Gui-Quan; Seidu, Baba; Yankson, Ernest; Abidemi, Afeez; Oduro, F T; Alzahrani, Faris; Moore, Stephen E; Okyere, Eric",Chaos Solitons Fractals,343,26

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) proposed an expert consensus for imaging classification for COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and reproducibility of chest CT standards in the beginning of the Brazilian COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Cross-sectional study performed from March 1st to April 14th, 2020. Patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia submitted to RT-PCR test and chest computed tomography (CT) were included. Two thoracic radiologists blinded for RT-PCR and clinical and laboratory results classified every patient scan according to the RSNA expert consensus. A third thoracic radiologist also evaluated in case of discordance, and consensus was reached among the three radiologists. A typical appearance was considered a positive chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to evaluate intra- and inter-rater agreements. RESULTS: A total of 159 patients were included (mean age 57.9â¯±â¯18.0 years; 88 [55.3%] males): 86 (54.1%) COVID-19 and 73 (45.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. Eighty (50.3%) patients had a positive CT for COVID-19 pneumonia. Sensitivity and specificity of typical appearance were 88.3% (95%CI, 79.9-93.5) and 94.5% (95%CI, 86.7-97.8), respectively. Intra- and inter-rater agreement were assessed (Cohen's kappaâ¯=â¯0.924, Pâ¯=â¯0.06; Cohen's kappa=0.772, Pâ¯=â¯0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chest CT categorical classification of COVID-19 findings is reproducible and demonstrates high level of agreement with clinical and RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19. In RT-PCR scarcity scenarios or in equivocal cases, it may be useful for attending physicians in the evaluation of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients attended at the emergency unit.","Grando, Rafael D; Brentano, Vicente B; Zanardo, Ana P; Hertz, Felipe T; Júnior, Luís C Anflor; Prietto Dos Santos, Jônatas F; Galvão, Gabriela S; Zavascki, Alexandre P; Gazzana, Marcelo B",Braz J Infect Dis,343,24

While, for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision-makers to plan ahead (e.g., medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e., the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospitals and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e., the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision-makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.","Fenga, Livio; Gaspari, Mauro",Sensors (Basel),343,24

Purpose To investigate patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent abdomen/pelvis or cervical spine/neck CT with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19. Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020 to April 6, 2020 involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hotspot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19. Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency room (ER) with primary non-respiratory [gastrointestinal (GI) or neurological] symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 on a non-chest CT but no concurrent chest CT and had COVID-19 testing in the ER. Group 1 patients had RT PCR obtained pre-CT read (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); Group 2 had RT PCR obtained post-CT read (COVID-19 not suspected). Presentation and imaging findings were compared and outcomes were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients [31 men, 31 women, mean age 67(SD ±17) years] and group 2 comprised 57 patients [28 men, 29 women, mean age 63(SD ± 16) years). Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37/62, 60%, 29/62, 47%) than group 2 (9/57, 16%, 12/57, 21%) respectively, with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms. There were 101 abdomen/pelvis and 18 cervical spine/neck CTs. In Group 1, non-chest CT findings provided the initial evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia in 32/62 (52%); for Group 2, it was 44/57 (77%).

Each round has a random number of individuals arrive, and individuals can be characterized by their type (i.e. preferences over the different resources). A standard notion of `fairness' in this setting is that an allocation simultaneously satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency. The former is an individual guarantee, requiring that each agent prefers her own allocation over the allocation of any other; in contrast, efficiency is a global property, requiring that the allocations clear the available resources. For divisible resources, when the number of individuals of each type are known upfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable for a large class of utility functions. However, in an online setting when the number of individuals of each type are only revealed round by round, no policy can guarantee these desiderata simultaneously, and hence the best one can do is to try and allocate so as to approximately satisfy the two properties. We show that in the online setting, the two desired properties (envy-freeness and efficiency) are in direct contention, in that any algorithm achieving additive envy-freeness up to a factor of $L_T$ necessarily suffers an efficiency loss of at least $1 / L_T$. We complement this uncertainty principle with a simple algorithm, HopeGuardrail, which allocates resources based on an adaptive threshold policy. We show that our algorithm is able to achieve any fairness-efficiency point on this frontier, and moreover, in simulation results, provides allocations close to the optimal fair solution in hindsight. This motivates its use in practical applications, as the algorithm is able to adapt to any desired fairness efficiency trade-off.","Sinclair, Sean R.; Banerjee, Siddhartha; Yu, Christina Lee",,343,26

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. RESULTS: Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as meanâ¯±â¯standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39â¯±â¯18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32â¯±â¯6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were pâ¯<â¯0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were pâ¯<â¯0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients.

Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.","Zheng, Yongli; Xu, Hong; Yang, Ming; Zeng, Yilan; Chen, Hong; Liu, Ru; Li, Qingfeng; Zhang, Na; Wang, Dan",J Clin Virol,343,7

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.","Sabando, Mar'ia Virginia; Ulbrich, Pavol; Selzer, Mat'ias; Byvska, Jan; Mivcan, Jan; Ponzoni, Ignacio; Soto, Axel J.; Ganuza, Mar'ia Luj'an; Kozl'ikov'a, Barbora",,343,16

Here, we proposed a solution by designing a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 eraser strategy for eliminating potential contamination amplification. The CRISPR/Cas9 engineered eraser is firstly adopted into artpcr reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) system to achieve contamination-free RNA detection. Subsequently, we extended this CRISPR/Cas9 eraser to the PCR system. We engineered conventional PCR primers to enable the amplified products to contain an implanted NGG (protospacer adjacent motif, PAM) site, which is used as a code for specific CRISPR/Cas9 recognition. Pre-incubation of Cas9/sgRNA with PCR mix leads to a selective cleavage of contamination amplicons, thus only the template DNA is amplified. The developed CRISPR/Cas9 eraser, adopted by both RT-PCR and PCR systems, showed high-fidelity detection of SARS-CoV-2 and African swine fever virus with a convenient strip test.","Lin, Wei; Tian, Tian; Jiang, Yongzhong; Xiong, Erhu; Zhu, Debin; Zhou, Xiaoming",Biotechnol Bioeng,343,24

The present study investigated the effects of Mg++ supplementation on preventing CS-induced muscle atrophy in an animal model, which provided experimental data for potential clinical translation. METHODS: Twelve 24-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS methylprednisolone (MPS) to induce muscle atrophy, with half of the rats also given daily 50 mg/kg Mg++ oral supplementation. Additional six rats without LPS + CS treatments were used as normal controls. After treatment for 6 weeks, serum was collected for Mg++ quantification, animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for tissue composition, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was collected for muscle functional test and histology including muscle fiber size, intramuscular fat infiltration and fiber typing. In vitro myotube atrophy model was used to study the in vitro effect associated with in vivo muscle atrophy. RESULTS: LPS + CS treatments induced hypomagnesemia while the serum Mg++ level was in normal range after Mg++ supplementation. DXA showed 53.0% lower fat percent and 29.7% higher lean mass in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Muscle functional test showed 22.2% higher specific twitch force and 40.3% higher specific tetanic force in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of muscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that Mg++ supplementation group had larger myotube diameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in Mg++ supplementation group both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that Mg++ supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy. This study provided the evidence for the first time that Mg++ supplementation could prevent muscle atrophy-an adverse effect of CS therapy, currently also adopted for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Zheng, Lizhen; Huang, Le; Chen, Ziyi; Cui, Can; Zhang, Ri; Qin, Ling",Eur. j. nutr,343,24

However, vaccine hesitancy, fueled by exposure to social media misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines became a major hurdle. Therefore, it is essential to automatically detect where misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media is spread and what kind of misinformation is discussed, such that inoculation interventions can be delivered at the right time and in the right place, in addition to interventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing the first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the automatic detection of known misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the social media platform that has the highest volume of conversations about COVID-19 and its vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged relevant to several misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a novel method of detecting misinformation was developed. Our method organizes CoVaxLies in a Misinformation Knowledge Graph as it casts misinformation detection as a graph link prediction problem. The misinformation detection method detailed in this paper takes advantage of the link scoring functions provided by several knowledge embedding methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this method when compared with classification-based methods, widely used currently.","Weinzierl, Maxwell A.; Harabagiu, Sanda M.",,343,6

Specificity, sensitivity, promptness or scalability are the main parameters to estimate the final performance, but rarely all of them match in a single test. We have developed SCOVAM, a protein microarray with several viral antigens (spike, nucleocapsid, main protease Nsp5) as capturing probes in a fluorescence immunoassay for COVID‐19 serological testing. SCOVAM depicts IgG and IgM antibody responses against each of these proteins of 22 individuals in a single microscope slide. It detects specific IgM (0.094 μg ml‐1) and IgG (~0.017 μg ml‐1) and is scalable and cost‐effective. We validated SCOVAM by comparing with a widely used chemiluminescent commercial serological test (n = 742). SCOVAM showed twice the sensitivity and allowed following seroconversion in a single assay. By analysing the prevalence 4 months later in a subset of 76 positive sera, we still detected 93.42% of positives, almost doubling the detection of the commercial assay. The higher sensitivity of SCOVAM is especially relevant to screen sera for convalescent plasma‐based treatments, high‐throughput antibody response monitoring after vaccination or evaluation of vaccine efficiency.","David, Ruano‐Gallego Miriam García‐Villadangos Mercedes Moreno‐Paz Javier Gómez‐Elvira Postigo Marina María Simón‐Sacristán Reyburn Hugh T.; Carolis, Carlo Rodrigo Natalia Codeseira Yaiza B.; Rueda, Paloma Zúñiga Sonia Enjuanes Luis Parro Victor",Microbial Biotechnology,343,10

METHODS: We mined coronavirus-related tweets from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We classified tweets by the socioeconomic status of the county from which they originated with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We applied topic modeling to identify and monitor topics of concern over time. We investigated how topics varied by ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots. RESULTS: We identified 45 topics in 269,556 unique tweets. Topics shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle impacts in March. High-resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks and social distancing, while under-resourced areas shared negative expression and discussion of the CARES Act relief package. These differences were consistent within hotspots, with increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI hotspots. DISCUSSION: Topic modeling captures major concerns on Twitter in the early months of COVID-19. Our study extends previous Twitter-based research as it assesses how topics differ based on a marker of socioeconomic status. Comparisons between low and high-resourced areas indicate more focus on personal economic hardship in less-resourced communities and less focus on general public health messaging. CONCLUSION: Real-time social media analysis of community-based pandemic responses can uncover differential conversations correlating to local impact and income, education, and housing disparities. In future public health crises, such insights can inform messaging campaigns, which should partly focus on the interests of those most disproportionately impacted.","Su, Yihua; Venkat, Aarthi; Yadav, Yadush; Puglisi, Lisa B; Fodeh, Samah J",Comput Biol Med,343,16

By combining local data from a large urban private school system with national and international data on maintaining in-person learning during COVID-19 surges, Chicago believes in-person public education poses a low risk of transmission when the operational burden imposed by the second wave has subsided.","Fricchione, Marielle J; Seo, Jennifer Y; Arwady, M Allison",,343,1

Interaktion. Organisation. wird erfolgreiches Krisenmanagement als Weg von paradoxen Spannungen in der Krise zur Resilienz der Organisation beschrieben. Widersprüchliche und doch miteinander verbundene Interessen, Bedürfnisse und Anforderungen in der aktuellen COVID-19 Pandemie dienen als Beispiele. Das Modell betont die Rolle eines paradoxen Mindsets, welches Führungskräften, Entscheidern und Betroffenen ermöglicht, paradoxe Spannungen als solche zu erkennen, anzunehmen und die Chancen im „sowohl-als auch“ (im Gegensatz zu „entweder-oder“) zu finden. Das paradoxe Mindset fördert die Auseinandersetzung mit den Spannungen in einem wiederkehrenden Prozess des Sinnfindens und Sinnstiftens. Dieser Prozess stößt im Austausch mit den unterschiedlichen Stakeholdern die Entwicklung gemeinsamer „sowohl-als auch“ Denkmodelle, kreativer Herangehensweisen und schrittweisen Lernens an. Somit stärkt die paradoxe Sichtweise die Fähigkeit von Organisationen konstruktiv mit Herausforderungen umzugehen und diese in Chancen zu verwandeln – es macht sie resilienter.

The participants were 328 people aged between 19 and 59 years (M = 37.06;SD = 10.82). Females comprised 63.70% of the participants, and 36.30% were male. An associative, comparative and predictive design was used in this research. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Profile of Mood State (POMS), the state anxiety scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI) and the General Health Questionnaire GHQ−12 were applied in order to measure the study variables. Both correlation and linear regression analyses were performed, showing that physical activity is positively related to health perception and mood. Similarly, data have shown that moderate physical practice predicts better health perceptions and positive mood states than vigorous physical activity. Specifically, moderate physical activity is the only variable that predicts the anxiety state (R = 0.22;R2adjusted = 0.05;F = 15.51;p &lt;0.001). In addition, it has been detected that mood is related to the perception of the state of health. Outcomes suggest that practicing moderate physical activity during these types of situations could amortize its negative effects on psychological health and benefit a more positive mental state. Future studies should consider the employment status of the sample to detect possible differences based on this variable.","Reigal, Rafael E.; Páez-Maldonado, José A.; Pastrana-Brincones, José L.; Morillo-Baro, Juan P.; Hernández-Mendo, Antonio Morales-Sánchez Verónica",Sustainability,343,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 374 cervical lymph nodes from 67 patients were evaluated. The B-mode ultrasonography and the elastography findings were compared with the final histopathological diagnosis. Radiological variables were used to construct nomogram and clinical utility of the nomogram was cross-validated. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, status of the hilum, Long Axis Diameter, Short axis diameter, colour virtual touch imaging grade (VTI) and shear wave velocity were significant in predicting metastasis in the cervical lymph nodes. In multivariable analysis, it was found that predominance of red over yellow area on colour VTI was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. A multiple logistic regression performed to ascertain the effects of on the likelihood that patients had lymph node metastasis on histopathology was statistically significant, &#967;2(10) = 44.96, p < 0.001. The model was able to correctly classify 93.28% of cases and the concordance index (c-index) was estimated to be 0.8773. A nomogram was thus established to predict metastasis in cervical lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: ARFI increases the diagnostic accuracy of conventional USG in predicting metastatic lymph nodes in HNSCC. Adding the constructed nomogram to the conventional diagnostic pathway can provide an alternative option to frozen section and FNAC.","Sinha, Neetesh Kumar; Kohli, Pavneet Singh; Nagarajan, Krishnan; Gochhait, Debasis; Ganapathy, Sachit; Swamiappan, Elango; Ganesan, Sivaraman; Penumadu, Prasanth",Oral Oncol,343,19

The most likely links between the two are obesity-mediated systemic low-grade chronic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are all known to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and eventually diabetic nephropathy (DN). Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is an oligomer of chitosan prepared by the deacetylation of chitin commonly found in exoskeletons of crustaceans such as shrimp and crab as well as the cell walls of fungi. COS has various biological effects including lipid lowering, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes, and anti-oxidant effects. Therefore, COS is a potential new therapeutic agent for treatment of the obesity-induced DN condition. It is an abundant natural polymer and therefore freely available. This review includes information regarding the relationship between obesity, IR, T2DM, and DN as well as the potential usefulness of COS in controlling lipid and cholesterol metabolism, T2DM and kidney injury models in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However, evidence is limited regarding the effect of COS on the DN model.

With the ongoing health concerns related to COVID-19, there is an increased need for social workers who can competently deliver evidence-based interventions, such as SBIRT, via telehealth. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional SBIRT training approaches using face-to-face (FTF) instruction and FTF simulated practice may not be a safe or feasible way to develop students' SBIRT- related skills. This study explores 35 social work graduate students' experiences of learning SBIRT skills in a remote learning format and subsequently delivering a SBIRT intervention to a live ""client"" via a peer-to-peer simulated telehealth session. Overall, students reported that the shift from FTF to remote learning made learning SBIRT skills difficult, and that providing brief intervention and referral was the most difficult step of the simulated SBIRT telehealth intervention. Qualitative feedback indicates that overall, students found the simulated telehealth sessions a valuable learning experience, but also reported that richer educational experiences would have resulted from additional practice opportunities and real time feedback.

If the language used in video messages is not clear or understandable to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people with a high school degree or less, this can cause confusion and result in information gaps among DHH people during a health emergency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between DHH people's perception of the effectiveness of physical distancing and contagiousness of an asymptomatic person. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey study on DHH people's perceptions about COVID-19 (N=475). Items pertaining to COVID-19 knowledge were administered to US deaf adults from April 17, 2020, to May 1, 2020, via a bilingual American Sign Language/English online survey platform. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 475 DHH adults aged 18-88 years old, with 74% (n=352) identifying as White and 54% (n=256) as female. About 88% (n=418) of the sample felt they knew most things or a lot about physical distancing. This figure dropped to 72% (n=342) for the question about the effectiveness of physical distancing in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and 70% (n=333) for the question about the contagiousness of an infected person without symptoms. Education and a knowledge of the effectiveness of physical distancing significantly predicted knowledge about the contagiousness of an asymptomatic individual. Race, gender, and age did not emerge as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This results of this study point to the strong connection between education and coronavirus-related knowledge. Education-related disparities can be remedied by making information fully accessible and easily understood during emergencies and pandemics.","Paludneviciene, Raylene; Knight, Tracy; Firl, Gideon; Luttrell, Kaela; Takayama, Kota; Kushalnagar, Poorna",J Med Internet Res,343,16

This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014-2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient -0.02; P<0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient -0.30; P<0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient -0.18; P<0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Wagatsuma, Keita; Koolhof, Iain S; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Reiko",PLoS One,343,26

Later on, in 2012, the Middle-East respiratory syndrome spread in Saudi Arabia, caused by MERS-CoV. Currently, the global crisis is caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the same lineage of SARS-CoV. In response to the urgent need of diagnostic tools, several lab-based and biosensing techniques have been proposed so far. Five main areas have been individuated and discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The cell-culture detection and the microneutralization tests are still considered highly reliable methods. The genetic screening, featuring the well-established Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), represents the gold standard for virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. On the other side, immunoassays were developed, either by screening/antigen recognition of IgM/IgG or by detecting the whole virus, in blood and sera. Next, proteomic mass-spectrometry (MS)-based methodologies have also been proposed for the analysis of swab samples. Finally, virus-biosensing devices were efficiently designed. Both electrochemical immunosensors and eye-based technologies have been described, showing detection times lower than 10 min after swab introduction. Alternative to swab-based techniques, lateral flow point-of-care immunoassays are already commercially available for the analysis of blood samples. Such biosensing devices hold the advantage of being portable for on-site testing in hospitals, airports, and hotspots, virtually without any sample treatment or complicated lab precautions.","Hussein, Heba A; Hassan, Rabeay Y A; Chino, Marco; Febbraio, Ferdinando",,343,1

Challenges in healthcare access have driven a need for innovative approaches ensuring connectivity to health providers. Telehealth services and virtual clinics offer accessible disease management pathways for patients living in health resource limited areas or, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, where there may be potential barriers to existing healthcare resources. Those suffering with serious chronic disorders often cannot be seen by a healthcare specialist due to their limited availability, or the lack of a specialist within a reasonable proximity. Epilepsy represents such a disorder where most of the world's population lacks the availability of necessary specialists. Virtual clinics allow for specialist care and an ability to perform necessary ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring by placing the technologies directly in patients' homes or at local clinics near the patients' homes. By moving the diagnostic process out of the hospital or epilepsy center, it becomes possible to overcome growing gaps in neurology services.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on electronic survey data that was collected in Iraq during December first-19th, 2020. The electronic survey was designed using Qualtrics. HBM was followed to develop the survey items. A regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing people accepting vaccination. Thematic analysis for participant comments to an open-ended question. RESULTS: A total of 1680 completed surveys were received. The mean age of 31.2 ± 9.9 years, 53.0% were female and 47.0% were male. The largest group was HCWs (45.7%), followed by general population (37.5%) and health college students (16.8%). Our findings expressed some hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with the acceptance rate of 61.7%. The HCWs perceived significantly higher susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The HCWs were significantly more likely than the general population to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns with proper storage was the biggest barrier to vaccine receipt. The regression analysis indicated eight factors that were significantly associated with the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine: Preventive measures, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to action, subjective norm, supportive of vaccination in general and having received a flu vaccine before. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness campaign can focus on enhancing the vaccine perceived benefit, debunking misconceptions, and increasing the disease perceived severity. Additionally, the public health leaders need to minimize the perceived barriers by providing the vaccines and appeasing people concerns about their storage, effectiveness, and adverse events.","Al-Metwali, Basma Zuheir; Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Alag, Zahraa Adel; Sorofman, Bernard",J. eval. clin. pract.

With regard to antibody detection, 50/59 (84.75%) and 4/59 (6.78%) patients had positive IgG or dual positive IgG/IgM RDT results, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who had been quarantined and had subsequently recovered from COVID-19 had recurrent positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, and the possibility of transmission of the virus by recovered patients needs further investigation.

METHODS: In this pilot study, we report a series of 39 patients (66.5â¯± 9.2 years; 10.3% female) with acute encephalopathy, who underwent a standard brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5â¯T during the acute symptomatic phase. In addition to diffusion-weighted imaging, MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted images, high-resolution vascular black blood sequences (in 34 cases) were used to investigate the vasculature of the brain. RESULTS: In 29 out of 34 patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy (85%) with high-resolution vessel wall imaging, we found a circular enhancement and thickening of the basilar and vertebral arteries, without any correlation with ischemia or microbleeds (reported in 21% and 59%, respectively).

Due to this recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any homoplasies observed in SARS-CoV-2 to date are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral and primarily induced by the human immune system via RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation. At this stage we find no evidence for significantly more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.","van Dorp, Lucy; Richard, Damien; Tan, Cedric C S; Shaw, Liam P; Acman, Mislav; Balloux, François",Nat Commun,343,21

The number of samples and their randomization are among the various factors that may affect results. Current research aims to analyze and develop a technique for sample collecting in fish pond through the evaluation of the effects of the sample number on the variability of results obtained. A fry pond at the Fish culture Station of the State University of Maringá/Codapar, located in the district of Floriano, Maringá city, Paraná State, Brazil, was used. Whereas samples were collected in nine sites within the pond, according to the square division method, in a randomized imaginary S, a sample comprising 10 simple samples was randomly collected for comparison with the pond original soil at its margin. The main chemical characteristics of the original soil and of the pond sediments in the samples were determined. Highest variation coefficients among the characteristics were phosphorus and carbon; soil pH showed the lowest coefficient. It has been found that a representative sample, at 5% level, could be obtained from seven randomly collected simple samples at a 20% variation of the correct average.

During the first wave, in May 2020, the maximums of the 7-day average daily deaths per population of Amazonas and Pará were similar: 15.7 and 17.1 deaths per day per million people, respectively, which means a ratio 15.7/17.1 = 0.92 &#8776; 1. Now, in the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak, Amazonas has entered a serious situation; meanwhile, Pará has presented a much smaller growth in the mortality. The accumulated mortality per population from 11 November 2020 to 15 March 2021 of Amazonas and Pará are 1645 and 296 deaths per million people, respectively. As 1645/296 = 5.55, Amazonas is presenting an accumulated mortality per population more than five times that of Pará. Future in-depth research can provide a grounded answer to explain this significant difference, nonetheless the explicit support of the Pará state government, after 21 May 2020, to early ambulatory treatment may have played some role on this result.","Emmerich, Francisco G",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),343,21

In designing global health security solutions, ‘…simple, quick fix solutions that flounder in the face of interconnectedness, volatility and uncertainty’ (Jackson in Critical Systems Thinking and the Management of Complexity. John Wiley and Sons, NJ, 2019 [1]) will not suffice and may create unintended consequences. For example, recent years have seen the threat presented by bio-risks heighten significantly. Infectious disease emergencies have included Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika and now COVID-19. These outbreaks have had significant global and public health impact. Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, as of January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen upwards of 100 million cases, 2.1 million deaths, and has significantly impacted the global economy and affected the most vulnerable. The impacts have seen the closure of borders, economic disruptions and failures, strained and overwhelmed health care systems, failure of supply chains, all of which are contributing to a human and national security issue. Sensemaking is the activity that enables us to turn the ongoing complexity of the world into a ‘situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action’ (Weick et al. in Organ Sci 16:409–421, 2005 [2]). The importance of sensemaking as it pertains to individual and public health is that it enables us to plan, design and take action in real-time to events that affect or ‘shock’ our health and healthcare system. With advances in technology over the last decade, from robust cloud infrastructures, to artificial intelligence, to wearable devices, personalized health interventions are becoming increasingly accurate, accessible, and prevalent. As part of this shift, there has been a growing movement in the field of public health to include personalized medicine as an integrative element of public health which would have the potential to radically transform its methods and character (Evangelatos et al. in Int J Public Health 63:433–434, 2018 [3]). This is changing the landscape as it pertains to health ‘sensemaking’ at the individual and public health level.

PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29 ± 12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4 ± 10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13 ± 0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1 ± 1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR.

METHODS: This review is based on guidelines, reviews, meta-analyses, selected publications, and the authors' own experiences from everyday clinical practice. RESULTS: Most patients want frank information from their physicians about their condition at all times over the course of their treatment, from the moment of diagnosis to the end of their life. This has no lasting adverse effects, but rather enables patients to take decisions that are appropriate to their stage of disease. Early integration in palliative care can improve patients' quality of life, symptom control, and mood. In helping to manage the last phase of life, the physician often serves as a provider of impulses, or else determines which other types of professional should counsel or support the patient. Patients should be enabled to issue directives that reflect their wishes, as well as to choose representatives who are allowed to speak for them. Consideration should also be given to the patient's emotional legacy, e.g., letters or video messages with personal content. CONCLUSION: In the care of patients with life-limiting diseases, more attention should be paid to the management of the last phase of life. Palliative-care physicians can take over this task from other medical disciplines, and early integration in palliative care is recommended.","Welsch, Katja; Gottschling, Sven",Dtsch Arztebl Int,343,26

While the development of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are ongoing, government authorities in China have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions as primary barriers to curb the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the decline of COVID-19 cases coincided with the implementation of such interventions, we searched for evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, since artifactual factors, such as the environment, the pathogen itself, and the phases of epidemic, may also alter the patterns of case development. METHODS: We surveyed common viral respiratory infections that have a similar pattern of transmission, tropism, and clinical manifestation, as COVID-19 under a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the current pandemic season. We then compared this data with historical data from previous seasons without such interventions. RESULTS: Our survey showed that the rates of common respiratory infections, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, decreased dramatically from 13.7% (95% CI, 10.82-16.58) and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.88-7.64) in previous years to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.02-1.44) and 0.0%, respectively, in the current season.

Until recently, this infection in humans was mainly observed during the autumn-winter period and characterized by a mild, often asymptomatic, course. The situation changed dramatically in 2003, when SARS outbreak caused by pathogenic CoV (SARS-CoV) was recorded in China. A decade later, a new CoV outbreak occurred in the form of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), whereas in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases were recorded, which transformed within the first months of 2020 into the pandemic. In all three cases, CoV disease led to severe bronchopulmonary lesions, varying from dry, debilitating cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). At the same time, multiple changes in innate immunity were noted most often manifested as a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the lower respiratory tract, featured by damaged type II pneumocytes, apoptosis, hyalinization of alveolar membranes, focal or generalized pulmonary edema. Destructive processes in the respiratory tract were accompanied by migration of monocytes/macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils to the inflammatory focus. Such events were accompanied by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which magnitude could ascend up to a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV is characterized by symptoms of secondary immunosuppression, manifested by the late onset of interferon production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes – the key inflammatory factor. The reason for such reaction may be accounted for by CoV arsenal containing extensive set of structural and non-structural proteins exerting pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Delayed IFN production allowed CoV to replicate actively and freely, and when type I IFN synthesis was eventually triggered, its activity was detrimental and accompanied by an aggravated infection course. Thus, SARS can surely be referred to immune-dependent infections with a marked immunopathological component. The purpose of this review was to describe some mechanisms underlying formation of innate immune response to infection caused by pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Smirnov, V.

Based on a variety of data including meteorological, traffic, and industrial manufacturing datasets, statistical methods were combined with spatial analysis to evaluate changes in air pollution and associated human impacts during each stage. In addition, suggestions are made for further regional air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Key results are as follows:â Overall, the AQI and the concentrations of six air pollutants, especially SO2, PM10, and NO2, were lower during control period than during the equivalent period in 2019 (reductions of 26.5%, 24.3%, and 16.9%, respectively). From the before to later stages, pollutants (except O3) showed a downward trend while O3 increased significantly during the before stage (by 76.2%) and the growth rate slowed during the middle and later stages; â¡During the prior stage, Beijing experienced two periods with heavy air pollution days as a result of the local accumulation of pollutants, secondary transformation, and regional transport. The concentration of PM2.5 in February was nearly 60% lower than in February 2014 under similar meteorological conditions in Beijing; â¢ Following an increase in traffic volume and industrial activity, changes in air pollutants tended to be stable or slightly increase during the middle and later stages of the control period. The grey relation coefficients between thermal radiation intensity anomalies and the main pollutants in heavy industrial cities were greater than 0.6, which means that the control of industrial emissions remains key to controlling air pollution.","Zhao, Xue; Shen, Nan-Chi; Li, Ling-Jun; Wu, Gao-Feng; Tao, Jing; Zhao, Wen-Ji",Huan Jing Ke Xue,343,20

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","Sun, Chuan-Bin; Wang, Yue-Ye; Liu, Geng-Hao; Liu, Zhe",Front Public Health,343,16

Therefore, technological developments cause changes in all areas of education systems. These changes affect the quality and functions of art education directly and indirectly. In this study, visual arts teachers' attitudes towards distance teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated. For this purpose, the attitudes towards distance education were examined by gender, age and school type variables. The study, which was carried out in the survey model, was carried out with 165 visual arts teachers working in public and private secondary and high schools in Konya, Aksaray, Karaman and Nigde provinces. Distance education attitude scale was used to collect the research data. Findings revealed that visual arts teachers' attitudes towards distance education were generally negative.

infectious outbreaks, older adults are also vulnerable to mental and physical health risks due to increased social isolation Studies on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly emerging, with reviews focused on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, or mixed samples of healthcare workers, patient populations, and community-dwelling individuals However, recent reviews of mental health during COVID-19 have failed to focus on findings in the geriatric population This review provides a scope of the current literature on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in the general population, with a geriatric lens, by examining older adults' representation across studies and the pandemic's impact on older adults’ mental health Methods The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist was used as the methodological framework to conduct the review A review of the literature on the topic was conducted through PubMed and https://www medrxiv org/ from January 1st, 2020 to June 1st, 2020 Studies were included if they (i) focused on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) used validated measures of psychological or psychiatric symptomatology;(iii) included samples of the general population or in which they comprised the majority;(iv) reported quantitative outcomes of prevalence (expressed as the percentage of participants that exceed the cut-off for normal on the measures) Excluded were (i) opinion papers or commentaries without prevalence data;(ii) studies that reported qualitative data or population means only;(iii) studies with samples of primarily healthcare workers (i e , the entire or &gt;50% of the sample were healthcare workers), (iv) studies with patient samples such as those with confirmed or probable COVID-19 infection, clinic or hospitalized patients, or pregnant women Fifty-six full-text articles were included in the review, with 33 published articles and 23 pre-print articles Results Cross-sectional designs were employed by all 56 studies that met the inclusion criteria The results pooled across the studies showed that 1 in 3 individuals across all age groups endorses post-traumatic stress symptoms, while approximately 30% experience depression, anxiety, and overall stress Amongst available data in older adults 60 years of age or older, anxiety rates were comparable to the overall population (30 2%), while the prevalence of depression was higher, with nearly 1 in 3 older adults experiencing clinically significant depression symptoms Effects of age on mental health outcomes are mixed, with several studies showing that the risk or severity of psychiatric symptoms may be lower in older adults In contrast, others show the opposite pattern or no effect of age The current literature on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic has two important methodological limitations The first is that the cross-sectional design in all reviewed studies does not permit firm conclusions regarding whether the current reported prevalence rates can be attributed to the onset of the pandemic or whether they represent a change from baseline A second limitation is that all studies reviewed typically assessed mental health outcomes using self-report measures completed by anonymous responders in online surveys No studies included follow-up assessments, and none conducted clinical or psychiatric interviews to confirm the presence of clinically significant psychiatric symptomatology or to establish a diagnosis Self-report measures are used as screening tools in psychological research, but there are limitations to relying on scale scores to establish clinical significance Conclusions Overall, nearly 1 in 3 individuals have experienced negative effects on mental health during COVID-19, a figure that exceeds rates reported in front-line healthcare workers Paradoxically, some studies report that older age may be a protective factor against psychiatric symptoms, but this is based on a limited number of studies Our main recommendations for future research include: (i) the use of longitudinal study designs to permit assessment of change in mental health and to yield more definitive conclusions regarding the impact of the pandemic on mental health, and (ii) ensuring a wider representation of older adults through the use of methods, other than online survey platforms, to assess mental health More high-quality data is needed to understand the pandemic's effects on the general population's mental health, which can inform public health and social policy decisions aimed at alleviating these burdens during the pandemic Funding The study was funded by the Ontario

However, this led to more caution, which may lead to xenophobia. Via ethnography, this study unmasks the xenophobic attitude. This research discusses the root causes of panic in the community so that remedies can be implemented. The research attempts to explain, from a socio-anthropological viewpoint, how people and religious groups in the village perceive the pandemic of COVID-19 based on their belief in their faith and in the science. The research takes place in Cigagak village, an area of approximately 7000 m2 on the outskirts of Bandung of West Java of Indonesia. This study examines the selected respondents (20 respondents as the samples) from about 190 inhabitants (as the population) who had close ties to managing places of worship (mosques) and public places. This study utilises a collaborative self-ethnographic method and qualitative analysis. The influence of COVID-19 has moved to new exclusive and disintegrating practices from the inclusion-cohesive religious tradition. Therefore, this study tries to find out ways on how to reduce exclusive perception and religious practices to a minimum level and how to disappear xenophobia. Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, inclusive awareness and actions were re-established, and even social cohesiveness was fostered. This study concludes that in its deep conviction nature, theology can change exclusive behaviour to be inclusive if it is based on the religious principles that are raised in response to human events. In this case, the Muslim community in a village can change the fear of COVID-19 pandemic to be a reducer of the panic based on the support of the religious doctrines. Contribution: This article used a collaborative self-ethnography with a religious socio-anthropological viewpoint. This study could help to solve social problems through theological convergence in Islamic milieu, especially that of the government’s formal Islamic organisation and organic Islamic leaders of the society. © 2021.

Patients who contracted the disease presented with different phenotypes.Multiple reports have described the findings of pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema on computed tomography (CT) scans of these patient. Research Question:To describe the incidence and management of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema related to COVID-19 found on radiologic imaging. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all confirmed Covid-19 patients admitted between early March to mid May to two hospitals in New York City. Patient demographics, radiological imaging and clinical courses, were documented. Results:Between early March and mid May, a total of 1970 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the two hospitals included in the study. 65/386 intubated patients developed the study specific complications, for an overall incidence of 16.8%;36 developed pneumothorax, 2 patients developed pneumomediastinum, 1 had subcutaneous emphysema and 26 had a combination of both. 87.5% were men and (age 28 to 81). Distribution of comorbidities included: hypertension (55.2%), diabetes(35.7%) , morbid obesity (21.5%) , underlying respiratory disease (12.5%) while 14.3% had no comorbidities. Average duration of intubation was 14 days (0-46). Mean highest PEEP within 72 hours of complication was 11 cmH220 (5-24). Mean highest peak inspiratory pressure within 72 hours of complication was 35.3 cmH2O (17-52). Incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax was 0.45%. Discussion:To our knowledge, this is the largest series of patients documenting these complications in the COVID-19 population. Given a mean duration of 14 days, it is theorized that it is the progression of the inflammation and lung destruction results in cyst development that are prone to rupture. Low lung compliance and high BMI leading to restrictive lung disease and higher peak airway pressures, and the need for high PEEP due to severe hypoxia, likely contributed to a higher incidence of these complications. In comparison to our intubated patients, there were no identifiable risk factors in our patients with spontaneous complications. Most of our patients had a pigtail catheter placed, however patients with small pneumothoraces with no hemodynamically instability were managed conservatively with a higher FiO2 concentration to help with re-absorption. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are high risk for pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema both while intubated and spontaneously. These should be considered in differential diagnosis of shortness of breath or hypoxia in a patient with new diagnosis COVID-19 or worsening hemodynamics in an ICU setting.","Abdelghany, Y.; Rachmasari, K.; Alvarez-Mulett, S.

VL was determined using quantitative PCR and log10 transformed for normalization. Associations were tested with univariate and multivariate regression models. Diagnostic VL was significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in patients not hospitalized (log10 VL = 3.3 versus 4.0; P = 0.018) after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, and comorbidities.

The authors own experience with autopsy neuropathology in CoVID-19 patients is also described. There is a particular paucity of data regarding the histopathology of the eye. However, it is likely that the ocular surface is a potential site for inoculation and the tears a source of spread of viral particles.

While data on safety is increasingly available, evidence for efficacy is still sparse. Subgroup analyses hint to a dose-response relationship between convalescent plasma neutralizing antibody levels and mortality. In particular, patients with primary and secondary antibody deficiency might benefit from this approach. However, testing of neutralizing antibodies is limited to specialized biosafety level 3 laboratories and is a time- and labor-intense procedure. In this single center study of 206 COVID-19 convalescent patients, clinical data, results of commercially available ELISA testing of SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG and -IgA, and levels of neutralizing antibodies, determined by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT), were analyzed. At a medium time point of 58 days after symptom onset, only 12.6% of potential plasma donors showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies (PRNT50 &#8805; 1:320). Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression analysis revealed need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (odds ratio 6.87; p-value 0.0004) and fever (odds ratio 3.00; p-value 0.0001) as leading factors affecting levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors. Using penalized estimation, a predictive proportional odds logistic regression model including the most important variables hospitalization, fever, age, sex, and anosmia or dysgeusia was developed.

This research aimed to develop a conceptual disease model describing STGD symptoms and their impact on patients' lives. Material and Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients (juvenile and adult) and parents of children and adolescents with STGD. Interviewed subjects were enrolled through ophthalmologists from specialized eye centers in the USA and in France. Trained interviewers used semi-structured techniques to elicit concepts relevant to patients and their parents. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts led to the identification of concepts which were organized to generate a disease model. Results: A total of 21 patients (12 in the US; 9 in France) - 14 adults, 7 juveniles - and 7 parents were interviewed. The most cited ocular symptoms were photosensitivity and central vision decline. Interviewees reported limitations on Physical (e.g. difficulty with sports/physical activities), Mental (e.g. frustration and worry, reduced ability to concentrate), Social (e.g. issue with facial recognition and difficulty discussing disease) and Role (e.g. impact on driving and reading, difficulties at school/work) functioning. These impacts were, when possible, mitigated by coping strategies and support (e.g. using electronic devices, setting up routines or accepting the disease). Conclusions: This research provides an overview of symptoms experienced by patients with STGD and highlights the dramatic impact these have on patients' lives, allowing the identification of concepts of importance when evaluating new therapeutic options for STGD.","Roborel de Climens, Aude; Tugaut, Béatrice; Dias Barbosa, Carla; Buggage, Ronald; Brun-Strang, Catherine",Ophthalmic Genet,343,1

Our results, based on the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for the data from 21 January 2020, to 26 February 2021, indicate that the COVID-19 cases significantly and negatively impact all the endogenous variables such as Baltic dry index (BDI), MSCI world index (MSCI), and MSCI world energy index (MSCIE). Our results also reveal that of the three variables, the stock markets indices (MSCI and MSCIE) are comparatively more affected by COVID-19 cases. The findings imply that the stock markets are more sensitive to the COVID-19 pandemic than the real economy. The results further indicate that of the three variables, the MSCIE index is the most affected by COVID-19 due to two factors: one is the dwindling power consumption caused by COVID-19 and the other is the decline in oil price because of the Russia–OPEC price war. Our findings enhance the understanding of the spillover impacts of the global health crisis on economic activity, the stock market, and the energy sector. Moreover, our study offers insights for policymakers and governments into the relationship dynamics of COVID-19 that would help them be more cautious in taking preventive measures against the health crisis to save the economy, the stock market, and the energy sector from falling into a more deepened crisis.","Hasan, Md.

In this study, we aimed to assess this by evaluating the relationship between sP-Selectin level and the clinical severity of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: A total of 80 patients (50 with mild to moderate and 30 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia), and 60 non-symptomatic healthy volunteers participated in the study. Following serum isolation, sP-Selectin levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: The serum sP-Selectin level was 1.7 ng/ml in the control group (1-3.78); 6.24 ng/ml (5.14-7.23) in mild-to-moderate pneumonia group; and 6.72 ng/ml (5.36-8.03) in the severe pneumonia group. Serum sP-Selectin levels in both mild-to-moderate pneumonia and severe pneumonia groups were found to be higher than the control group, with statistical significance (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) showed greater area under the curve (AUC) for the serum sP-Selectin levels of the COVID-19 patients (AUC = 0.913, 95% CI = 0.857-0.969; p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 97.5% sensitive and 80% specific at 4.125 ng/ml level for diagnosis (p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 76.9% sensitive and 51.9% specific at the level of 6.12 ng/ml (p = 0.005) to predict the need for intensive care treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed that sP-Selectin can be used as a valuable biomarker in both diagnosing and predicting the need for intensive care treatment of COVID-19 infection.","Karsli, Emre; Sabirli, Ramazan; Altintas, Emel; Canacik, Omer; Sabirli, Gizem Tukenmez; Kaymaz, Buse; Kurt, Özgür; Koseler, Aylin",Life Sci,343,20

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. RESULTS: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection. Post-test clinical evaluation of each patient is advised to ensure that rtRT-PCR results are not the only factor in excluding COVID-19.","Kanji, Jamil N; Zelyas, Nathan; MacDonald, Clayton; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Khan, Muhammad Naeem; Prasad, Abhaya; Hu, Jia; Diggle, Mathew; Berenger, Byron M; Tipples, Graham",Virol J,343,23

Four nursing and eight medical students (n = 12) supplied photographs and commentary documenting the experience of withdrawing suddenly from clinical sites in rural Alberta. Collaborative, thematic analysis revealed continuities between pre- and post-outbreak life, both for the students and their rural hosts. Social determinants of health such as seclusion, environmental hazards, and health-seeking behaviors carried over and compounded the effects of the outbreak on the placement communities and clinical sites. Other continuities included the reliance on technology for clinical and social connectivity, and capitalizing on natural settings to cope with isolation and confinement. Prolonged liminality, lack of closure, and the loss of team identity were the greatest stressors brought on by the suspension of clinical activities.

Commentaries explore the political and economic drivers and effects of neoliberal ideology, and critique the impact on higher education and academic work. The impact on the health and well-being of academic staff has had less attention, and it is to that we turn in this paper. Much academic interest in neoliberalism stems from the UK, Australia and the United States. We draw particularly on studies of public Irish universities, where neoliberalism, now well entrenched, but something of a late-comer to the new public management party, is making its presence felt. This conceptual paper explores the concept of neoliberalism in higher education, arguing that the policies and practices of new public management as exercised in universities are a form of bullying;what we term institutional bullying. The authors are researchers of workplace culture, workplace bullying and incivility. Irish universities are increasingly challenged in delivering the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principles of decent work, i.e., dignity, equity, fair income and safe working conditions. They have become exposed in terms of gender imbalance in senior positions, precariat workforce, excessive workload and diminishing levels of control. Irish universities are suffering in terms of both the health and well-being of staff and organisational vibrancy. The authors conclude by cautioning against potential neoliberal intensification as universities grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chest sonography has long been an important part of ultrasound diagnostics. Historically, the first evidence found in chest sonography were pleural effusions. Peripheral consolidations (pneumonia, tumors, pulmonary embolism) and pneumothorax were added later. The COVID-19 pandemic with often massive lung infestation has significantly increased the interest in thoracic sonography.

Few days later, new cases are notified, followed by deaths. The government decided to adopt large-scale drastic measures against the epidemic. This study aims to describe and analyse the COVID-19 distribution in Morocco, according to key measures taken to curb this health problem. Methods: an observational study of all cases daily reported by the Ministry of Health of Morocco from 02 March to 05 May 2020, was carried out. A mapping was performed. Results: before the implementation of the state of health emergency, 86 confirmed cases out of 471 biological examinations carried out have been reported and the highest cumulative incidence (0.43 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) was recorded in Fes-Meknes region. During the 1st quarantine, 2,960 positive cases out of 15,915 examinations carried out have been detected. Marrakech-Safi region was the most affected (15.33 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Halfway through extended quarantine, 2,173 confirmed cases out of 49,570 biological examinations realized have been notified, the highest cumulative incidence has observed in Draa-Tafilalet region (27.45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The highest mortality was observed in Marrakech-Safi region (1.05 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and the highest case fatality rate (13.46%) was registered in Souss-Massa region. Conclusion: the strategy adopted by Morocco has enabled it to avoid a health catastrophe. But, it’s not over yet. Morocco should continue the massive efforts and reinforce the existing measures against the virus, especially in regions very affected by the epidemic.","Hadrya, Fatine; Soulaymani, Abdelmajid; El Hattimy, Faiçal",Pan Afr.

Medical practitioners of all specialties are being assigned to treat patients of COVID-19. In this article, two authors (T.V. and N.G.) from the Department of Neurosurgery who were deployed in the COVID-19 testing ward between April 25 and May 31, 2020 share their experience. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted including all those who were admitted in this ward. The patients were studied according to their demographic profiles, diagnoses, admitting departments, travel history, and presence/absence of COVID-19-related symptoms. Relevant history regarding occupation, contact with patient with known COVID-19, and comorbid illness was noted. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied further. The data from the institute's official record were updated until August 14, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 256 admissions in the ward, of whom 148 (92 male, 56 female) were patients and 108 were patients' attendants/relatives. Most patients were admitted under the departments of internal medicine (33, 22.3%) and general surgery (19, 12.8%). Of 148 patients, 46 (31.1%) were admitted as they were planned for a surgery/intervention. Among 148 patients, 29 (19.6%) had history of travel to or were residents of a red zone, 4 (2.7%) had history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, whereas 6 (4.1%) were health care workers. One hundred four patients (70.2%) showed no COVID-19-related symptoms. Thirty-four patients (22.9%) had associated comorbid conditions. Eight patients (5 male, 3 female) with mean age of 37.6 years (range 4-69 years) tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The authors share their experience and their institute's protocol in various facets during this war against COVID-19 pandemic.

Anecdotal evidence and clinical observation suggest that there is a decrease in the number of patients presenting with stroke during the pandemic. We aim to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of stroke emergency services on a single comprehensive stroke center (CSC). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database and compared all emergency department (ED) encounters, acute stroke admissions (including TIA), and thrombectomy cases admitted in March 2017-2019 to patients admitted in March 2020 at a comprehensive stroke center. RESULTS: Number of total ED encounters (22%, p=0.005), acute ischemic strokes (40%, p=0.001), and TIAs (60%, p=0.163) decreased between March of 2017-2019 compared to March of 2020. The number of patients undergoing EVT in March 2020 was comparable to March 2017-2019 (p=0.430). CONCLUSION: A pandemic-related stay-at-home policy reduces the utilization of stroke emergency services at a CSC. This effect appears to be more prominent for ED encounters, all stroke admissions and TIAs, and less impactful for severe strokes. Given the relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 cases in our region, this decrement is likely related to healthcare seeking behavior rather than capacity saturation.","Desai, Shashvat M; Guyette, Francis X; Martin-Gill, Christian; Jadhav, Ashutosh P",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,343,20

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020). RESULTS: A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (r = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (r = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (r = -0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45). CONCLUSIONS: We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State. Social determinants of health, such as occupation, housing, healthcare access, and community structure, may contribute to health disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Targeted capture of these variables in electronic health records is warranted to inform health equity analyses.","Pflugeisen, Bethann Mangel; Mou, Jin",Ethn Health,343,14

The possibility that PV may facilitate the transport of exhaled pathogens was explored by performing experiments with droplets and applying PV to a source or/and a target manikin. The risk of direct and indirect exposure to droplets in the inhalation zone of the target was estimated, with these exposure types defined according to their different origins. The infection risk of influenza A, a typical disease transmitted via air, was predicted based on a dose-response model. Results showed that the flow interactions between PV and the infectious exhaled flow would facilitate airborne transmission between occupants in two ways. First, application of PV to the source caused more than 90% of indirect exposure of the target. Second, entrainment of the PV jet directly from the infectious exhalation increased direct exposure of the target by more than 50%. Thus, these scenarios for different PV application modes indicated that continuous exposure to exhaled influenza A virus particles for 2 h would correspond with an infection probability ranging from 0.28 to 0.85. These results imply that PV may protect against infection only when it is maintained with a high ventilation efficiency at the inhalation zone, which can be realized by reduced entrainment of infectious flow and higher clean air volume. Improved PV design methods that could maximize the positive effects of PV on disease control in the human microenvironment are discussed.","Xu, Chunwen; Wei, Xiongxiong; Liu, Li; Su, Li; Liu, Wenbing; Wang, Yi; Nielsen, Peter V.",Build.

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections.

From August 7-16, 2020, nearly 500,000 motorcycle enthusiasts converged on Sturgis, South Dakota for its annual rally in an environment without mask-wearing requirements or other mitigating policies. This study is the first to explore this event's public health impacts. First, using anonymized cell phone data, we document that foot traffic at restaurants/bars, retail establishments, and entertainment venues rose substantially at event locations. Stay-at-home behavior among local residents fell. Second, using a synthetic control approach, we find that the COVID-19 case rate increased substantially in Meade County and in the state of South Dakota in the month following the Rally. Finally, using a difference-in-differences model to assess nationwide spread, we find that following the Sturgis event, counties outside of South Dakota that contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 6.4-12.5% increase in COVID-19 cases relative to counties without inflows. Our findings highlight that local policy decisions assessing the tradeoff between local economic benefits and COVID-19 health costs will not be socially optimal in the presence of large contagion externalities.","Dave, Dhaval; McNichols, Drew; Sabia, Joseph J",Southern economic journal,343,26

Methods This single-center, retrospective study included a total of 401 patients admitted to our study center between October 2019 and July 2020. The patients who were admitted before March 1, 2020, were considered the pre-March group, and those who were admitted after March 1, 2020, were considered the post-March group. According to their age, the patients were further divided into groups as those aged ≤18 years and those aged &gt;18 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, burn agent, burn surface area, COVID-19 status, and treatment and follow-up data were recorded. Results Our study results showed no significant difference in the number of patient admission, age, and sex of patients, burn agents and length of hospital stay before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions Burn centers can work safely in COVID-19 outbreak, paying special attention to precautions mandated by the national and global health authorities. However, the increase in pandemic burden may force the burn centers to be converted into alternate COVID-19 facilities. In such cases, the care of burn patients may pose a great problem.","Dayı, Sabriye Beyeç Selma Alpağat Şeyhmus",Burns Open,343,14

COVID-19 patients display a wide variety of symptoms and clinical outcomes, including those attributed to genetic ancestry. Alu retrotransposons have played an important role in human evolution, and their variants influence host response to viral infection. Intronic Alus regulate gene expression through several mechanisms, including both genetic and epigenetic pathways. With respect to SARS-CoV-2, an intronic Alu within the ACE gene is hypothesized to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and morbidity. Here, we review specific Alu polymorphisms that are of particular interest when considering host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially polymorphic Alu insertions in genes associated with immune response and coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade. We posit that additional research focused on Alu-related pathways could yield novel biomarkers capable of predicting clinical outcomes as well as patient-specific treatment strategies for COVID-19 and related infectious diseases.","Li, Manci; Schifanella, Luca; Larsen, Peter A",Hum Genomics,343,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.","Kola, Lola; Kohrt, Brandon A; Hanlon, Charlotte; Naslund, John A; Sikander, Siham; Balaji, Madhumitha; Benjet, Corina; Cheung, Eliza Yee Lai; Eaton, Julian; Gonsalves, Pattie; Hailemariam, Maji; Luitel, Nagendra P; Machado, Daiane B; Misganaw, Eleni; Omigbodun, Olayinka; Roberts, Tessa; Salisbury, Tatiana Taylor; Shidhaye, Rahul; Sunkel, Charlene; Ugo, Victor; van Rensburg, André Janse; Gureje, Oye; Pathare, Soumitra; Saxena, Shekhar; Thornicroft, Graham; Patel, Vikram",Lancet Psychiatry,343,10

After the first alert message from the local healthcare service, a series of drastic measures were taken at our outpatient clinic to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this retrospective study, all consecutive cancer outpatients completed a baseline SARS-CoV­2 test via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 15 March to 26 May 2020. In the later phase, after the peak of the pandemic, patients as well as healthcare workers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV­2 IgG antibodies. RESULTS: Between 15 March and 26 May 2020, 0.78% (Nâ¯= 5/640) cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV­2 by RT-PCR. Between 22 June and 17 July 2020, anti-SARS-CoV­2 IgG antibodies were detected in 2 out of 250 (0.8%) cancer patients and 2 out of 36 (5.5%) healthcare workers. In only 1 out of 4 cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, could SARS-CoV­2 antibodies be detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the majority of our patients and healthcare workers had not been infected with SARS-CoV­2 and rapidly implemented measures were effective. Maintenance of preventive measures should be continued until vaccines or specific treatments are available.","Fong, Dominic; San Nicolò, Katja Olga; Alber, Monika; Mitterer, Manfred",Wien. klin.

Meanwhile, the virus is sweeping all around the world and has infected millions of people. Fever and pulmonary symptoms have been noticed as major and early signs of infection, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were also observed in a significant portion of patients. The clinical investigation of disease onset was underestimated, especially due to the neglection of cases presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. AIM To characterize the clinical features of coronavirus-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms as initial symptoms. METHODS This is a retrospective, single-center case series of the general consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Union Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 13, 2020. According to their initial symptoms, these patients were classified into two groups. Patients in group one presented with pulmonary symptoms (PS) as initial symptoms, and group two presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (GS). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected for analysis. RESULTS Among the 50 patients recruited, no patient has been admitted to intensive care units, and no patient died during the study. The duration of hospitalization was longer in the GS group than in the PS group (12.13 ± 2.44 vs 10.00 ± 2.13, P &lt; 0.01). All of the 50 patients exhibited decreased lymphocytes. However, lymphocytes in the GS group were significantly lower compared to those in the PS group (0.94 ± 0.06 vs 1.04 ± 0.15, P &lt; 0.01). Procalcitonin and hs-CRP were both significantly higher in the GS group than in the PS group. Accordingly, the duration of viral shedding was significantly longer in the GS group compared to the PS group (10.22 ± 1.93 vs 8.15 ± 1.87, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms as initial symptoms need more days of viral shedding and hospitalization than the patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms.","Yang, Tuo-Yun; Li, Yuan-Chao; Wang, Si-Cong; Dai, Qing-Qing; Jiang, Xue-Song; Zuo, Shu; Jia, Liu; Zheng, Jun-Bo; Wang, Hong-Liang",World J.

While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider an assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naïve, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naïve and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naïve, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naïve group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naïve following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Clark, Andrew E; Markantonis, John; Green, Allen; Xu, Jing; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Alexis, Charles; Fankhauser, Kimberly; Parikh, Hiren; Wilkinson, Kathleen; Reczek, Annika; Kopplin, Noa; Yekkaluri, Sruthi; Balani, Jyoti; Thomas, Abey; Singal, Amit G; Sarode, Ravi; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",J. clin. microbiol,343,6

Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein cross-linking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3' segment of the product RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product RNA 3' end frays and enters the NTP entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking.

This unprecedented pandemic outbreak pressingly necessitated the trans-disciplinary approach in developing novel/new anti-COVID-19 drugs especially, small molecule inhibitors targeting the seminal proteins of viral etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the traditional medicinal knowledge, we made an attempt through molecular docking analysis to explore the phytochemical constituents of three most commonly used Indian herbs in 'steam inhalation therapy' against well recognized viral receptor proteins. RESULTS: A total of 57 phytochemicals were scrutinized virtually against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE-2, spike glycoprotein and RdRp. Providentially, two bioactives from each of the three plants i.e. apigenin-o-7-glucuronide and ellagic acid from Eucalyptus globulus; eudesmol and viridiflorene from Vitex negundo and; vasicolinone and anisotine from Justicia adhatoda were identified to be the best hit lead molecules based on interaction energies, conventional hydrogen bonding numbers and other non-covalent interactions. On comparison with the known SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor -lopinavir and RdRp inhibitor -remdesivir, apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was found to be a phenomenal inhibitor of both protease and polymerase, as it strongly interacts with their active sites and exhibited remarkably high binding affinity. Furthermore, in silico drug-likeness and ADMET prediction analyses clearly evidenced the usability of the identified bioactives to develop as drug against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data of the present study exemplifies that the phytochemicals from selected traditional herbs having significance in steam inhalation therapy would be promising in combating COVID-19.","Gowrishankar, Shanmugaraj; Muthumanickam, Sankar; Kamaladevi, Arumugam; Karthika, Chandrasekar; Jothi, Ravi; Boomi, Pandi; Maniazhagu, Dharuman; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha",Food Chem Toxicol,343,24

The aim of this selective scoping review was to investigate the influence of gross income on accessing local green spaces to engage in PA and the associated health benefits. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted of international literature to facilitate the clarification of the research question. FINDINGS: 15 papers were critically appraised under two themes: (1) environments and well-being and (2) PA and income/socioeconomic status and impact on the frequency, duration and opportunity to engage in PA. INTERPRETATION: Income is related to differential use of green and blue spaces for PA, due mainly to access issues. People who live in lower socioeconomic areas tend to be more sedentary and there are also gender differences related to PA in built environments. CONCLUSION: There is an effect of income in using green spaces for PA, but the relationship is non-linear, and there is still a lack of knowledge about what kind of green spaces are best for health benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of accessing green local spaces to engage in physical exercise to improve well-being among the public.","Spencer, Llinos Haf; Lynch, Mary; Lawrence, Catherine L; Edwards, Rhiannon Tudor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),343,16

When it ended, the Singaporean government announced that restrictions on physical interactions would be eased in three phases. In Phase 1, all physical interactions between households continued to be disallowed with exceptions made for visits to parents and grandparents so that families could provide mutual support to one another. This article argues the permissibility of certain interactions hierarchised social ties according to a heteronormative logic where heteronormative kinship structures were elevated above others – thus excluding multiple constituencies that either did not have access to these kinship structures or for whom they did not provide support. Reading this instantiation as part of a larger reification of the heterosexual nuclear family unit in Singapore, this article posits that the demonstrable inability of heteronormative kinship to fulfil everyone’s support needs signals the urgency of rethinking extant heteronormative foundations of kinship in Singapore. Queering kinship in this way extends the existing body of queer studies scholarship in Singapore which has largely focussed on the effects of heteronormativity on LGBT lives by demonstrating how heteronormativity shapes non-LGBT lives as well.

The causative pathogen of COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel, highly contagious coronavirus. Numerous studies have reported that liver injury is quite common in patients with COVID-19. Hepatitis B has a worldwide distribution as well as in China. At present, hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because both viruses challenge liver physiology, it raises questions as to how coinfection with HBV and SARS-CoV-2 affect disease progression and mortality. Is there an increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with HBV infection? In this review, we summarize the current reports of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection and elaborate the interaction of the two diseases. The emphasis was placed on evaluating the impact of HBV infection on disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and discussing the potential mechanism behind this effect.","Xiang, Tian-Dan; Zheng, Xin",World J Gastroenterol,343,28

The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of Covid-19 support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV virions are preferentially released apically and not at the basement of the airway cells. Thus, in the setting of a productive infection of conducting airway epithelia, the apically released SARS-CoV may be removed by mucociliary clearance and gain access to the GI tract via a luminal exposure. In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis. Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two ""pinchers"" (S1 and 2). The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane. In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications.","Mönkemüller, Klaus; Fry, Lucia; Rickes, Steffen",Rev Esp Enferm Dig,343,16

DATA SOURCES: Electronic search for eligible articles of PubMed, Cochrane Central and clinicaltrials.gov was performed on 20 September 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 were included for meta-analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Remdesivir was compared with standard of care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were time to clinical improvement and safety outcomes like serious adverse events, respiratory failure. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Data synthesis was done with Cochrane review manager 5 (RevMan) V.5.3. Cochrane risk of bias V.2.0 tool was used for methodological quality assessment. The GRADE pro GDT was applied for overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: 52 RCTs were screened and 4 studies were included in analysis, with total of 7324 patients. No mortality benefit was observed with remdesivir versus control group (OR=0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.07), p=0.30, moderate quality evidence). Significantly higher rates of clinical improvement (OR=1.52 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.87), p<0.0001, low quality) and faster time to clinical improvement (HR=1.28 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.46), p=0.0002, very low quality) was observed with remdesivir versus control group. Significant decrease was found in the risk of serious adverse events (RR=0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90), p=0.0003, low quality); however, no difference was found in the risk of respiratory failure (RR=0.85 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.77), p=0.67, very low quality evidence) with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: As per the evidence from current review, remdesivir has shown no mortality benefit (moderate quality evidence) in the treatment of COVID-19. From a cost-benefit perspective, it is our personal opinion that it should not be recommended for use, especially in low and lower middle income countries.

With the global spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the need to have a real-time screening of the population, especially in crowded places, this study aimed to investigate the applicability of sniffer dogs to carry out such a task. METHODS: Firstly, three male and female dogs from German shepherd (Saray), German black (Kuzhi) and Labrador (Marco) breeds had been intensively trained throughout the classical conditioning method for 7 weeks. They were introduced to human specimens obtained from the throat and pharyngeal secretions of participants who were already reported positive or negative for SARS-COV-2 infection be RT-PCR. Each dog underwent the conditioning process for almost 1000 times. In the meantime another similar condition process was conducted on clothes and masks of COVID-19 patient using another three male and female dogs from Labrador (Lexi), Border gypsy (Sami), and Golden retriever (Zhico) breeds. In verification test for the first three dogs, 80 pharyngeal secretion samples consisting of 26 positive and 54 negative samples from different medical centers who underwent RT-PCR test were in a single-blind method. In the second verification test for the other three dogs, masks and clothes of 50 RT-PCR positive and 70 RT-PCR negative cases from different medical center were used. RESULTS: In verification test using pharyngeal secretion, the sniffer dogs' detection capability was associated with a 65% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity and they amanged to identify 17 out of the 26 positive and 48 out of the 54 true negative samples. In the next verification test using patients' face masks and clothes, 43 out of the 50 positive samples were correctly identified by the dogs. Moreover, out of the 70 negative samples, 65 samples were correctly found to be negative. The sensitivity of this test was as high as 86% and its specificity was 92.9%. In addition, the positive and negative predictive values were 89.6 and 90.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dogs are capable of being trained to identify COVID-19 cases by sniffing their odour, so they can be used as a reliable tool in limited screening.","Eskandari, Esmaeil; Ahmadi Marzaleh, Milad; Roudgari, Hassan; Hamidi Farahani, Ramin; Nezami-Asl, Amir; Laripour, Reza; Aliyazdi, Helen; Dabbagh Moghaddam, Arasb; Zibaseresht, Ramin; Akbarialiabad, Hossein; Yousefi Zoshk, Mojtaba; Shiri, Hamidreza; Shiri, Mahdi",BMC Infect Dis,343,1

This study evaluated the role of eosinopenia as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Information on 429 patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, India between 04 June 2020 to 15 August 2020, was retrospectively collected through electronic records and analysed. RESULTS: 79.25% of the patients included in the study had eosinopenia on admission. The median eosinophil count in COVID-19-positive patients was 0.015 × 109 /L, and in negative patients, it was 0.249 × 109 /L. Eighteen per cent of the positive patients presented with 0 eosinophil count. Eosinopenia for early diagnosis of COVID-19 had a sensitivity of 80.68% and specificity of 100% with an accuracy of 85.24. Role of eosinopenia in prognostication of COVID-19 was found to be insignificant. There was no statistically significant difference between the median eosinophil counts in survivors and nonsurvivors. Eosinophil trends during the course of disease were found to be similar between survivors and nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinopenia on admission is a reliable and convenient early diagnostic marker for COVID-19 infection, helping in early identification, triaging and isolation of the patients till nucleic acid test results are available. Role of eosinopenia as a prognostic indicator is insignificant.","Soni, Mamta",Int. j. lab. hematol,343,3

However, no studies to date have considered the impact of interactions between meteorological factors and air pollutants on COVID-19 transmission. This study explores the association between ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3), meteorological factors (average temperature, diurnal temperature range, relative humidity, wind velocity, air pressure, precipitation, and hours of sunshine), and their interaction on confirmed case counts of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities. We modeled total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as the dependent variable with meteorological factors, air pollutants, and their interactions as the independent variables. To account for potential migration effects, we included the migration scale index (MSI) from Wuhan to each of the 120 cities included in the model, using data from 15 Jan. to 18 Mar. 2020. As an important confounding factor, MSI was considered in a negative binomial regression analysis. Positive associations were found between the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and CO, PM2.5, relative humidity, and O3, with and without MSI-adjustment. Negative associations were also found for SO2 and wind velocity both with and without controlling for population migration. In addition, air pollutants and meteorological factors had interactive effects on COVID-19 after controlling for MSI. In conclusion, air pollutants, meteorological factors, and their interactions all affect COVID-19 cases.","Zhou, Jianli; Qin, Linyuan; Meng, Xiaojing; Liu, Nan",,343,20

However, less is known regarding the longitudinal association between anemia and deterioration of kidney function among the general population. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a nationally representative survey for households with members aged &#8805; 45 years. Participants without creatinine and demographic data in 2011 and 2015 were excluded. Anemia was defined according to definitions of the World Health Organization. Rapid decline in kidney function was defined as a &#8805;16.9% (quartile 3) decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the CKD-EPI equation during 2011-2015. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic splines were used to explore their relationship. Altogether, 7210 eligible participants were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 8.8 years. Rapid decline in kidney function occurred among 1802 (25.0%) participants. Those with kidney function decline were more likely to be older, male, and have anemia, lower eGFRs, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (P < 0.05). Anemia, or hemoglobin, was independently associated with rapid decline in kidney function after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.32-2.04; OR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.87-0.94, respectively). Restricted cubic splines showed a nonlinear relationship between hemoglobin and rapid decline in kidney function, especially for men with anemia (P < 0.05). In conclusion, anemia is an independent risk factor for progression of kidney function among the middle-aged and elderly population. Attentive management and intervention strategies targeting anemia could be effective to reduce the risk of kidney failure and improve the prognosis of the general population.","Yang, Chao; Meng, Qinqin; Wang, Huaiyu; Wang, Yafeng; Su, Zaiming; Liu, Lili; Liu, Wenwen; Kong, Guilan; Zhang, Luxia; Zhao, Yaohui; Zhao, Ming-Hui",Biomed Res Int,343,26

This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. RESULTS: Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. CONCLUSIONS: There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritised and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.","Anand, Mridu; Nimmala, Pavani",Trop Med Int Health,343,1

It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. Methods and analysis: We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (L·OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts. Ethics and dissemination: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of these articles will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks, and traditional media, and will be sent to relevant international organizations discussing this topic.","Rada, Gabriel; Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Ávila, Camila; Morel-Marambio, Macarena; Bravo-Jeria, Rocío; Pesce, Franco; Madrid, Eva; Izcovich, Ariel",Medwave,343,10

Starting in China, it is arguably the most precipitous global health calamity of modern times. The entire world has rocked back to fight against the disease and the COVID-19 vaccine is the prime weapon. Even though the conventional vaccine development pipeline usually takes more than a decade, the escalating daily death rates due to COVID-19 infections have resulted in the development of fast-track strategies to bring in the vaccine under a year's time. Governments, companies, and universities have networked to pool resources and have come up with a number of vaccine candidates. Also, international consortia have emerged to address the distribution of successful candidates.

Pulmonary hypertension patients need persistent medical care; however, limited reports focused on them when there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China. This national survey was aimed to evaluate the overall condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during this period. A questionnaire regarding the living condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during coronavirus disease 2019 was designed by pulmonary hypertension diagnostic experts in Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital. Pulmonary hypertension patients and their family members were invited to participate in this survey online. One-hundred twenty pulmonary hypertension patients and 23 family members participated in the survey; 64.8% (n = 87) participants came from Hubei, and others were from 15 other provinces; 98.6% (n = 141) participants were in home quarantine; 65.8% (n = 79) were pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease; and 76.7% (n = 92) patients proclaimed their heart function was well maintained at class I or II. One (0.8%) patient was confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Two (1.7%) patients were hospitalized due to heart function worsening. Nearly 70% (n = 100) participants implied shortage in medications during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A total of 24.2% (n = 29) patients indicated that medications were discontinued due to the insufficient supply. Most of the participants stayed optimistic on either coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak or their pulmonary hypertension disease, and 61.7% (n = 74) patients would go to the hospital for follow-up immediately after outbreak. These preliminary data show pulmonary hypertension patients are able to avoid severe disease when they are in home quarantine. Medication supplement is important for pulmonary hypertension patients when their heart function is well maintained. In addition, there might be increasing requirements of medical care for pulmonary hypertension patients after the outbreak.","Zhou, Hongmei; Zhang, Gangcheng; Deng, Xiaoxian; Jin, Bowen; Qiu, Qiu; Yan, Menghuan; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xuan",Pulm.

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.","Triggle, Chris R; Bansal, Devendra; Farag, Elmoubasher Abu Baker Abd; Ding, Hong; Sultan, Ali A",MSphere,343,24

It is a common cause of liver failure in pregnancy and often needs to be admitted to the department of critical care medicine because of the rapid development of acute hepatic dysfunction and severe acute renal dysfunction. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder is not very clear although there have been many studies on it before. Meanwhile, the relatively high mortality requires a better recognition in order to better guide clinical decision making. Our previous multicentre retrospective study on AFLP demonstrated that total bilirubin and serum creatinine were independent risk factors for perinatal maternal mortality. And we aim to further assess maternal outcomes and risk factors in AFLP patients treated without plasma exchange or renal replacement therapy based on previous data we collected.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 133 hospitalized patients with AFLP was collected from four Chinese tertiary hospitals during the period between January 2009 and April 2014. One hundred thirty three patients were divided into two subgroups containing patients treated without plasma exchange (PE) or renal replacement therapy (CRT) and patients treated with PE or/and CRT. Logistic regression was used to analyze independent risk factors for maternal mortality of AFLP treated without PE or CRT.Results: The maternal mortality rate was 12.0% in subgroup of patients treated without PE or CRT. And in subgroup of patients treated with PE or/and CRT, the maternal mortality rate was 26.8%. Independent risk factors for maternal mortality of AFLP treated without PE or CRT were direct bilirubin (OR = 1.012; 95% CI, 1.002-1.022) and serum creatinine (OR = 1.022; 95% CI, 1.007-1.036).Conclusion: Although less liver and kidney damage in AFLP treated without PE or CRT, direct bilirubin and serum creatinine remained to be independent risk factors for maternal mortality. Thus, the level of bilirubin and serum creatinine might not be necessary for AFLP to decide whether to give plasma exchange or dialysis treatment.","Gao, Qiang; Ma, Yujie; Zhang, Jicheng; Chen, Xiukai; Liu, Fen; Tian, Suochen; Qu, Xin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,343,10

Previous studies have suggested that built environment would affect older people's recreational walking (RW) and RPA, but how the effects exist in a small-scale Chinese city remains unclear. Two hundred and fifty-two older participants were recruited in the city of Yiwu using cross-sectional survey of random samples in 2019. RW and RPA level of participants and perceived scores of built environments were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of built environment with older people's RW and RPA. The results showed that two main factors affecting older people's RW and RPA were residential density and aesthetics. Additionally, access to services was related to RW, and street connectivity was correlated with RPA. The associations of RW with built environment varied slightly with demographic variables included in the regression model. All the results suggested that lower residential density, better aesthetics environment, and higher street connectivity would motivate older people to engage more in RW and RPA. The better access to services encourages only RW, not RPA, in older people. These findings would be helpful for policy decision makers in the urban construction process in Yiwu.

Although the pathogen for COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified, the pandemic is still ongoing. The critically ill COVID-19 patients account for most disease-associated death; thus, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors that would help determine therapeutic approaches. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings in 100 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Hubei Women & Children Healthcare Hospital (Guanggu District), of whom 22 patients died in hospital, and 78 patients survived. RESULTS: We found that age, lymphocyte count, and total bilirubin concentration were an independent prognostic factor for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Of particular importance, we observed a significant elevation of myocardium injury biomarkers, including CK-MB, high-sensitivity cardiac troponini I (hs-cTnI), and Mb, in the non-survivor group. These myocardium injury biomarkers appeared to correlate with the time of survival, and two multivariate models have suggested hs-cTnI was a novel prognostic factor with a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 84.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study highlighted the prognostic significance of myocardium injury biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Monitoring myocardium injury biomarkers would predict patient survival and guide therapeutic strategy.","Cao, Liang; Zhang, Sha; Luo, Xi; Wang, Enxin; Bai, Yang; Li, Zhe; Li, Feng; Ma, Jing; Liu, Haitao",Ann Palliat Med,343,21

This study aimed to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and COPD on the cellular phenotype of circulating monocytes. Thirty-two patients with COPD and 36 healthy volunteers (n = 17 and 19 in nonsmokers and smokers with normal lung functions, respectively) were enrolled in this study. The expression of two cell surface markers, pro-inflammatory-related S100A9 and anti-inflammatory-related CD163, on classical monocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of CD14strongCD16- classical monocytes in circulating monocytes showed no difference among the three groups. The percentage of S100A9+, S100A9+CD163-, and S100A9+CD163+ cells in classical monocytes was significantly increased in COPD patients relative to nonsmoker controls. In contrast, the levels of S100A9-CD163+ cells were significantly decreased in smokers with normal lung functions and in COPD patients relative to that in nonsmokers. Multivariate analyses revealed an independent association between S100A9+ cell rates and COPD (exponent 1.0336, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0063-1.0617, p value < 0.05). In Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the ratio of S100A9+CD163-/S100A9-CD163+ cells yielded a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve of 0.719 (95% CI = 0.567-0.871) for discrimination between smokers with normal lung functions and COPD patients.

METHOD: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS: The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark. In spite the abundant regulations in place, market control instruments have detected counterfeit face masks, which means that public authorities and users should ask manufacturers or suppliers for additional information in case of doubt.

To reduce transmission, people altered their mobility and interpersonal contact, and state and local governments acted to induce social distancing through across-the-board policies. The epidemic and the subsequent social distancing response led to high unemployment and to efforts to reopen the economy using more-targeted virus mitigation policies. This paper makes five contributions to studying epidemic policy and mobility. First, we review COVID-19 research on mobility, labor markets, consumer behavior, and health. Second, we sketch a simple model of incentives and constraints facing individuals. Third, we propose a typology of government social distancing policies. Fourth, we review new databases measuring cellular mobility and contact. Fifth, we present regression evidence to help disentangle private versus policy-induced changes in mobility. During the shutdown phase, large declines in mobility occurred before states adopted stay-at-home (SAH) mandates and in states that never adopted them, suggesting that much of the decline was a private response to the risk of infection. Similarly, in the reopening phase mobility increased rapidly, mostly preceding official state reopenings, with policies explaining almost none of the increase.","Gupta, S.; Simon, K.; Wing, C.",Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,343,26

VC stability was evaluated in blood, plasma, and precipitant-containing stabilizers. A proportion of 7.7 % of VC was degraded in blood at room temperature (RT) (approximately 20-25 °C) at 1.5 h post administration with respect to the proportion degraded at 0.5 h, but without statistical difference. VC was stable in plasma for 0.75 h at RT, 2 h at 4 °C, 5 days at -40 °C, and 4 h in precipitant-containing stabilizer (2 % oxalic acid) at RT. The mean plasma concentration of VC in patients with COVID-19 was 2.00 mg/L (0.5-4.90) (n = 8), which was almost 5-fold lower than that in healthy volunteers (9.23 mg/L (3.09. 35.30)) (n = 51). After high-dose VC treatment, the mean VC concentration increased to 13.46 mg/L (3.93. 34.70) (n = 36), higher than that in healthy volunteers, and was within the normal range (6-20 mg/L). In summary, we developed a simple UPLC-MS/MS method to quantify VC in plasma, and determined the duration for which the sample remained stable. VC levels in patients with COVID-19 were considerably low, and supplementation at 100 mg/kg/day is considered highly essential.","Xing, Yaru; Zhao, Bing; Yin, Lin; Guo, Mingquan; Shi, Huichun; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Zhang, Lin; He, Juan; Ling, Yun; Gao, Menglu; Lu, Hongzhou; Mao, Enqiang; Zhang, Lijun",J Pharm Biomed Anal,343,16

Although this has led to a significant reduction in chances of exposure, human-to-human interaction at the doorstep of the customer might be involved during the delivery of the ordered items. This human-to-human doorstep interaction arises in some other situations also. There is a finite probability that the person standing in front of the door coughs or sneezes during such an interaction. In this work, a three dimensional (3D) Euler-Lagrangian computational fluid dynamic model is used to understand the transmission and evaporation of micrometer-size droplets generated due to a coughing event in this setting. Different possible scenarios varying in wind direction, wind velocity, ventilation in the vicinity of door, and extent of door opening have been postulated and simulated. The results obtained from numerical simulations show that in the presence of wind, the dynamics of transmission of droplets is much faster than the dynamics of their evaporation. Thus wind velocity and direction have a significant impact on the fate of the droplets. The simulation results show that even if the door is opened by a very small degree, cough droplets enter through the door. Having open windows in the vicinity of the door on a windy day is expected to reduce the chance of the exposure significantly.","Sen, N.; Singh, K. K.",Physics of Fluids,343,16

Early challenges in the 2020 deployed environment included limited availability of living and quarantine space and limited testing capacity. This is a brief report of stringent quarantine strategies employed to newly arriving cohorts at a NATO and U.S. military base to prevent release of SARS-CoV-2 into a larger base population. METHODS: With awareness of the worldwide pandemic, beginning in late February 2020, all personnel arriving to the Hamid Karzai International Airport NATO base were quarantined for 14 days to prevent interaction with the wider base population. Testing capacity was limited. Names, locations, and dates of those within quarantine were tracked to improve contact tracing. Between February and April 2020, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed on a military base in Afghanistan within quarantine. RESULTS: Within quarantine, 11 males became PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during April 2020. Five of the 11 were PCR tested for symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of taste. A sixth individual, who had been asymptomatic upon leaving the base after completion of quarantine, later developed symptoms and tested positive. Another five asymptomatic individuals were found with antibody testing just before planned release from 14 days of quarantine post-exposure and confirmed with PCR testing. All PCR-positive individuals were diagnosed before being released into the general population of the base because of strict screening, quarantine, and exit criteria. CONCLUSION: Quarantine creates significant strain on resources in a deployed environment. Group quarantine facilities where social distancing is limited allow for the possibility for intra-quarantine transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, PCR testing is done upon entry into quarantine and upon exit. With the possibility of false-negative PCR or limited PCR testing, we recommend daily symptom screening, pulse oximetry, temperature checks, and small quarantine groups that must ""graduate"" together-all meeting exit criteria. Any introduction of new individual, even with negative testing, to a group increases risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Upon exit of quarantine, testing should be performed, regardless of entry testing. If PCR is limited, serology testing should be done, followed by PCR, if positive. Serology testing can be combined with clinical judgment to conserve PCR testing for quarantine release of asymptomatic individuals.","O039,; Donnell, Mary T; Kucera, John; Mitchell, Christopher A; Gurney, Jennifer M",Mil. med,343,16

Literature regarding cognitive impact of COVID-19 is still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive deficits and emotional distress among COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients who required functional rehabilitation. Specifically, this study explored and compared cognitive and psychological status of patients in the subacute phase of the disease (COVID-19 group) and patients in the postillness period (post-COVID-19 group). Forty patients admitted to rehabilitation units were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the phase of the disease: (a) COVID-19 group (n = 20) and (b) post-COVID-19 group (n = 20). All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A larger part of the COVID group showed neuropsychological deficits in the total MMSE (35%) compared to the post-COVID group (5%), whereas the majority of both groups (75-70%) reported cognitive impairments in the total MoCA. The post-COVID group reported significantly higher score in MMSE subtests of language (p = 0.02) and in MoCA subtests of executive functions (p = 0.05), language (p = 0.01), and abstraction (p = 0.02) compared to the COVID group. Regarding emotional disturbances, similar to 40% of patients presented with mild to moderate depression (57.9-60%). The post-COVID-19 group reported significantly higher levels of distress at the IES-R compared to the COVID group (p = 0.02). These findings highlight the gravity of neuropsychological and psychological symptoms that can be induced by COVID-19 infection and the need for tailored rehabilitation, including cognitive training and psychological support.","Pistarini, C.; Fiabane, E.; Houdayer, E.; Vassallo, C.; Manera, M.

Integrative modalities such as yoga, acupuncture, and massage are evidenced therapies for pain management. Additionally, medical cannabis and cannabinoids are emerging therapies for treatment of neuropathic pain (4,28). The authors of this study report a case of chronic neuropathic pain treated with integrative interventions. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic neuropathic pain in her lower back and legs, degenerative arthritis, restless leg syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and severe, chronic anxiety, presenting with worsening neuropathic pain. After over a decade of unsuccessful allopathic treatment, the patient sought out a more integrative approach to her pain management. A regimen of acupuncture, massage, gentle yoga, and medical cannabis was recommended. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to continue most of the integrative modalities and reported a significant increase in pain. The patient then joined a weekly Mind and Body program and began acupuncture treatments again, reporting a steady improvement in pain. CONCLUSION: The patient's chronic neuropathic pain was effectively treated using an integrative approach, with a combination of acupuncture, massage, yoga, mind-body approaches, and medical cannabis. While this case originally presented similarly to other cases of chronic neuropathic pain, it is unique in that it demonstrates the importance of an individualized complex approach, highlighting the patient's driven engagement in integrative modalities and medical cannabis.","Zarabian, Kimia; Wannon, Avi; Chin, May; Kogan, Mikhail",Explor.

This is the first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant, CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB, accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 6 × 10-4 M CTAB allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition).

Very recently its genomic RNA of â¼30 kb was decoded to be packaged with nucleocapsid (N) protein into phase separated condensates. Interestingly, viruses have no ability to generate ATP but host cells have very high ATP concentrations of 2-12 mM. A key question thus arises whether ATP modulates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the N protein. Here we discovered that ATP not only biphasically modulates LLPS of the viral N protein as we previously found on human FUS and TDP-43, but also dissolves the droplets induced by oligonucleic acid. Residue-specific NMR characterization showed ATP specifically binds the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the N protein with the average Kd of 3.3 ± 0.4 mM. The ATP-RBD complex structure was constructed by NMR-derived constraints, in which ATP occupies a pocket within the positive-charged surface utilized for binding nucleic acids. Our study suggests that ATP appears to be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to promote its life cycle by facilitating the uncoating, localizing and packing of its genomic RNA. Therefore the interactions of ATP with the viral RNA and N protein might represent promising targets for design of drugs and vaccines to terminate the pandemic.","Dang, Mei; Li, Yifan; Song, Jianxing",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,343,16

We quantify the FLPHER-induced changes of NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in 174 cities in China. A machine learning prediction model for air pollution is established by coupling a generalized additive model, random effects meta-analysis, and weather research and forecasting model with chemistry analysis. The short-term control effect under the current energy structure in each city is estimated by comparing the predicted and observed results during the FLPHER period. We found that the short-term emission control effect ranges within 53.0%-98.3% for all cities, and southern cities show a significantly stronger effect than northern cities (P < 0.01). Compared with megacities, small-medium cities show a similar control effect on NO2 and SO2 but a larger effect on PM2.5 and PM10.","Lu, Dawei; Zhang, Jingwei; Xue, Chaoyang; Zuo, Peijie; Chen, Zigu; Zhang, Luyao; Ling, Weibo; Liu, Qian; Jiang, Guibin",Environ Sci Technol,343,4

Here we determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (range $N=21{,}000-157{,}000$) from the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informa\c{c}\~ao de Vigil\^ancia Epidemiol\'ogica da Gripe) database. We fit a set of probability distribution functions and estimate a symptom-onset-to-death mean of $15.2$ days for Brazil, which is lower than earlier estimates of 17.8 days based on early Chinese data. A joint Bayesian subnational model is used to simultaneously describe the $26$ states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between $11.2-17.8$ days across the different states. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability distribution function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-discharge. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, Iwona; Mellan, Thomas A.; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique H.; Mishra, Swapnil; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P.; Whittaker, Charles; Zhu, Harrison; Gandy, Axel; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir",,343,29

A Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (C-NDDI-E), a self-reporting depression inventory, was applied for rapid detection of major depression. Assessment was carried out online during three different periods (prior to, during, and after the outbreak of COVID-19), with the aim of identifying changes in prevalence of depression and associated risk factors. A total of 158 PWE were recruited into the study (48.7% female). The questionnaire completion rates were 94.3% and 70.9% during and after the outbreak, respectively. The prevalence of depression prior to the epidemic, as the baseline, was 34.8% and increased to 42.3% during the period of the epidemic. Towards the end of the outbreak, the prevalence declined towards the baseline (36.6%). Factors such as living alone (OR = 4.022, 95% CI: 1.158-13.971, P = 0.028) and active seizures before the epidemic (OR = 2.993, 95% CI: 1.197-7.486, P = 0.019) were associated with depression during the epidemic. Monotherapy appeared to be protective against depression (OR = 0. 105, 95% CI: 0.047-0.235, P <0.001). Our results suggest that the pandemic exerts negative influence on PWE's mental health.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This is the first international survey assessing the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training of doctors of all grades and specialties. METHODS: An online global survey was disseminated using Survey Monkey® between 4th August 2020 and 17th November 2020. A global network of collaborators facilitated participant recruitment. Data were collated anonymously with informed consent and analysed using univariate and adjusted multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-three doctors of median age 27 (IQR: 25-30) were included with the majority (56.8%, n = 422) being male. Two-thirds of doctors were in a training post (66.5%, n = 494), 52.9% (n = 393) in a surgical specialty and 53.0% (n = 394) in low- and middle-income countries. Sixty-nine point two percent (n = 514) reported an overall perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their training. A significant decline was noted amongst non-virtual teaching methods such as face-to-face lectures, tutorials, ward-based teaching, theatre sessions, conferences, simulation sessions and morbidity and mortality meetings (P &#8804; .05). Low or middle-income country doctors' training was associated with perceived inadequate supervision while performing invasive procedures under general, local or regional anaesthetic. (P &#8804; .05). CONCLUSION: In addition to the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare infrastructure, this international survey reports a widespread perceived overall negative impact on medical and surgical doctors' training globally. Ongoing adaptation and innovation will be required to enhance the approach to doctors' training and learning in order to ultimately improve patient care.","Laloo, Ryan; Santhosh Karri, Rama; Wanigasooriya, Kasun; Beedham, William; Darr, Adnan; Layton, Georgia R; Logan, Peter; Tan, Yanyu; Mittapalli, Devender; Patel, Tapan; Mishra, Vivaswan Dutt; Odeh, Osama Faleh; Prakash, Swathi; Elnoamany, Salma; Peddinti, Sri Ramya; Daketsey, Elorm Adzoa; Gadgil, Shardool; Bouhuwaish, Ahmad; Ozair, Ahmad; Bansal, Sanchit; Elhadi, Muhammed; Godbole, Aditya Amit; Axiaq, Ariana; Rauf, Faateh Ahmad; Ashpak, Ashna",Int J Clin Pract,343,20

Methods • The data on the COVID-19 epidemic situation in various provincial administrative regions in China published by National Health Commission of People's Republic of China from Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. The elbow cluster analysis method was used to cluster the provincial administrative regions. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model was used to calculate the basic infection number (R0) of different clusters, whose changing trends were also predicted. Results • According to the prevalence rates, the 34 provincial administrative regions were divided into four types of clusters: Cluster Ⅰ (22 provincial administrative regions), Cluster Ⅱ (9 provincial administrative regions), Cluster Ⅲ (2 provincial administrative regions) and Cluster Ⅳ (Hubei). The prevalence rate of Hubei was higher than those of other clusters (P=0.000), but the differences in the cure rate and the case-fatality rate among the four clusters were not statistically significant; the R0 values based on the SEIR model of them were 2.764, 3.056, 3.899 and 3.984, respectively. By Feb. 13, 2020, except for Hubei, the cumulative prevalence curves of the other clusters tended to be stable and the cure rates increased. The prevalence rate and case-fatality rate of Hubei were still higher, and the cure rate was lower. Conclusion • From Jan. 13 to Feb. 13, 2020, 34 provincial administrative regions in China can be divided into four clusters according to the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the prevalence rate of Cluster Ⅳ was significantly higher than those of other three clusters; by Feb. 13, 2020, the epidemic situations in the Cluster Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ has been alleviated, and the epidemic situation in Cluster Ⅳ areas were still severe.","Li, Qiang; Sun, Zhe; Qian, Bi-Yun; Feng, Tie-Nan",J.

In spite of this incredible success of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), the development of perovskite NCs is still in its infancy, and the production of high-quality ultrathin perovskite nanostructures has been a hot topic in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Herein, we demonstrate that ultrathin CsPbBr3 perovskite nanosheets (NSs) can be obtained by a simple mixing of precursor-ligand complexes under ambient conditions. It was found that the formation of NSs is ascribed to the stepwise self-assembly of the initially formed different types of ultrathin nanostructures. Due to the disappearance of grain boundaries and protection of branched ligands, these NSs exhibit enhanced optical properties compared to other types of samples. This direct synthesis method opens up a promising road for the synthesis of ultrathin NSs and guides the fabrication of other ultrathin nanostructures.","Ji, Yongqiang; Wang, Minqiang; Yang, Zhi; Qiu, Hengwei; Wang, Hui; Padhiar, Muhammad Amin; Zhou, Yun; Dang, Jialin; Gaponenko, Nikolai V; Bhatti, Arshad Saleem",Dalton trans (2003.

Here, we show that modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing membrane-anchored pre-fusion stabilized spike (MVA/S) but not secreted S1 induced strong neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. In macaques, the MVA/S vaccination induced strong neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses, and conferred protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus replication in the lungs as early as day 2 following intranasal and intratracheal challenge. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of lung cells on day 4 after infection revealed that MVA/S vaccination also protected macaques from infection-induced inflammation and B cell abnormalities and lowered induction of interferon-stimulated genes. These results demonstrate that MVA/S vaccination induces neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lungs and is a potential vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","Routhu, Nanda Kishore; Cheedarla, Narayanaiah; Gangadhara, Sailaja; Bollimpelli, Venkata Satish; Boddapati, Arun K; Shiferaw, Ayalnesh; Rahman, Sheikh Abdul; Sahoo, Anusmita; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Lai, Lilin; Floyd, Katharine; Wang, Shelly; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Shin, Sally A; Gumber, Sanjeev; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Cohen, Joyce; Jean, Sherrie M; Wood, Jennifer S; Connor-Stroud, Fawn; Stammen, Rachelle L; Upadhyay, Amit A; Pellegrini, Kathryn; Montefiori, David; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Alter, Galit; Vanderford, Thomas H; Bosinger, Steven E; Suthar, Mehul S; Amara, Rama Rao",Immunity,343,16

Cardiac complications secondary to this infection are common; however, the underlying mechanisms of such remain unclear. A detailed cardiac evaluation of a series of COVID-19 individuals undergoing postmortem evaluation is provided, with four aims: 1) describe the pathologic spectrum of the myocardium; 2) compare to an alternate viral illness; 3) investigate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; and 4) provide the first description of the cardiac findings in patients with cleared infection. Methods: Study cases were identified from institutional files and included COVID-19 (n=15; 12 active, 3 cleared), influenza A/B (n=6), and non-virally mediated deaths (n=6). Salient information was abstracted from the medical record. Light microscopic findings were recorded. An ACE2 immunohistochemical H-score was compared across cases. Viral detection encompassed SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural examination, and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Results: Male sex was more common in the COVID-19 group (p=0.05). Non-occlusive fibrin microthrombi (without ischemic injury) were identified in 16 cases (12 COVID-19, 2 influenza, and 2 controls), and were more common in the active COVID-19 cohort (p=0.006). Four active COVID-19 cases showed focal myocarditis, while one case of cleared COVID-19 showed extensive disease. Arteriolar ACE2 endothelial expression was lower in COVID-19 cases versus controls (p=0.004). ACE2 myocardial expression did not differ by disease category, sex, age or number of patient comorbidities (p=0.69, p=1.00, p=0.46, p=0.65, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry showed non-specific staining, while ultrastructural examination and ddPCR were negative for viral presence. Four (26.7%) COVID-19 patients had underlying cardiac amyloidosis. Cases with cleared infection had variable presentations. Conclusions: This detailed histopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular cardiac series showed no definitive evidence of direct myocardial infection. COVID-19 cases frequently have cardiac fibrin microthrombi, without universal acute ischemic injury. Moreover, myocarditis is present in 33.3% of active and cleared COVID-19 patients, but is usually limited in extent. Histologic features of resolved infection are variable. Cardiac amyloidosis may be an additional risk factor for severe disease.","Bois, Melanie C; Boire, Nicholas A; Layman, Andrew J; Aubry, Marie-Christine; Alexander, Mariam P; Roden, Anja C; Hagen, Catherine E; Quinton, Reade A; Larsen, Christopher; Erben, Young; Majumdar, Ramanath; Jenkins, Sarah M; Kipp, Benjamin R; Lin, Peter T; Maleszewski, Joseph J",Circulation,343,1

Considering elevators as a high-risk environment for the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases via surface transmission, common methods of manually applying liquid-form disinfectants are impractical for sanitizing the elevator panel after each use. Therefore, an automated UVC light surface sanitization device with integrated sensing components to avoid UVC light-human interaction and perform frequent sanitization was developed. Algorithmically, the system uses a motion sensor, an inertial measurement unit, and a door sensor to determine when the elevator is empty, stationary, and shut. Once these conditions are met, the UVC lamp is enabled to safely sanitize the elevator control panel. The device's UVC irradiation capabilities were tested by applying UVC light to a mock control panel. A minimum power density of 0.31 mW/cm(2) was detected, which can deactivate SARS-CoV-2. The sensing and control system was tested in an elevator and it was demonstrated to be able to detect operating conditions and activate the UVC light at appropriate instances. Our device operates using inexpensive hardware and it can be easily integrated into existing elevator infrastructures.","Hu, J.; O039,; Brien, J.; Joshi, A. S.; Navabi, Z. S.; Alegria, A.

The behavior is consistent with the previous results for SF networks by a mean-field approximation without connectivity correlations. In particular, it is suggested that the growing must be stopped to prevent the spreading of infection.

Community detection is crucial for various reasons, such as serving as a functional unit of a network that captures local interactions among nodes. Communities come in various forms and types, ranging from biologically to technology-induced ones. As technology-induced communities, social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook connect a myriad of diverse users, leading to a highly connected and dynamic ecosystem. Although many algorithms have been proposed for detecting socially cohesive communities on Twitter, mining and related tasks remain challenging. This study presents a novel detection method based on a scalable framework to identify related communities in a network. We propose a multilevel clustering technique (MCT) that leverages structural and textual information to identify local communities termed microcosms. Experimental evaluation on benchmark models and datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. This study contributes a new dimension for the detection of cohesive communities in social networks. The approach offers a better understanding and clarity toward describing how low-level communities evolve and behave on Twitter. From an application point of view, identifying such communities can better inform recommendation, among other benefits.","Inuwa-Dutse, Isa; Liptrott, Mark; Korkontzelos, Yannis",,343,16

This cluster is amongst the top 0.1\% richest clusters in the redMaPPer catalog; it is significantly detected in X-ray and through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in ROSAT and \emph{Planck} data, respectively; and its optical luminosity distribution implies a very large lens, following mass-to-light scaling relations. Based on these properties it was chosen for the Webb Medium Deep Fields (WMDF) JWST/GTO program. In preparation for this program, RMJ1212 was recently imaged with GMOS on Gemini North and in seven optical and near-infrared bands with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}. We use these data to map the inner mass distribution of the cluster, uncovering various sets of multiple images.

We find over a dozen high-redshift ($z\gtrsim6$) candidates based on both photometric redshift and the dropout technique. No prominent ($\gtrsim5 \sigma$) transients were found in the data between the two HST visits.

Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the value of anticytokine therapies to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This review summarizes the existing literature evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticytokine therapy to tackle the dysregulated immune response to infectious pathogens, discusses potential reasons for failure, applicability to coronavirus disease 2019, and future direction. Data Sources: Medline, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and media reports. Study Selection: The studies were included by author consensus. Data Extraction: Data were selected for inclusion after reviewing each study by author consensus. Data Synthesis: ""Cytokine storm"" is a nonspecific term, encompassing systemic inflammatory response to infectious pathogens, autoimmune conditions, cancers, trauma, and various chemotherapies. Like bacterial sepsis, viral pathogens may fuel immunopathogenesis by inducing a dysregulated autoamplifying cytokine cascade, ultimately leading to organ injury. This narrative review discusses what we know of the immune milieu of coronavirus disease 2019 versus noncoronavirus disease 2019 sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, summarizes the existing literature on cytokine inhibitors in patients with sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and discusses possible reasons for recurrent failure.

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of São Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students' educational routines and medical training.

Computed tomography of the coronary arteries showed a left dominant system with dissection extending from the mid-to-distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient was subsequently discharged on medical therapy but returned 3 days later due to worsening chest pain. Electrocardiogram revealed inferior and anteroseptal ST segment changes with peak troponin of 14.9 ng/ml (reference range <0.80 ng/ml). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab was performed prior to urgent coronary angiogram. Coronary angiogram was performed with full personal protective equipment for respiratory and droplet precautions due to pending COVID-19 testing results. Angiogram revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) extending from the ostium of the LAD to the distal vessel. COVID-19 testing returned positive while in intensive care unit. The patient was not a percutaneous coronary intervention candidate due to the extent of the dissection and was not a surgical candidate due to a lack of graftable target and medical management was continued. To our knowledge, this case is the first in which SCAD has been reported in the LAD in a patient with COVID-19 with no other symptoms of respiratory illness or symptoms classically associated with the novel coronavirus. SCAD should be considered on the differential as one of the various cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection.","Kumar, Kris; Vogt, Joshua C; Divanji, Punag H; Cigarroa, Joaquin E",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,343,16

The heterogeneity and constant variability of hosts, in terms of age, immunological status, family structure, lifestyle, work activities, social and leisure habits, daily division of time, and other demographic characteristics make it extremely difficult to predict the evolution of epidemics. Such prediction is, however, critical for implementing intervention measures in due time and with appropriate intensity. General conclusions should be precluded, given that local parameters dominate the flow of local epidemics. Membrane computing models allows us to reproduce the objects (viruses, hosts) and their interactions (stochastic but also with defined probabilities) with an unprecedented level of detail. Our LOIMOS model helps reproduce the demographics and social aspects of a hypothetical town of 10,320 inhabitants in an average European country where COVID-19 is imported from the outside. The above-mentioned characteristics of hosts and their lifestyle are minutely considered. The dynamics of the epidemics are reproduced and include the effects on viral transmission of innate and acquired immunity at various ages. The model predicts the consequences of delaying the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (between 15 and 45 days after the first reported cases) and the effect of those interventions on infection and mortality rates (reducing transmission by 20%, 50%, and 80%) in immunological response groups. The lockdown for the elderly population as a single intervention appears to be effective. This modelling exercise exemplifies the application of membrane computing for designing appropriate interventions in epidemic situations.","Baquero, Fernando; Campos, Marcelino; Sempere, Jose-Maria; Galan, Juan-Carlos; Moya, Andres; Llorens, Carlos; de-los-Angeles, Cristina; Baquero-Artigao, Fernando; Canton, Rafael",,343,26

Importantly, although ADEP-activated ClpP is assumed to target multiple polypeptide and protein substrates in the bacterial cell, not all proteins seem equally susceptible. In Bacillus subtilis, the cell division protein FtsZ emerged to be particularly sensitive to degradation by ADEP-activated ClpP at low inhibitory ADEP concentrations. In fact, FtsZ is the only bacterial protein that has been confirmed to be degraded in vitro as well as within bacterial cells so far. However, the molecular reason for this preferred degradation remained elusive. Here, we report the unexpected finding that ADEP-activated ClpP alone, in the absence of any Clp-ATPase, leads to an unfolding and subsequent degradation of the N-terminal domain of FtsZ, which can be prevented by the stabilization of the FtsZ fold via nucleotide binding. At elevated antibiotic concentrations, importantly, the C terminus of FtsZ is notably targeted for degradation in addition to the N terminus. Our results show that different target structures are more or less accessible to ClpP, depending on the ADEP level present. Moreover, our data assign a Clp-ATPase-independent protein unfolding capability to the ClpP core of the bacterial Clp protease and suggest that the protein fold of FtsZ may be more flexible than previously anticipated.IMPORTANCE Acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics effectively kill multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antibacterial activity of ADEP depends on a new mechanism of action, i.e., the deregulation of bacterial protease ClpP that leads to bacterial self-digestion. Our data allow new insights into the mode of ADEP action by providing a molecular explanation for the distinct bacterial phenotypes observed at low versus high ADEP concentrations. In addition, we show that ClpP alone, in the absence of any unfoldase or energy-consuming system, and only activated by the small molecule antibiotic ADEP, leads to the unfolding of the cell division protein FtsZ.","Silber, Nadine; Pan, Stefan; Schäkermann, Sina; Mayer, Christian; Brötz-Oesterhelt, Heike; Sass, Peter",mBio (Online),343,20

Limited data exist on its use in immediate breast reconstruction. We present our experience of day-case management of mastectomy with immediate pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction (IBR). METHODS: Data were collected on 47 patients who underwent day-case skin-sparing (SSM) or nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomy with pre-pectoral IBR between October 2017 and September 2019. Clinicopathological data were collected, including postoperative complications, re-admission and re-operation. The data were compared to published national standards. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (range 37-74). Thirty-two patients (68%) had an SSM and 15 (32%) had an NSM. Two patients (4%) had risk-reducing mastectomies and 45 had treatment for invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean tumour size was 33.3mm (range 7-85mm). Forty-two (89%) patients went home on the day of surgery. No patients required re-operation in the first 48 hours. The median postoperative follow-up time was 11.4 months (range 1.8-22.7 months). During the first 90-day postoperative period, eight patients (17%) developed superficial skin necrosis, five patients (10.6%) developed postoperative infections and five patients (10.6%) suffered an implant loss. Eight patients (17%) were readmitted for re-operation. Compared to UK national standards set in the iBRA study, our cohort has demonstrated comparable postoperative infection, implant loss and re-operation and re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated close to 90% day-case success rate for mastectomy with IBR. These early data suggest that immediate IBR can be carried out in a manner that is cost-efficient without impacting surgical outcomes.","Shaker, H; Leena, Nar; Mayers, V; Koussa, F; Deshpande, A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,343,24

Here, we dissect the predictions made by four models for the daily COVID-19 death counts between March 25 and June 5 in New York state, as well as the predictions of ICU bed utilisation made by the influential IHME model. We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the""ground truth""data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained. Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions. For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had started to wane.

More information is needed to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics maintain the growth performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic based on Bacillus subtilis bacteria on growth related mechanisms of broilers under heat stress conditions. Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3 × 107 cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 °C) or chronic heat stress (30 °C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions. In addition, broilers fed B. subtilis under heat stress conditions exhibited higher (P < 0.05) skeletal muscles size and improved (P < 0.05) tibia traits and lower (P < 0.05) abdominal fat pads deposition compared with the controls. B. subtilis had no effect on rectal temperature under thermoneutral or heat stress conditions. It is concluded that B. subtilis can be used as growth promoters in broilers, particularly during the periods of heat stress conditions.","Abdelqader, Anas; Abuajamieh, Mohannad; Hayajneh, Firas; Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",J Therm Biol,343,20

Antibodies persist in the blood after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Since COVID-19 vaccines induce immune response to the Spike protein of the virus, which is the main serosurveillance target to date, alternative targets should be explored to distinguish infection from vaccination. MethodsMultiplex immunoassay data from 1,513 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-tested individuals (352 positive and 1,161 negative) with a primary infection and no vaccination history were used to determine the accuracy of Nucleoprotein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in detecting past SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described Spike S1 and Nucleoprotein-specific IgG responses in 230 COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (Pfizer/BioNTech). ResultsThe sensitivity of Nucleoprotein seropositivity was 85% (95% confidence interval: 80-90%) for mild COVID-19 in the first two months following symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower in asymptomatic individuals (67%, 50-81%). Participants who had experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 11 months preceding vaccination, as assessed by Spike S1 seropositivity or RT-qPCR, produced 2.7-fold higher median levels of IgG to Spike S1 [≥]14 days after the first dose as compared to those unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 at [≥]7 days after the second dose (p=0.011). Nucleoprotein-specific IgG concentrations were not affected by vaccination in naive participants. ConclusionsSerological responses to Nucleoprotein may prove helpful in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination. Furthermore, it can help interpret IgG to Spike S1 after COVID-19 vaccination as particularly high responses shortly after vaccination could be explained by prior exposure history.","Hoogen, Lotus Leonie van den; Smits, Gaby; Hagen, Cheyenne CE van; Wong, Denise; Vos, Eric RA; Boven, Michiel van; Melker, Hester E de; Vliet, Jeffrey van; Kuijer, Marjan; Woudstra, Linde; Wijmenga-Monsuur, Alienke J; Kessel, Corine H Geurts van; Stoof, Susanne P; Reukers, Daphne; Wijsman, Lisa A; Meijer, Adam; Reusken, Chantal BEM; Rots, Nynke Y; Klis, Fiona RM van der; Binnendijk, Robert S van; Hartog, Gerco den",,343,1

We describe among short-term and long-term residents at three NHs in Michigan the outbreak identification process, universal testing, point prevalence of COVID-19, and subsequent containment efforts, outcomes, and challenges. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds = 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHODS: Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials, and parent corporation implemented immediate facility-wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID-19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment reeducation and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID-19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14-day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases of COVID-19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were identified through symptom-triggered testing from March 23 to April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted from April 7 to 15, 2020. The hospitalization rate was 37.9%. The case fatality rate was 20.7% (6/29); these patients had multiple comorbidities. No residents who tested positive through the point-prevalence survey required hospitalization, and five were discharged home within 14 days. CONCLUSION: Proactive and coordinated steps between NH medical directors and administrators, referral hospitals including their laboratories, and local public health officials are necessary to rapidly respond to an outbreak and limit the transmission of COVID-19. This coordinated public health approach may save lives, minimize the burden to the healthcare system, and reduce healthcare costs.","Montoya, Ana; Jenq, Grace; Mills, John P; Beal, Jennifer; Diviney Chun, Erin; Newton, Duane; Gibson, Kristen; Mantey, Julia; Hurst, Kristen; Jones, Karen; Mody, Lona",J. am. geriatr. soc,343,16

In addition to continuing the residency education during COVID-19, it is also important to conduct their examination so that the graduations of final year residents are not delayed. The conventional exam pattern involved clinical case presentations and required resident interaction with a number of patients. However, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a “zero-patient contact virtual practical exit examination” for orthopaedic residents. Methods: In order to replicate the conventional exam case-scenarios, clinical cases were prepared in a digital presentation format. The candidate used N-95 facemasks and gloves, and adequate social distancing was maintained in the examination area. We also designed a 10- item questionnaire aimed at assessing the quality and satisfaction with the exam pattern. Results: The mean score for overall satisfaction with the virtual pattern was 4.5 (out of 5) in examiner group while it was 4.1 in examinee group. Higher scores were also reported for questions related to safety of the exam, relevance and quality of the virtual cases, etc. The mean total feedback score for the examiner and examinee group was 48 and 43.4 respectively (out of 50). Conclusion: Orthopaedic residency end-of-training examinations can be successfully conducted during the COVID pandemic, and we hope our experience will be helpful to other residency programs.","Malhotra, Rajesh; Gautam, Deepak; George, Jaiben; Goyal, Devansh; Ansari, Mohammed Tahir",J.

The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals. In conclusion, gAOP is a verifiable treatment that can be applied to decontaminate N95 and surgical masks without any negative effects on functionality.","Hasani, Mahdiyeh; Campbell, Tracey; Wu, Fan; Warriner, Keith",PLoS One,343,32

Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. METHODS: Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. RESULTS: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P>.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P<.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P<.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than 1 minute and is appropriate for use in both in-person and virtual visits.","Mansbach, William E; Mace, Ryan A; Tanner, Melissa A",JMIR Aging,343,15

However, there are no systematic studies describe the molecular genetic evolution and migration of LNVs. With the development of bioinformatics, viral genetic data combining the information of virus isolation time and locations could be integrated to infer the virus evolution and spread in nature. METHODS: Here, a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations was conducted on the LNVs isolated from a variety of vectors during 1990-2014 to identify the evolution and migration patterns of LNVs. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the LNV could be divided into 3 genotypes, of which genotype 1 mainly composed of LNVs isolated from Australia during 1990 to 2014 and the original LNV strain (LNV-NE97-31) isolated from Liaoning province in northern China in 1997, genotype 2 comprised of the isolates all from Xinjiang province in western China and genotype 3 consisted the isolates from Qinghai and Shanxi province of central China. LNVs emerged about 272 years ago and gradually evolved into three lineages in the order genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3. Following phylogeographic analysis, it shows genotype 1 LNVs transmitted from Australia (113°E-153°E,10°S-42°S) to Liaoning province (118°E-125°E,38°N-43°N) in Northeast Asian continent then further spread across the central part of China to western China (75°E-95°E,35°N-50°N). CONCLUSION: LNVs were initially isolated from Liaoning province of China in the Northeast Asia, however, the present study revealed that LNVs were first appeared in Australia in the South Pacific region and transmitted to mainland China then rapidly spread across China and evolved three different genotypes. The above results suggested that LNV had the characteristics of long-distance transmission and there were great genetic diversity existed in the LNV population. Notably, current information of 80 strains of LNVs are limited. It is of great importance to strengthen the surveillance of LNVs to explore its real origin in nature and monitoring of the LNVs' population variation and maintain vigilance to avoid LNV breaking through the species barrier and further clarify its relationship to human and animal infection.","Zhang, Jun; Liu, Hong; Wang, Jiahui; Wang, Jiheng; Zhang, Jianming; Wang, Jiayue; Zhang, Xin; Ji, Hongfang; Ding, Zhongfeng; Xia, Han; Zhang, Chunyang; Zhao, Qian; Liang, Guodong",Virol J,343,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present three case reports that highlight the capability of RPM to enable early identification of viral infection with COVID-19 in patients with chronic respiratory disease. METHODS: Patients at a large pulmonary practice who were enrolled in a respiratory RPM program and who had contracted COVID-19 were identified. The RPM system (Spire Health) contains three components: (1) Health Tags (Spire Health), undergarment waistband-adhered physiologic monitors that include a respiratory rate sensor; (2) an app on a smartphone; and (3) a web dashboard for use by respiratory therapists. The physiologic data of 9 patients with COVID out of 1000 patients who were enrolled for monitoring were retrospectively reviewed, and 3 instances were identified where the RPM system had notified clinicians of physiologic deviation due to the viral infection. RESULTS: Physiologic deviations from respective patient baselines occurred during infection onset and, although the infection manifested differently in each case, were identified by the RPM system. In the first case, the patient was symptomatic; in the second case, the patient was presymptomatic; and in the third case, the patient varied from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: RPM systems intended for long-term use and that use patient-specific baselines can highlight physiologic changes early in the course of acute disease, such as COVID-19 infection. These cases demonstrate opportunities for earlier diagnosis, treatment, and isolation.

Currently, governments and transportation industries around the world are developing strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with resuming activity. This study investigated the possible use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater surveillance from airline and cruise ship sanitation systems and its potential use as a COVID-19 public health management tool. METHODS: Aircraft and cruise ship wastewater samples (n = 21) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using two virus concentration methods, adsorption-extraction by electronegative membrane (n = 13) and ultrafiltration by Amicon (n = 8), and five assays using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). Representative qPCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced to confirm assay specificity. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in samples from both aircraft and cruise ship wastewater; however concentrations were near the assay limit of detection. The analysis of multiple replicate samples and use of multiple RT-qPCR and/or RT-ddPCR assays increased detection sensitivity and minimized false-negative results. Representative qPCR amplicons were confirmed for the correct PCR product by sequencing. However, differences in sensitivity were observed among molecular assays and concentration methods. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that surveillance of wastewater from large transport vessels with their own sanitation systems has potential as a complementary data source to prioritize clinical testing and contact tracing among disembarking passengers. Importantly, sampling methods and molecular assays must be further optimized to maximize detection sensitivity. The potential for false negatives by both wastewater testing and clinical swab testing suggests that the two strategies could be employed together to maximize the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst passengers.","Ahmed, Warish; Bertsch, Paul M; Angel, Nicola; Bibby, Kyle; Bivins, Aaron; Dierens, Leanne; Edson, Janette; Ehret, John; Gyawali, Pradip; Hamilton, Kerry A; Hosegood, Ian; Hugenholtz, Philip; Jiang, Guangming; Kitajima, Masaaki; Sichani, Homa T; Shi, Jiahua; Shimko, Katja M; Simpson, Stuart L; Smith, Wendy J M; Symonds, Erin M; Thomas, Kevin V; Verhagen, Rory; Zaugg, Julian; Mueller, Jochen F",J. travel med,343,16

Comprehensive reports from other countries are needed. We dissect the pattern, evolution and predictive value of such abnormalities in a cohort from Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Retrospective study with prospective 14-day follow-up of 373 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in five Madrid hospitals, including 50 outpatients. COVID-19 severe course was defined as need of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 33.1% hospitalised patients showed baseline AST elevation and 28.5% showed ALT elevation, contrasting with 12% and 8% of outpatients (P&#8804;0.001). Baseline AST, ALT and GGT levels correlated with LDH and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (r&#8804;0.598, P<0.005). AST elevation was associated with other severity markers such as male sex, lymphopenia and pneumonia on X-ray (P<0.05 all). ALP and Bilirubin levels were rarely increased. Patients with elevated baseline AST displayed progressive normalization of this enzyme and increase in ALT and GGT levels. Patients with normal baseline AST showed a flattened evolution pattern with levels in range. Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 showed more frequently elevated baseline AST than those with a milder evolution (54.2% vs. 25.4%, P<0.001). Age, AST and CRP were independent risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mild liver enzyme elevation is associated with COVID-19 severity.

It is therefore crucial to clarify this aspect, considering its implications in the development of successful surveillance strategies, therapies, and vaccinations. The aim of this study was to assess the antibody response in a children group after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to compare it with that of their parents affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled 12 children and their parents, both groups being affected by COVID-19 in April 2020. In the children's group, we collected real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and gene characterization of first nasal-throat swab at the time of diagnosis (T0); 30 days after the diagnosis (T30), we performed blood tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Finally, 180 days after the diagnosis (T180), we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both children and parents. In children, antibody levels declined significantly at 180 days (T180) after first measurement (T30). There were no significant differences in IgG level related to age, sex, and clinical manifestations. We found a significant correlation between IgG titers at T30 and Ct value of gene N. Children showed a lower level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at T180 compared to their parents.Conclusion: Antibody responses in children waned 180 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and at the same time, their parents showed a different antibody response to the virus. These results highlight that serological tests should be used with caution in surveillance strategies among the general population.

In contrast, specificity was much lower for the Ghanaian and Nigerian serum panels (Ghana: NCP-based assays 77.7-89.7%, spike/S1-based assay 94.3%; Nigeria: NCP-based assays 39.3-82.7%, spike/S1-based assay 90.7%). 15 of 600 African sera were concordantly classified as positive in both the NCP-based and the spike/S1-based Euroimmun ELISA, but did not inhibit spike/ACE2 binding in a surrogate virus neutralisation test. IgG antibodies elicited by previous infections with common cold CoVs were found in all sample panels, including those from Madagascar, Colombia, and Germany and thus do not inevitably hamper assay specificity. Nevertheless, high levels of IgG antibodies interacting with OC43 NCP were found in all 15 SARS-CoV-2 NCP/spike/S1 ELISA positive sera. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the chosen antigen and assay protocol, SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA specificity may be significantly reduced in certain populations probably due to interference of immune responses to endemic pathogens like other viruses or parasites.","Emmerich, Petra; Murawski, Carolin; Ehmen, Christa; von Possel, Ronald; Pekarek, Neele; Oestereich, Lisa; Duraffour, Sophie; Pahlmann, Meike; Struck, Nicole; Eibach, Daniel; Krumkamp, Ralf; Amuasi, John; Maiga-Ascofaré, Oumou; Rakotozandrindrainy, Raphael; Asogun, Danny; Ighodalo, Yemisi; Kann, Simone; May, Jürgen; Tannich, Egbert; Deschermeier, Christina",Trop Med Int Health,343,16

Cloth masks are widely believed to impede droplet and aerosol transmission but most are constructed from materials with unknown filtration efficiency, airflow resistance and water resistance. Further, there has been no clear guidance on the most important performance metrics for the materials used by the general public (as opposed to high-risk healthcare settings). Here we provide data on a range of common fabrics that might be used to construct masks. None of the materials were suitable for masks meeting the N95 NIOSH standard, but many could provide useful filtration (>90%) of 3 micron particles (a plausible challenge size for human generated aerosols), with low pressure drop. These were: nonwoven sterile wraps, dried baby wipes and some double-knit cotton materials. Decontamination of N95 masks using isopropyl alcohol produces the expected increase in particle penetration, but for 3 micron particles, filtration efficiency is still well above 95%. Tightly woven thin fabrics, despite having the visual appearance of a good particle barrier, had remarkably low filtration efficiency and high pressure drop. These differences in filtration performance can be partly explained by the material structure; the better structures expose individual fibers to the flow while the poor materials may have small fundamental fibers but these are in tightly bundled yarns. The fit and use of the whole mask are critical factors not addressed in this work. Despite the complexity of the design of a very good mask, it is clear that for the larger aerosol particles, any mask will provide substantial protection to the wearer and those around them.","Rogak, Steven.

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries should inform the design of possible strategies to shield or vaccinate those at highest risk. METHODS: We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe disease (defined as those with at least one condition listed as ""at increased risk of severe COVID-19"" in current guidelines) by age (5-year age groups), sex, and country for 188 countries using prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 and UN population estimates for 2020. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection-hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection-hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies. FINDINGS: We estimated that 1·7 billion (UI 1·0-2·4) people, comprising 22% (UI 15-28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from <5% of those younger than 20 years to >66% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186-787) people (4% [3-9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from <1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6% (3-12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2-7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. INTERPRETATION: About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.

While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remain to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19-convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) double-positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies and TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by granzyme B (GzmB) expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully able to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Collectively, we provide a comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.IMPORTANCE Wuhan was the very first city hit by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the patients who experienced the longest phase of convalescence following COVID-19 reside here. This enabled us to investigate the ""immunological scar"" left by SARS-CoV-2 on cellular immunity after recovery from the disease. In this study, we characterized the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the immune system and provide a comprehensive picture of cellular immunity of a convalescent COVID-19 patient cohort with the longest recovery time. We revealed that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease; in particular, a profound NKT cell impairment was found in the convalescent phase of COVID-19.","Liu, Jia; Yang, Xuecheng; Wang, Hua; Li, Ziwei; Deng, Hui; Liu, Jing; Xiong, Shue; He, Junyi; Feng, Xuemei; Guo, Chunxia; Wang, Weixian; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy; Trilling, Mirko; Sutter, Kathrin; Senff, Tina; Menne, Christopher; Timm, Joerg; Zhang, Yanfang; Deng, Fei; Lu, Yinping; Wu, Jun; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Dittmer, Ulf; Wang, Baoju; Zheng, Xin",mBio (Online),343,21

How ethically demanding situations are handled affects employees' moral stress and job satisfaction. AIM: Describe priority-setting dilemmas, moral distress and support experienced by nurses and physicians across medical specialties in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Norway. RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional hospital-based survey was conducted from 23 April to 11 May 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval granted by the Regional Research Ethics Committee in Western Norway (131421). FINDINGS: Among the 1606 respondents, 67% had experienced priority-setting dilemmas the previous two weeks. Healthcare workers who were directly involved in COVID-19 care, were redeployed or worked in psychiatry/addiction medicine experienced it more often. Although 59% of the respondents had seen adverse consequences due to resource scarcity, severe consequences were rare. Moral distress levels were generally low (2.9 on a 0-10 scale), but higher in selected groups (redeployed, managers and working in psychiatry/addiction medicine). Backing from existing collegial and managerial structures and routines, such as discussions with colleagues and receiving updates and information from managers that listened and acted upon feedback, were found more helpful than external support mechanisms. Priority-setting guidelines were also helpful. DISCUSSION: By including all medical specialties, nurses and physicians, and various institutions, the study provides information on how the COVID-19 mitigation also influenced those not directly involved in the COVID-19 treatment of patients. In the next stages of the pandemic response, support for healthcare professionals directly involved in outbreak-affected patients, those redeployed or those most impacted by mitigation strategies must be a priority. CONCLUSION: Empirical research of healthcare workers experiences under a pandemic are important to identify groups at risks and useful support mechanisms.","Miljeteig, Ingrid; Forthun, Ingeborg; Hufthammer, Karl Ove; Engelund, Inger Elise; Schanche, Elisabeth; Schaufel, Margrethe; Onarheim, Kristine Husøy",Nurs Ethics,343,3

Bat-origin RaTG13 is currently the most phylogenetically related virus. Here we obtained the complex structure of the RaTG13 receptor binding domain (RBD) with human ACE2 (hACE2) and evaluated binding of RaTG13 RBD to 24 additional ACE2 orthologs. By substituting residues in the RaTG13 RBD with their counterparts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the major position found in variants of concern (VOCs) 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus. These results elucidate the receptor binding and host adaption mechanisms of RaTG13 and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) carried by animal reservoirs to prevent another spillover of CoVs.","Liu, Kefang; Pan, Xiaoqian; Li, Linjie; Yu, Feng; Zheng, Anqi; Du, Pei; Han, Pengcheng; Meng, Yumin; Zhang, Yanfang; Wu, Lili; Chen, Qian; Song, Chunli; Jia, Yunfei; Niu, Sheng; Lu, Dan; Qiao, Chengpeng; Chen, Zhihai; Ma, Dongli; Ma, Xiaopeng; Tan, Shuguang; Zhao, Xin; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F; Wang, Qihui",Cell,343,15

The largest positive trends are exhibited in the tropical nights index, and a clear anthropogenic signal is evident in the subtropical region. In the subtropical central Andes, there is a decrease in the frost days index and increases in the tropical nights and summer days indices, and an anthropogenic signal is evident. In the Patagonian region, all trends from the historical runs were significant, while the ones from the natural experiment were nonsignificant, showing the marked effect of anthropogenic forcing in this region in the extreme temperature events.

One striking fact that attracted media attention is that people seemed to be dying from COVID-19 at much higher rates in countries with male leaders. This paper goes a step further to see whether the exclusion of women more broadly from economic, social, and political life, as well as high levels of injustice and insecurity, also means that the countries are in bad shape when it comes to major pandemic risks. Investigating the statistical relationship in scores on the INFORM Epidemic Risk Index and the Women, Peace and Security Index for 167 countries, we find a strong statistical correlation which, while not proving causation, does point to key connections. Our analysis suggests that countries most at risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster that would overwhelm national response capacity are those where the status and well-being of women in the country are weak. This is not only harmful to women, but to everyone in society.","Klugman, Jeni Dahl Marianne Zou Bryan Haiwen",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,343,20

The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","Kirpich, Alexander; Koniukhovskii, Vladimir; Shvartc, Vladimir; Skums, Pavel; Weppelmann, Thomas A; Imyanitov, Evgeny; Semyonov, Semyon; Barsukov, Konstantin; Gankin, Yuriy",PLoS One,343,26

A survey assessed perceptions and practice differences between ENT and emergency department doctors. RESULTS: Each study arm examined 82 patients. Following the introduction of new ENT UK guidelines, ENT clinicians demonstrated significant changes in practice, unlike their emergency department counterparts. Survey results from emergency department doctors highlighted a lack of appreciation of guideline change and identified barriers to guideline uptake. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new management guidelines for tonsillitis and quinsy patients during the pandemic resulted in disparate uptake within ENT and emergency department departments at the tertiary centre.

These failures of the nation-state to adequately protect citizens have endangered indigenous communities but also opened a space for indigenous solidarity, organization, and institution building. The residents of Spiti Valley of Northern India initially attempted to organize against COVID-19 through the secular mechanisms of government in their district. When residents lost trust in their ability to work through official channels, monasteries transcended traditional and contemporary boundaries to cooperate with each other in developing the Committee for Preventive Measures and Sustainable Development (CPMSD). The CPMSD has successfully warded off COVID-19 through a variety of measures, including limiting incoming traffic, quarantine, education, contact tracing, and social distancing. In the process, the Spiti Valley has revitalized traditional structures of governance. Public health practitioners should carefully document how indigenous (and other) communities organize to combat COVID-19. This data – which may reveal practical as opposed to formal networks of authority – may assist current and future public health practitioners to decide how and with whom to invest scarce human resources.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV–host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the “Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong",Cell Discov.,343,16

These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 dialysis patients), but are applicable elsewhere. A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19, to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans. If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed. Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and inpatients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity. Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities.","Allen, Michael; Bhanji, Amir; Willemsen, Jonas; Dudfield, Steven; Logan, Stuart; Monks, Thomas",PLoS One,343,1

Studies distinguishing post-COVID conditions from late conditions caused by other etiologies are lacking. Using data from a large administrative all-payer database, we assessed the type, association, and timing of post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, October 20, 2020) data, during March-June 2020, 27,589 inpatients and 46,857 outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 (case-patients) were 1:1 matched with patients without COVID-19 through the 4-month follow-up period (control-patients) by using propensity score matching. In this matched-cohort study, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess for late conditions that were more common in case-patients compared with control-patients. Incidence proportion was calculated for conditions that were more common in case-patients than control-patients during 31-120 days following a COVID-19 encounter. RESULTS: During 31-120 days after an initial COVID-19 inpatient hospitalization, 7.0% of adults experienced at least one of five post-COVID conditions. Among adult outpatients with COVID-19, 7.7% experienced at least one of ten post-COVID conditions. During 31-60 days after an initial outpatient encounter, adults with COVID-19 were 2.8 times as likely to experience acute pulmonary embolism as outpatient control-patients and were also more likely to experience a range of conditions affecting multiple body systems (e.g. nonspecific chest pain, fatigue, headache, and respiratory, nervous, circulatory, and gastrointestinal system symptoms) than outpatient control-patients. Children with COVID-19 were not more likely to experience late conditions than children without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the evidence of late health conditions possibly related to COVID-19 in adults following COVID-19 diagnosis and can inform health care practice and resource planning for follow-up COVID-19 care.","Chevinsky, Jennifer R; Tao, Guoyu; Lavery, Amy M; Kukielka, Esther A; Click, Eleanor S; Malec, Donald; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Bruce, Beau B; Yusuf, Hussain; Goodman, Alyson B; Dixon, Meredith G; Nakao, Jolene H; Datta, S Deblina; Mac Kenzie, William R; Kadri, Sameer; Saydah, Sharon; Giovanni, Jennifer E; Gundlapalli, Adi V",Clin. infect. dis,343,24

All three conditions induce systemic inflammation via each pathomechanism-developed production of inflammatory cytokines. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, leading to an increase in Ang II levels. Ang II-induced coagulopathy comprising platelet activation, thrombin generation, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and endothelial injury causes thrombosis via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) DNA activate FXII, resulting in plasmin generation through FXIIa- and kallikrein-mediated plasminogen conversion to plasmin and bradykinin-induced tissue-type plasminogen activator release from the endothelium via the kinin B2 receptor. NETs induce immunothrombosis at the site of infection (lungs), through histone- and DNA-mediated thrombin generation, insufficient anticoagulation control, and inhibition of fibrinolysis. However, if the infection is sufficiently severe, immunothrombosis disseminates into the systemic circulation, and DIC, which is associated with the endothelial injury, occurs. Inflammation, and serine protease networks of coagulation and fibrinolysis, militate each other through complement pathways, which exacerbates three pathologies of COVID-19 coagulopathy. COVID-19 coagulopathy causes microvascular thrombosis and bleeding, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and death in critically ill patients. Treatment targets for improving the prognosis of COVID-19 coagulopathy include thrombin, plasmin, and inflammation, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several drugs are candidates for controlling these conditions; however, further advances are required to establish robust treatments based on a clear understanding of molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 coagulopathy.","Gando, Satoshi; Wada, Takeshi",Front Immunol,343,24

Method: This observational study from a UK Major Trauma Centre matched a cohort of patients admitted during a 10-week period of the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic (09/03/2020 to 18/05/2020) to a historical cohort admitted during a similar time period in 2019 (11/03/2019 to 20/05/ 2019). Demographic differences, injury method and severity were compared using Fisher's and Chi-squared tests. Multivariable logistic regression examined the associated factors predicting 30-day mortality. Results: Of 642 patients, 405 and 237 were in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively. 1.69%(4/237) of the 2020 cohort tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. There was a 41.5% decrease in trauma admissions in 2020. The 2020 cohort was older (median 46 vs.40 years), more comorbid and frailer (p&lt;0.0015). There was a significant difference in injury method with a decrease in vehicle related trauma, but an increase in falls. There was a 2-fold increased risk ofmortality in the 2020 cohort that in adjustedmodels, was explained by higher injury severity and frailty. Positive SARS-CoV-2 status was not associated with increasedmortality onmultivariable analysis.

It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","Calisti, Roberto",Epidemiol Prev,343,9

While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% UI 0·62-1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0·88, 0·66-1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0·88, 0·60-1·43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain parenchyma in quite a few patients, which provide undeniable evidence for the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus. In contrast with the cerebrum and cerebellum, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the olfactory system and the brainstem, both of which also showed severe microgliosis and lymphocytic infiltrations. As compared with the number of patients who underwent viral testing in the central nervous system (CNS), the number of patients showing positive results seems very small. However, it seems too early to conclude that the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is rare in COVID-19 patients because the detection methods or sampling procedures in some studies may not be suitable or sufficient to reveal the CNS infection induced by neurotropic viruses. Moreover, the primary symptoms and/or causes of death were distinctly different among examined patients, which probably caused more conspicuous pathological changes than those due to the direct infection that usually localized to specific brain areas. Unfortunately, most autopsy studies did not provide sufficient details about neurological symptoms or suspected diagnoses of the examined patients, and the documentation of neuropathological changes was often incomplete. Given the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the characteristics of neurotropic viruses, it is understandable that any study of the CNS infection may inevitably have limitations.","Li, Yan-Chao; Zhang, Yan; Tan, Bai-Hong",J Med Virol,343,10

These ulcers are painful and significantly reduce a person's quality of life. PUs are also expensive to manage and impact negatively on the achievement of cost-effective, efficient care delivery. METHOD: Prone positioning is a postural therapy that aims to enhance respiratory function through increasing oxygenation levels. In contemporary clinical practice, ventilation in the prone position is indicated for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, despite its advantages in terms of respiratory function, several studies have examined complications of prone position ventilation and have identified PUs (facial PUs as well as PUs on other weight-bearing areas of the body) as a frequent complication in patients who are already in a precarious medical situation. International data suggest that up to 57% of patients nursed in the prone position develop a PU. The aim of this clinical review is to identify and review evidence-based recommendations developed to facilitate the selection and application of preventive interventions aimed at reducing PU development in patients ventilated in the prone position. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, this review is timely as intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 require ventilation in the prone position at a level that is disproportionate to the general intensive care population. Up to 28% of patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed infection due to severe COVID-19 are cared for in the prone position. The scope of this review is limited to adult individuals only. RESULTS: The skin assessment should be undertaken before proning and following positioning the patient back into the supine position. Although it is essential to keep the skin clean and moisturised, using pH-balanced cleansers, there is inconsistency in terms of the evidence to support the type of moisturiser. Use of positioning devices in addition to repositioning is recommended to offload pressure points on the face and body. Further, using dressings such as hydrocolloids, transparent film and silicone may be of benefit in decreasing facial skin breakdown. CONCLUSION: Given the importance of PU prevention in this cohort of patients, adopting a focused prevention strategy, including skin assessment and care, offloading and pressure redistribution, and dressings for prevention may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of these largely preventable wounds.","Moore, Zena; Patton, Declan; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Natalie L; Curley, Gerard; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; O039,; Connor, Tom",J Wound Care,343,18

This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. METHODS: This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in AprilâJuly 2020. RESULTS: Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3-8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12-19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8-17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates.

In this paper, we provide a new multimodal (consisting of images, text and temporal information) labeled dataset containing news articles and tweets on the COVID-19 vaccine. We collected 2,593 news articles from 80 publishers for one year between Feb 16th 2020 to May 8th 2021 and 24184 Twitter posts (collected between April 17th 2021 to May 8th 2021). We combine ratings from two news media ranking sites: Medias Bias Chart and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) to classify the news dataset into two levels of credibility: reliable and unreliable. The combination of two filters allows for higher precision of labeling. We also propose a stance detection mechanism to annotate tweets into three levels of credibility: reliable, unreliable and inconclusive. We provide several statistics as well as other analytics like, publisher distribution, publication date distribution, topic analysis, etc. We also provide a novel architecture that classifies the news data into misinformation or truth to provide a baseline performance for this dataset. We find that the proposed architecture has an F-Score of 0.919 and accuracy of 0.882 for fake news detection. Furthermore, we provide benchmark performance for misinformation detection on tweet dataset. This new multimodal dataset can be used in research on COVID-19 vaccine, including misinformation detection, influence of fake COVID-19 vaccine information, etc.","Chen, Mingxuan; Chu, Xinqiao; Subbalakshmi, K.

The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on January 31 in Sweden and on February 26 in Norway. Despite being similar countries with universal healthcare systems, the governmental approaches to mitigation of the epidemic have varied considerably. Norway initiated a societal lockdown effective from March 12, the same day as the first confirmed death. Sweden has initiated a more laxed and gradual strategy based on the appeal for a strong personal sense of responsibility to mitigate the viral spread. In both countries, the first weeks of preparation has seen a strong reduction in elective surgery, with several implemented principles to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread and prepare for surgical care for COVID-19 diseases as needed.

High resolution radio observations were recently used to identify accreting massive BHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, with a significant fraction found to be non-nuclear. Here we present the first results of our optical follow-up of these radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) data from Gemini-North. We focus on the dwarf galaxy J1220+3020, which shows no clear optical AGN signatures in its nuclear SDSS spectrum covering the radio source. With our new IFU data, we confirm the presence of an active BH via the AGN coronal line [Fe X] and enhanced [O I] emission coincident with the radio source. Furthermore, we detect broad H$\alpha$ emission and estimate a BH mass of $M_{\rm BH}=10^{4.9}M_\odot$. We compare the narrow emission line ratios to standard BPT diagnostics and shock models. Spatially-resolved BPT diagrams show some AGN signatures, particularly in [O I]/H$\alpha$, but overall do not unambiguously identify the AGN. A comparison of our data to shock models clearly indicates shocked emission surrounding the AGN. The physical model most consistent with the data is an active BH with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) that both photoionizes and shock-excites the surrounding gas. We conclude that feedback is important in radio-selected BHs in dwarf galaxies, and that radio surveys may probe a population of low accretion-rate BHs in dwarf galaxies that cannot be detected through optical surveys alone.","Molina, M.; Reines, A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties. RESULTS: STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model. CONCLUSIONS: By combining information from real-world claims data and disease case counts data, STAN can better predict disease status and medical resource utilization.","Gao, Junyi; Sharma, Rakshith; Qian, Cheng; Glass, Lucas M; Spaeder, Jeffrey; Romberg, Justin; Sun, Jimeng; Xiao, Cao",J Am Med Inform Assoc,343,20

Since then, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to a growing number of deaths around the globe, as well as unparalleled economic and sociodemographic consequences. The disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel form of human coronavirus. Although coronavirus infections have been associated with neurological manifestations such as febrile seizures, convulsions, change in mental status, and encephalitis, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with neurological alterations in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical manifestations. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process, as well as the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, are still poorly understood. Glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, play pivotal roles in the brain response to neuroinflammatory insults and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, accumulating evidence has shown that those cells are targets of several neurotropic viruses that severely impact their function. Glial cell dysfunctions have been associated with several neuroinflammatory diseases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 likely has a primary effect on these cells in addition to a secondary effect from neuronal damage. Here, we provide an overview of these data and discuss the possible implications of glial cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the roles of microglia and astrocytes in brain inflammatory responses, we shed light on glial cells as possible drivers and potential targets of therapeutic strategies against neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. The main goal of this review is to highlight the need to consider glial involvement in the progression of COVID-19 and potentially include astrocytes and microglia as mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological damage.","Vargas, Gabriele; Medeiros Geraldo, Luiz Henrique; Gedeão Salomão, Natália; Viana Paes, Marciano; Regina Souza Lima, Flavia; Carvalho Alcantara Gomes, Flávia",Brain Behav Immun Health,343,16

In this review, we give an overview of the current literature regarding prevalence, diagnosis, and therapeutic options of recurrent CD. METHODS: We systematically screened the literature regarding recurrent and persistent Cushing's disease using the MESH term Cushing's disease and recurrence. Of 717 results in PubMed, all manuscripts in English and German published between 1980 and April 2020 were screened. Case reports, comments, publications focusing on pediatric CD or CD in veterinary disciplines or studies with very small sample size (patient number < 10) were excluded. Also, papers on CD in pregnancy were not included in this review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high incidence of recurrence in CD, annual clinical and biochemical follow-up is paramount. 50% of recurrences occur during the first 50 months after first surgery. In case of recurrence, treatment options include second surgery, pituitary radiation, targeted medical therapy to control hypercortisolism, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Success rates of all these treatment options vary between 25 (some of the medical therapy) and 100% (bilateral adrenalectomy). All treatment options have specific advantages, limitations, and side effects.

For each week during March 1, 2020 through December 26, 2020 (""pandemic period""), we compared the proportion of ED visits in each respiratory category with the proportion of visits in that category during the corresponding weeks of 2017-2019 (""pre-pandemic period""). We analyzed positivity of respiratory viral tests from two independent clinical laboratories. RESULTS: During March 2020, cough, shortness of breath, and influenza-like illness accounted for twice as many ED visits compared with the pre-pandemic period. During the last four months of 2020, all respiratory conditions, except shortness of breath, accounted for a smaller proportion of ED visits than during the pre-pandemic period. Percent positivity for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus were lower in 2020 than 2019. Although test volume decreased, percent positivity was higher for rhinovirus/enterovirus during the final weeks of 2020 compared with 2019; with ED visits similar to the pre-pandemic period. DISCUSSION: Broad reductions in respiratory test positivity and respiratory emergency department visits (excluding COVID-19) occurred during 2020. Interventions for mitigating spread of SARS-CoV-2 likely also reduced transmission of other pathogens.

Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 135 cases were analyzed in the study. The average age was 39.46±18.95 years. The ratio of males to females was 0.985:1. Most of COVID-19 patients were 18-45 years old (52.27%). Close contact history was the most common (37.88%), followed by residence history in Hubei (34.85%). There was no difference between males and females in age (P=0.953) and exposure condition (P=0.186). Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007). CONCLUSION: Among the cases, most patients were young adults. Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females. Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure. Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.","Li, Xiahong; Wang, Xue; Liu, Jun; Huang, Guangtao; Shi, Xiuquan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,343,1

Among various types of pneumonitis from different kinds of cancer treatments, immune-checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI pneumonitis) has been recognized as an important topic in the radiology and oncology communities in the past few years, given increasing clinical indications for ICI therapy in patients with cancer. Moreover, clinical applications of ICI continue to advance rapidly with novel combination approaches, leading to further emerging challenges. This focused review describes the current knowledge of ICI pneumonitis and discusses several newly emerging issues involving recurrence and flare of ICI pneumonitis, as well as involving pneumonitis from new combination approaches including ICI with EGFR inhibitors and ICI with radiotherapy. The article concludes with a summary of unmet needs in the care of patients with ICI pneumonitis, as well as of future directions in the advancement of knowledge and patient care for ICI pneumonitis. Given the demonstrated multifaceted value of imaging in ICI pneumonitis, radiologists will remain central in the ongoing multidisciplinary journey to further understand and overcome this challenging toxicity for patients with cancer.","Nishino, Mizuki",,343,1

Here, we explored the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission inventory, in-situ air quality observations and a localized chemical transport modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially affected by the pandemic, with a higher reduction for NOx (75.9%, 125.3 Mg/day) compared to VOCs (53.1%, 52.9 Mg/day). Unexpectedly, our results show that the imbalanced emission abatement of NOx and VOCs from vehicles led to a significant rise of the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in urban areas, but only resulting in modest increases in secondary aerosols due to the inadequate precursors. However, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors, which is mainly responsible for Beijing haze during the lockdown period. Our results indicate that the winter haze in Beijing was insensitive to the local vehicular emissions reduction due to the complicated nonlinear response of the fine particle and air pollutant emissions. We suggest mitigation policies should focus on accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reduction and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission control.","Lv, Zhaofeng; Wang, Xiaotong; Deng, Fanyuan; Ying, Qi; Archibald, Alexander T.; Jones, Roderic L.; Ding, Yan; Cheng, Ying; Fu, Mingliang; Liu, Ying; Man, Hanyang; Xue, Zhigang; He, Kebin; Hao, Jiming; ESPC, Huan Liu State Key Joint Laboratory of; Sources, State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of; Complex, Control of Air Pollution; Innovation, International Joint Laboratory on Low Carbon Clean Energy; Environment, School of the; University, Tsinghua; China,; Civil, Zachry Department of; Engineering, Environmental; University, Texas AM; USA,; Science, Centre for Atmospheric; Chemistry, Department of; Cambridge, University of; UK,; Sciences, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental; Institute, Beijing Transport",,343,20

We performed a meta-analysis aimed at comprehensively summarizing the clinical characteristics and laboratory abnormalities correlated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were systematically searched for studies considering the relationship between COVID-19 and mortality up to 4 June 2020. Data were extracted including clinical characteristics and laboratory examination. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies involving 9407 COVID-19 patients were included. Dyspnea (OR = 4.52, 95%CI [3.15, 6.48], P < 0.001), chest tightness (OR = 2.50, 95%CI [1.78, 3.52], P<0.001), hemoptysis (OR = 2.00, 95%CI [1.02, 3.93], P = 0.045), expectoration (OR = 1.52, 95%CI [1.17, 1.97], P = 0.002) and fatigue (OR = 1.27, 95%CI [1.09, 1.48], P = 0.003) were significantly related to increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, increased pretreatment absolute leukocyte count (OR = 11.11, 95%CI [6.85,18.03], P<0.001) and decreased pretreatment absolute lymphocyte count (OR = 9.83, 95%CI [6.72, 14.38], P<0.001) were also associated with increased mortality of COVID-19. We also compared the mean value of them between survivors and non-survivors, and found that non-survivors showed significantly raise in pretreatment absolute leukocyte count (WMD: 3.27×109/L, 95%CI [2.34, 4.21], P<0.001) and reduction in pretreatment absolute lymphocyte count (WMD = -0.39×109/L, 95%CI [-0.46, -0.33], P<0.001) compared with survivors. The results of pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT), D-Dimer and ferritin showed the similar trend with pretreatment absolute leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Among the common symptoms of COVID-19 infections, fatigue, expectoration, hemoptysis, dyspnea and chest tightness were independent predictors of death. As for laboratory examinations, significantly increased pretreatment absolute leukocytosis count, LDH, PCT, D-Dimer and ferritin, and decreased pretreatment absolute lymphocyte count were found in non-survivors, which also have an unbeneficial impact on mortality among COVID-19 patients. Motoring these indicators during the hospitalization plays a very important role in predicting the prognosis of patients.","Yang, Lan; Jin, Jing; Luo, Wenxin; Gan, Yuncui; Chen, Bojiang; Li, Weimin",PLoS One,343,1

The purpose of the present study was to: (1) compare sleep health across the lifespan, (2) determine lifestyle factors associated with sleep health, and (3) examine whether lifestyle factors associated with sleep health varied between and within age groups. Participants consisted of 3284 individuals (Mean age = 42.70; 45% male) who participated in a cross-sectional online survey of sleep and health. Sleep health was measured using the RU-SATED scale, while demographic and lifestyle factors (e.g., daily social media use, sedentary activity, fast food consumption, etc.) were all self-reported. Sleep health was the highest among older adults (M = 8.09) followed by middle-aged (M = 7.65) and younger adults (M = 7.16). Across age groups, fast-food consumption, daily regularity, and daily TV, social media, or internet use were all negatively correlated with sleep health (ps < 0.05). Few differences in the association between lifestyle factors and sleep health across age groups were found. Overall, these findings may help to inform sleep health promotion efforts by targeting the most pertinent lifestyle factors for promoting sleep health.","Dzierzewski, Joseph M; Sabet, Sahar M; Ghose, Sarah M; Perez, Elliottnell; Soto, Pablo; Ravyts, Scott G; Dautovich, Natalie D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),343,1

We aimed to identify mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in IPV among SGM, focusing on childhood experiences of violence, structural inequalities, and sexual minority stress. METHOD: 308 SGM assigned female-at-birth (AFAB; 82 White, 133 Black, 93 Latinx; age 16-31) self-reported on minor psychological, severe psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and three proposed mechanisms: childhood violence (child abuse, witnessing interparental violence), structural inequalities (economic stress, racial discrimination), and sexual minority stressors (internalized heterosexism, anti-SGM victimization, low social support). Indirect effects of race on IPV victimization via hypothesized mechanisms were estimated using logistic regression with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS: Compared to White participants, Black participants were 2.5-7.03 times more likely to report all eight IPV types; Latinx participants were 2.5-4.8 times more likely to experience four IPV types. Univariate indirect effects analyses indicated that these racial/ethnic disparities were partially explained by higher economic stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and childhood violence experiences (for Black and Latinx participants) and lower social support (Black participants). In multivariate models, the most robust indirect effects were through racial/ethnic discrimination and childhood violence. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the need for policy and interventions aimed at preventing IPV among SGM-POC by targeting factors that contribute to IPV disparities in this group, particularly racial/ethnic discrimination and family violence.

The way the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the cell is a complex process and comprises four main stages: attachment to the cognate receptor, cellular entry, replication and cellular egress. Since, this is a multi-part process, it creates many opportunities to develop effective interventions. Targeting binding of the virus to the host receptor in order to prevent its entry has been of particular interest. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, among 56 tested polyphenols, including plant extracts, brazilin, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, and curcumin displayed the highest binding with the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, inhibiting viral attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and thus cellular entry of pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 virions. Both, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate at 25 µg/ml and curcumin above 10 µg/ml concentration, showed binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor reducing at the same time its activity in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Our study also demonstrates that brazilin and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, and to a still greater extent, curcumin, decrease the activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 both in cell-free and cell-based assays. Similar pattern was observed with cathepsin L, although only theaflavin-3,3'-digallate showed a modest diminution of cathepsin L expression at protein level. Finally, each of these three compounds moderately increased endosomal/lysosomal pH. In conclusion, this study demonstrates pleiotropic anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of specific polyphenols and their prospects for further scientific and clinical investigations.","Goc, Anna; Sumera, Waldemar; Rath, Matthias; Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra",PLoS One,343,24

The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection. However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia). Transcriptional aspects of three core elements - pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses - were interrogated. Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity. RESULTS: The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance. Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses. Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling. The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling. The immune-associated host transcriptional signatures of COVID-19 hold promise as a tool for improving COVID-19 diagnosis and indicating disease severity.","Zhang, Haocheng; Ai, Jing-Wen; Yang, Wenjiao; Zhou, Xian; He, Fusheng; Xie, Shumei; Zeng, Weiqi; Li, Yang; Yu, Yiqi; Gou, Xuejing; Li, Yongjun; Wang, Xiaorui; Su, Hang; Xu, Teng; Zhang, Wenhong",Clin. infect. dis,343,23

METHODS: U.S. adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the HeartlineTM clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the HeartlineTM mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. RESULTS: Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report. CONCLUSIONS: Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

The article used backcasting approach to link expected development objectives and targets with current state of social and economic conditions. Results demonstrated a gap between long-term and current economic performance, attributable largely to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and society. A drastic decline in aggregate demand due to contraction in household and corporate expenditure, investment, and exports sparked a surge in open unemployment and underemployment. While swift and wide-ranging government response helped to attenuate the impact of the crisis on the economy and vulnerable sections of society, COVID-19 pandemic impact compounded existing fundamental problems facing the Indonesian economy including de-industrialization, wide urban–rural, East–West, inter-regional digital divide;unemployment and underemployment;weak human resource development;low participation in global value chains;and low education effectiveness. Policy recommendations to nudge the economy and society back to its long-term development trajectory include initiatives to enhance emergency response program effectiveness and tackling structural problems. The initiatives include strengthening and widening the coverage of government programs that support business and society in education, labor and employment, and SME and trade. The thrust of the pathways stresses the need for accelerating the implementation of the national information highway and the ASEAN connectivity initiative.

The impacts of proposed alternatives on reducing infection risk are unknown. Objective: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with the risks and benefits of standard radiation therapy (RT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used estimated individual patient-level data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier survival figures from 8 randomized clinical trials across oncology from 1993 to 2014 that evaluated the inclusion of RT or compared different RT fractionation regimens. Included trials were Dutch TME and TROG 01.04 examining rectal cancer; CALGB 9343, OCOG hypofractionation trial, FAST-Forward, and NSABP B-39 examining early stage breast cancer, and CHHiP and HYPO-RT-PC examining prostate cancer. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality associated with receipt of RT in the treatment arms were simulated and trials were reanalyzed. Data were analyzed between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 risk associated with treatment was simulated across different pandemic scenarios, varying infection risk per fractions (IRFs) and case fatality rates (CFRs). Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modeling under different pandemic scenarios. Results: Estimated IPLD from a total of 14â¯170 patients were included in the simulations. In scenarios with low COVID-19-associated risks (IRF, 0.5%; CFR, 5%), fractionation was not significantly associated with outcomes. In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course RT was associated with better outcomes than long-course chemoradiation (TROG 01.04) and was associated with similar outcomes as RT omission (Dutch TME) in most settings (eg, TROG 01.04 median HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.46-0.96]; Dutch TME median HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.80-1.03] in a scenario with IRF 5% and CFR 20%). Moderate hypofractionation in early stage breast cancer (OCOG hypofractionation trial) and prostate cancer (CHHiP) was not associated with survival benefits in the setting of COVID-19 (eg, OCOG hypofractionation trial median HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.06]; CHHiP median HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.01] under high-risk scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%). More aggressive hypofractionation (FAST-Forward, HYPO-RT-PC) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (NSABP B-39) were associated with improved survival in higher risk scenarios (eg, FAST-Forward median HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.68]; HYPO-RT-PC median HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.48-0.75] under scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study of data from 8 clinical trials of patients receiving radiation therapy to simulate COVID-19 risk and mortality rates, treatment modification was not associated with altered risk from COVID-19 in lower-risk scenarios and was only associated with decreased mortality in very high COVID-19-risk scenarios. This model, which can be adapted to dynamic changes in COVID-19 risk, provides a flexible, quantitative approach to assess the potential impact of treatment modifications and supports the continued delivery of standard evidence-based care with appropriate precautions against COVID-19.","Tabrizi, Shervin; Trippa, Lorenzo; Cagney, Daniel; Aizer, Ayal A; Tanguturi, Shyam; Ventz, Steffen; Fell, Geoffrey; Bellon, Jennifer R; Mamon, Harvey; Nguyen, Paul L; D039,; Amico, Anthony V; Haas-Kogan, Daphne; Alexander, Brian M; Rahman, Rifaquat",JAMA Netw Open,343,5

The typical symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, evolving to a clinical picture of pneumonia and, ultimately, death. Nausea and diarrhea are equally frequent, suggesting viral infection or transmission via the gastrointestinal-enteric system. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is cleaved by transmembrane proteases during host cells infection, thus reducing its activities. ACE2 is a relevant player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the aminoacid transporter B0AT1. It has been suggested that B0AT1/ACE2 complex in the intestinal epithelium regulates gut microbiota (GM) composition and function, with important repercussions on local and systemic immune responses against pathogenic agents, namely virus. Notably, productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2+ mature human enterocytes and patients' GM dysbiosis was recently demonstrated. This review outlines the evidence linking abnormal ACE2 functions with the poor outcomes (higher disease severity and mortality rate) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing age-related comorbidities and addresses a possible role for GM dysbiosis. The article culminates with the therapeutics opportunities based on these pathways.","Viana, Sofia D; Nunes, Sara; Reis, Flávio",Ageing Res Rev,343,5

Mucosal immunity, particularly salivary antibodies, may be short-lived although long-term studies are lacking. METHODS: Using a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3). RESULTS: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to nine months post-recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At nine months, IgG remained in both blood and saliva in majority of patients. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with a recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appeared stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. This non-invasive saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody test with home self-collection may therefore serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.","Alkharaan, Hassan; Bayati, Shaghayegh; Hellström, Cecilia; Aleman, Soo; Olsson, Annika; Lindahl, Karin; Bogdanovic, Gordana; Healy, Katie; Tsilingaridis, Georgios; De Palma, Patricia; Hober, Sophia; Månberg, Anna; Nilsson, Peter; Pin, Elisa; Sällberg Chen, Margaret",J. infect. dis,343,20

We examined the transport of aerosols similar in size to human respiratory aerosols (0.3-10 $\mu$m) in representative locations, such as high-traffic areas and restrooms. In restrooms, the observed decay of aerosol concentrations was consistent with well-mixed air exchange. In all other locations, fast decay times were measured, which were found to be independent of aerosol size (typically a few minutes). From this, we conclude that in the main retail areas, including at checkouts, rapid turbulent mixing and advection is the dominant feature in aerosol dynamics. With this, the upper bound of risk for airborne disease transmission to a susceptible is determined by direct exposure to the exhalation cloud of an infectious. For the example of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we find when speaking without a face mask and aerosol sizes up to an exhalation (wet) diameter of 50 $\mu$m, a distance of 1.5 m to be unsafe. However, at the smallest distance between an infectious and a susceptible, while wearing typical surgical masks and for all sizes of exhaled aerosol, the upper bound of infection risk is only $\sim 5\%$ and decreases further by a factor of 100 ($\sim 0.05\%$) for typical FFP2 masks for a duration of 20 minutes. This upper bound is very conservative and we expect the actual risk for typical encounters to be much lower. The risks found here are comparable to what might be expected in calm outdoor weather.","Hejazi, Bardia; Schlenczek, Oliver; Thiede, Birte; Bagheri, Gholamhossein; Bodenschatz, Eberhard",,343,26

Serious hemorrhagic complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, have also been recognized. However, intra-abdominal hemorrhage is under-recognized because of its rare occurrence, despite high mortality. Here, we discuss two cases of spontaneous iliopsoas hematoma (IPH) likely caused by anticoagulants during the clinical course of COVID-19. We also explored published case reports to identify clinical characteristics of IPH in COVID-19 patients. The use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of lethal IPH among COVID-19 patients becsuse of scarce data on optimal dosage and adequate monitoring of anticoagulant effects.

These attributes are complementary to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing, which may be used to inform community seroprevalence rates. METHODS: The Luminex xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen assay utilizes magnetic beads labeled with three viral antigens (nucleocapsid [NC], receptor binding domain [RBD], spike S1 subunit) to detect anti-viral IgG-class antibodies, and has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in serum and plasma. This assay was modified for use with DBS and validated against paired sera tested by one of two reference assays: the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA or the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. RESULTS: 159 paired DBS and serum specimens analyzed using the modified Luminex xMAP assay on DBS and the reference methods on serum showed an overall concordance of 96.9% (154/159). Use of multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR) for post-analytical interpretation of the Luminex xMAP DBS assay results, instead of manufacturer provided interpretive thresholds, increased overall qualitative result concordance to 99.4% (158/159) between the modified Luminex xMAP DBS and reference results. CONCLUSIONS: Use of DBS for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provides comparable results to those obtained using serum. DBS concordance was improved with multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR). We demonstrate that DBS are a reliable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using the modified Luminex xMAP assay.","Turgeon, Coleman T; Sanders, Karen A; Rinaldo, Piero; Granger, Dane; Hilgart, Heather; Matern, Dietrich; Theel, Elitza S",PLoS One,343,23

Investment in research solutions has been demonstrated to yield health and a 9.8-fold return economic benefit. The sector, however, is severely challenged with success rates of traditional peer-reviewed funding in decline. Here, we aimed to understand the perceived challenges faced by the cardiovascular workforce in Australia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used an online survey distributed across Australian cardiovascular societies/councils, universities and research institutes over a period of 6 months during 2019, with 548 completed responses. Inclusion criteria included being an Australian resident or an Australian citizen who lived overseas, and a current or past student or employee in the field of cardiovascular research. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 42±13 years, 47% were male, 85% had a full-time position, and 40% were a group leader or laboratory head. Twenty-three per cent (23%) had permanent employment, and 82% of full-time workers regularly worked >40 hours/week. Sixty-eight per cent (68%) said they had previously considered leaving the cardiovascular research sector. If their position could not be funded in the next few years, a staggering 91% of respondents would leave the sector. Compared to PhD- and age-matched men, women were less likely to be a laboratory head and to feel they had a long-term career path as a cardiovascular researcher, while more women were unsure about future employment and had considered leaving the sector (all p<0.05). Greater job security (76%) and government and philanthropic investment in cardiovascular research (72%) were highlighted by responders as the main changes to current practices that would encourage them to stay.

Quantifying the risk of mortality is challenging because of high relative prevalence of asymptomatic and non-specific disease manifestations. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between CYP who have died of SARS-CoV-2 and those who have died of an alternative disease process but coincidentally tested positive. MethodsDuring the pandemic, the mandatory National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) was linked to Public Health England (PHE) testing data to identify CYP (<18 years) who died with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. A clinical review of all deaths from March 2020 to February 2021 was undertaken to differentiate between those who died of SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who died of an alternative cause but coincidentally tested positive. Then, using linkage to national hospital admission data, demographic and comorbidity details of CYP who died of SARS-CoV-2 were compared to all other deaths. Absolute risk of death was estimated where denominator data were available. Findings3105 CYP died from all causes during the first pandemic year in England. 61 of these deaths occurred in CYP who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 25 CYP died of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 22 from acute infection and three from PIMS-TS. 99{middle dot}995% of CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test survived. The 25 CYP who died of SARS-CoV-2 equates to a mortality rate of 2/million for the 12,023,568 CYP living in England.

The World Health Organization’s subsequent declaration of this outbreak as a public health emergency of international importance was, if anything, an understatement. The emergence of this pathogen is best seen as the latest and globally one of the most important examples of emerging infectious diseases–a phenomenon that has been at the forefront of global health for several decades. We trace the initial experience with COVID-19, highlighting experiences in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. We emphasize selected countries, with varied demographic, socioeconomic, and political profiles, and identify instructive lessons from these national and regional experiences in terms of the efficacy of responses. Previous experience with serious epidemics of emerging infectious disease, well developed public health infrastructure, early, well-coordinated and transparent communication, rapidly established surveillance, case ascertainment, contact tracing, and containment are all vitally important in the control of this disease.","Mayer, Jonathan D.; Lewis, Nancy Davis",Eurasian Geogr.

A description of the current literature relating to COVID-19 infection in children and the associated inflammatory condition, paediatric multi-inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). What advances does it highlight? Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a distinct clinical phenotype when compared to adults. This may relate to relative differences in their adaptive immunity and in the degree and distribution of expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). There are several similarities between PIMS-TS, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and other known inflammatory disorders such as macrophage activation syndrome. Few data are available to date regarding vaccination responses of children against COVID-19. ABSTRACT: Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a clinical phenotype that is distinct from that observed in adult cases. They can present with a range of respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, or with a delayed hyperinflammatory syndrome (paediatric multisystem inflammatory system temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2; PIMS-TS) that frequently requires treatment in an intensive care unit. These manifestations may be related to unique expression of transmembrane receptors and immune physiology in children. The clinical features and inflammatory profile of PIMS-TS are similar to other inflammatory disorders that occur in children such as Kawasaki disease, macrophage activation syndrome and sepsis. Given children are infected less frequently and have less severe disease due to COVID-19 compared to adults, their physiological profile is of great interest. An understanding of the unique mechanisms of infection and disease in children could aid the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Like adults, children can have long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neurological and cardiac morbidity. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is not yet authorised in children aged <12 years, and hence we anticipate ongoing paediatric presentations of COVID-19 in the coming months.","Clark, John A; Pathan, Nazima",Exp. physiol,343,26

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is the first time that a pathogen's spread across the globe has been extensively monitored by direct detection of the pathogen itself rather just than the morbidity left in its wake, indicates such heterogeneity is not limited to outcomes of infections but whether infection of a particular host occurs at all. This suggests an important role for yet to be discovered environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors that influence whether an exposure to the virus initiates a productive infection and, moreover, the severity of disease that results. This article discusses the emerging hypothesis that the composition of a host's commensal microbial communities, that is, its 'microbiome', may be one such determinant that influences outcomes following encounters with respiratory viral pathogens in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular. Specifically, we will review the rationales and evidence that supports this hypothesis and, moreover, speculate as to possible approaches to manipulate microbiota to ameliorate disease induced by respiratory viral pathogens.","Ngo, Vu L; Gewirtz, Andrew T",Curr Opin Virol,343,1

However, the evidence regarding their response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the agent responsible for COVID-19 is scant. Herein we present the clinical course of the SARSCoV- 2 infection in four pediatric patients that had underwent visceral transplantation. Methods: pediatric patients (3 with mulvisceral transplant and 1 hepatointestinal transplant;median age: 13,75 years, range: 12-17 years) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by nucleic acid amplification test, antigen test or serologic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM detection. Lymphocytes count, clinical signs and seroconversion were assessed. Results:3/4 consulted for symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and had a mild clinical presentation. Patient I: headache and muscle pain, Patient II: Anosmia and agusia, cough and rhinorrhea, Patient III: sore throat, cough and rhinorrhea. Patient IV was asymptomatic and consult for epidemiological environment. Lymphocytes count at the time of diagnosis was between normal range (media: 3600 cells/ul of blood, range 2600-4600 cells/ul of blood) and, interestingly, no gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Of note, immunosuppression was not suspended nor diminished during the episode. 4/4 were receiving Tacrolimus (blood levels: median 7.7ng/ ml, range: 6.7-8.4 ng/ml) and 3/4 also corticoids (median 5 mg/day, range 2-10 mg/day). Finally, until today we could detect specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum after recovery in 3 of the patients (one is still pending). Conclusion: The results presented here suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients with visceral transplantation is asymptomatic/mild. Interestingly, despite their graft altered immune status, no gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. Additionally, despite the high immunosuppression levels used, seroconversion was achieved in all patients so far. All together, these results suggest that collaboration between B and T cells was not affected by the pharmacological treatment and that pediatric patients would not constitute a risk group.","Papa-gobbi, R.; Serradilla, J.; Bueno, A.; Serrano-Fernández, P.; González-Sacristan, R.; Alcolea-Sánchez, A.; Hernández-Oliveros, F.; Ramos-Boluda, E.; Papa-Gobbi, R.",Transplantation,343,15

Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested as a potential risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although its impact on the prognosis of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is associated with hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (n = 220) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were categorized as follows: <10 ng/mL, 10 to <20 ng/mL, 20 to <30 ng/mL, and &#8805;30 ng/mL, and <10 ng/mL and &#8805;10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and the secondary outcomes were the rate of patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hospital length of stay when the 4 25(OH)D categories were compared (P = 0.120). Patients exhibiting 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL showed a trend (P = 0.057) for longer hospital length of stay compared with those with 25(OH)D &#8805;10 ng/mL [9.0 d (95% CI: 6.4, 11.6 d) vs. 7.0 d (95% CI: 6.6, 7.4 d)]. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard models showed no significant associations between 25(OH)D and primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, those with severe 25(OH)D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) exhibited a trend for longer hospital length of stay compared with patients with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. This association was not significant in the multivariable Cox regression model. Prospective studies should test whether correcting severe 25(OH)D deficiency could improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Reis, Bruna Z; Fernandes, Alan L; Sales, Lucas P; Santos, Mayara D; Dos Santos, Caroline C; Pinto, Ana J; Goessler, Karla F; Franco, Andre S; Duran, Camila S C; Silva, Carla B R; Macêdo, Marina B; Dalmolin, Henrique H H; Baggio, Janaína; Balbi, Guilherme G M; Antonangelo, Leila; Caparbo, Valeria F; Gualano, Bruno; Murai, Igor H; Pereira, Rosa M R",Am. j. clin. nutr,343,28

It is incumbent on health professional associations to assist their membership in defining and preparing for AI-related change. Health professional associations, or the national groups convened to represent the interests of the members of a profession, play a unique role in establishing the sociocultural, normative, and regulative elements of health care professions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a proposed study of how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, health professional associations engage in sensemaking and legitimization of change to support their membership in preparing for future practice. METHODS: An exploratory multi-case study approach will be used. This study will be informed by the normalization process theory (NPT), which suggests behavioral constructs required for complex change, providing a novel lens through which to consider the agency of macrolevel actors in practice change. A total of 4 health professional associations will be studied, each representing an instrumental case and related fields selected for their early consideration of AI technologies. Data collection will consist of key informant interviews, observation of relevant meetings, and document review. Individual and collective sensemaking activities and action toward change will be identified using stakeholder network mapping. A hybrid inductive and deductive model will be used for a concurrent thematic analysis, mapping emergent themes against the NPT framework to assess fit and identify areas of discordance. RESULTS: As of January 2021, we have conducted 17 interviews, with representation across the 4 health professional associations. Of these 17 interviews, 15 (88%) have been transcribed. Document review is underway and complete for one health professional association and nearly complete for another. Observation opportunities have been challenged by competing priorities during COVID-19 and may require revisiting. A linear cross-case analytic approach will be taken to present the data, highlighting both guidance for the implementation of AI and implications for the application of NPT at the macro level. The ability to inform consideration of AI will depend on the degree to which the engaged health professional associations have considered this topic at the time of the study and, hence, what priority it has been assigned within the health professional association and what actions have been taken to consider or prepare for it. The fact that this may differ between health professional associations and practice environments will require consideration throughout the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, this protocol outlines a case study approach to understand how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, health professional associations engage in sensemaking and legitimization of change to support their membership in preparing for future practice.

In those patients who develop worsening pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high concentrations of oxygen may need to be administered for prolonged time periods, often together with mechanical ventilation. Hyperoxia, although lifesaving and essential for maintaining adequate oxygenation in the short-term, may have adverse long-term consequences upon lung parenchymal structure and function. How hyperoxia per se impacts lung disease in COVID-19 has remained largely unexplored. Numbers of experimental studies have previously established that hyperoxia is associated with deleterious outcomes inclusive of: perturbations in immunologic responses; abnormal metabolic function and alterations in hemodynamics and alveolar barrier function. Such changes may ultimately progress into clinically evident lung injury, adverse remodeling and result in parenchymal fibrosis when exposure is prolonged. Given that significant exposure to hyperoxia in patients with severe COVID-19 may be unavoidable to preserve life, these sequelae of hyperoxia, superimposed on the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus may well impact pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Hanidziar, Dusan; Robson, Simon C","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",343,24

Before an effective vaccine is available, the development of potential treatments for resultant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial. One of the disease hallmarks is hyper-inflammatory responses, which usually leads to a severe lung disease. Patients with COVID-19 also frequently suffer from neurological symptoms such as acute diffuse encephalomyelitis, brain injury and psychiatric complications. The metabolic pathway of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a dynamic regulator of various cell types and disease processes, including the nervous system. It has been demonstrated that S1P and its metabolic enzymes, regulating neuroinflammation and neurogenesis, exhibit important functions during viral infection. S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) analogues including AAL-R and RP-002 inhibit pathophysiological responses at the early stage of H1N1 virus infection and then play a protective role.

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Dandan; Qian, Yuxing",J Med Internet Res,343,1

Here, we combine both human mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions (social-distancing and suspected-cases isolation) into SEIR transmission model to understand how coronavirus transmits in a global environment. Dynamic trends of region-specific time-variant reproduction number, social-distancing rate, work-resumption rate, and suspected-cases isolation rate have been estimated and plotted for each region by fitting stochastic transmission processes to the real total confirmed cases reported of each region. We find after shutdown in Wuhan, the reproduction number in Wuhan greatly declined from 6·982 (95% CI 2·558-14·668) on January 23rd, 2020 to 1.130 (95% CI 0.289-3.279) on February 7th, 2020, and there was a higher intervention level in terms of social-distancing and suspected-cases isolation in Wuhan than the Chinese average and Western average, for the period from the shutdown in Wuhan to mid-March. Future epidemic trajectories of Western countries up to October 10th, 2020, have been predicted with 95% confidence intervals. Through the scenario simulation, we discover the benefits of earlier international travel ban and rigorous intervention strategies, and the significance of non-pharmaceutical interventions. From a global perspective, it is vital for each country to control the risks of imported cases, and execute rigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions before successful vaccination development.","Yang, Tianan; Liu, Yexin; Deng, Wenhao; Zhao, Weigang; Deng, Jianwei",Sci Rep,343,21

The drugs used for experimental COVID-19 therapies were included in this study using the same method for comparison with turmeric components. The 30 turmeric compounds and nine drugs were performed in the docking procedure for vital proteins of COVID-19. With evaluations based on docking scores, the Prime MMGBSA binding free energy and protein-ligand interactions were identified in detail. The 100 ns MD simulations were also performed to assess the stability of the ligands at the binding site of the target proteins. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is used to obtain the average displacement for a particular frame concerning a reference frame. The results of this study are suggesting that turmeric spice have a potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins and can be use a therapeutic or protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting key protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The compound 4, 23 and 6 are the most prominent inhibitor for the main protease, the spike glycoprotein and RNA polymerase of virus, respectively. The MD simulation validated the stability of ligand-protein interactions. The compactness of the complexes was shown using a radius of gyration.

OBJECTIVE: To review current knowledge on sexual health-related containment measures during pandemics, specifically COVID-19, and focus on 2 main areas: intimacy and relational dynamics and clinical effects on sexual health. METHODS: We carried out a literature search encompassing sexual health and pandemic issues using Entrez-PubMed and Google Scholar. We reviewed the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual health regarding transmission and safe sex practices, pregnancy, dating and intimacy amid the pandemic, benefits of sex, and impact on sexual dysfunctions. RESULTS: Coronavirus transmission occurs via inhalation and touching infected surfaces. Currently, there is no evidence it is sexually transmitted, but there are sexual behaviors that pose a higher risk of infectivity due to asymptomatic carriers. Nonmonogamy plays a key role in transmission hubs. New dating possibilities and intimacy issues are highlighted. Sexual activity has a positive impact on the immune response, psychological health, and cognitive function and could mitigate psychosocial stressors. COVID-19 pandemic affects indirectly the sexual function with implications on overall health. CONCLUSION: Increased awareness of health-care providers on sexual health implications related to the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. Telemedicine has an imperative role in allowing continued support at times of lockdown and preventing worsening of the sexual, mental, and physical health after the pandemic. This is a broad overview addressing sexual issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As this is an unprecedented global situation, little is known on sexuality related to pandemics.

We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We use changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that Rt was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

Some old drugs have shown clinical benefits after a few small clinical trials that attracted great attention. Clinically, however, many drugs, including those currently used in COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, may cause cardiotoxicity by acting on cardiac potassium channels, especially hERG channel through their off-target effects. The blocking of the hERG channel prolongs QT intervals on electrocardiograms; thus, it might induce severe ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, while focusing on the efficacy of COVID-19 drugs, the fact that they block hERG channels to cause arrhythmias cannot be ignored. To develop safer and more effective drugs, it is necessary to understand the interactions between drugs and the hERG channel and the molecular mechanism behind this high affinity. In this review, we focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanistic aspects of drug-related blockade of the hERG channel to provide insights into QT prolongation caused by off-label use of related drugs in COVID-19, and hope to weigh the risks and benefits when using these drugs.","Zequn, Zheng; Yujia, Wu; Dingding, Qian; Jiangfang, Lian",Eur J Pharmacol,343,16

In response, severely affected countries have had to impose a range of public health strategies achieved via nonpharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: 1) ""mitigation,"" which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and 2) ""suppression,"" aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterized to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United Kingdom, we assessed the long-term prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. Our modeling confirmed that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is possible with plausible levels of social distancing over a period of months, consistent with observed trends. Notably, our modeling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly defined forces. Specifically, we found that 1) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, 2) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be adaptive over time in a precise yet unfeasible way, and 3) social distancing must be maintained for an extended period to ensure the healthcare system is not overwhelmed.","Brett, Tobias S; Rohani, Pejman",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,343,10

The use of selenium as a tool in organic synthesis and as a pharmacological agent goes back to the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of ebselen and its investigation in clinical trials have motivated the search for new organoselenium molecules with pharmacological properties. Although ebselen and diselenides have some overlapping pharmacological properties, their molecular targets are not identical. However, they have similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, possibly, via activation of transcription factors, regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. In short, our knowledge about the pharmacological properties of simple organoselenium compounds is still elusive. However, contrary to our early expectations that they could imitate selenoproteins, organoselenium compounds seem to have non-specific modulatory activation of antioxidant pathways and specific inhibitory effects in some thiol-containing proteins. The thiol-oxidizing properties of organoselenium compounds are considered the molecular basis of their chronic toxicity; however, the acute use of organoselenium compounds as inhibitors of specific thiol-containing enzymes can be of therapeutic significance. In summary, the outcomes of the clinical trials of ebselen as a mimetic of lithium or as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases will be important to the field of organoselenium synthesis. The development of computational techniques that could predict rational modifications in the structure of organoselenium compounds to increase their specificity is required to construct a library of thiol-modifying agents with selectivity toward specific target proteins.","Nogueira, Cristina W; Barbosa, Nilda V; Rocha, João B T",Arch Toxicol,343,14

Hence, increased SpO(2) levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO(2) levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO(2) levels in these patients. Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO(2) levels in all COVID-19 patients. However, the 5 patients in the sham-controlled study did not exhibit a significant change in their SpO(2) levels during sham stimulation.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to quantify the safety and tolerability of remdesivir, based on safety outcome findings from randomized controlled trials, observational studies and case reports of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We have performed a systematic search in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library using specific keywords such as ‘COVID-19’ OR ‘SARS CoV-2’ AND ‘Remdesivir’. The study endpoints include total adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, mortality and drug tolerability. Statistical analysis was carried out by using Revman 5.4 software. RESULTS: Total 15 studies were included for systematic review, but only 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 13,622) were included for meta-analysis. Visual inspection of the forest plots for remdesivir 10-day versus placebo and remdesivir 10-day versus 5-day groups revealed that there is a significant difference in SAEs [10-day remdesivir versus control (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 0.40–0.74) p = 0.0001; I(2) = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.56, 0.38–0.84) p = 0.005; I(2) = 13%]. In grade 4 AEs, there is a significant difference in 10-day remdesivir versus control (OR = 0.32, 0.19–0.54) p = 0.0001; I(2) = 0%, but not in comparison to 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.95, 0.59–1.54) p = 0.85; I(2) = 0%. But there is no significant difference in grade 3 AEs [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 0.81, 0.59–1.11) p = 0.19; I(2) = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 1.24, 0.86–1.80) p = 0.25; I(2) = 0%], in total AEs [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 1.07, 0.66–1.75) p = 0.77; I(2) = 79%; remdesivir 10 day versus 5 day (OR = 1.08, 0.70–1.68) p = 0.73; I(2) = 54%)], in mortality [10-day remdesivir versus control (OR = 0.93, 0.80–1.08) p = 0.32; I(2) = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 1.39, 0.73–2.62) p = 0.32; I(2) = 0%)] and tolerability [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 1.05, 0.51–2.18) p = 0.89; I(2) = 65%, 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.86, 0.18–4.01) p = 0.85; I(2) = 78%]. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Ten-day remdesivir was a safe antiviral agent but not tolerable over control in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a need of administration cautiousness for grade 3 AEs. There was no added benefit of 10- or 5-day remdesivir in reducing mortality over placebo. To avoid SAEs, we suggest for prior monitoring of liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), complete blood count (CBC) and serum electrolytes for those with preexisting hepatic and renal impairments and patients receiving concomitant hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. Furthermore, a number of RCTs of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients are suggested. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Ten-day remdesivir is a safe antiviral drug with common adverse events in comparison to placebo. The rate of serious adverse events and grade 3 adverse events were significantly lower in 10-day remdesivir in comparison to placebo/5-day remdesivir. There was no significant difference in the rate of tolerability and mortality reduction in 10-day remdesivir over placebo/5-day remdesivir. There were no new safety signals reported in vulnerable populations, paediatric, pregnant and lactating women.","Santenna, Chenchula; Vidyasagar, Kota; Amarneni, Krishna Chaitanya; Ghanta, Sai Nikhila; Sadasivam, Balakrishnan; Pathan, Saman; Padmavathi, R.",Ther Adv Drug Saf,343,16

Lockdowns and movement restrictions increased the potential of negative impact on population mental health, in which depression and anxiety symptoms were frequently reported by different population groups during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the causal relationship of mitigation policies on national-wide mental health treatment is lacking. Objective This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mental health across the UnitedStates, on county and state levels. It examines the effect on the total mental health patients, different age and gender groups, and patients of selected mental health diagnoses. Methods We used large-scale medical claims data for mental health patients dated from September 1, 2019 to December31, 2020, with publicly available state- and county-specific COVID-19 cases from first case in January to December 31,2020, and used publicly available lockdown dates data for states and counties. We designed a difference-in-differences(DID) model, which infers the causal effect of a policy intervention by comparing pre-policy and post-policy periods indifferent regions. We mainly focused on two types of social distancing policies, stay-at-home and school closure orders. Results Based on common pre-treatment trend assumption of regions, we find that lockdown has significantly and causally increased seeking medical treatment for mental health across counties and states. Mental health patients inregions with lockdown orders have significantly increased by 18% compared to 1% decline in regions without a lockdown.Also, female populations have been exposed to a larger lockdown effect on their mental health with 24% increase in regions with lockdowns compared to 3% increase in regions without. While male mental health patients decreased by 5% in regions without lockdowns. Patients diagnosed with panic disorders and reaction to severe stress both were significantly exposed to a significant large effect of lockdowns. Also, life management difficulty patients doubled in regions with stay-at-home orders but increased less with school closures. Contrarily, attention-deficit hyperactivity patients declined in regions without stay-at-home orders. The number of mental health patients older than 80 decreased in regions with lockdowns. Adults between (21-40) years old were exposed to the greatest lockdown effect with patient number increasing between 20% to 30% in regions with lockdown. Adolescent patients under 21 increased in regions with school closures.

Children are particularly under-represented in registry research. This paper lays out novel principles, methods and governance to integrate diverse registries within or alongside a planned children’s mega-cohort to rapidly generate translatable evidence. GenV (Generation Victoria) will approach for recruitment parents of all newborns (estimated 150,000) over two years from mid-2021 in the state of Victoria (population 6.5 million), Australia. Its sample size and population denominator mean it will contain almost all children with uncommon or co-morbid conditions as they emerge over time. By design, it will include linked datasets, biosamples (including from pregnancy), phenotypes and participant-reported measures, all of which will span pre-morbid to long-term outcomes. We provide a vignette of a planned new registry for high-risk pregnancies to illustrate the possibilities. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe such a methodology designed prospectively to enhance both the clinical relevance of a large multipurpose cohort and the value and inclusivity of registries in a population.","Sung, Valerie; Williams, Katrina; Perlow, Ella; Hu, Yanhong J.; Ahern, Susannah; Said, Joanne M.; Karanatsios, Bill; Hopper, John L.; McNeil, John J.; Donnan, Leo; Goldfeld, Sharon; Wake, Melissa",Children (Basel),343,16

TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4.","Aboudounya, Mohamed M.; Heads, Richard J.",Mediators Inflamm,343,26

The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.","Bandyopadhyay, Samir Kumar; Dutta, Shawni",,343,29

COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs). Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines. To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their “selective reuse” during contingency situations. METHODS: Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks). To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namely Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes. We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks. Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits. Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19. RESULTS: Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7–8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft × breadth 10 ft × height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss of B. stearothermophilus spore revival. The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings. Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks. Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments. Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration. There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE. Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements. VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer. We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility. This process can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.","Saini, Vikram; Sikri, Kriti; Batra, Sakshi Dhingra; Kalra, Priya; Gautam, Kamini",Gut Pathog,343,20

The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical features of COVID-19 is unknown. Methods: We prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes. Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease. Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic regression. Results: A total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10-21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51-11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection. Conclusion: Our results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. The results suggest that parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19.","Gebrecherkos, T.; Gessesse, Z.; Kebede, Y.; Gebreegzabher, A.; Tassew, G.; Abdulkader, M.; Ebuy, H.; Desta, A.; Hailu, A.; Harris, V.; Rinke de Wit, T.; Wolday, D.",,343,26

Managing orthopaedic emergencies effectively, while at the same time protecting patients and staff, remains a challenge. We explore how the UK lockdown affected the rate, distribution, and type of orthopaedic emergency department (ED) presentations, using the same period in 2019 as reference. This article discusses considerations for the ED and trauma wards to help to maintain the safety of patients and healthcare providers with an emphasis on more remote geography. METHODS: The study was conducted from 23 March 2020 to 5 May 2020 during the full lockdown period (2020 group) and compared to the same time frame in 2019 (2019 group). Included are all patients who attended the ED at Raigmore Hospital during this period from both the local area and tertiary referral from throughout the UK Highlands. Data was collected and analyzed through the ED Information System (EDIS) as well as ward and theatre records. RESULTS: A total of 1,978 patients presented to the ED during the lockdown period, compared to 4,777 patients in the same timeframe in 2019; a reduction of 58.6%. Orthopaedic presentations in 2020 and 2019 were 736 (37.2%) and 1,729 (36.2%) respectively, representing a 57.4% reduction. During the lockdown, 43.6% of operations were major procedures (n = 48) and 56.4% were minor procedures (n = 62), representing a significant proportional shift. CONCLUSION: During the COVID- 19 lockdown period there was a significant reduction in ED attendances and orthopaedic presentations compared to 2019. We also observed that there was a proportional increase in fractures in elderly patients and in minor injuries requiring surgery. These represented the majority of the orthopaedic workload during the lockdown period of 2020. Given this shift towards smaller surgical procedures, we suggest that access to a minor operating theatre in or close to ED would be desirable in the event of a second wave or future crisis.","Elhalawany, Ahmed S.; Beastall, James; Cousins, Gerard",Bone Jt Open,343,24

They support midwives to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity by promoting the overall integration of midwifery in health systems. Our objective was to generate a framework for evidence-informed midwifery association strengthening. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis complemented by key informant interviews, focus groups, observations, and document review was used to inform the development of concepts and theory. Three electronic bibliographical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE) were searched through to 2 September 2020. A coding structure was created to guide the synthesis across the five sources of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 1634 records were retrieved through electronic searches and 57 documents were included in the critical interpretive synthesis. Thirty-one (31) key informant interviews and five focus groups were completed including observations (255 pages) and audio recordings. Twenty-four (24) programme documents were reviewed. The resulting theoretical framework outlines the key factors by context, describes the system drivers that impact the sustainability of midwifery associations and identifies the key-enabling elements involved in designing programmes that strengthen midwifery associations. CONCLUSION: Midwifery associations act as the web that holds the profession together and are key to the integration of the profession in health systems, supporting enabling environments and improving gender inequities. Our findings highlight that in order to strengthen midwifery (education, regulation and services), we have to lead with association strengthening. Building strong associations is the foundation necessary to create formal quality midwifery education systems and to support midwifery regulation and accreditation mechanisms.","Mattison, Cristina; Bourret, Kirsty; Hebert, Emmanuelle; Leshabari, Sebalda; Kabeya, Ambrocckha; Achiga, Patrick; Robinson, Jamie; Darling, Elizabeth",BMJ Glob Health,343,11

We studied the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in our health system serving Southeast Michigan as we rolled out a policy to limit admissions and transfers. METHODS: in this retrospective study conducted at two stroke centers, we included consecutive patients presenting to the ED for whom a stroke alert was activated during the period extending from 3/20/20 to 5/20/20 and a similar period in 2019. We compared demographics, time metrics, and discharge outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: of 385 patients presented to the ED during the two time periods, 58% were African American. There was a significant decrease in the number of stroke patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the hospital between the two periods (p <0.001). In 2020, patients had higher presenting NIHSS (median: 2 vs 5, p = 0.012), discharge NIHSS (median: 2 vs 3, p = 0.004), and longer times from LKW to ED arrival (4.8 vs 9.4 h, p = 0.031) and stroke team activation (median: 10 vs 15 min, p = 0.006). In 2020, stroke mimics rates were lower among African Americans. There were fewer hospitalizations (p <0.001), and transfers from outside facilities (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: a trend toward faster stroke care in the ED was observed during the pandemic along with dramatically reduced numbers of ED visits, hospitalizations and stroke mimics. Delayed ED presentations and higher stroke severity characterized the African American population, highlighting deepening of racial disparities during the pandemic.","Aboul Nour, Hassan; Affan, Muhammad; Mohamed, Ghada; Mohamud, Ali; Schultz, Lonni; Latack, Katie; Brady, Megan; Scozzari, Dawn; Haddad, Yazeed; Katramados, Angelos; Bou Chebl, Alex; Ramadan, Ahmad Riad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,343,3

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with terms COVID and SARS-COV-2 from December 1, 2019 till April 5, 2020. We estimated overall prevalence, stratified prevalence based on severity, estimated risk ratio (RR), and estimated standardized mean difference (SMD) of liver function parameters in severe as compared to non-severe COVID. Random effect method utilizing inverse variance approach was used for pooling the data. RESULTS: In all, 128 studies were included. The most frequent abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia [61.27% (48.24–72.87)], elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) [27.94% (18.22–40.27)], alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [23.28% (19.92–27.01)], and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [23.41% (18.84–28.70)]. Furthermore, the relative risk of these abnormalities was higher in the patients with severe COVID-19 when compared to non-severe disease [Hypoalbuminemia—2.65 (1.38–5.07); GGT—2.31 (1.6–3.33); ALT—1.76 (1.44–2.15); AST—2.30 (1.82–2.90)]. The SMD of hypoalbuminemia, GGT, ALT, and AST elevation in severe as compared to non-severe were − 1.05 (− 1.27 to − 0.83), 0.76 (0.40–1.12), 0.42 (0.27–0.56), and 0.69 (0.52–0.86), respectively. The pooled prevalence and RR of chronic liver disease as a comorbidity was 2.64% (1.73–4) and 1.69 (1.05–2.73) respectively. CONCLUSION: The most frequent abnormality in liver functions was hypoalbuminemia followed by derangements in gamma-glutamyl transferase and aminotransferases, and these abnormalities were more frequent in severe disease.

The kinetic description leads to study the evolution over time of Boltzmann-type equations describing the number densities of social contacts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical SIR-type compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to moments of the contact distribution. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the rapid spread of an epidemic.

Approximately 10,900 virus-laden droplets were released into the air by a teacher coughing and tracked for 90 min by numerical simulations. The teacher was standing in front of multiple students in a classroom. To estimate viral transmission to the students, we considered the features of the novel coronavirus, such as the virus half-life. The simulation results revealed that there was a high risk of prolonged airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets when the outlet flow of the classroom ventilation was low (i.e., 4.3 and 8.6 cm/s). The rates of remaining airborne virus-laden droplets produced by the teacher coughing were 40% and 15% after 45 and 90 min, respectively. The results revealed that students can avoid exposure to the virus-laden droplets by keeping a large distance from the teacher (5.5 m), which is more than two times farther than the currently suggested social distancing rules. The results of this study provide guidelines to set a new protection plan in the classroom to prevent airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets to students.","Yamakawa, Masashi; Kitagawa, Atsuhide; Ogura, Kiyota; Chung, Yongmann M.; Kim, Minsuok",J Aerosol Sci,343,16

The use of masks in preventing spread is controversial; masks are considered useless by many, while being mandated in some locations. Here, the effect of masking the general population on a COVID-19-like epidemic is estimated by computer simulation using three separate types of software. The main questions are whether mask use by the general population can limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a country and how to identify opportunities when mask use is cost-effective and safe. To address these questions, the protective effects of different types of masks, the side-effects of masks, and avenues for improvements of masks and masking are addressed. Main results: (i) Any type of mask, even simple home-made ones, may be of value, even if the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed “one mask-protection”) is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be critical but increasing one mask-protection to >50% was found to be advantageous. (ii) Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late stage in an epidemic, but early implementation helps reduce the cumulative and total number of cases. (iii) The simulations suggest that it might be possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a limited period. There is a brief discussion of why the reported effect size of masking varies widely, and is expected to do so, because of different filtration abilities of different masks, differences in compliance and fitting, other routes of transmission, pre-existing immunity, and because a system of interconnected, disease-prone individuals has non-linear properties. A software solution to visualize infection spread is presented. The results from these simulations are encouraging, but do not necessarily represent the real-life situation, so it is suggested that clinical trials of masks are now carried out while continuously monitoring effects and side-effects. As mask use is not without risks and costs, it is suggested that governments and scientists have an important role in advising the public about the sensible use of masks.","Johansson, Björn",Front Public Health,343,1

To summarize the most highly esteemed, peer-reviewed, infectious diseases (ID) pharmacotherapy articles published in 2020. Summary. Members of the Houston Infectious Diseases Network (HIDN) nominated articles that were deemed to have noteworthy contributions to ID pharmacotherapy in 2020, including those on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). To select the most significant articles of 2020, a survey was created and distributed to members of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (SIDP) to vote on their top 10 articles of general ID and COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and one noteworthy HIV/AIDS publication. A total of 40 articles were nominated by HIDN: 35 articles pertaining to general ID/COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and 5 articles with HIV/AIDS involvement. Of the 247 SIDP members who responded to the survey, 205 and 42 members voted for general ID/COVID-19 pharmacotherapy articles and HIV/AIDS related articles, respectively. The top publications are summarized. Conclusion. In a taxing year of a global pandemic, the abundant and rapid distribution of ID literature has made it challenging for clinicians to stay informed of significant publications across the ID spectrum. This review summarizes significant ID-related publications in 2020 with the goal of aiding clinicians in staying up to date on the most relevant publications in ID pharmacotherapy.","Eubank, Taryn A; Zaidan, Noor; Alnezary, Faris S; Moc, Courtney; Olson, Kelsey; Zaki, Ahmed; McDaneld, Patrick M; Gonzales-Luna, Anne J",J Pharm Pract,343,1

Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. In the present study we have shown that MHV-3 infection of macrophages induces these cells to undergo apoptosis. Three methods to detect apoptosis were applied: flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA content, fluorescence microscopic visualization of apoptotic cells labeled by the TUNEL assay, and gel electrophoresis to detect DNA laddering. Apoptosis in A/J and BALB/c macrophages was first detected at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) and reached a maximum by 12 h p.i. The degree of MHV-3-induced apoptosis was much greater in A/J-derived macrophages than in BALB/c-derived cells. Apoptosis was inversely correlated with the development of typical MHV cytopathology, namely syncytia formation. Infected macrophages from A/J mice did not form synctia in contrast to the extensive synctia formation observed in BALB/c-derived macrophages. In MHV-3-infected BALB/c macrophage cultures, apoptotic cells were not incorporated into syncytia. Apoptosis was also inversely correlated with the expression of MHV-3-induced fgl2 prothrombinase in macrophages. These results add the murine coronavirus MHV-3 to the list of RNA-containing viruses capable of inducing apoptosis.","Belyavsky, Michail; Belyavskaya, Elena; Levy, Gary A.; Leibowitz, Julian L.",Virology,343,20

In the context of academic meetings and conferences, there is the growing need for a set of guidelines secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing environmental and economic challenges that large academic and medical conferences face. These Virtual Meetings Best Practices were established in response to the scant evidence and guidance on the topic. METHODS: These best practice guidelines were developed from a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and lay literature. MEDLINE and Embase databases were scoped for relevant, non-duplicate articles. For lay articles, Google searches were utilized. The recommendations that comprise this document are a compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies (e.g. case studies) and expert committee reports, opinions and/or experience of respected authorities, and lay articles. RESULTS: We identified four phases of the meeting cycle: Pre-planning considerations, Planning, Accomplishing conference goals through execution, gauging Response and Engaging the target audience for future cycles (PrePARE). Akin to the Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions, this document is meant to drive meaningful initial and subsequent interventions in the meetings of the medical and academic community. This covers actions and preparation for registration, scheduling, speakers, attendees, event type, technology, monetization/marketing, dealing with disruptions, post-event deliverables, response and engagement strategies. Enhanced access to integrated, high-quality and efficient virtual meetings will establish a new norm as an effective alternative for innovative health research, education and information dissemination in orthopaedics and beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Given the uncertainty of whether large in-person gatherings will be permitted, advisable or responsible later into the summer of 2020 and beyond, these guidelines will aid events being converted and scheduled as virtual-only meetings. As we move forward in the era of increased utility and utilization of virtual conferencing, these guidelines will serve as a benchmark and standard for surgeons in the field.

This device consists of three separate modules: viewer, console and visual tube. The 4-inch LCD viewer panel displays the real-time video image with optimal view angle. The console is designed with respect to ergonomics allowing comfortable manipulation and internally accommodating the power supply, image processing components and connector platform for both viewer and probe. The distal end of the detachable probe is packaged with a high resolution lens, CMOS sensor, and four LEDs. The proximal end is a 6-pin connector which can be readily removed and attached on demand. The probe is detachable and disposable with length and diameter adaptable to the size of the endotracheal tube. In our preliminary test, the video-guided apparatus helped inexperienced performers to identify the vocal cords correctly and improve the success rate of intubation on the simulation model. With further improvements on the miniature design, all captured images could be transmitted to remote devices through standard wireless transmission and could thus be stored in a specific database station. The wireless technique enables image sharing on multiple devices while a powerful database can provide valuable resources for training, data mining and serial case studies. We demonstrate that the CMOS image sensor combined with advanced reduced instruction set computer machine can serve as a visual aid for tracheal intubation.

We evaluated the effect of nasal endoscopy on aerosol concentration and the role of a high‐efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in reducing aerosol concentration. METHODS: Otolaryngology patients were prospectively enrolled in an outpatient, cross‐sectional study. Demographic information and clinic room characteristics were recorded. A scanning mobility particle sizer and GRIMM aerosol monitor measured aerosols 14.3 nm to 34 μm in diameter (i.e., particles smaller than those currently examined in the literature) during (1) nasal endoscopy (± debridement) and (2) no nasal endoscopy encounters. One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t test were performed to compare aerosol concentrations and impact of HEPA filtration. RESULTS: Sixty‐two patients met inclusion criteria (25 nasal endoscopy without debridement; 18 nasal endoscopy with debridement; 19 no nasal endoscopy). There was no significant difference in age or gender across cohorts. Aerosol concentration in the nasal endoscopy cohort (± debridement) was not greater than the no nasal endoscopy cohort (p = 0.36; confidence interval [95% CI], −1.76 to 0.17 μg/m(3); and p = 0.12; 95% CI, −0.11 to 2.14 μg/m(3), respectively). Aerosol concentrations returned to baseline after 8.76 min without a HEPA filter versus 4.75 min with a HEPA filter (p = 0.001; 95% CI, 1.73–6.3 min). CONCLUSION: Using advanced instrumentation and a comparative study design, aerosol concentration was shown to be no greater during nasal endoscopy versus no endoscopy encounters. HEPA filter utilization reduced aerosol concentrations significantly faster than no HEPA filter.","Gill, Amarbir S.; Kaur, Kamaljeet; Shipman, Paige; Sumsion, Jorgen; Error, Marc; Kelly, Kerry; Alt, Jeremiah A.",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,343,16

Our results indicate that maternal immune activation may grant higher tolerance to anion gap and bilirubin disruptions triggered by weaning stress. Therefore, management practices aimed at minimizing the effects of weaning should consider the interacting effect of immune activation during development. ABSTRACT: Weaning stress can elicit changes in the metabolic, hormone and immune systems of pigs and interact with prolonged disruptions stemming from maternal immune activation (MIA) during gestation. The present study advances the characterization of the combined effects of weaning stress and MIA on blood chemistry, immune and hormone indicators that inform on the health of pigs. Three-week-old female and male offspring of control gilts or gilts infected with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus were allocated to weaned or nursed groups. The anion gap and bilirubin profiles suggest that MIA enhances tolerance to the effects of weaning stress. Interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 2 were highest among weaned MIA females, and cortisol was higher among weaned relative to nursed pigs across sexes. Canonical discriminant analysis demonstrated that weaned and nursed pigs have distinct chemistry profiles, whereas MIA and control pigs have distinct cytokine profiles. The results from this study can guide management practices that recognize the effects of the interaction between MIA and weaning stress on the performance and health of pigs.","Rymut, Haley E.; Rund, Laurie A.; Bolt, Courtni R.; Villamil, Maria B.; Southey, Bruce R.; Johnson, Rodney W.; Rodriguez-Zas, Sandra L.",Animals (Basel),343,24

Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.","Jarvis, Donald L.; Butel, Janet S.",Virology,343,5

Endothelium-related molecules have been reported as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and/or prognosis of infections. The prognostic value of these biomarkers in patients with liver cirrhosis and infections however remain elusive. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the performance of key soluble endothelial injury biomarkers, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (vegfr1), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang1, 2) as mortality predictors in liver cirrhosis patients with severe covid-19 or bacterial sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 66 hospitalized patients [admitted in covid-19 ward or liver intensive care unit (ICU)] were included. 22 patients had covid-19 alone while 20 patients had cirrhosis plus covid-19. 24 patients had liver cirrhosis plus bacterial sepsis. Among cirrhosis patients, most common aetiology was alcohol. ICAM1 was increased (p=0.003) while vegfr1 (p<0.0001) and Ang1 (p<0.0001) were reduced in covid-19 patients with cirrhosis, as compared to covid-19 patients alone. Endothelial biomarkers between cirrhosis patients with severe covid-19 or with bacterial sepsis in the ICUs did not differ significantly. In these patients, ICAM1 levels significantly and independently predicted mortality (HR:3.24;1.19-8.86) along with MELD, renal and coagulation failures. The area under the curve for ICAM1 was 0.74, MELD was 0.60 and combined ICAM1 and MELD was 0.70. ICAM1 also positively correlated with the composite organ failure scores recorded 3-5 days post ICU admission (CLIF-OF and SOFA) in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that in patients with liver cirrhosis, elevated plasma ICAM1 serve as an independent predictor of severe covid-19 or sepsis associated 28-day mortality. LAY SUMMARY: Bacterial sepsis and covid-19 lead to increased mortality in cirrhosis patients.

METHODS: We reviewed patients admitted from the community to University College Hospital (UCH) with COVID-19 as their primary diagnosis between 1st-31st December 2020. Re-attendance and readmission data were collected for patients who re-presented within 10 days following discharge. Data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: 196 patients were admitted from the community with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged alive in December 2020. Corticosteroids were prescribed in hospital for a median of 5 days (IQR 3-8). 20 patients (10.2%) were readmitted within 10 days. 11/20 received corticosteroids in the first admission of which 10 had received 1-3 days of corticosteroids. Readmission rate in those receiving 1-3 days of steroids was 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Most international guidelines have recommended providing up to 10 days of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 but stopping discharge. Our findings show shorter courses of corticosteroids during admission are associated with an increased risk of being readmitted and support continuing the course of corticosteroids after hospital discharge monitored in the virtual ward setting.","Chaudhry, Zain; Shawe-Taylor, Marianne; Rampling, Tommy; Cutfield, Tim; Bidwell, Gabriella; Chan, Xin Hui S.; Last, Anna; Williams, Bryan; Logan, Sarah; Marks, Michael; Esmail, Hanif",J Infect,343,10

Plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing besides pathogen reduction procedures, to reduce the virus transmission risk through their products. To achieve a similar safety standard, NAT was then also introduced for labile blood components. German transfusion centres were the first to start in-house NAT testing of their donations in pools of up to 96 samples for HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Years later the diagnostics industry provided commercial HCV and HIV-1 and later HBV NAT tests on automated platforms. NAT tests for HIV-2, hepatitis A virus, and Parvovirus B19 followed, again driven by transfusion centres with their in-house tests. When severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and West Nile Virus emerged it was the NAT that enabled the manufacturers and transfusion centres to instantly introduce sensitive and specific screening tests. Subsequent automation including sample preparation has significantly reduced the costs and complexity of the procedure and made it affordable to middle income countries as well. Currently more than 60 million donations per year are NAT tested worldwide and the remaining residual risk of virus transmission by blood components and products could be reduced to almost zero. Automation rendered possible the reduction of pool size in conjunction with increased throughput and sensitivity. Thus, antibody and antigen testing may be dispensable in the long run, particularly in the combination of NAT testing with pathogen reduction. There are new technologies on the horizon like digital droplet PCR, next-generation sequencing, lab-on-a-chip, and digital antigen assays, which are comparably sensitive. However, each of these has limitations, either in throughput, costs, automation, time to result, specificity, or the need for NAT as an integral part of the technology. Thus, NAT is still the shortest and most efficient means to the result. Donor screening NAT also contributed significantly to our knowledge on how fast viruses replicate, and on the respective diagnostic window. In conjunction with animal and patient studies, we have learned more about the minimal infectious dose and the epidemics in the donor population.","Roth, Willi Kurt",Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy,343,3

METHODS: This survey was performed by online distribution of questionnaires in three countries in the Middle East (Jordan, Iraq and Egypt). The questionnaire consisted of five sections: the first section was aimed at collecting demographic data and the rest sections used to assess OH awareness, attitude towards dental treatment, degree of fear and economic impact of COVID‐19. The answers were either multiple choice, closed‐end (Yes or No) or 5‐point Likert scale for the last four sections. RESULTS: A total of 3782 respondents completed the questionnaire. Overall, OH awareness was low (mean ±SD; 1.84 ± 1.03), while attitude towards dental treatment (5.04 ± 1.68) and economic impact (11.29 ± 4.37) were moderately affected. In addition, fear of infection showed moderately high level (14.04 ± 4.11). All subgroups of the demographic variables showed significant differences among them in relation to OH awareness and attitude towards dental treatment. The regression model suggested country, gender, age, education level, income level and fear as predictors for OH awareness (R(2) 0.036) and attitude towards dental care (R(2) 0.141). CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic negatively impacted the level of OH awareness. However, the attitude towards dental treatment was moderately affected. Increasing public fear and compromised economy influenced OH awareness and the attitude towards dental treatment.","Abdulkareem, Ali A; Abdulbaqi, Hayder R; Alshami, Muhanad L; Al‐Rawi, Natheer H",Int J Dent Hyg,343,16

Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of HN glycoprotein similar to the authentic HN in size. The recombinant HN glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. The antigenic properties of the recombinant HN glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one, as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies, and were completely protected from the NDV challenge.","Masahiro, Niikura; Yoshiharu, Matsuura; Masakazu, Hattori; Misao, Onuma; Takeshi, Mikami",Virus Research,343,16

This research develops a conceptual framework using a design thinking process, through which EPR associated with offshore prefabrication can be analyzed, agreed upon, and allocated. By considering the scope and scale of the responsibility and the procurement methods, the framework comprises four quadrants representing four typical scenarios for implementation of the EPR principle. It is applicable for both short-term and lifelong EPR analysis, in both traditional and integrated project delivery contexts.

In spite of the higher virus load, induction of many cytokines and chemokines in the brains of infected Ifit2(-/-) mice were similar to that in wild-type mice. In contrast, infected Ifit2(-/-) mice revealed significantly impaired microglial activation as well as reduced recruitment of NK1.1 T cells and CD4 T cells to the brain, possibly contributing to the lack of viral clearance. These two deficiencies were associated with a lower level of microglial expression of CX3CR1, the receptor of the CX3CL1 (Fractalkine) chemokine, which plays a critical role in both microglial activation and leukocyte recruitment. The above results uncovered a new potential role of an interferon-induced protein in immune protection.","Das Sarma, Jayasri; Burrows, Amy; Rayman, Patricia; Hwang, Mi-Hyun; Kundu, Soumya; Sharma, Nikhil; Bergmann, Cornelia; Sen, Ganes C.",PLoS Pathog,343,33

Approach: To prepare this position paper, a systemic development model, founded on the sustainable human security paradigm, was employed to explore the global challenges to accessing appropriate wheelchairs. Positions: I: Consideration of key perspectives of wheelchair provision across the life course is essential to meet the needs to children, adults, older people and their families; II: Comprehensive wheelchair service delivery processes and a competent workforce are essential to ensure appropriate wheelchair service provision; III: Evaluations on wheelchair product quality development, performance and procurement standards are key as wheelchair product quality is generally poor; IV: Understanding the economic landscape when providing wheelchairs is critical. Wheelchair funding systems vary across jurisdictions; V: Establishing wheelchair provision policy is a key priority, as specific policy is limited globally.

On 18 December 2020, the South African government also announced the emergence of a new variant in a scenario similar to that of the UK, which is referred to as variant 501.V2. Another important milestone regarding this pandemic was the beginning, in December 2020, of vaccination campaigns in several countries. There are several vaccines, with different characteristics, developed by various laboratories and research centers. A natural question arises: what could be the impact of these variants and vaccines on the spread of COVID-19? Many models have been proposed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them incorporates the effects of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants together with the vaccines in the spread of COVID-19. We develop here a [Formula: see text]-SVEIHQRD mathematical model able to simulate the possible impact of this type of variants and of the vaccines, together with the main mechanisms influencing the disease spread. The model may be of interest for policy makers, as a tool to evaluate different possible future scenarios. We apply the model to the particular case of Italy (as an example of study case), showing different outcomes. We observe that the vaccines may reduce the infections, but they might not be enough for avoiding a new wave, with the current expected vaccination rates in that country, if the control measures are relaxed. Furthermore, a more contagious variant could increase significantly the cases, becoming the most common way of infection. We show how, even with the pandemic cases slowing down (with an effective reproduction number less than 1) and the disease seeming to be under control, the effective reproduction number of just the new variant may be greater than 1 and, eventually, the number of infections would increase towards a new disease wave. Therefore, a rigorous follow-up of the evolution of the number of infections with any potentially more dangerous new variant is of paramount importance at any stage of the pandemic.","Ramos, A.M.; Vela-Pérez, M.; Ferrández, M.R.; Kubik, A.B.; Ivorra, B.",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,343,28

A systematic review,18.456787,8.094591,2021,"Simulating epidemics in metapopulations is a challenging issue due to the large demographic and geographic scales to incorporate. Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD–IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.","Vincenot, Christian Ernest; Moriya, Kazuyuki",Ecol Inform,343,16

These objectives are in especially high demand in the setting of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With the recent progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), we introduce new deep learning frameworks to align and enhance the quality of portable CXRs to be more consistent, and to more closely match higher quality conventional CXRs. These enhanced portable CXRs can then help the doctors provide faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The contributions of this work are four-fold. Firstly, a new database collection of subject-pair radiographs is introduced. For each subject, we collected a pair of samples from both portable and conventional machines. Secondly, a new deep learning approach is presented to align the subject-pairs dataset to obtain a pixel-pairs dataset. Thirdly, a new PairFlow approach is presented, an end-to-end invertible transfer deep learning method, to enhance the degraded quality of portable CXRs. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is evaluated by UAMS doctors in terms of both image quality and topological properties. This work was undertaken in collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) to enhance portable/mobile COVID-19 CXRs, to improve the speed and accuracy of portable CXR images and aid in urgent COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.","Le, Ngan; Sorensen, James; Bui, Toan; Choudhary, Arabinda; Luu, Khoa; Nguyen, Hien",Diagnostics (Basel),343,11

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R(0) ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.","Brierley, Liam; Pedersen, Amy B.; Woolhouse, Mark E.

Phylogeny of 4618 spatiotemporally-representative genomes revealed that entities belonging to the early lineages are mostly spread over Asian countries, including India, whereas the recently-derived lineages are more globally distributed. Of the total 20,163 instances of polymorphism detected across global genomes, 12,594 and 7569 involved transitions and transversions, predominated by cytidine-to-uridine and guanosine-to-uridine conversions, respectively. Positive selection of nonsynonymous mutations (dN/dS >1) in most of the structural, but not the non-structural, genes indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has already harmonized its replication/transcription machineries with the host metabolism, while it is still redefining virulence/transmissibility strategies at the molecular level. Mechanistic bases and evolutionary/pathogenicity-related implications are discussed for the predominant mutation-types.","Roy, Chayan; Mandal, Santi M.; Mondal, Suresh K.; Mukherjee, Shriparna; Mapder, Tarunendu; Ghosh, Wriddhiman; Chakraborty, Ranadhir",Genomics,343,24

BACKGROUND: Anxiety related to the COVID‐19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses’ well‐being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus‐related anxiety among frontline nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID‐19 anxiety among nurses. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardised scales. RESULTS: Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support (β = ‐0.142, p = 0.011), personal resilience (β = ‐0.151, p = 0.008) and organisational support (β = ‐0.127, p = 0.023) predicted COVID‐19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID‐19 anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID‐19. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: COVID‐19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience‐promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, Leodoro J.; de los Santos, Janet",J Nurs Manag,343,1

Due to fear and social stigma linked with COVID-19, many individuals in the community hide their disease and do not access healthcare facilities in a timely manner. In addition, with the widespread use of social media, rumours, myths and inaccurate information about the virus are spreading rapidly, leading to intensified irritability, fearfulness, insomnia, oppositional behaviours and somatic complaints. Considering the relevance of all these factors, we aim to explore the perceptions and attitudes of community members towards COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This formative research will employ an exploratory qualitative research design using semistructured interviews and a purposive sampling approach. The data collection methods for this formative research will include indepth interviews with community members. The study will be conducted in the Karimabad Federal B Area and in the Garden (East and West) community settings in Karachi, Pakistan. The community members of these areas have been selected purposively for the interview. Study data will be analysed thematically using NVivo V.12 Plus software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Aga Khan University Ethical Review Committee (2020-4825-10599). The results of the study will be disseminated to the scientific community and to the research subjects participating in the study. The findings will help us explore the perceptions and attitudes of different community members towards the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being.","Shahil Feroz, Anam; Akber Ali, Naureen; Akber Ali, Noshaba; Feroz, Ridah; Nazim Meghani, Salima; Saleem, Sarah",BMJ Open,343,16

However, less is known about the haemostatic profile in mild COVID-19 patients. We performed an age and gender-matched prospective study of 10 severe and 10 mild COVID-19 patients. Comprehensive coagulation profiling together with Thromboelastography and Clot Waveform Analysis were performed. FBC, PT, APTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen and CWA were repeated every 3 days for both groups and repeat TEG was performed for severe patients up till 15 days. On recruitment, severe patients had markers reflecting hypercoagulability including raised median D-dimer 1.0 μg/mL (IQR 0.6, 1.4) (p = 0.0004), fibrinogen 5.6 g/L (IQR 4.9, 6.6) (p = 0.002), Factor VIII 206% (IQR 171, 203) and vWF levels 265.5% (IQR 206, 321). Mild patients had normal values of PT, aPTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer, and slightly elevated median Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels. Repeated 3-day assessments for both groups showed declining trends in D-dimer and Fibrinogen. CWA of severe COVID-19 group demonstrated hypercoagulability with an elevated median values of aPTT delta change 78.8% (IQR 69.8, 85.2) (p = 0.001), aPTT clot velocity (min1) 7.8%/s (IQR 6.7, 8.3) (p = 0.001), PT delta change 22.4% (IQR 19.4, 29.5) (p = 0.004), PT min1 7.1%/s (IQR 6.3, 9.0) (p = 0.02), PT clot acceleration (min 2) 3.6%/s(2) (IQR 3.2, 4.5) (p = 0.02) and PT clot deceleration (max2) 2.9%/s(2) (IQR 2.5, 3.5) (p = 0.02). TEG of severe patients reflected hypercoagulability with significant increases in the median values of CFF MA 34.6 mm (IQR 27.4,38.6) (p = 0.003), CRT Angle 78.9° (IQR 78.3, 80.0) (p = 0.0006), CRT A10 67.6 mm (IQR 65.8, 69.6) (p = 0.007) and CFF A10 32.0 mm (IQR 26.8, 34.0) (p = 0.003).

We aimed to determine the characteristics and outcomes of the patients who would have been denied admission to the ICU according to these protocols, including the cumulative number of saved ICU days. METHODS: We retrospectively identified the ethical triage status in every patient who was admitted to our 31-bed mixed ICU in Antwerp, Belgium during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the reason for admission. This study was possible since the capacity of our ICU had not been threatened, still enabling our usual case-per-case decision. We evaluated three different ETTs that were designed in our and two other hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the 81-day study period, 182 patients were admitted to the ICU. Of the patients, 9–23% would have been denied ICU admission according to the three assessed ETTs (WBD cohort), responsible for 8–18% (n = 116–257) of the total number of ICU days. Of the WBD patients, 44–55% eventually survived their hospital stay, compared to 71–74% of the patients that would have been allowed admission. Of the WBD patients admitted for respiratory failure due to COVID-19, 18–25% survived, a number that decreased to 0–20% when these patients required mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: An ETT effectively reduces ICU bed occupancy but it does not accurately discriminate between survivors and non-survivors, as a substantial percentage of patients who are being denied admission to the ICU would eventually survive their hospital stay.","Michielsen, Heidi; De laet, Inneke; Van Bastelaere, Joanne; Huygh, Johan; Bervoets, Katrien; Van Regenmortel, Niels",J Crit Care,343,26

METHODS: We included the patients >18 years of age, with at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Patients were grouped according to body mass index values as normal weight <25 kg/m2 (Group A), overweight from 25 to <30 kg/m2 (Group B), Class I obesity 30 to <35 kg/m2 (Group C), and ≥35 kg/m2 (Group D). Mortality, clinical outcomes, laboratory parameters, and comorbidities were compared among 4 groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference among study groups in terms of mortality. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation requirement was higher in group B and D than group A, while it was higher in Group D than Group C (Group B vs. Group A [p = 0.017], Group D vs. Group A [p = 0.001], and Group D vs. Group C [p = 0.016]). Lung involvement was less common in Group A, and presence of hypoxia was more common in Group D (Group B vs. Group A [p = 0.025], Group D vs. Group A [p < 0.001], Group D vs. Group B [p = 0.006], and Group D vs. Group C [p = 0.014]).

They are protected by the respiratory epithelium and immune cells to maintain a dynamic balance. Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of unconventional T cells, which have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Although MAIT cells account for a small part of the total immune cells in the lungs, evidence suggests that these cells are activated by T cell receptors and/or cytokine receptors and mediate immune response. They play an important role in immunosurveillance and immunity against microbial infection, and recent studies have shown that subsets of MAIT cells play a role in promoting pulmonary inflammation. Emerging data indicate that MAIT cells are involved in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and possible immunopathogenesis in COVID-19. Here, we introduce MAIT cell biology to clarify their role in the immune response. Then we review MAIT cells in human and murine lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, and discuss their possible protective and pathological effects. MAIT cells represent an attractive marker and potential therapeutic target for disease progression, thus providing new strategies for the treatment of lung diseases.","Wen, Xue; Zhang, Xingli; Nian, Siji; Wei, Gang; Guo, Xiyuan; Yu, Hong; Xie, Xiang; Ye, Yingchun; Yuan, Qing",Int Immunopharmacol,343,1

In this study we sought to assess the effect of psychological distress and risk perception of COVID-19 on prenatal attachment in a Italian sample of pregnant women. METHODS: 1179 pregnant women completed an anonymous online survey and self-report questionnaires measuring socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics, psychological distress (STAI Form Y-1-2 and BDI-II), prenatal attachment (PAI) and risk perception of COVID-19. Data were collected from March 2020 to April 2020 referring to the national lockdown period. RESULTS: After adjusting for the socio-demographic and obstetric factors in the multivariable analysis, we found out the state anxiety was shown to be a significant predictor (p < 0001) of prenatal attachment. Moreover, the COVID-19-risk perception positively moderate the relationship between trait anxiety and prenatal attachment (p=0008), indicating that when COVID-19-risk perception is high, the effects of trait anxiety on prenatal attachment is attenuated. The synergistic effect between STAI Form Y-1 and COVID-19-risk perception index on PAI is partially mediated by STAI Form Y-2 score. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study showed that state anxiety related to COVID-19 outbreak in pregnant women may affect the prenatal attachment process of the expectant mother negatively. However, an adequate and functional perception of COVID-19 could enhance prenatal attachment. These results underline the importance of monitoring the prenatal attachment process and the mother's mental health during pandemics, to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.","Craig, Francesco; Gioia, Maria Cecilia; Muggeo, Vito; Cajiao, Juanita; Aloi, Alessia; Martino, Iolanda; Tenuta, Flaviana; Cerasa, Antonio; Costabile, Angela",J Affect Disord,343,21

The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding site’s conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus’ mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","Bzówka, Maria; Mitusińska, Karolina; Raczyńska, Agata; Samol, Aleksandra; Tuszyński, Jack A.; Góra, Artur",bioRxiv,343,1

The UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) recently reported on a national cohort of pregnant women who required hospital admission due to COVID-19 between March and April 2020.1 We aimed to assess the demographics and outcomes for obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection within our Scottish, inner-city health board and compare this against that reported by UKOSS. Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained and the requirement for ethical approval waved by the local research ethics service. All female patients of child-bearing age (age 16–49) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 16 March – 3 June 2020 were identified by the local Infection Prevention and Control team. These data were cross-referenced with local electronic notes systems to identify pregnant or recently pregnant women (within 6 weeks post-partum). Collected data were de-identified prior to analysis and analyses performed using R statistical software. Descriptive statistics are reported with results expressed as mean (SD), median [IQR], or n (%). Results: In total, 741 eligible women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the study period. Twenty-three (3%) were pregnant or recently pregnant, with 14 of these women (60%) requiring hospital admission (representing 5.1 cases per 1000 maternities). All identified patients of Black or Asian ethnicity were admitted to hospital (5 in total), whilst only 47% of women of white ethnicity were admitted. The most common symptoms in admitted patients were cough (present in 64% of cases) and fever (present in 57% of cases). Amongst admitted patients, median age was 31.5 [29.3–34.0], median gestation at diagnosis 30.5 [24.3–37.5] weeks and 6 patients (43%) had a booking BMI [Formula presented]0 kg/m2. Three hospitalised patients (21.4%) required oxygen therapy and one required post-operative ICU monitoring. Two fetal losses occurred before 22 weeks gestation. No neonatal deaths occurred and no infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: During this “first wave” of the pandemic, rates of COVID-19 were in keeping with those reported by UKOSS. This may reflect local adherence to shielding advice, or that testing was performed only on symptomatic patients. Also in keeping with results from UKOSS, patients from minority ethnic groups (and those with high BMIs) were over represented in hospital admission rates. All patients studied have subsequently been discharged home and mainly required level 1 care during admission.

However, research shows that serious games do not always fulfill all the targeted pedagogical objectives. Designing efficient and engaging serious games is a difficult and multidisciplinary process that requires a collaborative approach. Many design frameworks have been described, most of which are dedicated to the development of specific types of serious games and take the collaborative dimension into account only to a limited extent. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to create a generic serious game design framework that could be adapted to all kinds of serious games and implemented in a collaborative web platform. METHODS: We combined the results of a literature review with our experience in serious game design and development to determine the basic building blocks of a collaborative design framework. We then organized these building blocks into categories and determined the features that a generic design framework should include. Finally, based on the paradigm of complex systems and systemic modelling, we created the co.LAB generic design framework and specifications to allow its implementation in a collaborative web platform. RESULTS: Based on a total of 10 existing design methodologies or frameworks, 23 building blocks were identified and represent the foundation of the co.LAB framework. These blocks were organized into 5 categories: “context and objectives,” “game design,” “mechanics,” “learning design,” and “assessment.” The arrangement by categories provides a structure that can be visualized in multiple and complementary ways. The classical view links game and learning design while other views offer project, systemic, and process visualizations. For the implementation of the co.LAB framework in a web platform, we propose to convert the building blocks into “cards.” Each card would constitute a collaborative working space for the design of the corresponding block. To make the framework adaptive, cards could be added, adapted, or removed according to the kind of serious game intended. Enhancing the visualization of relationships between cards should support a systemic implementation of the framework. CONCLUSIONS: By offering a structured view of the fundamental design elements required to create serious games, the co.LAB framework can facilitate the design and development of such games by virtue of a collaborative, adaptive, and systemic approach. The different visualizations of the building blocks should allow for a shared understanding and a consistent approach throughout the design and development process.

Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional observational survey was conducted. Four different groups period were studied on patients who visited for dental emergencies at tertiary care centre. April 14 to 13 May 2020 assigned and analyzed as a test period group or group IV. The control period group i.e. group III was 14 February 2020 to 17 March, pre lockdown COVID 19 month when there was no consideration of epidemic in India. Same as periods of group II and IV, group I and II from last year 2019 were also assigned and analyzed. The tertiary care centre provision of health services during this pandemic was also inquired and evaluated. The information was recorded regarding availability of health services like non-emergency dental treatments, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation. To compare four different time period of obtained data, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi square test were used. Results: The overall proportion and percentage of dental emergencies were raised. The reason for emergency visits to dental clinic were the main problem related with pulpal (46.0%) followed by abscess (16.6%), periapical lesions (15.0%), cellulitis (4.1%) or trauma (0.3%). In lockdown most of the dental emergencies 228(265) were endodontic related (86.1%) which managed mostly through ‘3A” approach(advise, analgesics and antibiotics) (60.1%) and remaining (26.0%) through extraction.","Kumar, Umesh; Gupta, Arpit; Goyal, Ashima; Gauba, K.",Saudi Dent J,343,1

Cells were induced to produce IFN-α by incubation with the coronavirus TGEV and IFN-α SC were detected by ELISPOT. A striking finding was that IFN-α SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at 26 days of gestation, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-α SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism. IFN-α SC were found to be associated with hematopoietic organs, which argues for their hematopoietic lineage.","Šplíchal, Igor; Bonnneau, Michel; Charley, Bernard",Immunology Letters,343,6

International standards have been established to ensure the protection of human subjects and the scientific integrity of clinical trial study design and data collection. A general overview of the history of the regulatory guidelines and ethical principles underpinning the vaccine development process is provided, with an emphasis on clinical trials conducted in the United States. The contemporary vaccine development process involves sequential assessment of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in phase1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. The process is not always linear or straightforward, and adaptive flexible clinical trial designs can increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Because the efficacy of vaccines for a number of the diseases discussed in this volume cannot be tested directly in humans, alternative approaches have been developed to address this challenge. The major elements of typical clinical trial protocol are discussed, and a checklist of essential documents supporting the trial is provided. As novel vaccine approaches and technologies emerge, the regulatory and ethical considerations will need to be revisited and adapted to respond to the ever-changing landscape.","Keitel, Wendy A.",Vaccines for Biodefense and Emerging and Neglected Diseases,343,5

L’hétérogénéité des résultats concernant l’efficacité du TCZ pourrait être expliquée par des différences dans le timing d’injection : défavorable si trop précoce ou inefficace si trop tardive. Le but de ce travail était d’étudier l’impact du délai d’injection de TCZ–défini depuis le début des symptômes (SF0) jusqu’à la perfusion de TCZ (J0)–sur la mortalité au cours de l’infection au COVID-19. Patients et méthodes Étude multicentrique rétrospective ayant inclus des patients COVID-19 avec atteinte modérée à sévère–score OMS 5 à 6–avec oxygénodépendance ≥4 L/min et CRP >50mg/L, traités de manière compassionnelle par TCZ 8mg/kg IV en plus des soins usuels, lors du premier pic épidémique en France, avant l’ouverture de l’essai randomisé CORIMUNO-TOCI. Les critères d’exclusion étaient une contre-indication au TCZ, une hospitalisation en soins intensifs avant ou dans les 24heures après TCZ ou une limitation thérapeutique. Les facteurs de risque de mortalité au cours de l’infection au COVID-19 modérée ou sévère après TCZ ont été analysés selon des modèles multivariés de régression logistique et de Cox. Les facteurs de risque potentiels étaient les variables avec p< 0,30 en analyse univariée parmi âge, sexe, obésité, comorbidités, période SF0–J0, débit O2 à l’admission, sévérité des lésions scanographiques, CRP à J0 et traitement par corticoïdes. L’analyse de survie a été réalisée en utilisant le jour d’hospitalisation comme début de suivi, et des courbes de survie ajustées conditionnelles ont été construites à l’aide d’un modèle de Cox. Résultats Entre le 17 mars et le 15 avril 2020, 97 patients (âge moyen 68 ans et 80 % hommes) ont reçu du TCZ pour une pneumonie modérée à sévère à COVID-19 dans 8 hôpitaux français. 0, 1 ou >1 comorbité était relevée chez 23 %, 35 % et 42 % des patients, respectivement. À J0 (administration du TCZ), le débit moyen d’O2 était de 9,6±4L/min, la fréquence respiratoire de 30±8/min et le taux moyen de CRP de 158±78mg/L. Le scanner thoracique retrouvait une atteinte parenchymateuse >50 % chez 39 (45 %) patients. Les glucocorticoïdes étaient utilisés chez 34 (35 %) patients. À J10, 35 (44 %) patients étaient sevrés d’O2, 26 (27 %) étaient sortis d’hospitalisation, 54 (55 %) étaient toujours hospitalisés dont 7 en réanimation, et 17 (18 %) étaient décédés. Le délai moyen de sevrage en O2 était de 15jours±12 et la durée moyenne d’hospitalisation de 16jours±13. À 1 mois du traitement par TCZ, la mortalité globale était de 25 %. La survie globale des patients ayant reçu le TCZ dans les 7 premiers jours après SF0 n’était pas différente de celle des patients ayant reçu le TCZ 8 à 10jours et >11jours après SF0. De même, les délais de survie n’étaient pas associés à la période SF0–J0. Un débit d’O2 à J0 >12 L/min versus 4-8L/min (OR 9,73, IC à 95 % [2,10-45,12] ; HR 5,20, IC à 95 % [1,62–16,67]) était significativement associée au décès chez les patients traités par TCZ, alors que le taux de CRP à J0 ne l’était pas. Discussion Dans cette étude de vraie vie rapportant l’utilisation compassionnelle du TCZ chez des patients atteints de formes modérées à sévères de COVID-19 hospitalisés hors soins intensifs, le délai de perfusion du TCZ n’avait pas d’impact sur la survie des patients contrairement au débit d’O2 à l’admission. En outre, l’existence d’un odds ratio de près de 10 pour des débits d’O2 différents chez des patients tous classés OMS 5 suggère de créer des sous-groupes de gravité croissante (4-8L/min, 9-11 L/min, 12-15 L/min) afin d’homogénéiser les populations étudiées.

Early diagnosis of the virus is of great significance for both of infected patients and doctors providing treatments. Chest Computerized tomography (CT) screening is one of the most straightforward techniques to detect pneumonia which was caused by the virus and thus to make the diagnosis. To facilitate the process of diagnosing COVID-19, we therefore developed a graph convolutional neural network ResGNet-C under ResGNet framework to automatically classify lung CT images into normal and confirmed pneumonia caused by COVID-19. In ResGNet-C, two by-products named NNet-C, ResNet101-C that showed high performance on detection of COVID-19 are simultaneously generated as well. Our best model ResGNet-C achieved an averaged accuracy at 0.9662 with an averaged sensitivity at 0.9733 and an averaged specificity at 0.9591 using five cross-validations on the dataset, which is comprised of 296 CT images. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating graph knowledge into the COVID-19 classification task. Graphs are constructed according to the Euclidean distance between features extracted by our proposed ResNet101-C and then are encoded with the features to give the prediction results of CT images. Besides the high-performance system, which surpassed all state-of-the-art methods, our proposed graph construction method is simple, transferrable yet quite helpful for improving the performance of classifiers, as can be justified by the experimental results.","Yu, Xiang; Lu, Siyuan; Guo, Lili; Wang, Shui-Hua; Zhang, Yu-Dong",Neurocomputing,343,24

Although the situation is rapidly evolving, with datasets being continually corrected or updated, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations. While studies are beginning to highlight specific parameters that may be playing a role, few have attempted to thoroughly estimate the relative importance of these disparate variables that likely include: climate, population demographics, and imposed state interventions. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted density (PWD), some ""stay at home"" metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race/ethnicity, and chronic low respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of ""lock-down"" orders should be tailored to the local PWD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present.","Riley, P.; Riley, A.; Turtle, J.; Ben-Nun, M.",,343,28

Understanding the psychological consequences of the UK’s lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified, and appropriate support can be implemented. METHODS: Participants were a convenience sample of parents and carers (n = 2,988) in the UK with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years who completed an online survey about their child’s mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from monthly assessments over four months. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms separately, and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. RESULTS: Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time, whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four, and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained ‘stable low’ symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July. These children were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have SEN/ND, or to be younger in age. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support previous literature and highlight that certain risk factors were associated with poorer mental health trajectories for children and adolescents during the pandemic.","Raw, Jasmine A.

Administration of convalescent plasma, serum, or hyperimmune immunoglobulin may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology. We conducted a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis to assess the overall evidence. Methods. Healthcare databases and sources of grey literature were searched in July 2013. All records were screened against the protocol eligibility criteria, using a 3-stage process. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. Results. We identified 32 studies of SARS coronavirus infection and severe influenza. Narrative analyses revealed consistent evidence for a reduction in mortality, especially when convalescent plasma is administered early after symptom onset. Exploratory post hoc meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, .14–.45; I(2) = 0%). Studies were commonly of low or very low quality, lacked control groups, and at moderate or high risk of bias. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. Conclusions. Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality and appears safe.

The virus rapidly spread into the whole world causing an unprecedented pandemic and forcing governments to impose a global quarantine, entering an extreme unknown situation. The organizational consequences of quarantine/isolation are absence of organized training and competition, lack of communication among athletes and coaches, inability to move freely, lack of adequate sunlight exposure, and inappropriate training conditions. The reduction of mobility imposed to contain the advance of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic can negatively affect the physical condition and health of individuals leading to muscle atrophy, progressive loss of muscle strength, and reductions in neuromuscular and mechanical capacities. Resistance training (RT) might be an effective tool to counteract these adverse consequences. RT is considered an essential part of an exercise program due to its numerous health and athletic benefits. However, in the face of the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak, many people might be concerned with safety issues regarding its practice, especially in indoor exercise facilities, such as gyms and fitness centers. These concerns might be associated with RT impact in the immune system, respiratory changes, and contamination due to equipment sharing and agglomeration. In this current opinion article, we provide insights to address these issues to facilitate the return of RT practices under the new logistical and health challenges.

METHODS: Observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Amman, Jordan. Demographic data, clinical presentation and smoking status were collected. Sinonasal symptoms, using Sino‐Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT‐22) Questionnaire, were evaluated. Smell/taste dysfunction was followed for three months. RESULTS: Ninety‐Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty‐six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3% had cough, 52.3% sore throat and 48.8% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non‐smokers. Smell/taste dysfunction affected 25.6% of patients, but was the first symptom in only one patient. Fourteen of 22 symptoms in SNOT‐22 had significant increase. The overall average of symptoms scores increased from 0.472 to 1.034, with smell/taste dysfunction to have the most increment. The latter symptom recovered completely in 81% and dysgeusia developed in 9.5% at three months, and it recovered completely in all patients at six months.

The head and neck region can be variably affected in adult patients, and taste and smell disorders are typical manifestations. However, pediatric clinical signs are less severe, making the onset diagnosis challenging to interpret. The variability of nasal olfactory symptoms in children and adolescents is intertwined with possible warning signs, including gastrointestinal, ocular, or dermato-logical symptoms. We present a case involving a 15-year-old boy with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who had late-onset rash and transient taste and smell disorders. CASE REPORT: The boy’s clinical history revealed that a family member was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the preceding 3 days, the boy’s eating habits had changed; he perceived a metallic taste while eating and had a loss of appetite. He also had erythematous skin lesions on the lower limbs for the 2 previous days. A sore throat, nasal congestion, and a runny nose were reported on head and neck examination. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test was positive, confirming the initial diagnostic hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children and adolescents can be asymptomatic, but it can also occur with fever, dry cough, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to the unique immune characteristics of pediatric and adolescent patients, the correct interpretation of the gustatory and skin symptoms associated with specific laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the most appropriate management and supportive care.","Maniaci, Antonino; Iannella, Giannicola; Vicini, Claudio; Pavone, Piero; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Falsaperla, Raffaele; Di Mauro, Paola; Ferlito, Salvatore; Cocuzza, Salvatore",Am J Case Rep,343,16

Non cultivable viruses have been associated with many cases of diarrhea. Norwalk, two strains of calicivirus and SRV/SRSV, appear to be capable of causing outbreak. Rotavirus, astrovirus and most fastidious adenoviruses are associated with endemic spread. Specific or catch-all methods are used for diagnosis. Among the latter, electron microscopy is the most commonly used when the virus is recognizable and present in sufficient quantities. Small spherical viruses in the range 20–35 nm present greater difficulties. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gives interesting epidemiological results for rotavirus. Specific methods are latex agglutination and enzyme immunoassays essentially for rotavirus and adenoviruses (all types or only 40 and 41). False positive results are few with well-designed kits. False negative results are seen in atypical strains and antigenic variants. In an outbreak, it is essential to make electron microscopic examinations. In individual cases, if no electron microscope is available, it is possible to make the diagnosis of rotavirus — and perhaps adenovirus 40 and 41 with a commercial kit. However a small number of stools contain more than one virus and they may act in synergy. In contrast many asymptomatic children may carry viruses.","Peigue-Lafeuille, H.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,343,26

However, all patients with asthma or COPD should continue all prescribed inhaled medications.

Considering that aerosol therapy generates fugitive emissions that are not inhaled by the patient and are released from the device during expiration, several international professional bodies have provided recommendations for drug delivery via inhalers and in particular, nebulizers. Unfortunately, these recommendations are often in conflict with each other and do not clarify whether it is appropriate to use nebulizers during this COVID-19 pandemic.

PURPOSE: The actual sanitary crisis led to a massive mobilization of the sanitary system toward intensive care units and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, some patients still require spinal interventions. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgical in a moderate COVID-19 cluster region. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Previous studies have reported screening and management of patients with spinal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, knowledge, no observational study on spine surgeries during the pandemic has not been reported. METHODS: Between March 17, 2020 and April 17, 2020, information on spine surgical activity was prospectively collected at our institution. This surgical activity related to the first month of confinement in France was compared to the activity during the same period in 2019 to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activities. RESULTS: In order to reduce the contamination rate of patients and medical staff during hospitalization, the spine department was completely reorganized. Non-urgent elective spine surgeries were cancelled. When considering the global amount of surgeries procedures during the first month of confinement, a decrease of almost 50% was observed in the number of surgical procedures. During the study period, 62 patients were eligible for spine surgery. The numbers of patients managed for tumor and infectious cases were stable, while a considerable reduction was observed in the number of trauma and degenerative cases. During the follow-up period, two patients were tested as COVID+ during the postoperative course, and no cases of medical or paramedical staff contamination were reported using polymerase chain reaction-testing. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain spine surgical activity. Each surgical procedure must be discussed and organized with all the caregivers involved. Indications for surgery must be in line with the scientific guidelines and adapted to each healthcare facility.","Meyer, Mikael; Prost, Solène; Farah, Kaissar; Denis, Jean-Baptiste; Dufour, Henry; Blondel, Benjamin; Fuentes, Stéphane",Asian Spine J,343,21

Objectifs Cette enquête a pour but d’évaluer l’impact du confinement sur l’accès aux personnels de santé (PDS) et la résilience des patients atteints de SEP pendant cette période inédite. Patients et méthodes Une enquête en ligne a été proposé aux patients suivis au sein de la clinique SEP du groupement hospitalier de l’institut catholique de Lille de mai à août 2020. Le questionnaire comprenait une partie sur les conséquences globales du confinement, l’accès aux PDS libéraux et hospitaliers, les alternatives aux soins mises en place et leurs souhaits de retour aux soins. Une analyse descriptive des données recueillies a été réalisée. Résultats Cent quatre-vingt-un patients ont répondu à l’enquête. Parmi les patients, 76,2 % ont vécu le confinement comme négatif avec aggravation de la spasticité, de la fatigue et de l’endurance. Parmi les patients, 38 % n’ont pas eu accès aux PDS principalement les kinésithérapeutes, médecins traitants et spécialistes. Parmi les patients, 49,2 % ont mis en place des programmes d’auto-rééducation. Parmi les patients, 39,2 % ont bénéficié d’une téléconsultation et 77 % en était satisfait. Enfin, 94 % sont prêts à revenir à l’hôpital pour leur suivi avec quelques adaptations. Discussion L’enquête AMGEN pour DATACOVID évoquait 30 % d’impact sur la prise en charge des patients atteints de pathologies chroniques. À notre connaissance, aucune étude française n’a évalué l’impact du confinement sur la population SEP. Deux études européennes menées sur des populations SEP retrouvaient sensiblement les mêmes résultats sur l’aggravation du handicap et les difficultés d’accès aux soins. Conclusion L’impact du confinement sur cette population n’est pas négligeable. Cependant, même si cette période a été compliquée pour nos patients ils gardent pour la plupart d’excellentes capacités d’adaptation.","Guenot, Maëva; Kwiatkowski, Arnaud; Massot, Caroline; Hautecoeur, Patrick; Donzé, Cécile",Revue Neurologique,343,16

We also expected that counties designated as primary care health professional shortage areas (PCHPSAs) would be associated with higher COVID-19 death rates, and the lack of primary care access would exacerbate racial disparities in death rates. We undertook this study to test these hypotheses and discern the independent effects of racial composition, socioecologic characteristics, and healthcare system factors on COVID-19 cases and deaths in Georgia counties. METHODS: We used county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths on April 23, 2020 from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and estimates of 2019 county-level populations from the US Census Bureau to calculate the cumulative event rates for the state of Georgia. We used multiple regression models to examine crude and adjusted associations of socioecologic and health system variables with county-level COVID-19 case and mortality rates. RESULTS: After adjustment, a 1% increase in the proportion of Black people in the county resulted in a 2.3% increase in the county COVID-19 confirmed case rate and a 3.0% increase in the death rate (relative risk 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.05, P < 0.001). Primary care shortage areas had a 74% higher death rate (relative risk 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.00–3.00, P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the impact of racial disparities on the spatial patterns of COVID-19 disease burden in Georgia, which can guide interventions to mitigate racial disparities. The results also support the need for robust primary care infrastructure throughout the state.","Baltrus, Peter T.; Douglas, Megan; Li, Chaohua; Caplan, Lee S.; Blount, Mitchell; Mack, Dominic; Gaglioti, Anne H.",South Med J,343,16

The results are based on the longitudinal representative 50+ population-based multi-country panel study Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in which representative samples of individuals in European countries plus Israel were collected. The goal is to turn the challenges of aging into opportunities as well as provide valid and reliable data for evidence-based policies. A total of 2,631 participants were interviewed by telephone in the Czech Republic during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. After a descriptive analysis showed that participants complied well with most preventative and protective COVID-19 measures, subsequent modeling using logistic regression analysis and a decision tree algorithm identified key determinants that have contributed to an understanding of variation in declared feelings of depression. We found that nervousness, previously unexperienced trouble with sleep, and self-rated health status before the COVID-19 outbreak and gender remained significant predictors of depression, from which statistically significant different categories concerning the percentage of depression could be formed. These identified potential risk factors should be considered in planning further supportive strategies for high-risk 50+ population.","Vaculíková, Jitka; Hanková, Magdalena",Journal of gerontological social work,343,1

Initial chest CT examination must be performed without intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material, but contrast material administration is required when pulmonary embolism is suspected, which seems to be frequent in severe forms of the disease. Typical CT features consist of bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral, posterior and basal predominance. Lung disease extent on CT correlates with clinical severity.

Consequently, elective and semi-urgent operations on the increasing number of patients severely affected by COVID-19 have been indefinitely postponed.in many countries with unclear implications on disease progression and overall survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the establishment of a standardized screening program for acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sufficient to ensure high-quality medical and surgical treatment of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients while minimizing in-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: The screening program comprised polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs and a standardized questionnaire about potential symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All elective and emergency patients admitted to the surgical department of a tertiary-care hospital center in Lower Franconia, Germany, between March and May 2020 were included and their characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: Out of the study population (n = 657), 509 patients (77.5%) had at least one risk factor for a potentially severe course of COVID-19 and 164 patients (25%) were active smokers. The average 7-day incidence in Lower Franconia was 24.0/100,000 during the observation period. Preoperative PCR testing revealed four asymptomatic positive patients out of the 657 tested patients. No postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection or transmission could be detected. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a standardized preoperative screening program to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients can ensure high-quality surgical care while minimizing infection risk for healthcare workers and potential in-hospital transmission.","Flemming, Sven; Hankir, Mohammed K.; Kusan, Simon; Krone, Manuel; Anger, Friedrich; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Wiegering, Armin",Eur J Med Res,343,22

This paper quantifies the association between smoking and COVID-19 disease progression. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 1–May 25, 2020. We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease, including death. We used random effects meta-analysis, meta-regression and locally weighted regression and smoothing to examine relationships in the data. RESULTS: We identified 46 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 22,939 COVID-19 patients, 5421 (23.6%) experienced disease progression and 2914 (12.7%) with a history of smoking (current and former smokers). Among those with a history of smoking, 33.5% experienced disease progression, compared with 21.9% of non-smokers. The meta-analysis confirmed an association between ever smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33–1.89, p = 0.001). Ever smoking was associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–1.39, p = 0.003). We found no significant difference (p = 0.864) between the effects of ever smoking on COVID-19 disease progression between adjusted and unadjusted analyses, suggesting that smoking is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression. We also found the risk of having COVID-19 progression higher among younger adults (p = 0.001), with the effect most pronounced among younger adults under about 45 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is an independent risk for having progression of COVID-19, including mortality. The effects seem to be higher among young people. Smoking prevention and cessation should remain a priority for the public, physicians, and public health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Molecular methods of pathogen discovery have recently led to the description of several new respiratory viruses. Human bocavirus (HBoV), a proposed member of the family Parvoviridae, is one of the most recently described respiratory viruses. Initial reports indicate that HBoV is a common cause of respiratory tract infection in children. Methods. A total of 1474 nasal scraping specimens collected over a 20-month period were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of HBoV nucleic acid. Positive results were confirmed with a second polymerase chain reaction assay from a different genomic region. The medical records of patients with positive results were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Results. HBoV DNA was identified in 82 samples (5.6%). The peak rate of HBoV infection occurred during the period of March through May in both 2004 and 2005. Sixty-three percent of infected patients were <12 months of age. The most common symptoms were cough, rhinorrhea, and fever. Other symptoms of interest included diarrhea and a “paroxysmal” cough that was clinically suspected to be caused by Bordetella pertussis. Conclusions. HBoV DNA is commonly present in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The presence of a pertussis-like cough and diarrhea in association with HBoV infection merits further investigation.","Arnold, John C.; Singh, Kumud K.; Spector, Stephen A.; Sawyer, Mark H.",Clin Infect Dis,343,28

While one case report suggested that sarcoidosis medications such as glucocorticoids may lengthen the COVID-19 disease course, another study with a larger registry suggests they do not. More studies are needed to elucidate an improvement in outcomes. It is possible that addition of TNF-alpha inhibitors at COVID-19 diagnosis decreases hospitalization rate. Overall, it is difficult to make firm conclusions regarding treatment given the heterogeneity of treatment modalities in the current literature. Our summarized findings are outlined with the opinions of sarcoidosis, pulmonary, and infectious disease experts in a flow chart that provides clinicians with our proposed management algorithm for sarcoidosis patients who develop COVID-19.

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) contribute to coagulopathy, but their role in COVID‐19 remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of aPLs in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: Sera collected from 66 critically ill and 13 non‐critically ill patients with COVID‐19 were tested for anti‐cardiolipin (aCL) and anti‐β2‐glycoprotein 1 (aβ2GP1) (IgG, IgM, and IgA) and IgG aβ2GP1‐D1 by the chemiluminescence assay (CIA) and IgM and IgG anti‐phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) by ELISA. RESULTS: aPLs were detected in 47.0% of critically ill patients (31/66), but not in patients with non‐critical conditions. IgA aβ2GP1 was the most common aPL, present in 28.8% (19/66) critically ill patients, followed by IgA aCL (25.8%,17/66) and IgG aβ2GP1 (18.2%,12/66). For multiple aPLs, IgA aβ2GP1+IgA aCL was the most common type (22.7%, 15/66), followed by IgA aβ2GP1+IgA aCL+ IgG aβ2GP1 (15.2%, 10/66). aPLs emerge around 35‐39 days post‐disease onset. Dynamic analysis of aPLs revealed 4 patterns based on persistence or transient appearance of the aPLs. Patients with multiple aPLs displayed significantly higher incidence of cerebral infarction (p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: aPLs were common in critically ill patients. Multiple medium or high levels aPLs may help identify patients at risk of developing cerebral infarction. aPLs may be transient and disappear within a few weeks, but in genetically predisposed patients, COVID‐19 may trigger the development of “COVID‐19‐induced‐APS‐like‐syndrome”. Long‐term follow‐up on COVID‐19 patients positive for aPLs would be of great importance.","Xiao, Meng; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Shulan; Qin, Xuzhen; Xia, Peng; Cao, Wei; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Huan; Ding, Xin; Zhao, Hua; Zhang, Hongmin; Wang, Chunyao; Zhao, Jing; Sun, Xuefeng; Tian, Ran; Wu, Wei; Wu, Dong; Ma, Jie; Chen, Yu; Zhang, Dong; Xie, Jing; Yan, Xiaowei; Zhou, Xiang; Liu, Zhengyin; Wang, Jinglan; Du, Bin; Qin, Yan; Gao, Peng; Lu, Minya; Hou, Xin; Wu, Xian; Zhu, Huadong; Xu, Yingchun; Zhang, Wen; Li, Taisheng; Zhang, Fengchun; Zhao, Yongqiang; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Arthritis Rheumatol,343,16

The aim of the study was to assess effectiveness and safety of the IL-17 antagonist nekatimab for its treatment. METHODS: The retrospective study included COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein levels >60 mg/L. Patients received either netakimab (group NET), IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab (group TOC) or no anti-cytokine treatment (group CON). RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the NET group, 27 patients in the TOC group, and 47 patients in the CON group. Mortality was lower in the NET group than in TOC and CON groups (2.3% vs. 14.8% and 31.9%; p = 0.018 and p < 0.001). NET group patients required intensive care unit admission (6.8% vs. 25.9% and 46.3%; p = 0.025 and p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs. 22.2% and 31.9%; p = 0.022 and p = 0.002) less frequently than patients of the TOC and CON groups. After 7–10 days of anti-cytokine drug administration, a reduction in lung lesion volume (p = 0.016) and an increase in the proportion of patients who did not need oxygen support (p = 0.005) or stayed in prone position (p = 0.044) was observed in the NET group only group; C-reactive protein levels were the same in the TOC and NET groups (p = 0.136) and lower in the CON group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005).

Some limitations that confront with these tests are false-negative results, tests redone for follow-up procedure, high cost, and unable to do for all patients. To overcome these limitations, modified and alternative tests must be considered. Among these tests, RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay had the lowest diagnostic limitation and highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and nonrespiratory tract clinical specimens.

In the lung, hyperinflammation leads to structural damage to tissue. To date, numerous lung histological studies have shown extensive alveolar damage, but there is scarce documentation of vascular inflammation in postmortem lung tissue. Methods: Lung sections from 8 COVID-19 affected and 11 non-COVID-19 subjects [of which 8 were acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) affected and 3 were from subjects with non-respiratory diseases] were stained for H & E to ascertain histopathological features including presence of thrombi/microthrombi. Inflammation along the vessel wall was also monitored by quantification of the expression of moieties of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (NLRP3 and caspase-1). Results: In lungs from “fatal COVID-19”, vascular changes in the form of microthrombi in small vessels, arterial thrombosis, and organization were extensive as compared to lungs from “non-COVID-19 non respiratory disease” affected subjects. The NLRP3 pathway components were significantly higher in lungs from COVID-19 subjects as compared to non-COVID-19 fatal cases without respiratory disease. No significant differences were observed between COVID-19 lungs and non-COVID-19 ARDS lungs. Conclusion: We posit that inflammasome formation along the vessel wall is a characteristic of lung inflammation that accompanies COVID-19. Thus, the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway seems to be probable candidate that drives amplification of inflammation post SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Paul, Oindrila; Tao, Jian Qin; West, Eric; Litzky, Leslie; Feldman, Michael; Montone, Kathleen; Rajapakse, Chamith; Bermudez, Christian; Chatterjee, Shampa",Res Sq,343,16

Therefore, the present study intended to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to collect the available clinical evidence on the value of physiological scoring systems in predicting the in-hospital mortality of acute patients. METHOD: An extensive search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until the end of year 2020. Physiological models included Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), modified REMS (mREMS), and Worthing Physiological Score (WPS). Finally, the data were summarized and the findings were presented as summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC), sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). RESULTS: Data from 25 articles were included. The overall analysis showed that the area under the SROC curve of REMS, RAPS, mREMS, and WPS criteria were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.86), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), 0.64 (95% CI: 0.60-0.68) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.89), respectively.

METHODS: In the present single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we reported findings from 87 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory syndrome hospitalized in an intermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU), subdividing the patients in two groups according to the admission date (before and after March 29, 2020). RESULTS: With improved skills in the clinical management of COVID-19, we observed a significant lower mortality in the T2 group compared with the T1 group and a significantly difference in terms of mortality among the patients transferred in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from our intermediate RICU (100% in T1 group vs. 33.3% in T2 group). The average length of stay in intermediate RICU of ICU-transferred patients who survived in T1 and T2 was significantly longer than those who died (who died 3.3 ± 2.8 days vs. who survived 6.4 ± 3.3 days).

Given the outbreak of this disease, it is so important to find a treatment. One strategy to cope with COVID-19 is to use the active ingredients of medicinal plants. In this study, the effect of active substances was surveyed in inhibiting four important druggable targets, including S protein, 3CLpro, RdRp, and N protein. RdRp controls the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and is crucial for its life cycle. 3CLpro is the main protease of the virus and could be another therapeutic target. Moreover, N protein and S protein are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and attaching, respectively. METHODS: The 3D structures of herbal active ingredients were prepared and docked with the mentioned SARS-CoV-2 proteins to obtain their affinity. Then, available antiviral drugs introduced in other investigations were docked using similar tools and compared with the results of this study. Finally, other properties of natural compounds were uncovered for drug designing. RESULTS: The outcomes of the study revealed that Linarin, Amentoflavone, (−)-Catechin Gallate and Hypericin from Chrysanthemum morifolium, Hypericum perforatum, Humulus lupulus, and Hibiscus sabdariffa had the highest affinity for these basic proteins and in some cases, their affinity was much higher than antiviral medicines. CONCLUSION: In addition to having high affinity, these herb active ingredients have antioxidant, vasoprotective, anticarcinogenic, and antiviral properties. Therefore, they can be used as extremely safe therapeutic compounds in drug design studies to control COVID-19.","Mahmoudi, Samira; Balmeh, Negar; Mohammadi, Niloofar; Sadeghian-Rizi, Tahereh",Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,343,16

Study Design: This was a prospective observational case-control study of infants born to women who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR at any time during their pregnancy (n=15). The study was carried out in a Tertiary University Maternity Hospital (8,500 deliveries/year) in Ireland. This study was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written consent was obtained. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery, full blood count and Calibrated Automated Thrombography were performed. Demographics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Healthy term infants, previously recruited as controls to a larger study prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, were the historical control population (n=10). RESULTS: Infants born to women with SARS-CoV-2 had similar growth parameters (birth weight 3600g v 3680g, p=0.83) and clinical outcomes to healthy controls, such as need for resuscitation at birth (2 (13.3%) v 1 (10%), p=1.0) and NICU admission (1 (6.7%) v 2 (20%), p=0.54). Haematological parameters (Haemoglobin, platelet, white cell and lymphocyte counts) in the COVID-19 group were all within normal neonatal reference ranges.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infections in humans. The changing antimicrobial sensitivity in UTI requires appropriate antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where the complete reversal of antimicrobial resistance is difficult due to irrational use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the most common bacterial agents causing UTI in different seasons among patients who were admitted to Buraidah Central Hospital (BCH), Saudi Arabia. The study also evaluated the link between prescribing and resistance toward antimicrobials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 6-month retrospective study was conducted among adult patients who were admitted to the inpatient department at BCH. A total of 379 files were collected from microbiological laboratory for inpatients. RESULTS: Most UTI-causing bacteria prevailed in the same season. Of 15 bacterial strains, 12 were significantly correlated with 20 (of a total of 40) antibiotics that were used. Most bacteria were gram-negative. Gram-negative bacilli including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonadaceae and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis were most frequently causing UTIs. CONCLUSION: Overall prevalence of antibiotic resistance was negative in bacterial isolates. However, the relationship between antimicrobial prescribing and antimicrobial resistance was significantly negative among UTI patients in BCH, Saudi Arabia.","Alsohaim, Sulaiman I.

The world is grappling with the second wave of this new pandemic. Different approaches are taken into consideration to tackle this deadly disease. These approaches were suggested in the form of modeling, analysis of the data, controlling the disease spread and clinical perspectives. In all these suggested approaches, the main aim was to eliminate or decrease the infection of the coronavirus from the community. Here, in this paper, we focus on developing a new mathematical model to understand its dynamics and possible control. We formulate the model first in the integer order and then use the Atangana–Baleanu derivative concept with a non-singular kernel for its generalization. We present some of the necessary mathematical aspects of the fractional model. We use a nonlinear fractional Lyapunov function in order to present the global asymptotical stability of the model at the disease-free equilibrium. In order to solve the model numerically in the fractional case, we use an efficient modified Adams–Bashforth scheme. The resulting iterative scheme is then used to demonstrate the detailed simulation results of the ABC mathematical model to examine the importance of the memory index and model parameters on the transmission and control of COVID-19 infection.","Khan, Muhammad Altaf; Ullah, Saif; Kumar, Sunil",Eur Phys J Plus,343,26

OBJECTIVES: To describe a Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf)-contaminated feline packed RBC (pRBC) unit and experimentally investigate Pf-contaminated canine pRBCs. METHODS: Canine pRBCs were inoculated with Pf-rich pRBCs from the sentinel feline unit and stored at 4°C or 20°C for 72 hours. Aliquots from the pRBCs were serially evaluated by microscopy, culture, and a eubacterial 16S rRNA real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: One Pf-contaminated feline unit turned black after 22 days of storage and was removed from the blood bank; a source was not found, and no other contaminated units were identified. Canine pRBCs spiked with 5 or 25 μL of the sentinel unit became culture- and/or 16S PCR-positive at ≥8 hours at 20°C and 48 hours at 4°C and developed a color change at ≥24 hours. Sensitivity studies indicated that without incubation, inoculation of ≥100 μL Pf-rich pRBCs was necessary for a positive 16S PCR test result. CONCLUSIONS: P. fluorescens grows in stored pRBCs slowly at 4°C and rapidly at 20°C. Screening of blood products for color change, estimating bacterial concentration with microscopy, and 16S PCR testing are simple and fast ways to detect bacteria in stored blood. Aseptic collection, temperature-controlled storage, and regular visual monitoring of stored units is recommended.

Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trail in Northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood engorged mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.","Fauver, Joseph R.; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Fakoli, Lawrence S.; Bolay, Kpehe; Bolay, Fatorma K.; Diclaro, Joseph W.; Brackney, Doug E.; Foy, Brian D.; Stenglein, Mark D.; Ebel, Gregory D.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,343,1

COVID‐19 infection and acute endocarditis may present similarly, both with shortness of breath and vital sign abnormalities, yet they require very different treatments. Here, we present two cases in which life‐threatening acute endocarditis was initially misdiagnosed as COVID‐19 infection during the height of the pandemic in New York City. The first was a case of Klebsiella pneumoniae mitral valve endocarditis leading to papillary muscle rupture and severe mitral regurgitation, and the second a case of Streptococcus mitis aortic valve endocarditis with heart failure due to severe aortic regurgitation. These cases highlight the importance of careful clinical reasoning and demonstrate how cognitive errors may impact clinical reasoning. They also underscore the limitations of real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for SARS‐CoV‐2 testing and illustrate the ways in which difficulty interpreting results may also influence clinical reasoning. Accurate diagnosis of acute endocarditis is critical given that surgical intervention can be lifesaving in unstable patients.","Hayes, Dena E.; Rhee, David W.; Hisamoto, Kazuhiro; Smith, Deane; Ro, Richard; Vainrib, Alan F.; Bamira, Daniel; Zhou, Fang; Saric, Muhamed",Echocardiography,343,12

There is currently a debate on when and how such measures should be loosened. To forecast the demand for hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU beds for COVID-19 patients from May to September, we developed 2 models, assuming a gradual easing of restrictions or an intermittent lockdown. METHODS: We used a compartmental model to evaluate 2 scenarios: (A) an intermittent lockdown; (B) a gradual relaxation of the lockdown. Predicted ICU and non-ICU demand was compared with the peak in hospital bed use observed in April 2020. RESULTS: Under scenario A, while ICU demand will remain below the peak, the number of non-ICU will substantially rise and will exceed it (133%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-171). Under scenario B, a rise in ICU and non-ICU demand will start in July and will progressively increase over the summer 2020, reaching 95% (95% CI: 71-121) and 237% (95% CI: 191-282) of the April peak. CONCLUSIONS: Italian hospital demand is likely to remain high in the next months. If restrictions are reduced, planning for the next several months should consider an increase in health-care resources to maintain surge capacity across the country.","Bollon, Jordy; Paganini, Matteo; Nava, Consuelo Rubina; De Vita, Nello; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Ragazzoni, Luca; Della Corte, Francesco; Barone-Adesi, Francesco",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,343,16

The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here, we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV-2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Infection of 293FT target cells was possible only if the cells were engineered to stably express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike-activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5- to 10-fold. Replacement of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modifications D614G and R682Q further enhanced infectious particle production. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles reached almost 10(6) infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike were successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but not in plasma from uninfected individuals. IMPORTANCE In work with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus, leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here, we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high-titer SARS-COV-2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for the detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.","Johnson, Marc C.; Lyddon, Terri D.; Suarez, Reinier; Salcedo, Braxton; LePique, Mary; Graham, Maddie; Ricana, Clifton; Robinson, Carolyn; Ritter, Detlef G.",J Virol,343,21

In October 2019, the Calm mindfulness meditation app introduced a mood check-in feature, but its effects on participation in meditation have yet to be tested. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate how a mood check-in feature impacts meditation behavior in Calm app subscribers. METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal analysis of mobile app usage data from a random sample of first-time subscribers to the Calm app (n=2600) who joined in summer 2018 or summer 2019. The mood check-in feature allows users to rate their mood using an emoji after completing a meditation session and displays a monthly calendar of their past mood check-ins. Regression analyses were used to compare the rate of change in meditation behavior before and after the introduction of mood check-ins and to estimate how usage of mood check-ins was associated with individuals’ future meditation behavior (ie, intent-to-treat effects). Additional regression models examined the heterogenous effect of mood check-ins between subscribers who were active or inactive users prior to the introduction to mood check-ins (ie, above or below the median number of weeks with any meditation within their cohort). In order to confirm the specific associations between mood check-ins and meditation engagement, we modeled the direct relationship between the use of mood check-ins in previous weeks and subsequent meditation behavior (ie, treatment on the treated effects). RESULTS: During the first 9 months of their subscription, the 2019 cohort completed an average of 0.482 more sessions per week (95% CI 0.309 to 0.655) than the 2018 cohort; however, across both cohorts, average weekly meditation declined (–0.033 sessions per week, 95% CI –0.035 to –0.031). Controlled for trends in meditation before mood check-ins and aggregate differences between the 2018 and 2019 samples, the time trend in the number of weekly meditation sessions increased by 0.045 sessions among the 2019 cohort after the introduction of mood check-ins (95% CI 0.039 to 0.052). This increase in meditation was most pronounced among the inactive subscribers (0.063 sessions, 95% CI 0.052 to 0.074). When controlled for past-week meditation, use of mood check-ins during the previous week was positively associated with the likelihood of meditating the following week (odds ratio 1.132, 95% CI 1.059 to 1.211); however, these associations were not sustained beyond 1 week. CONCLUSIONS: Using mood check-ins increases meditation participation in Calm app subscribers and may be especially beneficial for inactive subscribers. Mobile apps should consider incorporating mood check-ins to help better engage a wider range of users in app-based meditation, but more research is warranted.","Huberty, Jennifer; Green, Jeni; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,343,16

Whether pregnant women in general are more susceptible of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Methods: Linked registry-data on all women ages 15 to 45 living in Norway on March 1st, 2020 (N=1,033,699) were used in Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) comparing pregnant to non-pregnant women, of having a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, a diagnosis of COVID-19 in specialist healthcare, or hospitalization with COVID-19, adjusting for age, marital status, education, income, country of birth and underlying medical conditions. Results: Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a similar risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted HR, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.07), a higher risk of a COVID-19 diagnosis in specialist care (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.89 to 4.14), and to be hospitalized (HR, 4.70; 95% CI, 3.51 to 6.30). Pregnant women were in general not more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women born outside Scandinavia were less likely to be tested, but at higher risk of a positive test (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.51 to 8.87) and of hospitalization with COVID-19 (HR, 4.72; 95% CI, 2.51 to 8.87) than pregnant Scandinavian born women.

Here, we applied integrated bioinformatics to identify potential key genes and cytokine pathways after RV infection in asthma, and analyzed changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor of SARS-COV-2. MATERIAL/METHODS: The gene expression profile dataset GSE149273 was downloaded from NCBI-GEO, which included 90 samples of non-infected, RVA, and RVC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using t tests in the limma R package, and subsequently investigated by GO, KEGG, and DO analysis. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 and the proportion of immune cells were further analyzed to determine the effects of RV on cytokines. RESULTS: A total of 555 DEGs of RVA and 421 of RVC were identified. There were 415 DEGs in RVA and RVC, of which 406 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most DEGs were obviously enriched in cytokines, and were mainly enriched in “influenza” and “hepatitis C, chronic”. In addition, the expression of ACE2 increased significantly and the proportion of immune cytokines significantly changed after RV infection. Our results suggest that RV can activate the cytokine pathway associated with COVID-19 by increasing ACE2. CONCLUSIONS: The DEGs and related cytokine pathways after asthma RV infection identified using integrated bioinformatics in this study elucidate the potential link between RV and COVID-19.","Dai, Wenjuan; Cao, Dawei; Zhang, Wei; Wei, Yangyang; Ding, Daqing; Li, Bei; Gao, Yan; Zhao, Lixuan; Jiang, Yi; Kong, Xiaomei",Med Sci Monit,343,21

Previous studies have shown that BZD use could impair users' cognition, significantly affecting their quality of life. Past research has shown that higher education might play a protective role in the process of cognitive decline. Very few studies had examined the cognitive effects of BZD on highly educated older adults. The study aimed to explore how cognitive functions would be affected by benzodiazepines among highly educated older adults. Method: 140 older adults with an average education period of 14.8 years were included in this study. The subjects were divided into three separate groups, the long-term BZD users (≥180 days), short-term BZD users (<180 days), and non-users. Demographics and cognitive assessments for the three groups were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chi-squared test, and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To examine the association between BZD use and cognition a multiple linear aggression approach was used. Result: All three groups were significantly different from each other when looking at executive functioning in the Trail Making Test B (TMT-B). Compared to the control group, short-term BZD users showed significant defects in TMT-B time (p = 0.002) and TMT-B errors (p < 0.001); long-term BZD users showed significant defect on TMT-B time (p = 0.041). Compared to short-term BZD users, long-term BZD users showed significant merit on TMT-B errors (p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in other cognitive tasks that reflected general cognition, verbal memory, language fluency, and visual memory. After adjusting for demographic, increased BZD use over time was positively associated with scores for the revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (r = 0.377, p = 0.012). Conclusion: BZD use may be significantly associated with worse executive functioning in highly educated older adults. However, there is no association between the duration of BZD use and increased cognitive deficits in highly educated older adults. This study identified future experimental directions including potential longitudinal studies, within-subject studies comparing mood disorder patients' cognitive performance before and after onset of BZD use, and between-subject studies that directly compare BZD's effect on subjects with the same baseline of cognitive functioning.","Liu, Linzi; Jian, Peiying; Zhou, Yifang; Zhou, Jian; Jia, Linna; Tang, Minghui; Zhang, Rongwei; Tang, Yanqing",Front Psychiatry,343,20

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people’s movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the “new normal standard of life” following health guidelines and social distancing. Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation.

Mid-term outcomes of the survivors need to be assessed. The objective of this single-center cohort study was to describe their physical, cognitive, psychological, and biological outcomes at 3 months following intensive care unit (ICU)-discharge (M3). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All COVID-19 adults who survived an ICU stay ≥ 7 days and attended the M3 consultation at our multidisciplinary follow-up clinic were involved. They benefited from a standardized assessment, addressing health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), sleep disorders (PSQI), and the three principal components of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS): physical status (Barthel index, handgrip and quadriceps strength), mental health disorders (HADS and IES-R), and cognitive impairment (MoCA). Biological parameters referred to C-reactive protein and creatinine. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients admitted to our ICU for COVID-19, 42 survived a prolonged ICU stay and 32 (80%) attended the M3 follow-up visit. Their median age was 62 [49–68] years, 72% were male, and nearly half received inpatient rehabilitation following ICU discharge. At M3, 87.5% (28/32) had not regained their baseline level of daily activities. Only 6.2% (2/32) fully recovered, and had normal scores for the three MoCA, IES-R and Barthel scores. The main observed disorders were PSQI > 5 (75%, 24/32), MoCA < 26 (44%, 14/32), Barthel < 100 (31%, 10/32) and IES-R ≥ 33 (28%, 9/32). Combined disorders were observed in 13/32 (40.6%) of the patients. The EQ-5D-3L visual scale was rated at 71 [61–80]. A quarter of patients (8/32) demonstrated a persistent inflammation based on CRP blood level (9.3 [6.8–17.7] mg/L). CONCLUSION: The burden of severe COVID-19 and prolonged ICU stay was considerable in the present cohort after 3 months, affecting both functional status and biological parameters. These data are an argument on the need for closed follow-up for critically ill COVID-19 survivors.

Knowledge is essential to promote early awareness, diagnosis and treatment of AD symptoms. AD knowledge is influenced by many cultural factors including cultural beliefs, attitudes and language barriers. This study aims: (1) to define AD knowledge level and perceptions amongst adults between 18 and 49 years of age in the UK; (2) to compare knowledge and perceptions of AD among three main ethnic groups (Asian, Blacks, and Whites); and (3) to assess potential associations of age, gender, education level, affinity with older people (65 or over), family history and caregiving history with AD knowledge. METHODS: Data was collected from 186 participants as a convenience sample of younger adults of three different ethnicities (16.1% Asian, 16.7% Black, 67.2% White), living in the UK, recruited via an online research platform. The majority of the participants were in the 18–34 years age group (87.6%). Demographic characteristics of participants and AD knowledge correlation were assessed by the 30-item Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS), comprising 7 content domains. ANOVA/ANCOVA were used to assess differences in AD knowledge by ethnicity, gender, education level, age and affinity with dementia and Alzheimer’s patients. RESULTS: For AD general knowledge across all respondents only 45.0% answers were correct. No significant differences were found for the total ADKS score between ethnicities in this younger age group, who did not differ in education level. However, there were significant knowledge differences for the ADKS symptom domain score even after controlling for other demographics variables such as gender, education level (p = 0.005). White respondents were more likely to know about AD symptoms than their Black counterparts (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: The study’s findings suggest that the AD knowledge level is not adequate for all ethnic groups. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in symptoms, between ethnic groups, and therefore, differ in their needs regards health communication. The study contributes to an understanding of ethnicity differences in AD knowledge amongst adults from 18 to 49 years of age in the UK and may also provide input into an intervention plan for different ethnicities’ information needs.","Kafadar, Aysegul Humeyra; Barrett, Christine; Cheung, Kei Long",BMC Public Health,343,23

DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of 6 online focus groups conducted between 15th March - 22nd April 2021. SETTING: Online video conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 29 adult UK-based participants RESULTS: Three main groups regarding participants' decision or intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were identified: (1) Accepters, (2) Delayers and (3) Refusers. Two reasons for vaccine delay were identified: delay due to a perceived need more information and delay until vaccine was 'required' in the future. Three main facilitators (Vaccination as a social norm; Vaccination as a necessity; Trust in science) and six barriers (Preference for 'natural immunity'; Concerns over possible side effects; Distrust in government; Perceived lack of information; Conspiracy theories; 'Covid echo chambers') to vaccine uptake were identified. For some delayers, vaccine passports were perceived to be a reason why they would get vaccinated in the future. However, vaccine passports were controversial, and were framed in three main ways: as 'a necessary evil'; as 'Orwellian'; and as a 'human rights problem'. Participants generally felt that receiving a vaccine was not changing the extent to which people were adhering to COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, positive sentiment toward vaccines was high. However, there remains a number of potential barriers which might be leading to vaccine delay in some. 'Vaccine delay' might be a more useful and precise construct than vaccine hesitancy in explaining why some may initially ignore or be uncertain about vaccination invitations. Vaccine passports may increase or 'nudge' uptake in some delayers but remain controversial. Earlier concerns that vaccination might reduce adherence to social distancing measures are not borne out in our data, with most people reporting ongoing adherence and caution.","Williams, S.

Compared to studies of center- and school-based preschool practitioners, the FCC literature is lacking robust workforce studies, including examinations of whether and how FCC providers’ workplace appraisals of and feelings while at work are associated with indicators of interaction quality (relationships with families, relationships with children, and responsiveness to children's negative emotions) and the quality of their interactions with children and families. OBJECTIVE: The present study examines how groups of FCC providers, categorized based on differences in appraisals of and feelings experienced at work, differ in the quality of interactions with children and families. The study seeks to extend the FCC literature by also describing socio-ecological factors, such as provider and program characteristics, of these different groups of providers. METHOD: Survey data was collected through a national study of FCC providers (N = 888). A person-centered analysis using hierarchical clustering was used to classify providers into groups based on their workplace appraisals and feelings experienced at work. RESULTS: A person-centered cluster analysis identified four groups. Indicators of interaction quality varied between groups. Group membership was associated with FCC providers' professional commitment, job satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the current study support calls to increase investment in the support of the FCC workforce by addressing FCC providers’ needs through recognition of differences in workplace appraisals and provider feelings at work. In particular, reducing FCC providers’ emotional exhaustion may be an effective way to increase the quality of their interactions with children and families.","Park, Christen E.; Zinsser, Katherine M.; Jeon, Lieny",Child Youth Care Forum,343,1

Though a number of initiatives exist for researchers at PhD, post-doctoral and more senior levels, there remains a critical need for educational resources for research students at earlier career stages and across disciplines. The aim of the Principles and Practices of Open Research: Teaching, Research, Impact, and Learning (PaPOR TRaIL) project is to develop an open educational resource (OER) on the principles and practice of open research for undergraduate and master’s students. Methods: In stage 1, interviews and surveys of students and supervisors are being conducted to explore students’ and supervisors’ knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of open research, in addition to needs and preferences for the content and delivery of the OER. Stage 2 involves development of the OER content and delivery, based on Stage 1 engagement and national and international guidance on best practice in conducting and teaching open research. In Stage 3, students and supervisors will evaluate the developed OER and provide feedback in terms of OER usability, learning experience and learning outcomes. This feedback will guide revisions and finalisation of the OER content, format and learning activities. Discussion: The PaPOR TRaIL project will develop an evidence-based OER that provides a foundation in all aspects of open research theory & practice. Teaching undergraduate and master’s students open research will promote development of core research values and equip them with transferable competencies and skills, including how to conduct and use research in a trustworthy and ethical manner within and beyond academia. Enhancing teaching and learning of open research will promote better teaching and research outcomes that will benefit individuals, universities, and science more broadly.","Egan, Sophia; Tobin, Mary; Palmer, Brendan; Coffey, Aoife; Dahly, Darren; Houghton, Catherine; Ó Carragáin, Eoghan; Toomey, Elaine; Dockray, Samantha; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen",HRB Open Res,343,16

At the molecular level, the hallmark of sepsis is the elevated expression of a multitude of potent cytokines, i.e. a cytokine storm. For sepsis involving gram-negative bacteria, macrophages recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shed from the bacteria, activating Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4), and triggering a cytokine storm. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a highly active kinase that has been implicated in LPS-induced cytokine production. Thus, compounds that inhibit GSK-3 could be potential therapeutics for sepsis. Our group has recently described a novel and highly selective inhibitor of GSK-3 termed COB-187. In the present study, using THP-1 macrophages, we evaluated the ability of COB-187 to attenuate LPS-induced cytokine production. We found that COB-187 significantly reduced, at the protein and mRNA levels, cytokines induced by LPS (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL10, and IFN-β). Further, the data suggest that the inhibition could be due, at least in part, to COB-187 reducing NF-κB (p65/p50) DNA binding activity as well as reducing IRF-3 phosphorylation at Serine 396. Thus, COB-187 appears to be a potent inhibitor of the cytokine storm induced by LPS.","Noori, Mahboubeh S.; Courreges, Maria C.; Bergmeier, Stephen C.; McCall, Kelly D.; Goetz, Douglas J.",Eur J Pharmacol,343,16

The debate involves the mode of transmission of a simian virus (SIV) to humans. Both major camps in the argument presume that humans are normally free of such viruses and assume that once the simian virus was transmitted, it immediately infected some T-cells and caused the release of toxic agents that killed off bystander (uninfected) T-cells resulting in AIDS. The evolution of the Simian virus (SIV) into a human virus (HIV) is regarded as an artifact. In contrast, a fundamentally different hypothesis has been proposed [Parris GE. Med Hypotheses 2004;62(3):354–7] in which it is presumed that in hyper-endemic areas of malaria (central Africa), all primates (humans and non-human primates) have shared a retrovirus that augments their T-cell response to the malaria parasite. The virus can be called “primate T-cell retrovirus” (PTRV). Over thousands of years the virus has crossed species lines many times (with little effect) and typically adapts to the host quickly. In this model, AIDS is seen to be the result of the development of resistance of the virus (PTRV) to continuous exposure to pro-apoptotic (schizonticidal) aminoquinoline drugs used to prevent malaria. The hypothesis was originally proposed based on biochemical activities of the aminoquinolines (e.g., pamaquine (plasmoquine(TM)), primaquine and chloroquine), but recent publications demonstrated that some of these drugs definitely adversely affect HIV and other viruses and logically would cause them to evolve resistance. Review of the timeline that has been created for the evolution of HIV in humans is also shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with this hypothesis (and not with either version of the conventional hypothesis). SARS and Ebola also fit this pattern.","Parris, George E.",Med Hypotheses,343,5

Emerging evidence shows that this continues to be the case during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In an effort to rectify these differences in access to care, our team, which is co-led by FN/M/I partners, will generate and distribute evidence on COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccination in high-priority FN/M/I populations in Manitoba, with the goal of identifying system-level and individual-level factors that act as barriers to equitable care and thereby informing Indigenous-led public health responses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our nations-based approach focuses on FN/M/I populations with separate study arms for each group. Linked administrative health data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations are available on a weekly basis. We will conduct surveillance to monitor trends in testing and vaccination among each FN/M/I population and all other Manitobans, map the geographic distribution of these outcomes by health region and tribal council, and identify barriers to testing and vaccination to inform public health strategies. We will follow the course of the pandemic starting from January 2020 and report findings quarterly. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals have been granted by the University of Manitoba Research Ethics Board and from each of our FN/M/I partners’ organisations. Our team is committed to engaging in authentic relationship-based research that follows First Nations, Metis and Inuit research ethics principles. Our FN/M/I partners will direct the dissemination of new information to leadership in their communities (health directors, community health organisations) and to decision-makers in the provincial Ministry of Health. We will also publish in open-access journals. The study will create ongoing capacity to monitor Manitoba’s pandemic response and ensure potential health inequities are minimised, with learnings applicable to other jurisdictions where detailed administrative data may not be available.","Nickel, Nathan C; Clark, Wayne; Phillips-Beck, Wanda; Sanguins, Julianne; Enns, Jennifer Emily; Lavoie, Josée G; Romanescu, Razvan; Katz, Alan; Mahar, Alyson L; Brownell, Marni; Lix, Lisa; Urquia, Marcelo; Tso Deh, Miyosha; O’Conaill, Carrie; Durksen, Anita; Brownell, Emily",BMJ Open,343,13

Several studies have reported that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly infect endothelial cells, and endothelial dysfunction is often found in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better understand the pathological mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomarkers of endothelial cells in patients with COVID-19. Methods. A literature search was conducted on online databases for observational studies evaluating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and composite poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Results. A total of 1187 patients from 17 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated pooled means for von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen levels in COVID-19 patients was higher compared to healthy control (306.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 291.37-321.48], p<0.001; I2:86%), with the highest VWF antigen levels was found in deceased COVID-19 patients (448.57 [95% CI 407.20-489.93], p<0.001; I2:0%). Meta-analysis showed that higher plasma levels of VWF antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1) antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) were associated with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 patients ([standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.74 [0.33-1.16], p<0.001; I2:80.4%], [SMD 0.55 [0.19-0.92], p=0.003; I2:6.4%], [SMD 0.33 [0.04-0.62], p=0.025; I2:7.9%], and [SMD 0.55 [0.10-0.99], p=0.015; I2:23.6%], respectively). Conclusion. The estimated pooled means shows increased levels of VWF antigen in COVID-19 patients.

This mixed‐methods study explored these challenges among 296 divorced and separated parents: namely 204 women formerly partnered with men, 34 men formerly partnered with women, and 58 women formerly partnered with women, who were surveyed during Summer/Fall of 2020. Participants described legal, financial, and coparenting challenges. Those who were not yet divorced described difficulties filing for or finalizing their divorce because of court closures and lack of responsiveness from legal professionals. Those who were already divorced also faced legal challenges, such as being unable to obtain a court date to modify custody arrangements. Financial challenges included renegotiating financial support obligations in the context of job loss. Salient coparenting conflicts, explored through closed‐ and open‐ended questions, included communication issues, different views on virus risk mitigation behaviors, financial issues (especially for those not yet divorced), and transitioning between households and handling remote schooling (especially for those with shared physical custody). Participants elaborated on COVID‐19‐specific challenges, revealing that (a) lack of communication or agreement regarding shared strategies for risk mitigation reflected and exacerbated challenging dynamics between coparents, (b) remote schooling was often the site of disagreement when one parent felt that they were doing more than their fair share of coordination and oversight, and (c) different perspectives on science were expected to lead to future contention when making a joint decision about whether to vaccinate children.

To assess the effect of IL-13 on primary RSV infection, transgenic mice which either overexpress IL-13 in the lung (IL-13 OE) or nontransgenic littermates (IL-13 NT) were challenged intranasally with RSV. IL-13 OE mice had significantly decreased peak viral titers four days after infection compared to non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the IL-13 OE mice had significantly lower RSV-induced weight loss and reduced lung IFN-γ protein expression compared with IL-13 NT mice. In contrast, primary RSV challenge of IL-13 deficient mice resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in viral titers on day four after infection, no difference in RSV-induced weight loss compared to wild type mice, and augmented IFN-γ production on day 6 after infection. In STAT1-deficient (STAT1 KO) mice, where primary RSV challenge produced high levels of IL-13 production in the lungs, treatment with an IL-13 neutralizing protein resulted in greater peak viral titers both four and six days after RSV and greater RSV-induced weight loss compared to mice treated with a control protein. These results suggest that IL-13 modulates illness from RSV-infection.","Zhou, Weisong; Hashimoto, Koichi; Moore, Martin L.; Elias, Jack A.; Zhu, Zhou; Durbin, Joan; Colasurdo, Giuseppe; Rutigliano, John A.; Chiappetta, Constance L.; Goleniewska, Kasia; O’Neal, Jamye F.; Graham, Barney S.; Peebles, R.

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords “COVID-19,” “smell,” and/or “olfaction.” We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss—subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli—to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4–89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1–58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","Hannum, Mackenzie E.; Ramirez, Vicente A.; Lipson, Sarah J.; Herriman, Riley D.; Toskala, Aurora K.; Lin, Cailu; Joseph, Paule V.; Reed, Danielle R.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,343,1

Estrogen exposure has been associated with the increasing incidence of hypospadias in humans and a significant relationship between Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) polymorphisms and hypospadias was determined from the previous study. This study aims to determine the proportion of ESR1 polymorphism. METHODS: This was a descriptive study aimed to find the incidence of ESR1 gene polymorphism in hypospadias patients visiting the Urology Outpatient Unit of the Hasan Sadikin Bandung Hospital who will undergo hypospadias surgery. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was performed using foreskin of hypospadias patient during the surgery then being extracted and will be analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. RESULTS: Thirty eight samples of hypospadias were identified, 5 samples were unable to sequence and 33 samples were successfully sequenced using the PCR method. The Pvull ESR1 gene was dominated by the T allele which is a wild-type allele and the genotype containing the T allele, namely TT + TC (57,2%). Normal genotype (TT) were more frequent in distal hypospadias, and Heterozygous polymorphisms (TC) was higher in proximal hypospadias. The ESR1 Xba1 gene polymorphism was dominated by the A allele which is a wild-type allele and the AA + AG genotype (76,1%). Normal genotype (AA) was more frequent in distal hypospadias, and both heterozygous hypospadias (AG) and homozygous hypospadias (GG) were found only in proximal hypospadias. The ESR1 SNP 12 gene polymorphisms were found in the combination of genotypes that played a role, namely GA + AA (81%) and the G allele which is a wild-type allele. Heterozygous polymorphisms (GA) was the most finding genotype and more frequent in proximal hypospadias. CONCLUSION: ESR1 gene polymorphisms (PvuII, XbaI, and SNP 12) were found in hypospadias patients. ESR1 polymorphisms may correlate with the severity of hypospadias. Further research with a larger sample and better hypospadias grouping is needed to confirm.","Siregar, Safendra; Sibarani, Jupiter; Noegroho, Bambang Sasongko; Firmansyah, Irfan; Maskoen, Ani Melani",Res Rep Urol,343,21

This pathologic process may occur in many different sites such as the skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and fibrous tissue adjacent to joints, ligaments, walls of blood vessels, mesentery and other. The clinical spectrum of this disorder is wide: lesions may range from small foci of ossification to massive deposits of bone throughout the body, typical of the progressive genetically determined conditions such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, to mention one of the most severe and disabling forms. The ectopic bone formation may be regarded as a failed tissue repair process in response to a variety of triggers and evolving towards bone formation through a multistage differentiation program, with several steps common to different clinical presentations and distinctive features. In this review, we aim at providing a comprehensive view of the genetic and acquired heterotopic ossification disorders by detailing the clinical and molecular features underlying the different human conditions in comparison with the corresponding, currently available mouse models.","Cappato, Serena; Gamberale, Riccardo; Bocciardi, Renata; Brunelli, Silvia",Biomedicines,343,32

This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan based on several assumptions to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases considering that perhaps not all cases could be detected and reported in the complex situation there. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R(0) from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R(0) and temperature and humidity for four major cities in China to see the association between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the weather variables. RESULTS: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45 000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R(0) in Wuhan was 2.7, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.8 to 2.4. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R(0) in Wuhan. R(0) negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan. According to the correlation between R(0) and weather, the spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms.","Guo, Xiao-Jing; Zhang, Hui; Zeng, Yi-Ping",Infect Dis Poverty,343,16

Nearly no gonococcal AMR data are available from Central Asia, and no data from Kyrgyzstan has been published. We examined, for the first time, AMR and molecular epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae isolates cultured in Kyrgyzstan in 2012 and 2017, in order to inform refinements of the Kyrgyz national gonorrhoea management guidelines. METHODS: N. gonorrhoeae isolates cultured in 2012 (n = 84) and 2017 (n = 72) in Kyrgyzstan were examined. MICs of nine antimicrobials were determined using Etest and, where available, clinical breakpoints from the EUCAST were applied. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was also performed. RESULTS: The overall resistance levels were high to ciprofloxacin (88.5%), tetracycline (56.9%), benzylpenicillin (39.1%), and kanamycin (4.7%). Resistance to cefixime (0.6%, n = 1 isolate), azithromycin (0.6%, n = 1), and gentamicin (0.6%, n = 1) was rare. No resistance to ceftriaxone or spectinomycin was found. However, the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC = 0.125 mg/L) to ceftriaxone and cefixime was 12.8 and 11.5%, respectively. Gonococcal isolates were assigned 69 sequence types, of which 52 (75.4%) were new. CONCLUSIONS: The gonococcal population in Kyrgyzstan in 2012 and 2017 showed a high genetic diversity. Ceftriaxone, 500–1000 mg, in combination with azithromycin 2 g or doxycycline, particularly when chlamydial infection has not been excluded, should be recommended as empiric first-line treatment. Spectinomycin 2 g could be an alternative treatment, and given with azithromycin 2 g if pharyngeal gonorrhoea has not been excluded. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, benzylpenicillin, or tetracyclines should not be used for empiric treatment of gonorrhoea in Kyrgyzstan. Timely updating and high compliance to national gonorrhoea treatment guidelines based on quality-assured AMR data is imperative. Expanded and improved gonococcal AMR surveillance in Kyrgyzstan is crucial.","Karymbaeva, Saliya; Boiko, Iryna; Jacobsson, Susanne; Mamaeva, Galina; Ibraeva, Ainagul; Usupova, Dilara; Golparian, Daniel; Unemo, Magnus",BMC Infect Dis,343,1

This results from integrating the patient-centred focus of PC with the traditional tumour-directed focus in oncology. This integration represents a complex intervention affecting how people work. We have investigated clinicians’ adherence to requested documentation of four important patient-centred study indicators (EGOC; symptom assessment, weight and GP report) in our ongoing RCT on PC integration. Results from 435 consultations; first oncological (start last chemotherapy-line), palliative and oncological consultations during chemotherapy showed that registration percentage differed across consultations; 94.8% in the palliative (83.3–100%), 65.8% (62.5–75.0%) and 69.2% (57.0–84.3%) in the oncological consultations. Results were not satisfactory and call for strict pre-study optimization strategies to promote integration and handle organizational, professional and individual barriers towards a more patient-centred focus. ABSTRACT: Background. Despite robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating clinical and patient-reported benefits of integrated oncology and palliative care, the tumour-centred focus is predominant. This single–centre process evaluation monitors documentation of required patient-centred variables during an RCT. Methods. Performance status, patient self-reported symptoms, weight and summaries to general practitioners were assessed from June 2017 to July 2020 in three consultation types: first oncological after study inclusion and palliative and oncological consultations during chemotherapy. Descriptive statistics were used to monitor if the pre-defined program fulfilment of ≥85% documentation was reached. Results. 435 consultations were monitored in 76 patients; 60.5% males, 86.8% with GI cancers; 76 (17.5%) were from the first oncological consultations, 87 (20.0%) and 272 (62.5%) from palliative or subsequent oncological consultations. Program fulfilment differed across consultation types with 94.8% in the palliative consultations (83.3–100%), relative to 65.8% (62.5–75.0%) and 69.2% (57.0–84.3%) for first and subsequent oncological consultations over time, respectively. Use of self-reported symptoms was consistently lower in the oncological consultations. Conclusions. The documentation level of required core variables was not satisfactory, notwithstanding their high clinical relevance and continuous reminders during study. Pre-trial optimization strategies are paramount to promote integration and reduce professional and personal barriers towards a more patient-centred focus.","Hjermstad, Marianne Jensen; Hamfjord, Julian; Aass, Nina; Dajani, Olav; Lundeby, Tonje; Wester, Torunn; Kaasa, Stein",Cancers (Basel),343,5

This study aimed at assessing the characteristics of diabetic individuals and self-care practices and resilience with diabetes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional web survey study carried out among adults with diabetes, in which a structured 43-item questionnaire was conducted on the REDCap plataform, including the Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, to measure socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The web survey was disseminated through the main social media and data were collected from September 1st to October 19th, 2020. Data analysis was performed according to type of diabetes mellitus (DM) and at a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Of the 1633 participants, 67.5% were women, 43.2% aged between 35 and 59 years old, 68.0% lived in the south-eastern region of Brazil, 57.1% had a high education level, 49% reported to have DM1 and 140 participants reported to have had COVID-19. Diabetes care mostly involved the use of medications (93%), whereas the least used ones were physical activity (24.6%) and examination of the shoes (35.7%). About 40% of the participants reported to be followed up by telemedicine, 61.5% monitored the glycaemic levels, 61.2% followed a healthy diet and 43.4% left home only to go to the supermarket and drugstore. The mean resilience was 25.4 (SD = 7.7). CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, individuals with diabetes followed social distancing and maintained their medication treatment for DM. However, practice of physical activity and foot examination was little followed by the participants, who also had a low level of resilience. These findings showed the importance of patient follow-up in the healthcare services, meaning that telemedicine should be improved and support provided for adaptation in view of the therapeutic setbacks.

In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN-α production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Operative laparoscopy confirmed unilateral adnexal torsion, and detorsion without oophorectomy was accomplished. Post-operative labs revealed severe primary hypothyroidism. Ovarian size reduced with hormone replacement therapy. Summary and Conclusion This case demonstrates that prompt, interdisciplinary intervention and awareness of severe hypothyroidism as a cause of ovarian torsion related to enlarged, multi-cystic ovaries, may reduce the rate of oophorectomy, allowing preservation of pediatric patients’ future fertility, and reducing morbidity post-operatively through prompt, long-term thyroid supplementation.","Burns, Luke P.; Pennesi, Christine M.; Rosen, Monica W.; Araya, Adrian; Baruch, Adam; Arnold, Meghan A.; Quint, Elisabeth H.",J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol,343,20

Two of the biggest threats to optimal diabetes care have been lack of access to specialty diabetes care and fractured care. In this perspective, we discuss several innovative diabetes models of care which promote collaborative care models and improve access to high-quality specialty diabetes care. We discuss ongoing challenges to diabetes care innovation, and offer practical solutions to foster innovation and sustain current strides made during the pandemic.","Agarwal, Shivani; Griffith, Michelle L; Murphy, Elizabeth J; Greenlee, Carol; Boord, Jeffrey; Gabbay, Robert A",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,343,14

Of which, neutralizing antibodies play a crucial role in the prevention and resolution of viral infection. METHODS: We generated antibody libraries from 18 different COVID‐19 recovered patients and screened neutralizing antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 and its mutants. After 3 rounds of panning, 456 positive phage clones were obtained with high affinity to RBD (receptor binding domain). Clones were then reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assay and all 19 IgG were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. RESULTS: Although all antibodies were found to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 had superior inhibitory ability of the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 showed stronger binding affinity or ability to mutant RBDs (N501Y, W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F, and N354D/D364Y) derived from different SARS‐CoV‐2 strains as well, suggesting the great potential of these antibodies in preventing infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 and its mutations. Furthermore, such neutralizing antibodies strongly restricted the binding of RBD to hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized wildtype and more transmissible mutant pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero‐E6 cells, one of these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS‐CoV‐2 into cells at 12.5 nM. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the neutralizing human antibodies from the patient‐derived antibody libraries have the potential to fight SARS‐CoV‐2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.","Lou, Yan; Zhao, Wenxiang; Wei, Haitao; Chu, Min; Chao, Ruihua; Yao, Hangping; Su, Junwei; Li, Yanan; Li, Xiulan; Cao, Yu; Feng, Yanyan; Wang, Ping; Xia, Yongyang; Shang, Yushuan; Li, Fengping; Ge, Pingju; Zhang, Xinglin; Gao, Wenjing; Song, Gaojie; Du, Bing; Liang, Tingbo; Qiu, Yunqing; Liu, Mingyao",Biotechnol J,343,28

High-dose inactivated influenza quadrivalent vaccine (HD-QIV) has shown greater immunogenicity, relative efficacy, and effectiveness than the standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (SD-QIV). The aim of the study was to assess the cost-utility of an HD-QIV strategy compared with an adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (aTIV) strategy in the population above 65 years of age in Spain. METHODS We evaluated the public health and economic benefits of alternatives by using a decision-tree model, which included influenza cases, visits to the general practitioner (GP), visits to the emergency department (ED), hospitalisations, and mortality related to influenza. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for both epidemiological and economical sources of uncertainty. RESULTS Our results show that switching from aTIV strategy to HD-QIV would prevent 36,476 cases of influenza, 5,143 visits to GP, 1,054 visits to the ED, 9,193 episodes of hospitalisation due to influenza or pneumonia, and 357 deaths due to influenza - increasing 3,514 life-years and 3,167 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Healthcare costs increase by €78,874,301, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €24,353/QALY. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are rather robust. CONCLUSION Our analysis shows that HD-QIV in people over 65 years of age is an influenza-prevention strategy that is at least cost-effective, if not dominant, in Spain. It reduces cases of influenza, GP visits, hospitalisations, deaths, and associated healthcare costs.","Redondo, Esther; Drago, Georgina; López-Belmonte, Juan Luis; Guillén, Jose María; Bricout, Helene; Alvarez, Fabián P; Callejo, Daniel; Gil de Miguel, Ángel",Vaccine,343,24

Current approaches to COVID-19 therapeutics focus on antiviral agents, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators and more traditional therapies such as steroids. Reversing disturbances in coagulation has also been identified as a priority area for candidate therapies, such as through the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines 4 adaptive clinical trial (ACTIV-4) which is currently evaluating aspirin, heparins and apixaban. Since there is a clear relationship between mechanisms of coagulation and the immune response, it is possible that reversing disturbances in coagulation may diminish the dysregulated immune response observed in COVID-19. The basis for this hypothesis is described below and is followed by discussion of a proposed candidate therapy - activated protein C. By treating COVID-19 patients using a novel approach, which does not focus on immune-based or antiviral treatments, but instead which addresses both the anti-thrombotic and inflammatory consequences of infection, the hope is that new therapeutic targets can be considered and new candidate therapies, such as activated protein C, may be evaluated.","Pestka, Steven B.",Med Hypotheses,343,11

METHODS: A narrative review of the literature supplemented with expert opinion. RESULTS: There is clear evidence that the endothelium is at the centre stage in SSc and COVID-19, with endothelial cell activation/injury and dysfunction creating the crucial evolving step in the pathogenesis of both diseases. The angiotensin system has also been implicated in the early stages of both COVID-19 and SSc. Autoptic studies provide novel insights into the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the endothelium. Normal endothelium and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 and SSc are discussed. It is debated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers autoimmunity with production of autoantibodies which is of mechanistic interest because other viral illnesses are potentially involved in endothelial dysfunction and in SSc pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is due to a direct assault of SARS-CoV-2 on the vascular system as an acute infection, whereas SSc remains a chronic/sub-acute autoimmune disease of largely unknown etiology Further study and exploration of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms might provide further useful milestones in the understanding of the early SSc pathogenesis.","Matucci-Cerinic, Marco; Hughes, Michael; Taliani, Gloria; Kahaleh, Bashar",Autoimmun Rev,343,27

This is due to the fact that autopsy allows efficient evaluation of comorbidities for risk assessment, as well as identification of key pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms in organs driving the severity of disease which might be important targets for therapeutic interventions. In the case of patients who have died of infection with unknown pathogens, isolation and culture of pathogens from the affected organs is another important opportunity for a proper response to (re)emerging infectious diseases. However, the situation of COVID-19 demonstrated that there were concerns about performing autopsies because of biosafety risks. In this review we compare requirements for biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories from the European Commission and the World Health Organization and summarize specific recommendations for postmortem analysis of COVID-19-deceased patients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, we describe in detail a BSL-3 facility with enhanced protection of personnel and an environment that has been designed for performing autopsies, biobanking of collected tissue specimens, and culture of pathogens in cases of high-risk pathogen infections and report on the experience obtained in operating this facility in the context of COVID-19.","Loibner, Martina; Langner, Christine; Regitnig, Peter; Gorkiewicz, Gregor; Zatloukal, Kurt",Pathobiology,343,16

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[≤]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","Mowla, A.; Shakibajahromi, B.; Shahjouei, S.; Borhani-Haghighi, A.; Rahimian, N.; Baharvahdat, H.; Naderi, S.; Khorvash, F.; Altafi, D.; Ebrahimzadeh, S.

Following government-implemented regulations, there has been concern over the apparent decline in emergency department (ED) attendances and the resultant health legacy. Therefore, we aimed to characterise the attendances to an Irish tertiary hospital ED following the implementation of these regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study investigated all attendances to the Cork University Hospital ED from 15 February to 11 April in 2020 and 2017–2019. Attendances were stratified into four periods: Before COVID (BC) (15 February to 5 March), After COVID (AC) (6 March to 12 March), Educational Closure (EC) (13 March to 27 March) and Stay Home (SH) (28 March to 11 April), as per government regulations. Triage presentations of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache and trauma were examined. Data were analysed by independent t-tests and χ(2) analysis. RESULTS: There were 8261 attendances to the ED in the 2020 time period compared with a mean of 10 389 attendances during the corresponding periods in 2017–2019. There was a significant decrease in daily attendances in 2020 compared with 2017–2019 in the AC (142 vs 188, p=0.02), EC (122 vs 184, p<0.001) and SH (121 vs 181, p<0.001) periods, including significant decreases in abdominal pain (AC: 9 vs 22, EC: 10 vs 19, SH: 11 vs 18, p<0.001), chest pain (AC: 9 vs 15, EC: 8 vs 15, SH: 9 vs 15, p<0.01), headache (AC: 5 vs 11, EC: 4 vs 9, SH: 4 vs 9, p<0.01) and trauma (AC: 3 vs 5, EC: 2 vs 6, SH: 3 vs 5, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of government-imposed restrictions and perceived risk of attending an ED during a pandemic may contribute to reduced attendances. Public confidence in EDs is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by failure to seek medical attention during a pandemic; adequate infrastructure to allow social distancing and isolation capacity in EDs is a necessity.","Sless, Ryan Taylor; Hayward, Nathaniel Edward; Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Deasy, Conor; Dasari, Kantikiran",Emerg Med J,343,10

Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients’ past medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHO’s architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients’ pre-COVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.","Estiri, Hossein; Strasser, Zachary H.; Murphy, Shawn N.",Sci Rep,343,11

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center U.K. ICU. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation that received a transthoracic echocardiogram between March and December 2020. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Right ventricular dilation was defined as right ventricular:left ventricular end-diastolic area greater than 0.6, right ventricular systolic impairment as fractional area change less than 35%, or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion less than 17 mm. One hundred seventy-two patients were included, 59 years old (interquartile range, 49–67), with mostly moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 101; 59%). Ninety-day mortality was 41% (n = 70): 49% in patients with right ventricular dilation, 53% in right ventricular systolic impairment, and 72% in right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment. The right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment phenotype was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.15–7.60]), but either disease state alone was not. Right ventricular fractional area change correlated with Pao(2):Fio(2) ratio, Paco(2), chest radiograph opacification, and dynamic compliance, whereas right ventricular:left ventricle end-diastolic area correlated negatively with urine output. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular systolic impairment correlated with pulmonary pathophysiology, whereas right ventricular dilation correlated with renal dysfunction. Right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment was the only right ventricular phenotype that was independently associated with mortality.","Chotalia, Minesh; Ali, Muzzammil; Alderman, Joseph E.; Kalla, Manish; Parekh, Dhruv; Bangash, Mansoor N.; Patel, Jaimin M.",Crit Care Med,343,15

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the new diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. Methods: In this cohort study, we included all patient with new diagnosis of breast cancer who were admitted to our Hospital (Hospital Pedro Hispano, Matosinhos, Portugal), between March 2019 and March 2021. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions such as age, stage at diagnosis and treatment. We created two different groups were created: 1st group- before COVID-19 pandemia (March 1, 2019 to March 16, 2020);2nd group - COVID-19 pandemia (March 17, 2020 to March 31, 2021). A comparative assessment between groups was carried out. Results: Were included 483 patients;n=289 in the 1st group and n= 194 in the 2nd group. The median age was 60 years old in the 1st group and 59 years old in the 2nd group. In the 1st group, 13% patients were diagnosis with ductal in situ carcinoma (DCIS), 51% in stage I, 24% in stage II, 9.5% in stage III and 3% in stage IV. In 2nd group, 9% had DCIS, 30% were in stage I, 40% in stage II, 11% in stage III and 10% in stage IV. Stage at diagnosis was significantly higher in the 2nd group (p< 0.001) This situation was mainly due to tumour size (T). In the 1st group, most patients (n=91;38%) had tumour size between 10 e 20mm (T1c in TNM classification). One the other hand, 40% (n=78) of patients included in the 2nd group had tumour size between 20 e 50mm (T2), with significant differences between them (p=0.004). No difference was found between groups in nodular involvement (p=0.189), with the majority of patients (∼50% in both groups) presenting without nodular involvement (N0 in TMN classification). 10% of patients in 2nd group and 3% in 1st group had metastatic disease at diagnosis, with differences between them (p=0.006). 49% (n=119) of patients in 1st group and 52% (n=100) in the 2nd group were treated with chemotherapy, without differences between those groups.

We used a survey to investigate this association and performed interviews to get a better understanding of patient experiences, and therefore the nature of this association. METHODS: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD, n = 176) and ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 162) completed the short Crohn’s Disease Activity (sCDAI) or Patient Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (P-SCCAI) and the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH). Associations were investigated by multiple linear regression. Semi-structured interviews (7 CD, 7 UC) were conducted to assess patient experiences with the role of physical activity in their disease. RESULTS: The majority of survey participants were in remission (70%) and adhered to the Dutch physical activity guidelines (61%). In Crohn’s disease, the total physical activity score was inversely associated with disease activity, even after adjustment for confounders (β = − 0.375; p = 0.013). No association between physical activity and disease activity was found in ulcerative colitis. Of the interviewees, 86% experienced beneficial effects of physical activity, such as improved general fitness, quality of life and self-image.

CONCLUSIONS: Crohn’s disease participants with a higher physical activity level had a lower disease activity. This inverse association was not found in ulcerative colitis. Interviews revealed that IBD patients generally experience beneficial effects from physical activity, although the barriers caused by active disease may put them off to be physically active.

There is an urgent need to learn how this population is managing during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a qualitative study of 24 adults aged 55 and older living alone with cognitive impairment from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Participants’ lived experiences during the pandemic were elicited via 59 ethnographic interviews conducted over the phone either in English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of transcripts revealed 5 themes: (a) fear generated by the pandemic, (b) distress stemming from feeling extremely isolated, (c) belief in misinformation, (d) strategies for coping during the pandemic, and (e) the importance of access to essential services. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This pandemic put a spotlight on the precarity and unmet needs of older adults living alone with cognitive impairment. Findings underscore the need to expand access to home care aides and mental health services for this population.","Portacolone, Elena; Chodos, Anna; Halpern, Jodi; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Keiser, Sahru; Fung, Jennifer; Rivera, Elizabeth; Tran, Thi; Bykhovsky, Camilla; Johnson, Julene K",Gerontologist,343,16

These patients need to undertake medical care, but whether they should be included in intensive oral care is still not mandatory. The study aimed to assess a relationship between renal, metabolic, and oral health indicators among pediatric patients affected by simple obesity. (2) Methods: 45 children and adolescents with simple obesity hospitalized (BMI 34.1 ± 4.8 kg/m(2), age 15.4 ± 2.3) and compared with 41 aged-matched healthy controls (BMI 16.4 ± 2.4 kg/m(2), age 15.4 ± 2.7). Echocardiography, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ultrasound exam with Doppler, and laboratory tests including kidney and metabolic markers were performed. Oral status was examined regarding the occurrence of carious lesions using decay missing filling teeth (DMFT), gingivitis as bleeding on probing (BOP), and bacterial colonization as plaque control record (PCR). (3) Results: The strongest correlation was revealed between BMI and concentration of uric acid, cystatin C, GFR estimated by the Filler formula (r = 0.74; r = 0.48; r = −0.52), and between oral variables such as PCR and BOP (r = 0.54; r = 0.58). Children and adolescents with obesity demonstrated untreated dental caries, less efficient in plaque control and gingivitis. (4) Conclusions: No specific relation to markers of kidney disease were found; however, more frequent gingivitis/bacterial colonization and significant differences in oral status between obese and non-obese patients were revealed. Susceptibility to inflammation may be conducive to developing metabolic syndrome and kidney damage in the form of obesity-related glomerulopathy and contribute to future dental caries. Uric acid seems to indicate metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications (LVMI > 95 percentiles). Cystatin C and uric acid might aspire to be early markers of kidney damage leading to obesity-related glomerulopathy.","Maćkowiak-Lewandowicz, Katarzyna; Ostalska-Nowicka, Danuta; Zachwieja, Jacek; Paszyńska, Elżbieta",J Clin Med,343,16

Development of a vaccine requires knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response and also features that might be pathogenic. Protective and pathogenic aspects of the response to SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood, partly because the virus has infected humans for only 6 months. However, insight into coronavirus immunity can be informed by previous studies of immune responses to non-human coronaviruses, to common cold coronaviruses, and to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

The coronavirus-associated death tolls have been increasing rapidly in a country. The provincial status of confirmed cases of coronavirus is higher in Punjab, followed by the Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Balochistan. The case fatality ratio shows that KPK has a higher ratio, i.e., 5.11%, followed by the Punjab, i.e., 1.82%; Sindh, i.e., 1.80%; Balochistan, i.e., 1.28%; Gilgit-Baltistan, i.e., 0.71%; and Federal territory, i.e., 0.66%. The country has a less testing capacity to identify more suspected coronavirus patients. The study calculated that if we increase five times our testing capacity from the current date, the total registered cases will be reached to 137,370 and death tolls will increase up to 3090. It is highly needed to increase testing capacity across Pakistan in order to minimize the outbreak of coronavirus.

We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.","Chen, Xiaoping; Ling, Jiaxin; Mo, Pingzheng; Zhang, Yongxi; Jiang, Qunqun; Ma, Zhiyong; Cao, Qian; Hu, Wenjia; Zou, Shi; Chen, Liangjun; Yao, Lei; Luo, Mingqi; Chen, Tielong; Deng, Liping; Liang, Ke; Song, Shihui; Yang, Rongrong; Zheng, Ruiying; Gao, Shicheng; Gui, Xien; Ke, Hengning; Hou, Wei; Lundkvist, Åke; Xiong, Yong",,343,24

We assessed one- and two-dose regimens of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate in adult and aged non-human primates (NHP). A two-dose Ad26.COV2.S regimen induced higher peak binding and neutralizing antibody responses compared to a single dose. In one-dose regimens neutralizing antibody responses were stable for at least 14 weeks, providing an early indication of durability. Ad26.COV2.S induced humoral immunity and Th1 skewed cellular responses in aged NHP that were comparable to adult animals.

To date, only 6.7% of the population have received at least one dose of the vaccine, raising serious concerns over the speed of vaccine roll-out and its impact in the event of a future surge. Objective: Using mathematical modeling, we assessed the short-term impact (by end of 2021) of various vaccine roll-out scenarios on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic course in Lebanon. Results: At current immunity levels in the population, estimated by the model at 40% on 15 April 2021, a large epidemic wave is predicted if all social distancing restrictions are gradually eased and variants of concern are introduced. Reaching 80% vaccine coverage by end of 2021 will flatten the epidemic curve and will result in a 37% and 34% decrease in the peak daily numbers of severe/critical disease cases and deaths, respectively; while reaching intermediate coverage of 40% will result in only 10-11% decrease in each. Reaching 80% coverage by end of 2021 will avert 3 times more hospitalizations and deaths over the course of this year compared with 40% coverage. Impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up. Reaching 80% vaccine coverage by August would prevent twice as many severe/critical disease cases and deaths than if it were reached by December. Finally, a longer duration over which restrictions are eased resulted in a more favorable impact of vaccination. Conclusion: For vaccination to have an impact on the predicted epidemic course and associated disease burden in Lebanon, vaccination has to be rapid and reach high coverage (at least 70%), while sustaining social distancing measures during roll-out. At current vaccination pace, this is unlikely to be achieved. Concerted efforts need to be put to overcome local challenges and substantially scale up vaccination to avoid a surge that the country, with its multiple crises and limited health-care capacity, is largely unprepared for.","Mumtaz, G.

DESIGN: A prospective, observational study. SETTING: A tertiary university medical center in southern Israel. PATIENTS: Twenty-three hospitalizations for PNAE and 217 hospitalizations for NPAE were included in the study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the hospitalizations and were tested serologically for 12 pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers or levels was considered diagnostic. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups for any of the parameters related to COPD or comorbidity. The clinical type of the exacerbation was not significantly different between the groups. Compared to NPAE, patients with PNAE had lower Po(2) values at hospital admission (p = 0.004) but higher rates of abrupt onset (p = 0.005), ICU admissions (p = 0.006), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01), mortality (p = 0.007), and longer hospital stay (p = 0.001). In 22 PNAE hospitalizations (96%) and in 153 NPAE hospitalizations (71%), at least one infectious etiology was identified (p = 0.001). Mixed infection was found in 13 patients with PNAE (59%) and in 59 patients with NPAE (39%; not significant [NS]). Viral etiology was identified in 18 patients with PNAE (78%) compared with 99 patients with NPAE (46%; p = 0.003). Pneumococcal etiology was found in 10 patients with PNAE (43%) and in 38 patients with NPAE (18%; p = 0.006). An atypical etiology was identified in 8 patients with PNAE (35%) and 64 patients with NPAE (30%; NS). CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired pneumonia is common among patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD and is generally manifested by more severe clinical and laboratory parameters. In PNAE, compared to NPAE, viral and pneumococcal etiologies are more common, but the rate of atypical pathogens is similar. The therapeutic significance of these findings should be investigated further.","Lieberman, David; Lieberman, Devora; Gelfer, Yevgenia; Varshavsky, Raiesa; Dvoskin, Bella; Leinonen, Maija; Friedman, Maureen G.",Chest,343,16

The distribution of phage reported to infect diverse and ubiquitous heterotrophic bacteria (SAR11 clades) and cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp.) displayed population-level shifts in diversity. Samples from higher-salinity conditions (>14 practical salinity units [PSU]) had increased abundances of viruses for picoeukaryotes, i.e., Ostreococcus. These data, combined with host diversity estimates, suggest viral modulation of diversity on the whole-community scale, as well as in specific prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages. RNA libraries revealed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA viral populations throughout the Baltic Sea, with ssDNA phage highly represented in Lake Torneträsk. Further, our data suggest relatively high transcriptional activity of fish viruses within diverse families known to have broad host ranges, such as Nodoviridae (RNA), Iridoviridae (DNA), and predicted zoonotic viruses that can cause ecological and economic damage as well as impact human health. IMPORTANCE Inferred virus-host relationships, community structures of ubiquitous ecologically relevant groups, and identification of transcriptionally active populations have been achieved with our Baltic Sea study. Further, these data, highlighting the transcriptional activity of viruses, represent one of the more powerful uses of omics concerning ecosystem health. The use of omics-related data to assess ecosystem health holds great promise for rapid and relatively inexpensive determination of perturbations and risk, explicitly with regard to viral assemblages, as no single marker gene is suitable for widespread taxonomic coverage.","Zeigler Allen, Lisa; McCrow, John P.; Ininbergs, Karolina; Dupont, Christopher L.; Badger, Jonathan H.; Hoffman, Jeffery M.; Ekman, Martin; Allen, Andrew E.; Bergman, Birgitta; Venter, J.

Although the government has imposed several restricted measures to curb the progression of the outbreak, these arrays of measures are not sustainable in the long run. In this study, we assess the impact of lift of flexible lockdown on the COVID-19 dynamics in Bangladesh. Our analysis demonstrates that the country might experience second infection peak in 6-7 months after the withdrawal of current lockdown. Moreover, a prolonged restriction until January, 2021 will shift the infection peak towards August, 2021 and will reduce approximately 20 % COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh.","Siam, Z.

In combating infectious diseases, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are required for pathogen identification at the point of care (POC). In this review, investigations of diagnostic strategies for infectious diseases that are based on aptamers, especially nucleic acid aptamers, oligonucleotides that have high affinities and specificities toward their targets, are described. Owing to their unique features including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high chemical stability, reproducibility, and low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers have been widely utilized as bio-recognition elements (bio-receptors) for the development of infection diagnostic systems. We discuss nucleic acid aptamer-based methods that have been developed for diagnosis of infections using a format that organizes discussion according to the target pathogenic analytes including toxins or proteins, whole cells and nucleic acids. Also included is, a summary of recent advances made in the sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria utilizing the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. Lastly, a nucleic acid aptamer-based POC system is described and future directions of studies in this area are discussed.","Park, Ki Soo",Biosens Bioelectron,343,20

This economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions aimed to assess direct and fixed hospital costs and describe their particularities in different clinical and demographic conditions and outcomes in the largest public hospital in Latin America, located in São Paulo, Brazil, where a whole institute was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients in response to the pandemic. METHODS: This is a partial economic evaluation performed from the hospital´s perspective and is a prospective, observational cohort study to assess hospitalization costs of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, to Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) and followed until discharge, death, or external transfer. Micro- and macro-costing methodologies were used to describe and analyze the total cost associated with each patient's underlying medical conditions, itinerary and outcomes as well as the cost components of different hospital sectors. RESULTS: The average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit stays) was US$12,637.42. The overhead cost was its main component. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic (US$15,257.95) diseases were associated with higher costs. Age strata >69 years, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, use of mechanical ventilation or dialysis, surgery and outcomes remained associated with higher costs. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of COVID-19 hospital costs can aid in the development of a comprehensive approach for decision-making and planning for future risk management.","Miethke-Morais, Anna; Cassenote, Alex; Piva, Heloísa; Tokunaga, Eric; Cobello, Vilson; Gonçalves, Fábio; dos Santos Lobo, Renata; Trindade, Evelinda; Carneiro D'Albuquerque, Luiz; de Paiva Haddad, Luciana",Braz J Infect Dis,343,30

The aims of this study were to describe the diet and its nutritional quality in Spanish households during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave and to compare them with the same period in 2019. Data on monthly foods and beverages household purchases in 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the nationwide Food Consumption Surveys. In April, there was an average increase, compared with 2019, of more than 40% for all food groups, with significant peaks in: alcoholic beverages (75%), appetizers (60%), eggs (59%), sugar and sweets (52%), and vegetables (50%). In March, the greatest peak was for pulses, with a 63% increment. The mean energy value of purchased foods in April was 2801 kcal/person/day, corresponding to an increase of 771 kcal/person/day (+38%), compared to the same month of 2019 (March and May: +520 kcal (+26%), June: +343 kcal (+18%)). Regarding nutrient density, there was a reduction in calcium, iodine, zinc, selenium, riboflavin, vitamins B(12), D, A, especially retinol, and an increase in fibre, sodium, folic acid, carotenes and vitamin E. Alcohol content per 1000 kcal increased by more than 20% from April to July. Food purchase patterns in Spanish households changed during lockdown and after it, with no appreciable improvement in the quality of the diet.","del Pozo de la Calle, Susana; Alonso Ledesma, Isabel; Nuñez, Olivier; Castelló Pastor, Adela; Lope Carvajal, Virginia; Fernández de Larrea Baz, Nerea; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Pollán, Marina; Ruiz Moreno, Emma",Nutrients,343,15

For instance, one of the major suborders, Yinpterochiroptera, has an exclusively Old World distribution, and within the other, Yangochiroptera, no species and only five genera are common to both. However, as bats are sometimes blown out to sea, and have colonised isolated islands, occasional natural movement between the New and Old Worlds does appear to be possible. Here we identify new genotypes of a blood parasite, Trypanosoma dionisii, in Old World bats that are closely related to South American strains. Using highly conservative calibration points, divergence of Old and New World strains is estimated to have occurred 3.2–5.0 million years ago (MYA), depending on the method used (upper 95% CL for maximum time 11.4 MYA). The true date of divergence is likely to be considerably more recent. These results demonstrate that taxon-specific parasites can indicate historical movements of their hosts, even where their hosts may have left no lasting phylogenetic footprint.","Hamilton, Patrick B.; Cruickshank, Catriona; Stevens, Jamie R.; Teixeira, Marta M.G.; Mathews, Fiona",Mol Phylogenet Evol,343,1
