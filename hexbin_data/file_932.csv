170977,The nuts and bolts of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain heterologous expression,2021-09-17,"A generalization of the Susceptible-Infectious model is made to include a time-dependent transmission rate, which leads to a close analytical expression in terms of a logistic function. The solution can be applied to any continuous function chosen to describe the evolution of the transmission rate with time. Taking inspiration from real data of the Covid-19, for the case of cumulative confirmed positives and deaths, we propose an exponentially decaying transmission rate with two free parameters, one for its initial amplitude and another one for its decaying rate. The resultant time-dependent SI model, which under extra conditions recovers the standard Gompertz functional form, is then compared with data from selected countries and its parameters fit using Bayesian inference. We make predictions about the asymptotic number of confirmed positives and deaths and discuss the possible evolution of the disease in each country in terms of our parametrization of the transmission rate.","Urena-Lopez, L.

202800,A computational study on active constituents of Habb-ul-aas and Tabasheer as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease,2021,"Background It has been acknowledged and recognised internationally that the community pharmacy team has a major role to play in antimicrobial stewardship programmes, particularly regarding patient engagement. However, there is a paucity of published research on community pharmacy-based activities in antimicrobial stewardship, and views and perceptions of the community pharmacy team on their role in antimicrobial stewardship. Objective To explore views and experiences of community pharmacy teams across Scotland on antimicrobial stewardship, activities related to European Antibiotic Awareness Day, and a self-help guide to treating infection. Setting Community pharmacy, Scotland. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of community pharmacy team members over a six week period between November and December in 2016. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and data analysed thematically using the framework approach. Main outcome measure Views and perceptions of antimicrobial stewardship and European Antibiotic Awareness Day activities and role of the pharmacy team. Results Twenty-seven participants were interviewed-20 pharmacists, five pharmacy graduates completing their pre-registration year, and members of the pharmacy support team including two pharmacy technicians and one medicines counter assistant. They were working mainly in urban areas and across five regions of Scotland. Most were aware of antimicrobial stewardship but some were not familiar with the term. Participants identified roles for the community pharmacy team in antimicrobial stewardship including the importance of the pharmacy as a first port of call for self-care advice. Some participants, including pharmacists, showed lack of awareness of European Antibiotic Awareness Day; those who were aware thought it may not have the desired impact on educating the public. Most participants, irrespective of role within the team, were not familiar with the self-help guide but they perceived this as a useful resource for the pharmacy team. Conclusion The participants recognised and identified roles for the community pharmacist within antimicrobial stewardship. However, the lack of awareness of European Antibiotic Awareness Day shows a need for European Antibiotic Awareness Day tools and other materials to be more effectively disseminated and for more training to be provided.","Tonna, Antonella Pia; Weidmann, Anita Elaine; Sneddon, Jacqueline; Stewart, Derek",Int. j. clin. pharm,,932

241006,Seroprevalence and asymptomatic carrier status of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan City and other places of China,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of COVID-19, a sometimes-lethal respiratory infection responsible for a world-wide pandemic. The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA &#8776; EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5' position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein.","Park, Sang Ho; Siddiqi, Haley; Castro, Daniela V; De Angelis, Anna A; Oom, Aaron L; Stoneham, Charlotte A; Lewinski, Mary K; Clark, Alex E; Croker, Ben A; Carlin, Aaron F; Guatelli, John; Opella, Stanley J",PLoS Pathog,,932

264630,"Similarities and differences in the conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8, an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its L84S variant",2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are antimalarial drugs recently reported to be active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the global COVID-19 pandemic. In an emergency response to the pandemic, we aimed to develop a quantitation method for HCQ, its metabolites desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ) and bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ), and AZM in human plasma. METHODS: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to develop the method. Samples (20 µL) are extracted by solid-phase extraction and injected onto the LC-MS/MS system equipped with a PFP column (2.0 × 50 mm, 3 µm). ESI+ and MRM are used for detection. Ion pairs m/z 336.1â247.1 for HCQ, 308.1â179.1 for DHCQ, 264.1â179.1 for BDCQ, and 749.6â591.6 for AZM are selected for quantification. The ion pairs m/z 342.1â253.1, 314.1â181.1, 270.1â181.1, and 754.6â596.6 are selected for the corresponding deuterated internal standards (IS) HCQ-d4, DHCQ-d4, BDCQ-d4, and AZM-d5. The less abundant IS ions from 37Cl were used to overcome the interference from the analytes. RESULTS: Under optimized conditions, retention times are 0.78 min for BDCQ, 0.79 min for DHCQ, 0.92 min for HCQ and 1.87 min for AZM. Total run time is 3.5 min per sample. The calibration ranges are 2-1000 ng/mL for HCQ and AZM, 1-500 ng/mL for DHCQ and 0.5-250 ng/mL for BDCQ; samples above the range are validated for up to 10-fold dilution. Recoveries of the method ranged from 88.9-94.4% for HCQ, 88.6-92.9% for DHCQ, 88.7-90.9% for BDCQ, and 98.6%-102% for AZM. The IS normalized matrix effect were within (100±10) % for all 4 analytes. Blood samples are stable for at least 6 hr at room temperature. Plasma samples are stable for at least 66 hr at room temperature, 38 days at -70°C, and 4 freeze-thaw cycles. CONCLUSIONS: An LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantitation of HCQ, DHCQ, BDCQ, and AZM in human plasma was developed and validated for clinical studies requiring fast turnaround time and small samples volume.","Sok, Vong; Marzan, Florence; Gingrich, David; Aweeka, Francesca; Huang, Liusheng",PLoS One,,932
274309,Targeting allosteric pockets of SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro,2021,"The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has warranted the urgent need for technologies and tools to be deployed for confirming diagnosis of suspected cases. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical for understanding epidemiology, contract-tracing, case management, and to repress the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-based RT-PCR technique is a gold standard test used for routine diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. While there are many commercially available RT-PCR assay kits available in the market, selection of highly sensitive, specific, and validated assays is most crucial for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important in the disease and outbreak management. Development of rapid point of care tests with better sensitivity and specificity is the critical need of the hour as this will help accurate diagnosis and aid in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early detection of viral infection greatly enhances implementation of specific public health intervention, such as infection control, environmental decontamination, and the closure of specific high-risk zones. Large-scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from affected populations across the world needs to be carried to monitor mutations that might affect performance of molecular tests. Creation of genome repositories and open-source genetic databases for use by global researchers is clearly the way forward to manage COVID-19 outbreak and accelerate vaccine development. This review summarizes various molecular diagnostics methods, technical guidelines, and advanced testing strategies adopted in India for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.","Kumar, K S Rajesh; Mufti, Suhail Sayeed; Sarathy, Vinu; Hazarika, Diganta; Naik, Radheshyam",Front Public Health,,932

327772,A high-throughput microfluidic nanoimmunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultralow-volume blood samples,2021,"BACKGROUND: Amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has emerged as an alternative for inpatient point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) monitoring. We performed a feasibility pilot study using CGM in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Single-center, retrospective study of glucose monitoring in critically ill patients with COVID-19 on insulin therapy using Medtronic Guardian Connect and Dexcom G6 CGM systems. Primary outcomes were feasibility and accuracy for trending POC-BG. Secondary outcomes included reliability and nurse acceptance. Sensor glucose (SG) was used for trends between POC-BG with nursing guidance to reduce POC-BG frequency from one to two hours to four hours when the SG was in the target range. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD), Clarke error grids analysis (EGA), and Bland-Altman (B&A) plots were calculated for accuracy of paired SG and POC-BG measurements. RESULTS: CGM devices were placed on 11 patients: Medtronic (n = 6) and Dexcom G6 (n = 5). Both systems were feasible and reliable with good nurse acceptance. To determine accuracy, 437 paired SG and POC-BG readings were analyzed. For Medtronic, the MARD was 13.1% with 100% of readings in zones A and B on Clarke EGA. For Dexcom, MARD was 11.1% with 98% of readings in zones A and B. B&A plots had a mean bias of -17.76 mg/dL (Medtronic) and -1.94 mg/dL (Dexcom), with wide 95% limits of agreement. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGM is feasible in critically ill patients and has acceptable accuracy to identify trends and guide intermittent blood glucose monitoring with insulin therapy.","Sadhu, Archana R; Serrano, Ivan Alexander; Xu, Jiaqiong; Nisar, Tariq; Lucier, Jessica; Pandya, Anjani R; Patham, Bhargavi",J Diabetes Sci Technol,,932

Rates of PA in patients with IHD continue to be low in both hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation and home settings. While researchers have investigated strategies to increase PA among patients with IHD, interventions to promote PA specifically in IHD patients who report hopelessness are lacking. We describe the protocol for a NIH-funded randomized controlled trial designed to establish the effectiveness of a 6-week intervention (Heart Up!) to promote increased PA in IHD patients who report hopelessness. Participants (n = 225) are randomized to one of three groups: (1) motivational social support (MSS) from a nurse, (2) MSS from a nurse plus significant other support (SOS), or (3) attention control. Aims are to: (1) test the effectiveness of 6 weeks of MSS and MSS with SOS on increasing mean minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA; (2) determine the effects of change in moderate to vigorous PA on hopelessness; and (3) determine if perceived social support and motivation (exercise self-regulation) mediate the effects of the intervention on PA. A total of 69 participants have been enrolled to date. The protocol has been consistently and accurately used by research personnel. We address the protocol challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and steps taken to maintain fidelity to the intervention. Findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who report hopelessness by promoting self-management of important PA goals that can contribute to better health outcomes.","Dunn, Susan L; Robbins, Lorraine B; Tintle, Nathan L; Collins, Eileen G; Bronas, Ulf G; Goodyke, Madison P; Luong, Anna; Gutierrez-Kapheim, Melissa; DeVon, Holli A",Res. nurs. health,,932

Mathematical epidemic models can be used to predict the course of an epidemic and develop methods for controlling it. As social contact is a key factor in disease spreading, modeling epidemics on contact networks has been increasingly used. In this work, we propose a simulation model for the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Saudi Arabia using a network-based epidemic model. We generated a contact network that captures realistic social behaviors and dynamics of individuals in Saudi Arabia. The proposed model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures employed by the Saudi government, to predict the future dynamics of the disease in Saudi Arabia according to different scenarios, and to investigate multiple vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that Saudi Arabia would have faced a nationwide peak of the outbreak on 21 April 2020 with a total of approximately 26 million infections had it not imposed strict control measures. The results also indicate that social distancing plays a crucial role in determining the future local dynamics of the epidemic. Our results also show that the closure of schools and mosques had the maximum impact on delaying the epidemic peak and slowing down the infection rate. If a vaccine does not become available and no social distancing is practiced from 10 June 2020, our predictions suggest that the epidemic will end in Saudi Arabia at the beginning of November with over 13 million infected individuals, and it may take only 15 days to end the epidemic after 70% of the population receive a vaccine.","Alrasheed, Hend; Althnian, Alhanoof; Kurdi, Heba; Al-Mgren, Heila; Alharbi, Sulaiman",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,932

In multi-agency operations, such as extreme weather events, the involved first responders manage the event with different mandates, objectives, and tools which can make it challenging to build a COP. Effective collaboration requires a common situational understanding, based on knowledge about each other’s responsibilities and tasks, mutual respect and trust, as well as common communication tools for emergency communication and information sharing. This paper argues that the COP serves as a basis for deciding on further action, and thus represents a first stage in the process of establishing common situational understanding among the involved actors. The empirical basis for the study includes interviews with Norwegian emergency management stakeholders, analysis of audio-logs, and review of public documents. Based on the analysis we present a framework comprising activities and processes involved in establishing a COP as a basis for common situational understanding.","Steen-Tveit, Kristine Erik Munkvold Bjørn",Safety Science,,932

Fifty paraffin-embedded blocks from 48 anonymized patients, biopsied or operated on for diseases of the oral and maxillofacial region before 2010, were analyzed. ACE2-expressing cells were observed in the parotid, sublingual and the buccal glands, the conduits, the acinar regions of the serous glands, and sparsely in the mucous glands. Scattered ACE2-positive endothelial cells were also observed in nearby capillaries nourishing the salivary glands, as well as in the juxta-epithelial capillaries of the oral mucosa. ACE-2-positive adipocytes were scattered within the stroma of the parotid gland. These observations suggest the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may travel through the bloodstream to the capillaries that nourish the salivary glands and oral mucosa, and inducing vasculitis and damage of oral tissues. SARS-CoV-2 infection of salivary glands through the bloodstream implies the main cause of salivary contamination. Similarly, ascending infection from oral fluid to the salivary gland conduit has been shown to be another possible mute. Moreover, infection of ACE2-positive parotid adipocytes may lead to parotid glands inflammation and contribute to systemic progression of coronavirus disease 2019.","Yoshimura, K.; Toya, S.; Okada, Y.",Journal of Hard Tissue Biology,,932

China, as the early epicenter of the pandemic, locked down one-third of its cities in an attempt to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. Human migration patterns have subsequently been radically altered and many regions have seen perceived improvements in air quality during the lockdowns. This study empirically examines the relationship between human migration and air pollution and further evaluates the causal impacts of the lockdowns. A spatial econometric method and a spatial explicit counterfactual framework are employed in this study. The key findings are as follows: i) a considerable amount of variation in AQI, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentration can be explained by human migration but we fail to find suggestive evidence in the cases of SO2 and CO; ii) the implementation of lockdown measures led to a significant reduction in AQI (18.1%), PM2.5 (22.2%), NO2 (20.5%), and PM10 (10.7%), but has no meaningful impacts on SO2, CO and O3 levels; iii) further analysis indicates that the impacts of lockdown policies varied by control stringency and by regional heterogeneity.

605896,RNA sequence and ligand binding alter conformational profile of SARS-CoV-2 stem loop II motif,2021-01-14,"The vascular function of a vessel can be qualitatively and intraoperatively checked by recording the blood dynamics inside the vessel via fluorescence angiography (FA). Although FA is the state of the art in proving the existence of blood flow during interventions such as bypass surgery, it still lacks a quantitative blood flow measurement that could decrease the recurrence rate and postsurgical mortality. Previous approaches show that the measured flow has a significant deviation compared to the gold standard reference (ultrasonic flow meter). In order to systematically address the possible sources of error, we investigated the error in transit time measurement of an indicator. Obtaining in vivo indicator dilution curves with a known ground truth is complex and often not possible. Further, the error in transit time measurement should be quantified and reduced. To tackle both issues, we first computed many diverse indicator dilution curves using an in silico simulation of the indicator's flow. Second, we post-processed these curves to mimic measured signals. Finally, we fitted mathematical models (parabola, gamma variate, local density random walk, and mono-exponential model) to re-continualize the obtained discrete indicator dilution curves and calculate the time delay of two analytical functions. This re-continualization showed an increase in the temporal accuracy up to a sub-sample accuracy. Thereby, the Local Density Random Walk (LDRW) model performed best using the cross-correlation of the first derivative of both indicator curves with a cutting of the data at 40% of the peak intensity. The error in frames depends on the noise level and is for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB and a sampling rate of f(s) = 60 Hz at [Formula: see text] , so this error is smaller than the distance between two consecutive samples. The accurate determination of the transit time and the quantification of the error allow the calculation of the error propagation onto the flow measurement. Both can assist surgeons as an intraoperative quality check and thereby reduce the recurrence rate and post-surgical mortality.","Naber, Ady; Reiß, Michael; Nahm, Werner",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.588120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122123/,932
609536,Engineered SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain improves manufacturability in yeast and immunogenicity in mice,2021,"Because nosocomial and zoonotic diseases are inherent and ever-present risks in veterinary hospitals, proactive policies should be in place to reduce the risk of sporadic cases and outbreaks. Policies should ideally be put in place before disease issues arise, and policies should be effectively conveyed to all relevant personnel. Written policies are required for practical and liability reasons and should be reviewed regularly. Although no infection control program can eliminate disease concerns, proper implementation of barrier precautions and isolation can reduce the exposure of hospitalized animals and hospital personnel to infectious agents. Appropriate personal hygiene, particularly hand hygiene, can assist in the prevention of disease transmission when pathogens bypass barriers and are able to contact personnel. Veterinary hospitals have moral, professional, and legal requirements to provide a safe workplace and to reduce the risks to hospitalized patients. Based on experience in the human medical field and on the continual emergence of new infectious diseases, infection control challenges can only be expected to increase in the future. Regular reassessment of protocols based on ongoing research and clinical experiences is required.","Weese, J.

611304,Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein ORF6 dislocates RAE1 and NUP98 from the nuclear pore complex,2020-12-13,"COVID-19 is extraordinary both as once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and having abundant real-time case data, thus providing an extraordinary opportunity for timely independent analysis and novel perspectives. We investigate the weekly periodicity in the daily reported new cases and new deaths with the implied relationships to the societal and institutional responses using autocorrelation and Fourier transformation. The results show significant linear correlations between the weekly periodicity and the total cases and deaths, ranging from 50% to 84% for sizable groups of countries with population normalized deaths spanning nearly three orders of magnitude, from a few to approaching a thousand per million. In particular, the Strength Indicator of the periodicity in the new cases, defined by the autocorrelation with a 7-day lag, is positively correlated strongly to the total deaths per million in respective countries. The Persistence Indicator of the periodicity, defined as the average of three autocorrelations with 7-, 14- and 21-day lags, is an overall better indicator of the progression of the pandemic. For longer time series, Fourier transformation gives similar results. This analysis begins to fill the gap in modeling and simulation of epidemics with the inclusion of high frequency modulations, in this case most likely from human behaviors and institutional practices, and reveals that they can be highly correlated to the magnitude and duration of the pandemic. The results show that there is significant need to understand the causes and effects of the periodicity and its relationship to the progression and outcome of the pandemic, and how we could adapt our strategies and implementations to reduce the extent of the impact of COVID-19.","Li, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.20238295; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20238295v1?rss=1,932
628699,Genomic and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa,2021-04-26,"Currently, the world is coping with the COVID-19 pandemic with a few vaccines. So far, the European Medicine Agency has approved four of them. However, following widespread vaccination with the recombinant adenoviral vector-based Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, available only in the United Kingdom and Europe, many concerns have emerged, especially the report of several cases of the otherwise rare cerebral sinus vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. The onset of thrombosis particularly at these unusual sites, about 5--14 days after vaccination, along with thrombocytopenia and other specific blood test abnormalities, are the main features of the vaccine side effects. The acronym vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) has been coined to name this new condition, with the aim of highlighting the difference from the classic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). VIPIT seems to primarily affect young to middle-aged women. For this reason, the vaccine administration has been stopped or limited in a few European countries. Coagulopathy induced by the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (and probably by Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine as well in the USA) is likely related to the use of recombinant vector DNA adenovirus, as experimentally proven in animal models. Conversely, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA vectors. All vaccine-induced thrombotic events should be treated with a nonheparin anticoagulant. As the condition has some similarities with HIT, patients should not receive any heparin or platelet transfusion, as these treatments may potentially worsen the clinical course. Aspirin has limited rational use in this setting and is not currently recommended. Intravenous immunoglobulins may represent another potential treatment, but, most importantly, clinicians need to be aware of this new unusual postvaccination syndrome.","Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Bassareo, Pier Paolo; Barilla', Francesco; Romeo, Francesco; Mehta, Jawahar L",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366403/,932

However, there is no certainty of its effectiveness and efficiency due to the lack of comparison with similar scenarios. In this work, we formulated a theoretical model of individual mobility, which also incorporates the infection dynamics of Covid-19. The model is based on a cellular automaton, which includes individuals moving through the represented spatial region and interacting according to the dynamics of Covid-19. In addition, we include mobile and partial health barriers, and different mobility regimes. Our results show that, partial quarantines would not be effective in general, to reduce the peak of active individuals infected with the virus, except for some proportions of territorial area involved in the division of the global region. Another interesting result of our research is that the passage restrictions in a sanitary barrier would not be relevant to the impact of the pandemic indicators in a sanitary quarantine regime. A possible explanation for the ineffectiveness of partial quarantines lies in the fact that the sanitary barriers are permeable to infected individuals and therefore when one of these individuals passes, an outbreak occurs in the virus-free zone that is independent of the original one.","Leon, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.03.21254727v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.03.21254727,932
641045,SARS-CoV-2 Serological testing in frontline health workers in Zimbabwe,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: 9b is an accessory protein of the SARS-CoV. It is a small protein of 98 amino acids and its structure has been solved recently. 9b is known to localize in the extra-nuclear region and has been postulated to possess a nuclear export signal (NES), however the role of NES in 9b functioning is not well understood. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/METHODOLOGY: In this report, we demonstrate that 9b in the absence of any nuclear localization signal (NLS) enters the nucleus by passive transport. Using various cell cycle inhibitors, we have shown that the nuclear entry of 9b is independent of the cell cycle. Further, we found that 9b interacts with the cellular protein Crm1 and gets exported out of the nucleus using an active NES. We have also revealed that this NES activity influences the half-life of 9b and affects host cell death. We found that an export signal deficient SARS-CoV 9b protein induces apoptosis in transiently transfected cells and showed elevated caspase-3 activity. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we showed that nuclear shuttling of 9b and its interaction with Crm1 are essential for the proper degradation of 9b and blocking the nuclear export of this protein induces apoptosis. This phenomenon may be critical in providing a novel role to the 9b accessory protein of SARS-CoV.","Sharma, Kulbhushan; Åkerström, Sara; Sharma, Anuj Kumar; Chow, Vincent T.

Methods: Primary literature review included topics: “COVID-19,” “SARS,” “MERS,” “gut micro-biota,” “probiotics,” “immune system,” “ACE2,” and “metformin.” Results: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19–related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes.","Barengolts, Elena; Smith, Emily Daviau",Endocr Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1530891X20482205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471720/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1530891X20482205; https://doi.org/10.4158/ep-2020-0336,932
662108,SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.6 was the major contributor to early pandemic transmission in Malaysia,2020-11-30,"Abstract Although the brain has been considered as an immunologically privileged site, the evidence to date suggests that this is no longer the case. Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-3 induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on neural cells. IFN-γ, the most potent inducer of MHC antigen, also induces class II MHC antigen expression on microglia and astrocytes, which enable them to function as antigen-presenting cells. Thus, in some pathological conditions, invading T cells can interact with neural cells to induce central nervous system (CNS) damage. Glial cells have also been shown to produce various cytokines and chemokines. Almost all cytokines and chemokines known to occur in the immune system are also produced in the CNS. In this chapter, the glial responses contributing to neuroimmune interactions are reviewed, with a focus on production and functions of cytokines in the CNS.","Suzumura, Akio",NeuroImmune Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567744307100144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567744307100144,932

In addition, the risk of a virulent and lethal influenza pandemic has generated widespread and warranted concern. Currently licensed influenza vaccines are limited in their ability to induce efficacious and long-lasting herd immunity. In addition, and as evidenced by the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, there can be a significant delay between the emergence of a pandemic influenza and an effective, antibody-inducing vaccine. There is, therefore, a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection—obviating the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Development of such a vaccine would yield enormous health benefits to society and also greatly reduce the associated global healthcare burden. There are a number of alternative influenza vaccine technologies being assessed both preclinically and clinically. In this review we discuss viral vectored vaccines, either recombinant live-attenuated or replication-deficient viruses, which are current lead candidates for inducing efficacious and long-lasting immunity toward influenza viruses. These alternate influenza vaccines offer real promise to deliver viable alternatives to currently deployed vaccines and more importantly may confer long-lasting and universal protection against influenza viral infection.","Lambe, Teresa",Molecular Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735755/; https://doi.org/10.2119/molmed.2012.00147,932
