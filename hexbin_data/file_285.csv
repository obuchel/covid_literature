1307,Review on Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. (Koṭṭaikkarantai),2013,"Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. is from the aroma family Asteraceae. It is also known with other synonyms such as Munditika, Mundi, Shravana, Bhikshu, Tapodhana, Mahashravani, Shravanahva, Shravanashirshaka. It is abundantly distributed in damp areas in plains and also as a weed in the rice fields. In the Indian system of medicine, the plant as a whole plant or its different anatomical parts viz., leaf, stem, bark, root, flower and seed are widely used for curing many diseases. The plant is bitter, stomachic, restorative, alterative, pectoral, demulcent and externally soothing. The whole plant and its anatomical parts have been reported with different types of secondary metabolites which include eudesmanolides, sesquiterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, sesquiterpene acids, flavone glycosides, flavonoid C-glycosides, isoflavone glycoside, sterols, sterol glycoside, alkaloid, peptide alkaloids, amino acids and sugars. The essential oils obtained from the flowers and whole plants were analyzed by different authors and reported the presence of many monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The whole plants, its isolated secondary metabolites and different anatomical parts have been reported for ovicidal, antifeedant, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, antiviral, macrofilaricidal, larvicidal, analgesic, antipyretic, hepatoprotective, antitussive, wound healing, bronchodilatory, mast cell stabilizing activity, anxiolytic, neuroleptic, immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic, antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant, antioxidant, central nervous system depressant, anti-arthritic, nephroprotective, anticonvulsant activities and many other activities. It is also effective on psoriasis. In the present paper, the plant is reviewed for its phytochemical and pharmacological reports in detail.","Ramachandran, Shakila",Pharmacogn Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841994/,285
10647,Decreasing Usage of Lights and Sirens in an Urban Environment: A Quality Improvement Project,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVE: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis has an overall mortality rate of 11%–29% with treatment. Although rare, HSV encephalitis is frequently tested for and empirically treated, especially in the neonatal population. HSV infection can be diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, although this frequently requires sending samples to reference laboratories. The inherent delay in results may lead to prolonging empiric treatment and hospital stay, resulting in increased costs. This study investigates whether onsite HSV PCR testing decreases hospitalization duration, acyclovir treatment duration, and financial cost on an institution. PROJECT DESIGN: This single-center project utilized the IHI model for improvement to evaluate third-party HSV PCR processing versus an implemented onsite PCR-based meningitis–encephalitis panel for HSV central nervous system evaluation. The primary outcome was hospital cost differential with secondary outcomes, including duration of acyclovir administration and time to result. RESULTS: We identified 96 children age 0–18 from 2010 to 2016, 74 patients utilizing offsite third-party testing, and 22 patients utilizing onsite. We observed a per-patient cost savings of $428 ($618.43–$190.43, P = 0.029) upon the implementation of onsite testing. The mean duration of acyclovir therapy decreased from 3.7 to 0.26 days per patient (P < 0.001). Time to result decreased from 4.6 to 0.13 days (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acquisition of real-time local HSV PCR capabilities significantly decreased time to result and empiric medication use while significantly reducing hospital costs in a military treatment facility.","Weber, Zachary; Sutter, Deena; Baltensperger, Austin; Carr, Nicholas",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190250/,285

16202,Impact of the 2003 to 2018 Population Salt Intake Reduction Program in England: A Modeling Study,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic change of heart rate in the acute phase and clinical outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the associations of heart rate trajectories and variability with functional outcome and mortality in patients with acute ICH. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among 332 patients with acute ICH. Latent mixture modeling was used to identify heart rate trajectories during the first 72 h of hospitalization after ICH onset. Mean and coefficient of variation of heart rate measurements were calculated. The study outcomes included unfavorable functional outcome, ordinal shift of modified Rankin Scale score, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: We identified 3 distinct heart rate trajectory patterns (persistent-high, moderate-stable, and low-stable). During 3-month follow-up, 103 (31.0%) patients had unfavorable functional outcome and 46 (13.9%) patients died. In multivariable-adjusted model, compared with patients in low-stable trajectory, patients in persistent-high trajectory had the highest odds of poor functional outcome (odds ratio 15.06, 95% CI 3.67–61.78). Higher mean and coefficient of variation of heart rate were also associated with increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome (P trend < 0.05), and the corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) comparing two extreme tertiles were 4.69 (2.04–10.75) and 2.43 (1.09–5.39), respectively. Likewise, similar prognostic effects of heart rate dynamic changes on high modified Rankin Scale score and all-cause mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Persistently high heart rate and higher variability in the acute phase were associated with increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome in patients with acute ICH.

16303,La littérature médicale mondiale : obstétrique,2021-03-23,"Animal disease models are necessary in medical research, and an appropriate animal model is of great importance for studies about the prevention or treatment of cancer. The most important thing in the selection of animal models is to consider the similarity between animals and humans. The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a squirrel-like mammal which placed in the order Scandentia. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that tree shrews are extremely similar to primate and humans than to rodents, with many highly conserved genes, which makes the data from studies that use tree shrews as models more convincing and the research outcomes more easily translatable. In tumor research, tree shrews are often used as animal models for hepatic and mammary cancers. As research has progressed, other types of tree shrew tumor models have been developed and exhibit clinical manifestations similar to those of humans. Combining the advantages of both rodents and primates, the tree shrew is expected to be the most powerful animal model for studying tumors.","Lu, Tao; Peng, Hongmei; Zhong, Liping; Wu, Pan; He, Jian; Deng, Zhiming; Huang, Yong",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7985444/,285

34329,COVID-19 and coronaviral hepatitis: evidence of collateral damage,2020-06-12,"Generating code from networks of timed automata is a well-researched topic with many proposed approaches, which have in common that they not only generate code for the processes in the network, but necessarily generate additional code for a global scheduler which implements the timed automata semantics. For distributed systems without shared memory, this additional component is, in general, undesired. In this work, we present a new approach to the generation of correct code (without global scheduler) for distributed systems without shared memory yet with (almost) synchronous clocks if the source model does not depend on a global scheduler. We characterise a set of implementable timed automata models and provide a translation to a timed while language. We show that each computation of the generated program has a network computation path with the same observable behaviour.","Feo-Arenis, Sergio; Vujinović, Milan; Westphal, Bernd","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281891/,285
35349,After careful consideration of the rapidly changing situation relating to the Coronavirus outbreak,2020-05-27,"INTRODUCTION: Burkholderia cepacia complex is a ubiquitous organism with a high virulence potential. It is found most commonly in moist environments. Hospital outbreaks have been reported from diverse sources such as contaminated faucets, nebulizers, disinfectant solutions, multidose antibiotic vials, tap water, bottled water, nasal sprays, and ultrasound gels. In this article, we present our experience in investigating and successfully managing an outbreak of nosocomial transmission of Burkholderia cepacia sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit at SGT Hospital, Haryana, India. CASE PRESENTATION: During the month of March, multiple Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates were recovered from blood cultures of Caucasian babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital. The organisms were multidrug-resistant, with in vitro sensitivity to meropenem alone (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 μg/ml). An outbreak was suspected, and the neonatal intensive care unit in-charge and hospital infection control teams were alerted. Outbreak investigation was initiated, and surveillance samples were collected. Burkholderia cepacia complex was successfully isolated from suction apparatus. The isolates were phenotypically typed (biotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and found to be identical. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the index case might have been exposed to infection due to a physiological state of low immunity (preterm, low birth weight, and mechanical ventilation). The rest of the cases might have been exposed to this organism due to inadequate hand hygiene/improper cleaning and disinfection practices. Timely reporting and implementation of infection control measures played a significant role in curtailing this outbreak.","Bharara, Tanisha; Chakravarti, Anita; Sharma, Mukesh; Agarwal, Priti",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308110/,285

38535,Utilizing video conferencing software to teach young language learners in Hong Kong during the COVID‐19 class suspensions,2020-08-19,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with a mortality of 45%. Our previous research indicated that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could maintain the normal structure and function of the respiratory barrier. However, systemic application of VEGF antagonists would lead to animal death. This study attempts to study the targeted drug delivery for ARDS. In this study, we used soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt)-targeted ultrasound microbubbles to antagonize the effect of VEGF on lung tissue. Ninety male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups: phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group (PBS+PBS); blank group (PBS+empty microbubbles); lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (LPS+PBS); ARDS group (LPS+empty microbubbles); control group (PBS+sFlt microbubbles); and treatment group (LPS+sFlt microbubbles). After administration of LPS or PBS in the corresponding groups, the sFlt-targeted microbubbles or empty microbubbles were injected into the blood circulation. Then the lungs were irradiated with ultrasound, which ruptured the drug-loaded microbubbles and helped release drugs to the lung tissues targeted. The lung injury score, lung wet/dry ratio (W/D), liver and kidney functions, and the mortality of the mice in all groups were investigated at the predetermined time point. The difference in mortality between groups was examined by Fisher test. Other data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A value of P<0.05 indicates that the difference was significant. The results showed that the PaO(2) levels were normal in the PBS group, the blank group, and the control group. The LPS group and ARDS group showed significant hypoxia. PaO(2) was improved significantly in the treatment group. The lung injury score and W/D were normal in the PBS group, the blank group, and the control group. The lung injury score and W/D increased significantly in the LPS group and ARDS group and decreased in the treatment group (P<0.05). The mortality rate of the ARDS model was 60% (95% confidence interval 47.5%–72.5%), and that with sFlt-targeted microbubbles was significantly lower at only 40% (95% confidence interval 27.5%–52.5%, P<0.05). It was concluded that anti-VEGF with sFlt targeted ultrasound microbubbles attenuated the lung injury and ultimately reduced the 7-day mortality effectively. It might be a suitable therapeutic tool for the treatment of ARDS.","Zhang, Zhao; Lu, Dong-shi; Zhang, Dan-qing; Wang, Xin; Ming, Yu; Wu, Zhou-yang",Curr Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456355/,285

49999,Olfactory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Detection,2021-03-23,"Live migration is an essential feature in virtual infrastructure and cloud computing datacenters. Using live migration, virtual machines can be online migrated from a physical machine to another with negligible service interruption. Load balance, power saving, dynamic resource allocation, and high availability algorithms in virtual data-centers and cloud computing environments are dependent on live migration. Live migration process has six phases that result in live migration overhead. Currently, virtual datacenters admins run live migrations without an idea about the migration cost prediction and without recommendations about the optimal timing for initiating a VM live migration especially for large memory VMs or for concurrently multiple VMs migration. Without cost prediction and timing optimization, live migration might face longer duration, network bottlenecks and migration failure in some cases. The previously proposed timing optimization approach is based on using machine learning for live migration cost prediction and the network utilization predict ion of the cluster. In this paper, we show how to integrate our machine learning based timing optimization algorithm with VMware vSphere. This integration deployment proves the practicality of the proposed algorithm by presenting the building blocks of the tools and backend scripts that should run to implement this timing optimization feature. The paper shows also how the IT admins can make use of this novel cost prediction and timing optimization option as an integrated plug-in within VMware vSphere UI to be notified with the optimal timing recommendation in case of a having live migration request.","Elsaid, Mohamed Esam; Sameh, Mohamed; Abbas, Hazem M.; Meinel, Christoph",Cloud Computing and Services Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982693/,285

The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of public aid to business R&D on technological inputs and outputs through the economic cycle. We contribute to this literature by examining the effect of one specific instrument of direct public support: selective loans for firms’ R&D projects. For the analysis, we consider Spanish firms supported through this kind of instrument for the periods 2002–2005 and 2010–2012. Our results suggest that the hypothesis of full crowding out of private R&D is rejected in both cycle periods, expansion and recession: public support has positive effects on the resources devoted to R&D activities. However, the effect of public support on some technological outputs depends on the cycle phase: firms supported by selective loans during the crisis are more likely to obtain product innovations.","Barajas, Ascensión; Huergo, Elena; Moreno, Lourdes",Econ Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994917/,285
50894,"38 Dementia, Apoe and COVID-19 Severity",2021-03-16,"Aroma is one of the main attributes that consumers consider when appreciating and selecting a coffee; hence it is considered an important quality trait. However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on–time and ensure high-quality products.","Gonzalez Viejo, Claudia; Tongson, Eden; Fuentes, Sigfredo",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998415/,285

However, circRNA profiling and the potential biological role of circRNA in influenza A virus (IAV)-induced lung injury have not been investigated. In the present study, circRNA expression profiles in lung tissues from mice with and without IAV-induced lung injury were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing, and differentially expressed circRNAs were verified by quantitative PCR. The gene homology of candidate circRNAs was investigated and the expression of plasma circRNAs from patients with IAV-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was detected. The target microRNAs (miRNAs) of circRNAs were predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. In total, 781 circRNAs were differentially expressed between ARDS mice and control (467 were up-regulated and 314 were down-regulated). Moreover, the candidate circRNAs (Slco3a1, Nfatc2, Wdr33, and Dmd) expression showed the same trend with the sequencing results. The isoforms of circRNA Slco3a1 and Wdr33 were highly conserved between humans and mice. Plasma circRNA Slco3a1 and Wdr33 presented differential expression in patients with IAV-induced ARDS compared to control. The circRNA-miRNA interaction network and GO and KEGG analyses indicated the potential biological role of circRNAs in the development of IAV-induced lung injury. Taken together, a large number of differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in our study. CircRNA Slco3a1 and Wdr33 had significantly different expression in specimens from mice and humans, and showed a potential biological role in IAV-induced lung injury by bioinformatics analysis.

52247,Antiarrhythmic Drug Loading at Home Using Remote Monitoring: A Virtual Feasibility Study During COVID-19 Social Distancing,2021-03-25,"We previously isolated a single domain antibody (V(H)H) that binds Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) with the end-goal being the enteromucosal passive immunization of cattle herds. To improve the yield of a chimeric fusion of the V(H)H with an IgA Fc, we employed two rational design strategies, supercharging and introducing de novo disulfide bonds, on the bovine IgA Fc component of the chimera. After mutagenizing the Fc, we screened for accumulation levels after transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We identified and characterized five supercharging and one disulfide mutant, termed ‘(5 + 1)Fc’, that improve accumulation in comparison to the native Fc. Combining all these mutations is associated with a 32-fold increase of accumulation for the Fc alone, from 23.9 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) to 599.5 mg/kg FW, as well as a twenty-fold increase when fused to a V(H)H that binds EHEC, from 12.5 mg/kg FW tissue to 236.2 mg/kg FW. Co-expression of native or mutated V(H)H-Fc with bovine joining chain (JC) and bovine secretory component (SC) followed by co-immunoprecipitation suggests that the stabilizing mutations do not interfere with the capacity of V(H)H-Fc to assemble with JC and FC into a secretory IgA. Both the native and the mutated V(H)H-Fc similarly neutralized the ability of four of the seven most prevalent EHEC strains (O157:H7, O26:H11, O111:Hnm, O145:Hnm, O45:H2, O121:H19 and O103:H2), to adhere to HEp-2 cells as visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy and quantified by fluorometry. These results collectively suggest that supercharging and disulfide bond tethering on a Fc chain can effectively improve accumulation of a V(H)H-Fc fusion without impacting V(H)H functionality.","Chin-Fatt, Adam; Saberianfar, Reza; Menassa, Rima",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079772/,285

First, the study analyses the effect of passenger volume and the proportions of different modes of travel on the spread of COVID-19 in the early stage. The developed spatial autoregressive model shows that total passenger volume and proportions of air and railway passenger volumes are positively associated with the cumulative confirmed cases. Second, a questionnaire is analysed to determine changes in travel behaviour after COVID-19. The results indicate that the number of total trips considerably decreased. Public transport usage decreased by 20.5%, while private car usage increased by 6.4%. Then the factors affecting the changes in travel behaviour are analysed by logit models.

52538,Clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors to boost immunity to viral infection in older adults,2021-05-06,"Background: Psuedohypoparathyroidism type 1 b (PHP 1b) is a rare condition characterized by hormone resistance with PTH. It is caused by imprinting defect of the GNAS gene and is acquired as autosomal dominant. Compared with Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a), PHP1b does not have the characteristic physical features know as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy or AHO. Results: 12-year-old female with unremarkable past medical history presented with seizures. She has been complaining of leg pain for a week but on the day of presentation noted to have stiffening and shortness of breath. There was no history of cough, fever, leg trauma, headache, dysuria, hematuria or dark urine. She had no significant family history. Work up revealed severe hypocalcemia of 4.6 mg/ dL and elevated phosphorus (7.1mg/dl). There was no hypoglycemia and other electrolytes including renal function were normal. Patient also had normal inflammatory markers, normal fibrinogen, and normal ferritin. Urine was positive for trace protein and was positive for myoglobin. Alkaline phosphatase was normal. Urine toxicology screen was negative. Hand X-rays did not showed the shortening of metacarpal bones and kidney ultrasound was normal. After IV calcium bolus, calcium barely increased at 5.0. Interestingly CK was noted to be elevated at 3,794 U/L. Patient physical exam was normal and there was no signs of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Patient was positive for COVID19. Patient required intensive fluid therapy to correct CK which increased up to 11,223 U/L on 3rd day of admission. It eventually came down back to normal on the 6th day. Creatinine levels remained normal. Patient continued to receive high dose calcium and calcitriol supplement and discharged with calcium of 8.5 mg/dL and phosphorus of 7.8 mg/dL. Additional work up showed PTH of 885 pg/mL consistent with pseudohypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D levels and thyroid function were normal. Genetic testing for pseudohypoparathyroidism is awaited. Conclusion: Psuedohypoparathyroidism type 1 b (PHP 1b) is a rare endocrine disorder presenting with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and increased PTH values due to a variable resistance to target organs. As in our case it was unmasked by COVID 19 infection and rhabdomyolysis. Best of our knowledge there is no such unusual case reported in children. Severe hypocalcemia likely due to combination of factors including tissue calcium deposition, hyperphosphatemia, and skeletal resistance to PTH.

53191,281 Evaluating a Diagnostic Algorithm for Adult Appendicitis – A Quality Improvement Project,2021-05-04,"Both the concepts of ecosystem services and social enterprise have gained popularity as means of addressing social and environmental issues in recent years. But while research on ecosystem services has focused on non-governmental organisation and local community-led approaches, the role of social enterprises has received less attention. In Scotland, social enterprises play an important role in delivering social and environmental justice, as well as reaping economic benefits through forest-based practices. These practices are often small-scale and attract participants from local communities. But despite this prominence their motivations and the challenges they face remain largely unexplored. This research attempts to integrate both concepts mainly using field observations and interviews, and to reinforce the findings with the existing literature. It explores the motivations and challenges of social enterprises in sustaining forest ecosystem services through a case study, and discusses their potential within the context of current policy. The research suggests that social enterprises are equipped to tackle a range of social and environmental issues. The enterprise under investigation aims to improve participants’ wellbeing and employability, as well as to provide public education and promote environmental awareness. But these efforts are often hindered by the difficulties of high requirements of the manager and staff members in balancing multiple objectives and most importantly, of managing financial risks. The research concludes that a practical method of assessing cultural ecosystem services as well as the use of innovative funding norms may resolve these challenges, allowing social enterprises to fill the current policy gap and create synergies in the fields of ecosystem services and social enterprise.","Zhang, Shaohui; Paterson, James S.; Hujala, Teppo",Small-scale Forestry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8134967/,285

53200,171 Surgical Trainee Suggestions to Improve Surgical Training and the Surgical Recruitment Process in View of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused unprecedented shocks and disruptions in the cattle and beef industry. The shutdown of food service in March 2020 caused an unparalleled stacking of food demand on the retail grocery sector. The rigidity and specialized nature of food service and retail grocery supply chains, compounded by a surge in consumer demand at retail grocery, resulted in temporary shortages of meat in other consumer products in supermarkets. The food service sector recovered somewhat over many weeks but remained diminished through the balance of 2020 and beyond. In April 2020, COVID-19 infections affected the labor forces of many meat packing and processing facilities and resulted in significant reductions in beef packing and further processing for eight to twelve weeks. This caused additional product shortages in retail grocery and food service sectors. These impacts have raised many questions about how the beef industry might adapt to be more resilient in the face of such profound disruptions. Possible changes include more use of multi-purpose facilities (less specialized for food service or retail grocery supply chains); design changes in new plants and retrofitting existing facilities to reduce human health impacts; changes in labor management; changes in inventory management; and changes in business supply chain management and risk assessment practices.","Peel, Derrell S",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104768/,285
53227,944 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Fractures’: Utilising Opportunities Brought About By COVID-19 To Create A National Online Educational Series,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Rheumatology departments were required to switch rapidly from face-to-face (F2F) to remote consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. We conducted a patient satisfaction survey on the switch to inform future service development. Methods All patients [new (NP), follow-up (FU)] were identified between 1st to 5th June 2020. Patients who attended or did not attend (DNA) a pre-booked F2F consultation or cancelled were excluded. Of the remainder, half the patients was surveyed by phone using a standardised questionnaire and the other half was posted the same questionnaire. Both groups were offered the opportunity to complete the survey online. Patients were surveyed on the organisation and content of the consultation, whether they were offered a subsequent F2F appointment and future consultation preference. Results 233 consultations were scheduled during the study period. After 53 exclusions (34 pre-booked F2F, 16 DNA, 3 cancellations), 180 eligible consultations were surveyed (85 via mailshot, 95 by telephone). 75/180 patients (42%) responded within 1 month of the telephone consultation (20 NP, 47 FU, 8 missing). The organisation of the switch was positively perceived (Table). Patients were highly satisfied with 4 of the 5 consultation domains but were undecided whether a physical assessment would have changed the outcome of the consultation (Table). After the initial phone consultation, 7 of 20 NP and 19 of 47 FU were not offered subsequent F2F appointments at the clinicians’ discretion. Of those not offered subsequent F2F appointments, proportionally more NP (3/7, 43%) would have liked one, compared to FU (5/19, 26%). Reasons included communication difficulties and a desire for a definitive diagnosis. 48/75 (64%) would be happy for future routine FU to be conducted by phone “most of the time"" or ""always”; citing patient convenience and disease stability. Caveats were if physical examination was required or if more serious issues (as perceived by the patient) needed F2F discussion. Conclusion Patients were generally satisfied with telephone consultations and most were happy to be reviewed again this way. NPs should be offered F2F appointments for first visits to maximise patient satisfaction and time efficiency. Disclosure M. Rodziewicz: None. T. O'Neill: None. A.

53233,804 Using Simulation as A Platform to Prepare for ENT Emergencies in The COVID-19 Era,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: In an attempt to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, several measures of social distancing and reorganization of health care systems have been adopted. In Portugal, these included suspending elective clinical activity and a temporary national lockdown. Data from multiple centres, including central hospitals in Portugal, has shown a reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Fear of going to the hospital and physical inactivity have been pointed as possible explanations. PURPOSE: to assess the impact of this pandemic and the measures taken against it on the pattern of admissions and treatment of patients with ACS in a district hospital. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted in the Cardiology Department of a Portuguese district hospital, capable of performing 24h percutaneous coronary intervention. We analyzed the admissions for ACS during the peak of the first COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal (16th of March to 3rd of May 2020, coinciding with the suspension of elective activity) and compared it with two control periods: one immediately preceding the study period (27th of January to 15th of March - 2020 control) and one exactly one year before (16th of March to 3rd of May 2019 - 2019 control). RESULTS: During the 7 weeks of the first COVID-19 outbreak, 46 patients were hospitalized for ACS in our department, while 54 had been admitted during the 2020 control period and 40 in the 2019 control period, with a mean of 7 admissions/week (vs 8 and 6, respectively; p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between the study group and both controls regarding basal characteristics. Their presentation did not differ: the majority of patients (57%) was admitted for ST-elevation myocardial infarction and median time from symptom onset to admission to the emergency room was 3 hours, with 4% of patients presenting in Killip class ≥III (p > 0.05 for all). We also found no significant differences in the treatment administered nor in the outcomes (96% submitted to coronary angiography, median length of hospitalization of 4 days and in-hospital mortality rate of 2%, p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the reduction in admissions for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak is not universal. Additionally, severity at presentation, treatment administered and outcomes did not seem to differ. The relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 in our hospital""s region might be the cause, since people might fear and refrain less from going to the hospital. Larger studies with other centres in low-prevalence regions are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Ferreira, J; Fonseca, M; Farinha, JM; Esteves, AF; Pinheiro, A; Coelho, R; Goncalves, S; Costa, C; Caria, R",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135328/,285
53272,512 Trauma Meetings in the Time of COVID,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Patient and public involvement (PPI) initiatives are important to ensure patient-centered research. However, traditional focus groups can present challenges including the recruitment and retention of patient partners. Additional challenges to patient involvement have also arisen due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The University College London (UCL) Patient Partners in Rheumatology Research initiative has been developed to explore novel ways to boost patient involvement and foster an active collaboration between basic researchers and patient partners. Methods Two online surveys were designed to obtain information with regards to the expectations and practicalities of this initiative. One survey was sent to patients who had registered an interest in being patient partners and the other survey to rheumatology researchers at UCL and University College London Hospital (UCLH). Results We received responses from 25 researchers and 21 patients. The majority of patients who responded (71%) had not previously been involved in PPI. Most of the researchers (84%) had previously utilised PPI, however 20% of those had some difficulty accessing it. Most patients (86%) were interested in becoming a patient partner. Amongst those with reservations, one stated that “I don't think I have the qualifications to be involved with scientists and researchers”. Over half of patients (52%) were happy to participate in PPI more than five times a year and most researchers (84%) expressed that five times a year was acceptable. Patients favoured (52%) conducting PPI meetings after office hours (5-8pm) during the working week. Due to social restrictions because of COVID-19, we asked both patients and researchers their preferred mode of meeting. Both groups favoured a mixed (virtual and face to face) meeting arrangement (81% for patients and 68% for researchers). A third of patients (38%) expressed that they would need technical assistance accessing a virtual meeting. Almost all patients (95%) were happy to contribute to lay summary reviews remotely via email. Conclusion Based on the insights gained from the survey results, our PPI initiative meetings will be hosted in a hybrid virtual/face to face format. These will be held at a time and frequency that is convenient for the patient partners to increase participation across wider demographics. This survey has highlighted that we have to be mindful of certain patient perceptions of PPI which creates a barrier to patient involvement and that some individuals may require further support in accessing virtual meetings. By designing a PPI initiative that creatively addressed the needs of both the researchers and patient partners we hope to create a platform for productive dialogue and collaboration to ensure patient-centred research, despite the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

53283,829 Is There an Ongoing Role For 'Telephone Triage Clinics' Post COVID-19?,2021-05-04,"Background: Hypernatremia and hyponatremia (serum sodium > 145 mmol/L and < 135 mmol/L, respectively) are independent risk factors for excess mortality in patients with bacterial pneumonia. We sought, for the first time, an association of sodium [Na] abnormalities with mortality, need for advanced respiratory support and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Methods: This retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study included 488 adults, 277 males and 211 females, with a median age of 68 years, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 to two hospitals in London over an 8-week period (February to May 2020). Results: The in-hospital mortality rate was 31.1% with a medial length of stay of 8 days. High [Na] levels at any timepoint during hospital stay were associated with significantly increased mortality rate (56.6% vs 21.1% in patients who remained constantly normonatremic; odds ratio 3.05, 95% CI 1.69-5.49; p<0.0001). On day 3 and on day 6, high [Na] values predicted mortality with an estimated odds ratio of 2.34 (95% CI 1.08 – 5.05, p=0.0014) and 2.40 (95% CI 1.18 - 4.85, p=0.001), respectively. Non-survivors had a significantly higher 5-day rise in serum [Na] when compared to survivors (3.60 mmol/L vs 1.14 mmol/L respectively, p<0.05). Patients with low serum [Na] levels on admission had a 2.18-fold increase (95% CI 1.34-3.46, p=0.001) in the likelihood of needing advanced ventilatory support compared to those with normal [Na] (31.7% vs 17.5%, respectively). However, exposure to hyponatremia at any timepoint, including at presentation or on day 3 or day 5, was not associated with excess risk of death. AKI affected 37.1% of patients (21.3%, 7.4% and 8.4% stages 1, 2 and 3 respectively) but was not related to serum sodium values. Conclusions: In hospitalized COVD-19 patients, hypernatremia at any timepoint was associated with excess mortality, suggesting that [Na] concentration may facilitate risk stratification. In addition, whilst our data cannot prove causality, these findings highlight the significance of judicious rehydration in such patients.","Tzoulis, Ploutarchos; Waung, Julian; Bagkeris, Emmanouil; Hussein, Ziad; Biddanda, Aiyappa; Cousins, John; Dewsnip, Alice; Falayi, Kanoyin; McCaughran, P W; Mullins, Chloe; Naeem, Ammara; Nwokolo, Munachiso; Quah, Helen; Bitat, Syed Rabha; Deyab, Eithar; Ponnampalam, Swarupini; Bouloux, Pierre-Marc Gilles; Montgomery, Hugh; Baldeweg, Stephanie",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135456/,285
53285,201 Reducing Noise Pollution on a Surgical Ward,2021-05-04,"Subacute thyroiditis(SAT) is associated with viral(destructive) or post-viral(inflammatory) origin.[1]The most common clinical characteristics of SAT are female sex preponderance, anterior neck pain and fever.[2,3] Heart rhythm disorders and silent cervical forms have been described in SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,which occurs 16 to 36 days after resolution of COVID-19.[1,3] Symptomatic improvement occurs in a few days after initiation of therapy with sterods or NSAID.[3] Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO) is a very rare presentation of SAT.[2] Hereby, a case of SAT, presenting with painful neck swelling and persistent fever (5weeks duration), two weeks after resolution of COVID-19, is being discussed. The index patient was a 50-year old obese,normotensive, diabetic (10 years duration, HbA1c-6.6% on SU, metformin, sitagliptin and dapagliflozin) male. TSH was suppressed (0.02 mIU/L), FT4 (3.06 ng/dl, upper limit of normal-1.48ng/dl) and FT3 (3.9 pg/ml, upper limit of normal-3.71 pg/ml) were elevated. Total T4 and T3 were normal. HS-CRP was markedly elevated. IL-6 and TBG were not estimated. Cervical USG revealed diffuse hypoechogenecity of thyroid gland and thyromegaly. There was reduced uptake in thyroid scan (technetium). The patient became afebrile after 4 days of initiation of 30 mg prednisolone (tapered by 10 mg every 5 days). The initial tachycardia reverted to sinus rhythm with marked reduction of neck tenderness. This case highlights certain considerations for SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, it can present with PUO (first case report). Secondly, it may be associated with normal total T4 and T3 which can happen due to reduced TBG consequent upon increased IL-6.[4] References: 1.

53346,555 The Unintended Consequences Of COVID-19 on the Quality of Documentation of Operation-Notes,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND: We aim to investigate current head and neck outpatient practices across the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional study comprising of an online 20-item survey was emailed to members of the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists (BAHNO). Topics covered included safety measures, protective equipment used and protocols around the use of flexible nasendoscopy (FNE) in clinic. RESULTS: 117 participants completed the survey covering 66 Trusts across the UK. There was a significant reduction in face-to-face clinic patients compared to pre-pandemic numbers. Room down-time after FNE ranged from 0-6 hours and there was a significant increase in allocated down-time after the patient had coughed or sneezed. Natural ventilation existed in 36% of clinics and the majority of responders didn’t know the calculated Air Change Per Hour (ACPH) of the room (77%). Where ACPH was known, it often did not match the allocated room down-time. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations are being made across the UK to maintain staff and patient safety, but more can still be done by liaising with hospital infectious diseases and the hospital estates team to clarify outpatient protocols.Outpatient activity will likely remain limited and alternative strategies will need to develop to manage the backlog in face-to-face clinics.","Jaikaransingh, D; Bola, S; Winter, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135680/,285

METHOD: Prospective study of all general surgery inpatients, who would normally be looked after at University Hospital Monklands, between 17/04/20-06/06/20, the beginning and end of a single-site receiving model within NHS Lanarkshire. RESULTS: There was a 32% reduction in admissions from 278 to 188, from the same time period in 2019. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.2% in comparison to 2.8% in 2019. Of 59 patients (31.4%) who had surgery, 13.5% had a complication of varying degree. The post-operative 30-day mortality rate was 0%. Only 4 patients (2%) were diagnosed with covid-19, none of which died. Laparoscopic appendicectomy was favoured over conservative management, with average length of stay (LoS) being 3.2 days and 5 days respectively. Acute cholecystitis was overall managed conservatively with average LoS being 8.8 days for operative management, compared to 4.1 days for conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Overall outcomes during this time were not found to be significantly worse when compared to the previous year. The rate of contracting covid-19 in the unit was low.

53446,Oral health may prevent severe COVID-19 disease,2021-05-21,"INTRODUCTION: In the already high-risk, high-stress environment of the operating theatre, operating during Covid-19 has brought its own unique challenges. Communication, teamwork and anxiety related new operating practices secondary to Covid-19 are hypothesised to have a negative impact on patient care. METHOD: We conducted a single-centre online survey of operating theatre staff from 22nd June–6th July 2020. Respondents completed 18 human factors questions related to COVID-19 precautions including communication, teamwork, situational awareness, decision making, stress, fatigue, work environment and organisational culture. Questions consisted of yes/no responses, multiple choice and Likert items. Kruskall-Wallis tests, Chi-Squared, Mann Whitney U tests, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, lambda and Cramer’s V tests were used. Free-text responses were also reviewed. RESULTS: 116 theatre staff responded. Visual (90.5%), hearing/ understanding (96.6%) difficulties, feeling faint/lightheaded (66.4%) and stress (47.8%) were reported. Decreased situational awareness was reported by 71.5% and correlated with visors (r = 0.27 and p = 0.03) and FFP2/3 mask usage (r = 0.29 and p = 0.01). Reduced efficiency of theatre teams was reported by 75% of respondents and 21.5% felt patient safety was at greater risk due to Covid-19 precautions in theatre.

54235,IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON SURGICAL ACTIVITY OF AN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY SERVICE IN A SECONDARY HOSPITAL,2021-05-18,"With the progress of Artificial Intelligence, intelligent agents are increasingly being deployed in tasks for which ethical guidelines and moral values apply. As artificial agents do not have a legal position, humans should be held accountable if actions do not comply, implying humans need to exercise control. This is often labeled as Meaningful Human Control (MHC). In this paper, achieving MHC is addressed as a design problem, defining the collaboration between humans and agents. We propose three possible team designs (Team Design Patterns), varying in the level of autonomy on the agent’s part. The team designs include explanations given by the agent to clarify its reasoning and decision-making. The designs were implemented in a simulation of a medical triage task, to be executed by a domain expert and an artificial agent. The triage task simulates making decisions under time pressure, with too few resources available to comply with all medical guidelines all the time, hence involving moral choices. Domain experts (i.e., health care professionals) participated in the present study. One goal was to assess the ecological relevance of the simulation. Secondly, to explore the control that the human has over the agent to warrant moral compliant behavior in each proposed team design. Thirdly, to evaluate the role of agent explanations on the human’s understanding in the agent’s reasoning. Results showed that the experts overall found the task a believable simulation of what might occur in reality. Domain experts experienced control over the team’s moral compliance when consequences were quickly noticeable. When instead the consequences emerged much later, the experts experienced less control and felt less responsible. Possibly due to the experienced time pressure implemented in the task or over trust in the agent, the experts did not use explanations much during the task; when asked afterwards they however considered these to be useful. It is concluded that a team design should emphasize and support the human to develop a sense of responsibility for the agent’s behavior and for the team’s decisions. The design should include explanations that fit with the assigned team roles as well as the human cognitive state.","van der Waa, Jasper; Verdult, Sabine; van den Bosch, Karel; van Diggelen, Jurriaan; Haije, Tjalling; van der Stigchel, Birgit; Cocu, Ioana",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8190710/,285

Now, as employers reopen their doors, we can build on those gains to create better workplaces than the ones we left behind. HR has a window of opportunity in which to develop psychologically safe workplaces, trust‐based employment relationships and socially connected workforces. But progress towards better workplaces hangs on a few critical adjustments in the HR researcher–practitioner relationship. HR researchers must work with HR practitioners to identify organization‐level interventions and examine their simultaneous influence on employee and employer outcomes.

The national internal market and territorial disparities favor the formation of subnational production networks within borders, thus increasing the potential effects of lockdown measures on regional integration production networks. Therefore, this study makes hypothetical simulations of COVID‐19 mitigation policy decisions to understand the regional impacts on integration in supply chains, considering both domestic and global value chains. The generalized hypothetical extraction method is applied to a Brazilian interregional input–output model with 68 industries and 27 regions, imputing partial removals on intermediate consumption and final demand. The results suggest that richer subnational areas, mainly São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are proportionally more impacted by COVID‐19 trade shocks. However, the poorer peripheries are doubly affected, either by the foreign shock, which would damage their economic structure, or by the retraction of the subnational demand from core states. The findings highlight that economic shocks are spatially distributed through different industrial structures, thus stressing the need to avoid ‘one size fits all’ regional policies to mitigate the potential negative effects on exposed regions.","Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues; Alvim, Augusto Mussi; Atienza, Miguel; Fochezatto, Adelar",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242771/,285

However, small molecule mast cell activators may be a more cost-efficient adjuvant alternative that is easily synthesized with high purity compared to M7 or C48/80. To identify novel mast cell activating compounds that could be evaluated for mucosal vaccine adjuvant activity, we employed high-throughput screening to assess over 55,000 small molecules for mast cell degranulation activity. Fifteen mast cell activating compounds were down-selected to five compounds based on in vitro immune activation activities including cytokine production and cellular cytotoxicity, synthesis feasibility, and selection for functional diversity. These small molecule mast cell activators were evaluated for in vivo adjuvant activity and induction of protective immunity against West Nile Virus infection in BALB/c mice when combined with West Nile Virus envelope domain III (EDIII) protein in a nasal vaccine. We found that three of the five mast cell activators, ST101036, ST048871, and R529877, evoked high levels of EDIII-specific antibody and conferred comparable levels of protection against WNV challenge. The level of protection provided by these small molecule mast cell activators was comparable to the protection evoked by M7 (67%) but markedly higher than the levels seen with mice immunized with EDIII alone (no adjuvant 33%). Thus, novel small molecule mast cell activators identified by high throughput screening are as efficacious as previously described mast cell activators when used as nasal vaccine adjuvants and represent next-generation mast cell activators for evaluation in mucosal vaccine studies.","Johnson-Weaver, Brandi T.; Choi, Hae Woong; Yang, Hang; Granek, Josh A.; Chan, Cliburn; Abraham, Soman N.; Staats, Herman F.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8461742/,285

Yet, mixed empirical findings suggest that telework arrangements do not uniformly result in less interrole interference (i.e., work-home and home-work interference). Applying and extending a border theory perspective, the present research offers insight into what factors may predict interrole interference, mediating mechanisms that may explain why such interference occurs, and a moderator that tests for whom interference is most damaging when employees work from home. Specifically, we test cross-role interruption behaviors as a predictor of interrole interference, with recovery experiences as a mediator of this relation and work-life border segmentation preference as a moderator. A sample of 504 home-based teleworkers recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk participated in a three-wave survey. Results from a structural equation modeling approach support our overall model. However, the extent and valence of the impact of cross-role interruption behaviors had on teleworkers’ interrole interference depended on the direction of the interruption, type of recovery experience, and personal work-life border preference. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights that may help explain the gap between expected and actual occurrence of interrole interference in home-based telework arrangements.","Smith, Claire E.; Huang, Susannah; Horan, Kristin A.; Barratt, Clare L.",Occup Health Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502093/,285

It is critical to forecast the number of infected cases to make accurate decisions on the necessary measures to control the outbreak. While deep learning models have proved to be effective in this context, time series augmentation can improve their performance. In this paper, we use time series augmentation techniques to create new time series that take into account the characteristics of the original series, which we then use to generate enough samples to fit deep learning models properly. The proposed method is applied in the context of COVID-19 time series forecasting using three deep learning techniques, (1) the long short-term memory, (2) gated recurrent units, and (3) convolutional neural network. In terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error measures, the proposed method significantly improves the performance of long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks. Also, the improvement is average for the gated recurrent units. Finally, we present a summary of the top augmentation model as well as a visual representation of the actual and forecasted data for each country.","Abbasimehr, Hossein; Paki, Reza; Bahrini, Aram",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502508/,285

In recent years, several US states have enacted laws that legally allow EMS personnel to provide basic emergency care to certain animals. Currently, nine states allow some type of emergency medical treatment and/or ambulance transport of animals by EMS, and five states limit liability for vehicle damage resulting from rescuing animals trapped inside. Despite this expanding body of legislation encouraging EMS to assist animals, EMS personnel are not typically trained in the safe handling or medical treatment of animals. Interaction with veterinary patients can pose serious injury and infectious disease risks to untrained EMS personnel. Furthermore, relationships with veterinarians must be built and treatment and transport protocols must be developed for EMS agencies to appropriately care for these animals. This report serves as an initial framework from the veterinary perspective for EMS consideration regarding current legislation, safety concerns, transport protocols, and common life-saving treatments in the prehospital emergency care of animals. Increased collaboration between EMS personnel and veterinary professionals provides an opportunity to develop quality training programs for EMS and to improve disaster preparedness of the whole community.","Kryda, Katharyn T; Mitek, Ashley; McMichael, Maureen",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845940/,285

In the first few years of life, children experience maturation of their immune system thereby conferring homeostatic balance in which pneumococci are typically rendered as harmless colonizers in the upper respiratory environment. Pneumococcal carriage declines in many children before they acquire capsular-specific antibodies, suggesting a capsule antibody-independent mechanism of natural protection against pneumococcal carriage in early childhood. A child's immune system in the first few years of life is Th2-skewed so as to avoid inflammation-induced immunopathology. Understanding Th1/Th2 and Th17 ontogeny in early life and how adjuvant vaccine formulations shift the balance of T helper-cell differentiation, may facilitate the development of new protein-based pneumococcal vaccines.

Septorhinoplasty is a surgical procedure used to correct both functional as well as aesthetic problems of the nose. It enhances facial harmony and increases self-confidence. The objective of this study is to find out the prevalence of out-patients who underwent septorhinoplasty in a tertiary care centre in Nepal. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study among 5,760 patients who visited the outpatient department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of Kathmandu Medical College from April 2019 to September 2020. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Committee of Kathmandu Medical College. A convenient sampling technique was used. The preoperative and postoperative assessment was done with the help of a rhinoplasty outcome evaluation questionnaire. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences is used for analysis. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS The prevalence of septorhinoplasty was 117 (2.03%) during the study period (95% Confidence Interval= 1.66-2.40). Among 117 patients, 67 (57.3%) were males and 50 (42.7%) were females. Among 117 patients, 85 (72.6%) patients underwent an open approach, while 32 (27.4%) patients underwent closed approach rhinoplasty for the correction of both aesthetic and functional problems.

62408,Covid-19: ensuring equality of access to testing for ethnic minorities.,2020-05-29,"ABSTRACT Over 25% of annual health care expenditures in the United States are associated with the medical needs of people with disabilities. People with disabilities often experience inequalities with access to healthcare services, resulting in increased costs of living with disability. The economic burden of living with a disability results in nearly $400 billion spent annually from combined public and private payor sources. Historically, disparities in healthcare are associated with intersections between race, culture, and environmental factors. Minority status also plays a significant role in health outcomes and studies have highlighted the additional burdens faced at the junction of race and disability status. COVID-19 changed the landscape of healthcare delivery in the United States, resulting in a drastic increase in telehealth utilization. Traditional non-medical barriers to persons with disability, such as unforeseen parking fees, are documented in the literature. However, conditions surrounding access to the necessary technology required to participate in a telehealth driven medical landscape are less clear. This paper addresses the non-medical barriers and costs associated with living with a disability and discusses potential solutions in the evolving healthcare system.","Norman, Jensine'; Stowers, Jared; Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871431/,285

Due to the high rate of transmission and mortality, finding specific and effective treatment options for this infection is currently of urgent importance. Emerging technologies have created a promising platform for developing novel treatment options for various viral diseases such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we have described potential novel therapeutic options based on the structure and pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the results of previous studies on similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. Many of these approaches can be used for controlling viral infection by reducing the viral damage or by increasing the potency of the host response. Owing to their high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, siRNAs, aptamers, nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies, and different types of peptides can be used for interference with viral replication or for blocking internalization. Receptor agonists and interferon-inducing agents are also potential options to balance and enhance the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of such novel technologies is yet to be established although many well-designed clinical trials are underway to address these issues.","Aghamollaei, Hossein; Sarvestani, Rahim; Bakherad, Hamid; Zare, Hamed; Guest, Paul C; Ranjbar, Reza; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656715/,285

We present a theoretical model of the orientational response of anisotropic rods deposited onto a surface of a soft, elastic substrate of finite thickness. We show that anisotropic rods exhibit a continuous isotropic-nematic phase transition, driven by orientational interactions between surface deposited rods. This interaction is mediated by the deformation of the underlying elastic substrate and is quantified by the Boussinesq solution adapted to the case of slender, surface deposited rods. From the microscopic rod-rod interactions, we derive the appropriate Maier-Saupe mean-field description, which includes the Boussinesq elastic free energy contribution due to the substrate elasticity, derive the conditions for the existence of a continuous orientational ordering transition, and discuss the implication of results in the soft (bio)system context.","Kumari, Sunita; Ye, Fangfu; Podgornik, Rudolf",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0022556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086810/,285

This systematic review aims to synthesise current evidence regarding: (1) FCR-related healthcare usage and costs and (2) the cost-effectiveness of FCR treatments. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane and other electronic databases using MeSH headings and keywords for cancer, FCR and costs from their inception to September 2019. Identified studies were screened for eligibility. Original, peer-reviewed journal articles reporting quantitative data from samples of adults treated for cancer written in English were included. Quality was appraised using the Drummond checklist for economic evaluations or the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. RESULTS Data from 11 studies were extracted and synthesised. Seven studies addressed the costs of FCR and suggested an increase in the use of primary and secondary healthcare. Four studies addressed the cost-effectiveness of different FCR treatments and suggest that some treatments may cost-effectively reduce FCR and improve quality of life. Reviewed treatments had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between AU$3,233 and AU$152,050 per quality-adjusted life year gained when adjusted to 2019 Australian dollars. All studies were of sufficient quality to be synthesised in this review. CONCLUSIONS FCR appears to be associated with greater use of certain healthcare resources, and FCR may be treated cost-effectively. Thus, appropriate FCR treatments may not only reduce the individual burden, but also the strain on the healthcare system. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm this and ensure the future implementation of efficient and sustainable FCR treatments.","Williams, Jake Thomas Warton; Pearce, Alison; Smith, Allan 'Ben'",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880822/,285

In Study 2 (N = 68), participants made moral decisions before and after observing the decisions of a prosocial or antisocial peer. Peer observation caused participants' own preferences to resemble those of their peers. This peer influence effect on value computation manifested as an increased weight on choice attributes promoting the peers' goals that occurred independently from peer influence on initial choice bias.

Preventing this health problem is considered an important priority. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors for care and control of hypertension (CCH) according to the health belief model (HBM) in patients with hypertension during the COVID-19 epidemic in Sirjan, Iran. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, participants were chosen by simple random sampling. Data were collected by a valid and reliable researcher-made questionnaire from 200 patients with high blood pressure aged 30-60 years. Data were analyzed by SPSS21 and analysis based on descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression were conducted. RESULTS The results of Pearson correlation coefficients showed that there was a significant correlation between almost all constructs of Health Belief Model (HBM), but the strongest correlations were between self-efficacy and perceived susceptibility (r = 0.940, P ≤ 0.001), and between perceived barriers with perceived benefits (r = -0.615, P ≤ 0.001). According to linear regression, perceived barriers (β = -0.291), cues to action (β = -0.590), and knowledge (β = 0.973) predicted more than 26% of CCH variability. Knowledge had a stronger role than other variables. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that the constructs of the Health Belief Model can predict CCH in hypertensive patients. This model can be used as a tool for designing and implementing educational interventions to increase CCH among hypertensive patients.","Sadeghi, Reza; Masoudi, Mahmood Reza; Patelarou, Athina; Khanjani, Narges",Current hypertension reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573402117666210603115309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082684/,285
66095,COVID-19 Pandemic: A Wake-Up Call for Indian Medical Research.,2021,"BACKGROUND It is unclear whether insulin resistance (IR) contributes to excess mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes independent of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is strongly associated with IR and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the main cause of death in these individuals. We tested this hypothesis in patients with type 2 diabetes from the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events Italian Multicentre Study. METHODS This observational, prospective, cohort study enrolled 15,773 patients with type 2 diabetes attending 19 Italian Diabetes Clinics in 2006-2008. Insulin sensitivity was assessed as estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), which was validated against the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Vital status on October 31, 2015, was retrieved for 15,656 patients (99.3%). Participants were stratified by eGDR tertiles from T1 (≥ 5.35 mg/kg/min) to T3 (≤ 4.14 mg/kg/min, highest IR). RESULTS CVD risk profile was worse in T2 and T3 vs T1. eGDR tertiles were independently associated with micro- and macroalbuminuria and the albuminuric DKD phenotypes (albuminuria with preserved or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) as well as with eGFR categories or the nonalbuminuric DKD phenotype. Over a 7.4-year follow-up, unadjusted death rates and mortality risks increased progressively across eGDR tertiles, but remained significantly elevated after adjustment only in T3 vs T1 (age- and gender- adjusted death rate, 22.35 vs 16.74 per 1000 person-years, p < 0.0001, and hazard ratio [HR] adjusted for multiple confounders including DKD, 1.140 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.049-1.238], p = 0.002). However, eGDR was independently associated with mortality in participants with no DKD (adjusted HR, 1.214 [95% CI, 1.072-1.375], p = 0.002) and in those with nonalbuminuric DKD (1.276 [1.034-1.575], p = 0.023), but not in those with the albuminuric DKD phenotypes. Moreover, the association was stronger in males and in younger individuals and was observed in those without but not with prior CVD, though interaction was significant only for age. CONCLUSIONS The proxy of insulin sensitivity eGDR predicts all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, independent of confounders including DKD. However, the impact of IR in individuals with albuminuric DKD may be mediated by its relationship with albuminuria.

In this study, using a murine transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model, a novel therapeutic strategy is proposed, where blood replacement (BR) robustly reduces infarctions and improves neurological deficits in mice. Our analyses of immune cell subsets suggest that BR therapy substantially decreases neutrophils in blood following a stroke. Electrochemiluminescence detection demonstrates that BR therapy reduces cytokine storm in plasma and ELISA demonstrates reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the plasma and brains at different time points post-stroke. Further, we have demonstrated that the addition of MMP-9 to the blood diminishes the protective effect of the BR therapy. Our study is the first to show that BR therapy leads to profoundly improved stroke outcomes in mice and that the improved outcomes are mediated via MMP-9. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms of stroke damage.","Ren, Xuefang; Hu, Heng; Farooqi, Imran; Simpkins, James W",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17930-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843630/,285
66748,"Covid-19: One in three has neurological or psychiatric condition diagnosed after covid infection, study finds.",2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. It has multiple presentations, demyelinating or axonal, according to the pattern of injury. In general, there are cardinal symptoms, such as areflexia and ascending symmetrical lower limb weakness. GBS has multiple different variants. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type. Other known variants are acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute sensory neuropathy, acute pan dysautonomia, and Miller Fisher syndrome. CASE REPORT In the present case, the patient had initial symptoms of distal bilateral paresthesia and 12 days later he developed left facial muscle weakness, a decrease in ability to taste, and right facial muscle weakness. Two days later the patient said he did not have limb weakness. On examination, he had bilateral lower motor facial palsy, the power in his upper and lower right limbs was 4/5, and he had bilateral upper limb hyperreflexia. Results of a nerve conduction study were consistent with acute demyelinating polyneuropathy with secondary axonal loss. The patient was treated with immunoglobulin G, 0.4 mg/kg/d for 5 days, and fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS Facial diplegia is one of the GBS variants that presents rarely as pure bilateral facial weakness or is preceded by bilateral lower limb weakness. The present case underscores that patients with GBS may have facial diplegia before weakness. Also, they may not have areflexia as a cardinal feature, and instead, hyperreflexia may be seen. Although hyperreflexia has been reported in association with the acute motor axonal variant, the present case shows that hyperreflexia also can be found with AIDP.","Albuainain, Ghada",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.932757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34597290/,285
66758,The complex problem of identifying serious pathology in Musculoskeletal care: Managing clinical risk during the COVID pandemic and beyond.,2021-05-04,"Although cellular immunity to acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection has been well characterized in experimental studies in mice, the T cell response to this virus in humans is incompletely understood. Thus, we analyzed the breadths, magnitudes, and differentiation phenotypes of memory LCMV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in three human donors displaying a variety of disease outcomes after accidental needle stick injury or exposure to LCMV. Although only a small cohort of donors was analyzed at a single time point postinfection, several interesting observations were made. First, we were able to detect LCMV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses directly ex vivo at 4 to 8 years after exposure, demonstrating the longevity of T cell memory in humans. Second, unlike in murine models of LCMV infection, we found that the breadths of memory CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses were not significantly different from one another. Third, it seemed that the overall CD8(+) T cell response was augmented with increasing severity of disease, while the LCMV-specific CD4(+) T cell response magnitude was highly variable between the three different donors. Next, we found that LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the three donors analyzed seemed to undergo an effector memory differentiation program distinct from that of CD4(+) T cells. Finally, the levels of expression of memory, costimulatory, and inhibitory receptors on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell subsets, in some instances, correlated with disease outcome. These data demonstrate for the first time LCMV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in infected humans and begin to provide new insights into memory T cell responses following an acute virus infection.","Kotturi, Maya F; Swann, Justine A; Peters, Bjoern; Arlehamn, Cecilia Lindestam; Sidney, John; Kolla, Ravi V; James, Eddie A; Akondy, Rama S; Ahmed, Rafi; Kwok, William W; Buchmeier, Michael J; Sette, Alessandro",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05477-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900169/,285

STUDY DESIGN Ninety women undergoing robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign disease were randomized to three vaginal cuff closure techniques: running 2.0 V-Lock™ (Arm 1), 0 Vicryl™ figure-of-eight (Arm 2), and running 0 Vicryl™ with Lapra-Ty® (Arm 3). Patients' records were reviewed for age, body mass index, smoking status and relevant co-morbidities. Operative times for vaginal closure and total length of surgery, estimated blood loss, and peri-operative complications were collected. Patients were evaluated at 2 and 6 weeks post-operatively, and interviewed 1year following surgery by a telephone survey. Outcomes evaluated were vaginal cuff dehiscence, pain, dyspareunia and bleeding. RESULTS The study arms did not differ with respect to estimated blood loss (50mL in each arm; p=0.34), median vaginal cuff closure time (14.5, 12 and 13min, respectively; p=0.09) or readmission (p=0.55). In the 1-year follow-up (54/90 respondents; 60%), there were no significant differences among study arms for vaginal bleeding, cuff infection or dyspareunia. Only women belonging to arm 3 reported vaginal pain (0%, 0% and 23%, respectively; p=0.01). No cases of vaginal cuff dehiscence were observed. CONCLUSIONS The type of closure technique has no significant impact on patient outcomes. In the absence of a clear advantage of one technique over the others, the decision regarding the preferred method to close the vaginal cuff in robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy should be based on surgeons' preference and cost effectiveness.","Tsafrir, Ziv; Palmer, Matthew; Dahlman, Marisa; Nawfal, A Karim; Aoun, Joelle; Taylor, Andrew; Fisher, Jay; Theoharis, Evan; Eisenstein, David","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2016.11.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27923167/,285

Little is known about the types and impacts of non-accidental harms Para athletes face. In this literature review, we summarise current knowledge and suggest priorities for future research related to non-accidental harms in Para athletes. DESIGN Six electronic databases were searched between August and September 2017. 2245 articles were identified in the initial title/abstract review, and 202 records were selected for full-text review following preliminary screening. Two independent examiners evaluated each full text, and eight citations were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus and Academic Search Premier. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Inclusion criteria: (A) human participants; (B) written in English; (C) descriptive, cohort and case series, case-control, qualitative, mixed methods studies and all clinical trials; and (D) data pertain to harassment/abuse of youth, recreational, collegiate, national-level and/or elite-level athletes with a physical and/or intellectual impairment. RESULTS Most studies focused on young, visually impaired athletes and approximately half of all studies described high rates of bullying and its social implications. One study confirmed remarkably high rates of psychological, physical and sexual harms in Para athletes, compared with able-bodied peers. CONCLUSIONS Bullying in young, visually impaired athletes is described most commonly in the available literature. Due to the limited amount of data, the prevalence of non-accidental harms in Para athletes remains unclear and information on trends over time is similarly unavailable.","Tuakli-Wosornu, Yetsa A; Sun, Qisi; Gentry, Mark; Ona Ayala, Kimberly E; Doolan, Fiona C; Ottesen, Taylor D; Caldwell, Blake; Naushad, Nida; Huang, Patrick; Kirby, Sandi",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023860/,285

The first objective of the future review is to identify, summarize, appraise, and discuss the current literature on the prebiotic supplementation for dairy calves. The second objective is to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation on growth and health of dairy calves. Eligible studies will be non-randomized and randomized controlled trials in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that examined the supplementation of prebiotics to dairy calves (up to 6 months of age) and reported growth or health outcomes. The main growth outcomes will be average daily gain, feed efficiency, and main health outcomes will be fecal score and diarrhea incidence. A search will be conducted in Biosis, CAB Abstracts, Medline, Scopus, and the Dissertations and Theses Database with the support of a UC Davis librarian. Two reviewers independently will screen the titles and abstracts of retrieved studies. The screening of full manuscripts will be performed by one reviewer. The data extraction will be executed based on pre-tested forms. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. If feasible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted. Heterogeneity will be evaluated with I2 statistic. If possible, publication bias will be investigated by using funnel plots, Begg's adjusted rank correlation, and Egger's test. The certainty of the evidence will be determined using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach. The proposed review will contribute to the current knowledge on prebiotic supplementation for dairy calves; this information may guide management decision at the farm level and identify gaps of knowledge to be addressed in future research.

Development of DV and influential factors were investigated with repeated measures ANOVAs and linear regression models. Results: Individuals with prior DV reported significantly higher DV than previously not affected individuals. However, a statistically significant decrease of DV was found in the group with prior DV. Past DV, childlessness and insecure attachment, but not COVID-19 related stressors predicted current DV. Conclusions: In light of an insecure attachment style lockdown measures may have led to a temporary relationship stabilization.

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of data from a previous randomized clinical trial. METHODS A total of 208 patients who were mechanically ventilated on controlled modes and met criteria for assisted breathing were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Changes in ventilator settings and in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications were identified during the period in which the patients were ventilated either with PS (30.4 +/- 17.4 h) or PAV+ (30.0 +/- 18.1 h) and classified as changes to facilitate weaning (CFW) or changes to respond to deterioration (CD). RESULTS The mean number of changes in ventilator settings was significantly higher with PS than that with PAV+ (10.7 +/- 5.7 vs. 8.9 +/- 4.6). With PS the proportion of these changes classified as CFW was significantly lower than that with PAV+ (59.8% vs. 69.2%). Dyssynchrony as a cause of CD was more likely to occur with PS than with PAV+ (42 vs. 3%). The mean number of changes in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications was higher with PS than with PAV+, the difference being significant only for sedatives (4.06 +/- 3.8 vs. 2.82 +/- 3.4). CONCLUSIONS Compared to PS, PAV+ is associated with fewer intervention in terms of ventilator settings and sedative dose changes.","Xirouchaki, Nectaria; Kondili, Eumorfia; Klimathianaki, Maria; Georgopoulos, Dimitris",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1524-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19529915/,285

However, asymptomatic infection has also been reported, highlighting the difference in immune responses among individuals. Here we performed single-cell chromatin accessibility and T cell-receptor analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19 and healthy donors. Chromatin remodelling was observed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the individuals convalescing from COVID-19. Compared with healthy donors, recovered individuals contained abundant TBET-enriched CD16+ and IRF1-enriched CD14+ monocytes with sequential trained and activated epigenomic states. The B-cell lineage in recovered individuals exhibited an accelerated developmental programme from immature B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells. Finally, an integrated analysis of single-cell T cell-receptor clonality with the chromatin accessibility landscape revealed the expansion of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with epigenomic profiles that promote the differentiation of effector or memory cells. Overall, our data suggest that immune cells of individuals convalescing from COVID-19 exhibit global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility landscape, indicative of the establishment of immunological memory.","You, Maojun; Chen, Liang; Zhang, Dawei; Zhao, Peng; Chen, Zhu; Qin, En-Qiang; Gao, Yanan; Davis, Mark M; Yang, Pengyuan",Nature cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-021-00690-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108657/,285

Monotherapy is often unsuccessful for chronic pelvic pain, and combinations of different classes of medications are frequently prescribed, with the expectation of improved outcomes. Although a number of combination trials for chronic pelvic pain have been reported, we are not aware of any systematic reviews of the available evidence on combination drug therapy for chronic pelvic pain. OBJECTIVE We have developed a protocol for a systematic review to evaluate available evidence of the efficacy and safety of drug combinations for chronic pelvic pain. METHODS This systematic review will involve a detailed search of randomized controlled trials investigating drug combinations to treat chronic pelvic pain in adults. The databases searched will include the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from their inception until the date the searches are run to identify relevant studies. The primary outcome will be pain relief measured using validated scoring tools. Secondary outcomes, where reported, will include the following: adverse events, serious adverse events, sexual function, quality of life, and depression and anxiety. Methodological quality of each included study will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS The systematic review defined by this protocol is expected to synthesize available good quality evidence on combination drug therapy in chronic pelvic pain, which may help guide future research and treatment choices for patients and their health care providers.

OBJECTIVES This meta-analysis study explored the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and suicide mortality, with an emphasis on different lag times. METHODS A systematic search was used to find relevant studies in databases including Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Pubmed, and Embase published up to 19 May 2020. The inclusion criteria included case-crossover or time-series studies assessing the association of criteria air pollutants with suicide mortality at different Lag Days of 0-7 (LD0 to LD7) and Cumulative Lags of 1-7 days (CL1 to CL7). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Of 1436 retrieved articles, 11 were eligible for data extraction, representing data on 283,550 suicides published between 2010 and 2019. The odds of suicide death increase with each 10 μg/m3 increase in the mean concentrations of NO2 at CL1 (1.013: 1.006-1.021), CL2 (1.028: 1.003-1.053), CL3 (1.035: 1.001-1.070), and LD2 (1.011: 1.001-1.022), SO2 at CL1 (1.024: 1.014-1.034), CL2 (1.030: 1.012-1.048), CL3 (1.029: 1.009-1.049), and CL4 (1.027: 1.005-1.049), O3 at CL6 (1.008: 1.000-1.016), PM10 at CL1 (1.004: 1.000-1.008), and PM2.5 at CL1 (1.017: 1.003-1.031). Besides, the odds of suicide death increases with each 0.5 mg/m3 increase in the mean concentration of CO at LD6 (1.005: 1.000-1.011). However, it decreased with increased O3 exposure at LD3 (0.997: 0.994-1.000). CONCLUSION The study supports a positive association between air pollution and suicide mortality.

The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to evaluate the local effects of various types of smokeless tobacco on periodontal health in tobacco pouch keratosis (TPK) patients in Mangalore city in the state of Karnataka. Materials and Methods A total of 345 TPK patients were evaluated of which all were smokeless tobacco users. All the patients were clinically examined for different clinical periodontal parameters such as stains, gingival recession (GR), periodontal pocket, furcation involvement, and mobility and local effects of various types of smokeless tobacco on periodontal health in TPK sites were recorded. Results The prevalence of GR was of 87.5%. Haathichaap was the most common smokeless tobacco used (35.9%) closely followed by nonpackaged type (loose tobacco) (19.4%). This was followed by Madhu (14.2%). Likewise, periodontal parameters were observed more in these patients in decreasing order. Conclusion The results of the present study agree strongly with other smokeless tobacco user studies in terms of the strong association between GR and smokeless tobacco placement. The present cross-sectional study indicates that TPK lesions are positively associated with periodontal diseases. It is important to raise awareness of both oral cancer and periodontal risks and inform about its possible health consequences thereby working towards an improvement of oral and general health and related quality of life in these patients.","Bhandarkar, Gowri Pandarinath; Shetty, Kushal V; Jha, Kamakshi; Arati, Kulkarni; Thomas, Tanya",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_717_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719252/,285

Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies. The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention. The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1β secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities. We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability. Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes.","Lei, Jun; Vermillion, Meghan S; Jia, Bei; Xie, Han; Xie, Li; McLane, Michael W; Sheffield, Jeanne S; Pekosz, Andrew; Brown, Amanda; Klein, Sabra L; Burd, Irina",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.122678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944243/,285

83498,[Access to the Emergency Department in the time of COVID-19: an analysis of the first three months in the Lazio Region (Central Italy)].,2020,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 elicited a surge in publications. Obstetric reports were with few exceptions characterized by small sample sizes with potentially limited generalizability. In this review, evidence suggests increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in pregnancy; common pregnancy comorbidities may help explain worse outcomes. While the risk of death is low, pregnancy may be associated with increased need for ventilation. Prematurity rates seem to be increased but may be accounted for in part by higher cesarean rates, to a large degree accounted for by elective decision to shorten the course of the labor. Though fetal/neonatal complication rates may be higher in the presence of COVID-19 infection, survival rates seem unaffected and vertical transmission is rare. As the outbreak continues in the USA with resurgence in many other western countries that achieved initial success in suppressing the virus, much remains to be learned. For example, the question related to the degree to pregnancy modifying symptomatology remains open. Currently, routine polymerase chain reaction testing remains limited by supply shortages possibly delaying diagnosis until later in the course of the disorder and thus altering the symptom complex at presentation. To add to the knowledge base, we initiated a regional COVID-19 in pregnancy collaborative observational study with a coordinating center, standardized data collection and a shared database. This was facilitated by a longstanding tradition of collaboration among regional obstetric services. Over an anticipated two-year study duration, we expect to study 400 documented and suspected COVID-19 pregnancies with time and site of services controls for cohort effect and high power to detect several adverse maternal/infant outcomes. We include a complete listing of variables in our database, which, along with our experience in setting up our regional collaborative, we hope and believe will be of use in other settings.","Bahado-Singh, Ray; Hassan, Sonia S; Szymanska, Marta; Sokol, Robert J",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151180/,285

However, the role of positive emotion in pediatric asthma is not understood. No work to date has examined how positive emotion may offer benefits to children and adolescents with asthma. Based on theory and models of positive emotion and health, we hypothesize that positive emotion may improve asthma outcomes through mediators such as health behaviors and health-relevant physiological functioning. Moreover, boosting positive emotion during times of stress may be particularly relevant in mitigating asthma symptoms. In the present commentary, we elaborate on the hypothesized mechanisms behind such associations grounded within positive emotion theoretical frameworks. Additionally, we summarize the methodologically rigorous work of positive emotion interventions in other clinical settings to propose that positive emotion could be a useful tool in the management of pediatric asthma.","Jenkins, Brooke N; Moskowitz, Judith; Halterman, Jill S; Kain, Zeev N",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379892/,285

88001,Can Crafted Communication Strategies Allow Musculoskeletal Specialists to Address Health Within the Biopsychosocial Paradigm?,2021-01-06,"Efficient detection of human respiratory viral pathogens is crucial in the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infection. Sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids combined with next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses is a promising strategy for identifying pathogens in clinical and public health settings. It allows the characterization of hundreds of different known pathogens simultaneously and of novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. However, major hurdles for its routine use exist, including cost, turnaround time, and especially sensitivity of the assay, as the detection limit is dependent on viral load, host genetic material, and sequencing depth. To obtain insights into these aspects, we analyzed nasopharyngeal aspirates from a cohort of 81 Thai children with respiratory disease for the presence of respiratory viruses using a sequence-independent next-generation sequencing approach and routinely used diagnostic real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assays. With respect to the detection of rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, the next-generation sequencing approach was at least as sensitive as diagnostic real-time RT-PCR in this small cohort, whereas for bocavirus and enterovirus, next-generation sequencing was less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR. The advantage of the sequencing approach over real-time RT-PCR was the immediate availability of virus-typing information. Considering the development of platforms capable of generating more output data at declining costs, next-generation sequencing remains of interest for future virus diagnosis in clinical and public health settings and certainly as an additional tool when screening results from real-time RT-PCR are negative.","Prachayangprecha, Slinporn; Schapendonk, Claudia M E; Koopmans, Marion P; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Schürch, Anita C; Pas, Suzan D; van der Eijk, Annemiek A; Poovorawan, Yong; Haagmans, Bart L; Smits, Saskia L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01641-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100822/,285

Constrained by the macrocyclic molecular structure, the separations between the N atoms in this bifurcated hydrogen bond are about 2.6 Å, considerably shorter than those typically observed for hydrogen bonded systems in the condensed phases. As such, TAPH exhibits significantly elongated N-H lengths in its hydrogen bond and a downfield 1H NMR chemical shift of 22.1 ppm. In this work, we carry out ab initio molecular dynamics and ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations of TAPH in the acetonitrile solution to reveal the geometry and proton sharing conditions of the bifurcated short hydrogen bond and uncover how the interplay of electronic and nuclear quantum effects gives rise to its far downfield 1H chemical shift. Taking a linear short hydrogen bond as a reference, we demonstrate the distinct features of competing quantum effects and electronic shielding effects in the bifurcated hydrogen bond of TAPH. We further use the degree of deshielding on the proton as a measure of the hydrogen bonding interactions and evaluate the strength of the bifurcated short hydrogen bond as compared to its linear counterpart.","Zhou, Shengmin; Wang, Lu",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0024734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962368/,285

METHODS Retrospective chart review of pure PLS patients at Mayo Clinic-Rochester (1990-2016). Inclusion criteria required a normal EMG during the first 4 years of symptoms. RESULTS Forty-three patients had pure PLS (25 female, 58%) with median onset-age of 50 years (range: 38-78), and median follow-up at 9 years disease duration (range: 4-36). The ascending paraparesis phenotype (N = 30; 70%) was most common, followed by hemiparetic-onset (N = 9; 21%) and bulbar-onset (N = 4; 9%). Among the 30 paraparetic-onset cases, bladder symptoms (n = 18; 60%) and dysarthria (n = 15; 50%) were more common than pseudobulbar affect (n = 9; 30%); and dysphagia (n = 8; 27%); by last follow-up 17/30 (56%) used a cane; 6 (20%) required a wheelchair. The paraparetic-variant, compared with hemiparetic and bulbar-onset, had youngest onset (48 vs 56 vs 60 years, respectively; p = 0.02). Five patients died, 1 required a feeding tube, and none required permanent non-invasive ventilation. Two patients developed an idiopathic multisystem neurodegenerative disorder, which surfaced after 19 and 20 years. Two patients developed minor EMG abnormalities.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis after replacing the background CEI with PIEB for our labor PCEA. Pre-change pump settings were CEI 12mL/h with PCEA (12mL bolus, lockout 15min); PIEB settings were a 9mL bolus every 45min with PCEA (10mL bolus, lockout 10min). We compared medical records of all women receiving epidural or combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia for vaginal delivery for two months before PIEB implementation to a two-month period of PIEB utilization following a five-month introductory familiarization period. The primary outcome was the proportion of women requiring rescue clinician boluses. RESULTS Fewer patients in the PIEB group required rescue clinician boluses compared to the CEI group (12% vs. 19%, P=0.012). Time to first rescue bolus request and total bolus dose were not different. Peak (median [IQR]) pain scores were 2[0-5] with CEI and 0[0-4] with PIEB. There was no difference in instrumental delivery rates. CONCLUSIONS Using PIEB compared to CEI as the background maintenance epidural analgesia method in conjunction with PCEA reduced the number of women requiring clinician rescue boluses while providing comparable labor analgesia. The findings of this clinical care impact study confirm the results of randomized controlled studies and suggest PIEB may be a preferable technique to CEI for the maintenance of labor analgesia.","McKenzie, C P; Cobb, B; Riley, E T; Carvalho, B",International journal of obstetric anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2015.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26775896/,285

Using an engineered sensor that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) exclusively when normal ER membrane lipid composition is compromised, we identified pathways beyond lipid metabolism that are necessary to maintain ER integrity in yeast and in C. elegans. To systematically validate yeast mutants that disrupt ER membrane homeostasis, we identified a lipid bilayer stress (LBS) sensor in the UPR transducer protein Ire1, located at the interface of the amphipathic and transmembrane helices. Furthermore, transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses pinpoint the UPR as a broad-spectrum compensatory response wherein LBS and proteotoxic stress deploy divergent transcriptional UPR programs. Together, these findings reveal the UPR program as the sum of two independent stress responses, an insight that could be exploited for future therapeutic intervention.","Ho, Nurulain; Yap, Wei Sheng; Xu, Jiaming; Wu, Haoxi; Koh, Jhee Hong; Goh, Wilson Wen Bin; George, Bhawana; Chong, Shu Chen; Taubert, Stefan; Thibault, Guillaume",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201909165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349127/,285

Our objective was to determine biologic mesh practice patterns of reconstructive surgeons with regard to indications, most appropriate technique, choice of prosthetic, and experience with complications. METHODS A survey was mailed to 2,000 practicing surgeons. Main outcome measures included surgeon experience with biologic mesh and associated complications. RESULTS Two hundred and forty (12 %) surgeons responded to the survey. Ten were excluded, as surgeons completing the survey indicated they did not perform ventral hernia repairs or left multiple questions unanswered. Of the 230 included, 93.5 % (n = 215) of responders had experience using biologic mesh. Frequency of biologic graft use in the last year was as follows: low-volume users (<5 times in the last year) 50.7 %; medium-volume users (5-20 times in the last year) 37.3 %; high-volume users (>20 times in the last year) 11.9 %. Indications for biologic mesh use based on wound classifications (clean, clean contaminated, contaminated or dirty) were quite varied and lacked consensus among surgeons (p value < 0.05). The most commonly reported influences for use included personal experience (45 %), literature (28.3 %), and availability (17.2 %). CONCLUSIONS Despite a lack of level 1 evidence, biologic meshes are being used under various wound classifications. Importantly, use in clean and dirty-infected settings may reflect an inappropriate overuse of these expensive materials. To better guide surgeons, prospective, randomized trials should be undertaken to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes associated with these materials under the various surgical wound classifications.","Harth, K C; Krpata, D M; Chawla, A; Blatnik, J A; Halaweish, I; Rosen, M J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-1029-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23269402/,285

However, it is unclear whether associations of immunological proteins/traits with these disorders are likely to be causal, or could be explained by reverse causality/residual confounding. METHODS We used bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-variable MR (MVMR) analysis to examine evidence of causality, specificity and direction of association of 20 immunological proteins/traits (pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-12, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18; anti-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), IL-10, IL-13; chemokines: IL-8, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1); lymphoid growth-factors: soluble (s) IL-2Rα, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9; myeloid growth-factor: IL-5; acute phase protein: C-Reactive Protein (CRP); immune cells: neutrophils, lymphocytes; neurotrophic factor: brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) with schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. RESULTS Genetically-predicted IL-6 was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in univariable MR (OR=1.24; 95% C.I., 1.05-1.47) and with major depression in MVMR (OR=1.08; 95% C.I., 1.03-1.12). These results survived Bonferroni-correction. Genetically-predicted sIL-2Rα (OR=1.07; 95% C.I., 1.01-1.12) and IL-9 (OR=1.06; 95% C.I., 1.01-1.11) were associated with increased schizophrenia risk. Genetically-predicted BDNF (OR=0.97; 95% C.I., 0.94-1.00) and MCP-1 (OR=0.96; 95% C.I., 0.91-0.99) were associated with reduced schizophrenia risk. However, these findings did not survive correction for multiple testing. The CRP-schizophrenia association attenuated completely after taking into account IL-6 and sIL-2Rα in MVMR (OR=1.02; 95% C.I., 0.81-1.28). No significant associations were observed for bipolar disorder. Evidence from bidirectional MR did not support reverse causality. CONCLUSIONS We report evidence in support of potential causal associations of several immunological proteins/traits with schizophrenia, and of IL-6 with depression. Some of the findings did not survive correction for multiple testing and so replication in larger samples is required. Experimental studies are also required to further examine causality, mechanisms, and treatment potential for these immunological proteins/pathways for schizophrenia and depression.","Perry, Benjamin I; Upthegrove, Rachel; Kappelmann, Nils; Jones, Peter B; Burgess, Stephen; Khandaker, Golam M","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280516/,285

Small poultry flocks may act as a reservoir of avian and zoonotic pathogens, given the flocks' limited access to veterinary services, inadequate biosecurity practices, and increased risk of contact with wild birds. Despite these potential risks, there is a scarcity of data concerning the prevalence of poultry and zoonotic pathogens among these flocks. To assess the baseline prevalence of bacterial and viral infectious pathogens, prospective surveillance of small flock postmortem submissions to the Animal Health Laboratory was conducted over a 2-y period. With the owner's consent, a postmortem examination and pre-set tests for infectious agents were conducted. A total of 160 submissions, mainly chickens (84%), were received. Among bacterial pathogens, Brachyspira spp., Mycoplasma synoviae, Campylobacter spp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and Salmonella spp. were detected in 37%, 36%, 35%, 23%, and 3% of tested submissions, respectively.

METHODS We included all patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020 and April 10, 2020 with follow up through April 20, 2020. Patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care within 48 hours of admission were matched in a 1:2 fashion to a similar cohort who received standard of care alone. Clinical outcomes were compared between matched groups. The primary outcome was de-escalation in oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, septic shock, and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis. RESULTS Out of 77 patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care, 34% (n=26) received TCB within 48 hours of admission. One-to-two propensity matching identified 20 vs. 40 patients in the TCB and no-TCB treatment arms. In the TCB group, an improvement in oxygenation was observed in 80% (n=16) of the patients by7 days post TCB administration. After matching, there was no difference in clinical outcomes between TCB and no-TCB patients. In-hospital death: 10% vs. 8%; p=0.823, Septic Shock: 10% vs 11%, p=0.912, AKI requiring hemodialysis (10% vs. 13%; p=0.734). CONCLUSIONS Early treatment with TCB in patients admitted for COVID -19 led to an improvement in their oxygen status during hospitalization. This change however did not translate into improved survival when compared to a matched cohort with a similar clinical profile. This article is protected by copyright.

The disciplinary nature of most research activity has made it difficult to improve our understanding of interactions and feedback loops within the relevant systems. Influenced by the One Health approach, increasing efforts have recently been made to address this knowledge gap. Disease emergence and spread is strongly influenced by host density and contact structures, pathogen characteristics and pathogen population and molecular evolutionary dynamics in different host species, and host response to infection. All these mechanisms are strongly influenced by eco-social processes, such as globalization and urbanization, which lead to changes in global ecosystem dynamics, including patterns of mobility, human population density and contact structures, and food production and consumption. An improved understanding of epidemiological and eco-social processes, including their interdependence, will be essential to be able to manage diseases in these circumstances. The interfaces between wild animals, domestic animals and humans need to be examined to identify the main risk pathways and put in place appropriate mitigation. Some recent examples of emerging infectious disease are described to illustrate eco-social processes that are influencing disease emergence and spread.","Jones, Bryony A; Betson, Martha; Pfeiffer, Dirk U",Parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182016001414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609615/,285

95000,"Transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in Italy, Germany and Turkey considering social distancing, testing and quarantine.",2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND Isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus therapy is used in critically ill children to restore or maintain hemodynamic stability. However, the ideal choice of crystalloid remains to be determined. The most easily available and most frequently used crystalloid is 0.9% saline, an unbalanced crystalloid, that has been associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury (AKI). Balanced fluids such as Ringer's lactate (RL) were developed to be closer to the composition of serum. However, they are more expensive and less readily available than 0.9% saline. Few trials have found RL to be associated with more favorable outcomes, but pediatric data is limited and inconsistent. The objective of the present systematic review is to review existing literature to determine the effect of balanced versus unbalanced fluid bolus therapy on metabolic acidosis in critically ill children. METHODS Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, we will conduct a systematic review to retrieve all controlled trials and observational studies comparing balanced and unbalanced resuscitative fluids in critically ill children from age 28 days to 18 years old in any resuscitation settings. Search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced clinical research librarian. The primary outcome is the incidence and/or time to resolution of metabolic acidosis. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of hyperchloremia, AKI, duration of renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, total volume of rehydration needed per day, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and length of stay and mortality. Study screening, inclusion, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias will be performed independently by two authors. We intend to perform a meta-analysis with studies that are compatible on the basis of population and outcomes. DISCUSSION Isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus therapy is a ubiquitous treatment in resuscitation of critically ill pediatric patients and yet there is no clear recommendation to support the choice of balanced versus unbalanced fluid. The present review will summarize current available data in the literature and assess whether recommendations can be generated regarding the choice of crystalloids or otherwise identify knowledge gaps which will open the door to a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).","Lehr, Anab Rebecca; Rached-d'Astous, Soha; Parker, Melissa; McIntyre, Lauralyn; Sampson, Margaret; Hamid, Jemila; Menon, Kusum",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1109-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383009/,285

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 31 endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomies in patients with COVID-19 for the period from April 17 to June 10, 2020 (11 women and 19 men). Mean age of patients was 66.7 years (range 48-87). Tracheostomy was performed using Ciaglia (22) and Griggs (9) techniques. All procedures were carried out at the intensive care unit in elective fashion. RESULTS Tracheostomy was performed in 19.8% of ICU patients or 36.9% of all patients on mechanical ventilation within 6.5±2.5 days [min 3, max 11]. There were 22 survivors with tracheostomy (70.9%) that is comparable with survival of patients without mechanical ventilation (79.7%) and slightly higher than in patients on ventilation without tracheostomy (65.4%). No complications during the procedure were noted. CONCLUSION Endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomy is preferred for prolonged mechanical ventilation, including patients with COVID-19. The undeniable advantages of this operation are fewer intraoperative complications due to endoscopic control, and lower risk of tracheal strictures.","Starkov, Yu G; Lukich, K V; Dzhantukhanova, S V; Plotnikov, G P; Zamolodchikov, R D; Zvereva, A A",Khirurgiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/hirurgia202012116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301248/,285

By contrast, circulating Abs typically decline once the immunogen is cleared. Consequently, circulating Abs can underestimate the nature of cognate humoral immunity. On the other hand, the B(Mem) pool should provide a comprehensive picture of Ab specificities that arise over the entire course of infection. To test this hypothesis, we compared circulating Ab and B(Mem) from natural virus suppressors who control HIV-1 without therapy and maintain a relatively intact immune system. We found high frequencies of B(Mem) specific for the conserved neutralizing CD4 induced or CD4 binding site epitopes of gp120, whereas low Ab titers to these determinants were detected in contemporaneous plasma. These data suggest that plasma Ab repertoires can underestimate the breadth of humoral immunity, and analyses of B(Mem) should be included in studies correlating Ab specificity with protective immunity to HIV-1.","Guan, Yongjun; Sajadi, Mohammad M; Kamin-Lewis, Roberta; Fouts, Timothy R; Dimitrov, Anthony; Zhang, Zhixin; Redfield, Robert R; DeVico, Anthony L; Gallo, Robert C; Lewis, George K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813392106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19225108/,285

METHODS Through the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) Fetal Therapy Special Interest Group and the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet), fetal therapy centres were surveyed (September 2017-June 2018) regarding availability of fetal MMC surgical repair, patient inclusion criteria, repair techniques, number of cases, and outcome reporting. Responses were summarised on an interactive map on the ISPD website. RESULTS Forty-four of 59 centres responded (74.6%) of which 34 centres (77.1%) currently offered fetal surgery for MMC and seven centres (15.9%) were awaiting a first case after service set up. Patient inclusion criteria were similar and based on the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) trial. Five centres (14.7%) operated beyond 26 weeks' gestational age, outside the MOMS criteria. Open fetal surgery was provided in 23 centres (67.6%), fetoscopic surgery only in five (14.7%), and six centres offered both types (17.6%). Neurosurgical closure was similar for open surgery but highly variable in fetoscopy surgery. The median number of cases per centre was 21 (range 1-253). CONCLUSIONS Fetal surgery for MMC is now offered globally.

Through an appropriate combination of the momentum equation with the rheological model for Maxwell fluids, an hyperbolic partial differential equation is obtained and semi-analytically solved by using the Laplace transform method to describe the velocity field. In the solution process, different electrostatic conditions and electro-viscous stresses have to be considered in the liquid-liquid interfaces due to the transported fluids content buffer solutions based on symmetrical electrolytes. By adopting a dimensionless mathematical model for the governing and constitutive equations, certain dimensionless parameters that control the start-up of electroosmotic flow appear, as the viscosity ratios, dielectric permittivity ratios, the density ratios, the relaxation times, the electrokinetic parameters and the potential differences. In the results, it is shown that the velocity exhibits an oscillatory behavior in the transient regime as a consequence of the competition between the viscous and elastic forces; also, the flow field is affected by the electrostatic conditions at the liquid-liquid interfaces, producing steep velocity gradients, and finally, the time to reach the steady-state is strongly dependent on the relaxation times, viscosity ratios and the number of fluid layers.","Escandón, Juan; Torres, David; Hernández, Clara; Vargas, René",Micromachines,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11080757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764332/,285

School closures occurred on March 16, 2020, in 10 out of 32 Mexican states, and one week later in the remaining states. Because the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the influenza virus have similar transmission mechanisms, we aimed to evaluate the impact of physical distancing on the incidence of influenza as a proxy of the impact on SARS-CoV-2 contagion. METHODOLOGY A national flu surveillance system was cross-sectionally analyzed and daily average percent changes (APCs) of incidence rates were calculated throught Poisson regression models. RESULTS Greater decreasing trends (APCs -8.8, 95% CI: -12.5, -4.5; vs. -6.0, 95% CI: -9.9, -2.0; p = 0.026) were documented in the states with earlier school closures and across age groups, suggesting that earlier implementation of physical distance results in reduced SARS-CoV-2 spread. CONCLUSIONS Physical distancing policies decrease the incidence of influenza infections in Mexico; its favorable impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is commendable.","Murillo-Zamora, Efrén; Guzmán-Esquivel, José; Sánchez-Piña, Ramón Alberto; Cedeño-Laurent, Guillermo; Delgado-Enciso, Iván; Mendoza-Cano, Oliver",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031079/,285

Previous research has shown that three in four TGD young people have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and/or depression and almost one in two have attempted suicide. TGD young people experience barriers to traditional mental health services, commonly faced with inexperienced providers and discrimination. Video and computer games, as well as online spaces, are sources of resilience for TGD young people. Digital mental health interventions are a feasible, but understudied, approach to consider for this population. Methods N = 14 TGD young people aged 11-18 years were recruited to take part in focus groups as part of a multistage project. The focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a general inductive thematic analysis approach. This paper reports on their attitudes towards digital games and game-based digital mental health interventions. Discussion Aspects of game-based digital mental health interventions should be inclusive of diverse genders and sexuality, moderated appropriately and include content such as storylines and characters who are of diverse sexualities and/or gender. Participants were of the opinion that games should be preventative rather than treatment-focused; however, considering the high rate of mental health difficulties in this population, interventions should ideally address symptoms along the continuum from sub-clinical to clinical.","Strauss, Penelope; Morgan, Helen; Wright Toussaint, Dani; Lin, Ashleigh; Winter, Sam; Perry, Yael",Internet interventions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2019.100280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31890628/,285

This review aimed to examine the treatment gaps and challenges that burden Philippine epilepsy care. MATERIALS & METHODS Pertinent data on epidemiology, research, health financing and health systems, pharmacologic and surgical treatment options, cost of care, and workforce were obtained through a literature search and review of relevant Philippine government websites. RESULTS The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in the Philippines is 0.9%. Epilepsy research in the Philippines is low in quantity compared with the rest of Southeast Asia (SEA). Inequities in quality and quantity of healthcare services delivered to local government units (LGUs) have arisen because of devolution. Programs for epilepsy care by both government and nongovernment institutions have been implemented. Healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is still largely out-of-pocket, with only partial coverage from the public sector. There is limited access to antiseizure medications (ASMs), mainly due to cost. Epilepsy surgery is an underutilized treatment option. There are only 20 epileptologists in the Philippines, with one epileptologist for every 45,000 patients with epilepsy. In addition, epilepsy care service delivery has been further impeded by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION There is a large treatment gap in epilepsy care in the Philippines in terms of high epilepsy disease burden, socioeconomic limitations and inadequate public support, sparse clinico-epidemiologic research on epilepsy, inaccessibility of health care services and essential pharmacotherapy, underutilization of surgical options, and lack of specialists capable of rendering epilepsy care. Acknowledgment of the existence of these treatment gaps and addressing such are expected to improve the overall survival and quality of life of patients with epilepsy in the Philippines.","Moalong, Kevin Michael C; Espiritu, Adrian I; Fernandez, Marc Laurence L; Jamora, Roland Dominic G",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323340/,285

Here we find that ageing, known to negatively impact immune responses, impairs ACD in murine CD8+ T cells, and that this phenotype can be rescued by transient mTOR inhibition. Increased ACD rates in mitotic cells from aged mice restore the expansion and memory potential of their cellular progenies. Further characterization of the composition of CD8+ T cells reveals that virtual memory cells (TVM cells), which accumulate during ageing, have a unique proliferation and metabolic profile, and retain their ability to divide asymmetrically, which correlates with increased memory potential. The opposite is observed for naive CD8+ T cells from aged mice. Our data provide evidence on how ACD modulation contributes to long-term survival and function of T cells during ageing, offering new insights into how the immune system adapts to ageing.","Borsa, Mariana; Barandun, Niculò; Gräbnitz, Fabienne; Barnstorf, Isabel; Baumann, Nicolas S; Pallmer, Katharina; Baumann, Samira; Stark, Dominique; Balaz, Miroslav; Oetiker, Nathalie; Wagen, Franziska; Wolfrum, Christian; Simon, Anna Katharina; Joller, Nicole; Barral, Yves; Spörri, Roman; Oxenius, Annette",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22954-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976157/,285

Actions aimed at women's economic empowerment through income transfer programs are one of those. Still, the literature on their impact is scarce and controversial. This study attempts to shed some light on this matter assessing whether the Brazilian Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Programa Bolsa Família [PBF]) is a protective factor for psychological and physical IPV against women in families of different levels of income. This is a cross-sectional, household-based study conducted in the city of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sample comprised 807 women reporting some intimate relationship in the 12 months before the interview. Information on IPV and participation on PBF were collected through face-to-face interviews using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) and a direct question, respectively. A multigroup path analysis was applied to study the relations between PBF and psychological and physical IPV, considering confounding factors, some mediators, and moderation by income. The prevalence of both psychological and physical IPV are high, be it in the poverty and the extreme poverty income strata (psychological IPV: 66.2% and 72.7%, respectively; physical IPV: 26.2% and 40.6%, respectively). Results also showed a positive and direct association between PBF and psychological violence, yet only among families above the poverty line (β = .287, p = .001). The same could be found regarding physical violence, but the effect of PBF was indirect, mediated by psychological violence (β = .220, p = .003). Findings suggest that actions aimed at preventing IPV should go hand in hand with the PBF and, perhaps, other income transfer programs. This is even more relevant in relation to the less extreme poverty group where cash transfer may further raise conflicts and violence.","Leite, Tatiana Henriques; de Moraes, Claudia Leite; Reichenheim, Michael Eduardo; Deslandes, Suely; Salles-Costa, Rosana",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520951313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912044/,285

However, the specific regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role and molecular mechanism of histone methyltransferases G9a in lipids-induced M1 macrophage polarization in type 2 diabetes. METHODS We used saturated fatty acid palmitate to induce macrophage polarization, and performed real-time PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and CHIP assay to study the function and molecular mechanism of G9a. Additionally, we isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 187 patients with type 2 diabetes and 68 healthy individuals, and analyzed the expression level of G9a. RESULTS The palmitate treatment induced the macrophage M1 polarization, and decreased the expression of G9a. The deficiency of G9a could promote the palmitate-induced M1 macrophage polarization, whereas, over-expressing G9a notably suppressed this process. Meanwhile, we observed the regulatory role of G9a on the ER stress which could contribute to M1 macrophage. Furthermore, we identified the fatty acid transport protein CD36 as the potential target of G9a. Dependent on the methyltransferase activity, G9a could negatively regulate the expression of CD36 induced by palmitate. The CD36 inhibitor SSO could significantly attenuate the regulatory effect of G9a on M1 macrophage polarization and ER stress. Importantly, G9a was decreased, and suppressed CD36 and M1 macrophage genes in the PBMCs from individuals with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Our studies demonstrate that G9a plays critical roles in lipid-induced M1 macrophage polarization via negatively regulating CD36.","Wang, Xiuling; Chen, Shanshan; He, Jinrong; Chen, Weiqun; Ding, Yu; Huang, Juan; Huang, Jin",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069810/,285

Bioinformatics analysis showed the presence of a 5' RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) domain (LRDR), a S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding (GxGxG) motif and the KDKE tetrad of 2'-O-methyltransferase (MTase), which suggested that S4 may encode RTPase and MTase. The ORF of S4 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged fusion protein and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Biochemical analysis of recombinant p127 showed its RTPase as well as SAM-dependent guanine N(7)-and ribose 2'-O-MTase activities. A MTase assay using in vitro transcribed AmCPV S2 RNA having a 5' G*pppG end showed that guanine N(7) methylation occurred prior to the ribose 2'-O methylation to yield a m(7)GpppG/m(7)GpppGm RNA cap. Mutagenesis of the SAM-binding (GxGxG) motif (G831A) completely abolished N(7)- and 2'-O-MTase activities, indicating the importance of these residues for capping. From the kinetic analysis, the Km values of N(7)-MTase for SAM and RNA were calculated as 4.41 and 0.39 µM, respectively. These results suggested that AmCPV S4-encoded p127 catalyses RTPase and two cap methylation reactions for capping the 5' end of viral RNA.","Biswas, Poulomi; Kundu, Anirban; Ghosh, Ananta Kumar",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.069716-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25228490/,285

To our knowledge, there has not been a national population-based study in England of community prescribing of all drugs used in end-of-life care for patients with cancer. METHODS 57 632 people who died from malignant cancer in their own home or in a care home in 2017 in England were included in this study. National routinely collected data were used to examine community prescriptions dispensed for drugs for symptom control and anticipatory prescribing by key sociodemographic factors in the last 4 months of life. RESULTS 94% of people who died received drugs to control their symptoms and 65% received anticipatory prescribing.

CONCLUSIONS Most individuals who died of cancer in their own home or a care home were dispensed drugs commonly used to control symptoms at the end of life, as recommended by best-practice guidance. Lower prescribing activity was found for those who died in a care home, highlighting a potential need for improved end-of-life service planning.","Emanuel, Gabrielle; Verne, Julia; Forbes, Karen; Hounsome, Luke; Henson, Katherine E",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-002952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083319/,285

To examine the extent to which the phrases, ""COVID-19"" and ""Chinese virus"" were associated with anti-Asian sentiments.Methods. Data were collected from Twitter's Application Programming Interface, which included the hashtags ""#covid19"" or ""#chinesevirus."" We analyzed tweets from March 9 to 23, 2020, corresponding to the week before and the week after President Donald J. Trump's tweet with the phrase, ""Chinese Virus."" Our analysis focused on 1 273 141 hashtags.Results. One fifth (19.7%) of the 495 289 hashtags with #covid19 showed anti-Asian sentiment, compared with half (50.4%) of the 777 852 hashtags with #chinesevirus. When comparing the week before March 16, 2020, to the week after, there was a significantly greater increase in anti-Asian hashtags associated with #chinesevirus compared with #covid19 (P < .001).Conclusions.

The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities. The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients. In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission. Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.","Ralli, Massimo; Greco, Antonio; de Vincentiis, Marco","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320923893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347112/,285

In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.","Clarner, Tim; Janssen, Katharina; Nellessen, Lara; Stangel, Martin; Skripuletz, Thomas; Krauspe, Barbara; Hess, Franz-Martin; Denecke, Bernd; Beutner, Clara; Linnartz-Gerlach, Bettina; Neumann, Harald; Vallières, Luc; Amor, Sandra; Ohl, Kim; Tenbrock, Klaus; Beyer, Cordian; Kipp, Markus",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1401459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725102/,285

109399,Assessing the Risk of Apremilast Use for Psoriasis During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-01,"Skeletal unloading and cephalic fluid shifts in microgravity may alter the bone microvascular flow and may be associated with the 1-2% bone loss per month during spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine if lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) can prevent microgravity-induced alterations of tibial microvascular flow. Head-down tilt (HDT) simulates the cephalad fluid shift and microvascular flow responses that may occur in microgravity. We hypothesized that LBNP prevents HDT-induced increases in tibial microvascular flow. Tibial bone microvascular flow, oxygenation, and calf circumference were measured during 5 min sitting, 5 min supine, 5 min 15° HDT, and 10 min 15° HDT with 25 mmHg LBNP using photoplethysmography (PPG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP). Measurements were made simultaneously. Tibial microvascular flow increased by 36% with 5 min 15° HDT [2.2 ± 1.1 V; repeated-measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) P < 0.0001] from supine (1.4 ± 0.8 V). After 10 min of LBNP in the 15° HDT position, tibial microvascular flow returned to supine levels (1.1 ± 0.5 V; RMANOVA P < 0.001). Tibial oxygenation did not change significantly during sitting, supine, HDT, or HDT with LBNP. However, calf circumference decreased with 5 min 15° HDT (-0.7 ± 0.4 V; RMANOVA P < 0.0001) from supine (-0.5 ± 0.4 V). However, with LBNP calf circumference returned to supine levels (-0.4 ± 0.1 V; RMANOVA P = 0.002). These data establish that simulated microgravity increases tibial microvascular flow and LBNP prevents these increases. The results suggest that LBNP may provide a suitable countermeasure to normalize the bone microvascular flow during spaceflight.","Siamwala, Jamila H; Lee, Paul C; Macias, Brandon R; Hargens, Alan R",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00028.2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25930022/,285

This study examined whether self-monitoring can reduce clinic BP in patients with hypertension-related co-morbidity. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of articles published in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to January 2018. Randomised controlled trials of self-monitoring of BP were selected and individual patient data (IPD) were requested. Contributing studies were prospectively categorised by whether they examined a low/high intensity co-intervention. Change in BP and likelihood of uncontrolled BP at 12-months were examined according to number and type of hypertension-related co-morbidity in a one-stage IPD meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 22 trials were eligible, 16 of which were able to provide IPD for the primary outcome, including 6,522 (89%) participants with follow-up data. Self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic systolic BP compared to usual care at 12-month follow-up, regardless of the number of hypertension-related co-morbidities (-3.12 mmHg, [95%CI -4.78, -1.46 mmHg]; p value for interaction with number of morbidities = 0.260). Intense interventions were more effective than low-intensity interventions in patients with obesity (p<0.001 for all outcomes), and possibly stroke (p<0.004 for BP control outcome only), but this effect was not observed in patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the comparative effectiveness of the Food and Drug Administration-approved BVS versus metallic EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at longest available follow-up. METHODS The authors searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and web sources for randomized trials comparing BVS and EES. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints were target lesion failure and definite or probable stent thrombosis, respectively. RESULTS Seven trials were included: in sum, 5,583 patients were randomized to receive either the study BVS (n = 3,261) or the EES (n = 2,322). Median time of follow-up was 2 years (range 2 to 3 years). Compared with metallic EES, risk of target lesion failure (9.6% vs. 7.2%; absolute risk difference: +2.4%; risk ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.59; number needed to harm: 41; p = 0.003; I2 = 0%) and stent thrombosis (2.4% vs. 0.7%; absolute risk difference: +1.7%; risk ratio: 3.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.87 to 5.30; number needed to harm: 60; p < 0.0001; I2 = 0%) were both significantly higher with BVS.

117496,Special Issues for COVID-19 in Children and Adolescents.,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND Fluorescence videography is a promising technique for assessing bowel perfusion. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a novel concept, in which a dynamic perfusion cartogram, generated by computer analysis, is superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in a small bowel resection-anastomosis model. METHODS A small bowel ischaemic segment was created laparoscopically in 13 pigs. Animals were allocated to having anastomoses performed at either low perfusion (25 per cent; n = 7) or high perfusion (75 per cent; n = 6), as determined by FLER analysis. Capillary lactate levels were measured in blood samples obtained by serosal puncturing in the ischaemic area, resection lines and vascularized areas. Pathological inflammation scoring of the anastomosis was carried out. RESULTS Lactate levels in the ischaemic area (mean(s.d.) 5·6(2·8) mmol/l) were higher than those in resection lines at 25 per cent perfusion (3·7(1·7) mmol/l; P = 0·010) and 75 per cent perfusion (2·9(1·3) mmol/l; P < 0·001), and higher than levels in vascular zones (2·5(1·0) mmol/l; P < 0·001). Lactate levels in resection lines with 75 per cent perfusion were lower than those in lines with 25 per cent perfusion (P < 0·001), and similar to those in vascular zones (P = 0·188). Levels at resection lines with 25 per cent perfusion were higher than those in vascular zones (P = 0·001). Mean(s.d.) global inflammation scores were higher in the 25 per cent perfusion group compared with the 75 per cent perfusion group for mucosa/submucosa (2·1(0·4) versus 1·2(0·4); P = 0·003) and serosa (1·8(0·4) versus 0·8(0·8); P = 0·014). A ratio of preanastomotic lactate levels in the ischaemic area relative to the resection lines of 2 or less was predictive of a more severe inflammation score. CONCLUSION In an experimental model, FLER appeared accurate in discriminating bowel perfusion levels. Surgical relevance Clinical assessment has limited accuracy in evaluating bowel perfusion before anastomosis. Fluorescence videography estimates intestinal perfusion based on the fluorescence intensity of injected fluorophores, which is proportional to bowel vascularization. However, evaluation of fluorescence intensity remains a static and subjective measure. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a dynamic fluorescence videography technique integrating near-infrared endoscopy and specific software. The software generates a virtual perfusion cartogram based on time to peak fluorescence, which can be superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. This experimental study demonstrates the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in bowel perfusion in a survival model of laparoscopic small bowel resection-anastomosis, based on biochemical and histopathological data. It is concluded that real-time imaging of bowel perfusion is easy to use and accurate, and should be translated into clinical use.","Diana, M; Agnus, V; Halvax, P; Liu, Y-Y; Dallemagne, B; Schlagowski, A-I; Geny, B; Diemunsch, P; Lindner, V; Marescaux, J",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25627131/,285
117576,Modified Suction Apparatus to Reduce the Transmission Risk of COVID-19 among Healthcare Providers.,2020,"BACKGROUND Although current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulants (OAC) with or without antiplatelet therapy (APT) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TVAR) in patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation therapy, the optimal antithrombotic strategy remains unknown in these population. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing the outcome of OAC alone versus OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through May 2020 to identify clinical trials that investigated OAC alone versus OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with AF. From each study, we extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios of major or life threatening bleeding, stroke, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS 1 randomized controlled trial and 3 observational studies were identified, which enrolled a total of 2032 patients with AF who underwent TAVR assigned to the OAC group (n = 722) or OAC with APT group (n = 1310). Pooled analyses demonstrated the rate of major or life threatening bleeding was significantly lower in the OAC group compared to the OAC with APT group (HR [95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.54 [0.38-0.77], P = .0006]). However, the rate of stroke was similar in both groups (HR [95% CI] = 1.22 [0.80-1.87], P = .36). All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were also similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS We observed that OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with AF increased the risk of bleeding compared to OAC alone without decreasing the risk of stroke.","Yokoyama, Yujiro; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Takagi, Hisato; Kuno, Toshiki",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2020.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830088/,285

Intratumoral chemotherapy administration and local microwave ablation have been investigated in several studies. It has been previously proposed that lipiodol has the ability to modify the microenvironment matrix. In our current study we investigated this theory in BALBC mice. In total 160 BALBC mice were divided in eight groups: a) control, b) cisplatin, c) microwave, d) microwave and lipiodol, e) cisplatin and lipiodol, f) microwave and cisplatin, g) lipiodol and h) lipiodol, cisplatin and microwave. Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines (10(6)) were injected into the right back leg of each mouse. After the 8th day, when the tumor volume was about 100mm(3) the therapy application was initiated, once per week for four weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for each tumor when a mouse died or when sacrificed if they were still alive by the end of the experiment (8-Canal multifunctional spool; NORAS MRI products, Gmbh, Germany). Imaging and survival revealed efficient tumor apoptosis for the groups b,c,d,e and f. However; severe toxicity was observed in group h and no follow up was available for this group after the second week of therapy administration. Lipiodol in its current form does assist in a more efficient way the distribution of cisplatin, as the microwave apoptotic effect. Future modification of lipiodol might provide a more efficient method of therapy enhancement. Combination of drug and microwave ablation is possible and has an efficient apoptotic effect.","Hohenforst-Schmidt, Wolfgang; Zarogoulidis, Paul; Stopek, Joshua; Kosmidis, Efstratios; Vogl, Thomas; Linsmeier, Bernd; Tsakiridis, Kosmas; Lampaki, Sofia; Lazaridis, George; Mpakas, Andreas; Browning, Robert; Papaiwannou, Antonis; Drevelegas, Antonis; Baka, Sofia; Karavasilis, Vasilis; Mpoukovinas, Ioannis; Turner, J Francis; Zarogoulidis, Konstantinos; Brachmann, Johannes",Journal of Cancer,https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.10970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25663938/,285
118386,Elective Surgery during the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020-10-29,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A challenge for HCV vaccine development is to identify conserved epitopes able to elicit protective antibodies against this highly diverse virus. Glycan shielding is a mechanism by which HCV masks such epitopes on its E2 envelope glycoprotein. Antibodies to the E2 region comprising residues 412-423 (E2(412-423)) have broadly neutralizing activities. However, an adaptive mutation in this linear epitope, N417S, is associated with a glycosylation shift from Asn-417 to Asn-415 that enables HCV to escape neutralization by mAbs such as HCV1 and AP33. By contrast, the human mAb HC33.1 can neutralize virus bearing the N417S mutation. To understand how HC33.1 penetrates the glycan shield created by the glycosylation shift to Asn-415, we determined the structure of this broadly neutralizing mAb in complex with its E2(412-423) epitope to 2.0 Å resolution. The conformation of E2(412-423) bound to HC33.1 is distinct from the β-hairpin conformation of this peptide bound to HCV1 or AP33, because of disruption of the β-hairpin through interactions with the unusually long complementarity-determining region 3 of the HC33.1 heavy chain. Whereas Asn-415 is buried by HCV1 and AP33, it is solvent-exposed in the HC33.1-E2(412-423) complex, such that glycosylation of Asn-415 would not prevent antibody binding. Furthermore, our results highlight the structural flexibility of the E2(412-423) epitope, which may serve as an immune evasion strategy to impede induction of antibodies targeting this site by reducing its antigenicity.","Li, Yili; Pierce, Brian G; Wang, Qian; Keck, Zhen-Yong; Fuerst, Thomas R; Foung, Steven K H; Mariuzza, Roy A",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.643528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25737449/,285

We propose a method to enhance processing large amounts of collected samples.

To illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method, we carry out numerical tests for actual scenarios under various test conditions. Applying the proposed method allows testing many more patients using the same number of testing tubes, where all positives are identified with no false negatives, and no need for independent testing, and the effective testing time can be reduced drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high.","Kadri, Usama",Health systems,https://doi.org/10.1080/20476965.2020.1817801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763226/,285

Fourteen informal caregivers were interviewed; 64% were women and the median age was 55 years. Informal caregivers assessed patients' anxiety as moderate to severe and identified a negative impact of anxiety on physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions of the patients' lives. They indicated a variety of expressions of anxiety and mentioned physical and mental deterioration as an important source of anxiety. Informal caregivers recognized patients' needs as having a safe environment, presence of people around, and a sense of control over the situation. Although the patients' perspective is the gold standard, informal caregivers can be a valuable source of information in identifying anxiety and providing personalized support. Therefore, informal caregivers should be more involved in the care for anxious patients to improve early recognition of anxiety and to ameliorate anxiety management for this vulnerable patient population.","Duijn, Jette M; Zweers, Danielle; Kars, Marijke C; de Graeff, Alexander; Teunissen, Saskia C C M",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633096/,285

The mathematical model considers the existence of various sub-populations, including humans who are susceptible to the disease, asymptomatic humans, infected humans and recovered or quarantined individuals. Various mechanisms of propagation are considered in order to describe the propagation phenomenon accurately. METHODS We propose a stochastic extension of the deterministic model, considering a random component which follows a Brownian motion. In view of the difficulties to solve the system exactly, we propose a computational model to approximate its solutions following a nonstandard approach. RESULTS The nonstandard discretization is fully analyzed for positivity, boundedness and stability. It is worth pointing out that these properties are realized in the discrete scenario and that they are thoroughly established herein using rigorous mathematical arguments. We provide some illustrative computational simulations to exhibit the main computational features of this approach. CONCLUSIONS The results show that the nonstandard technique is capable of preserving the distinctive characteristics of the epidemiologically relevant solutions of the model, while other (classical) approaches are not able to do it. For the sake of convenience, a computational code of the nonstandard discrete model may be provided to the readers at their requests.","Macías-Díaz, J E; Raza, Ali; Ahmed, Nauman; Rafiq, Muhammad",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813059/,285

Intrinsic to this mandate is the need to train physicians to practice in rural, often underserviced, communities. To this end, social accountability language has been incorporated into medical school mission and vision statements1 , but the reality is that, despite improvement, the end goal of supplying rural areas with an adequate number of physicians has remained unfulfilled. The problem, in large part, is driven by the movement of populations from rural to urban areas and the attractiveness of cities for work and leisure. However, medical school policies, curriculum and the legacies of a centralized medical education system also play a significant role in the challenge of developing a sustainable community of rural practitioners.","Jattan, Aaron; Penner, Charles",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481260/,285

Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is a new biomarker for intrahepatic templates for HBV replication. AIM To explore whether a high HBcrAg level is associated with increased risk of cirrhosis, especially in patients with intermediate viral load (HBV DNA 2000-19 999 IU/mL) due to their moderate risk of disease progression. METHODS A total of 1673 treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients with negative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level <40 U/L at baseline were enrolled. We explored the relationship between baseline levels of HBcrAg and cirrhosis development in all patients, and whether a higher HBcrAg level (<10 vs ≥10 KU/mL) was associated with an increased risk of disease progression in those with intermediate viral load. RESULTS Of the 1673 patients, 104 developed cirrhosis after a mean follow-up of 15.9 years. Higher HBcrAg levels were associated with increased incidence of cirrhosis, cirrhosis-related complications, and liver-related death. In 445 patients with intermediate viral load, the cirrhosis risk stratified by HBcrAg level of 10 KU/mL yielded a hazard ratio of 3.22 (95% CI: 1.61-6.47). The risk stratification remained significant when exploring other pre-cirrhosis endpoints, including HBeAg-negative hepatitis, hepatitis flare, and HBV DNA >20 000 IU/mL after 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In HBeAg-negative patients with normal ALT levels, higher HBcrAg levels are associated with increased risk of cirrhosis. Among those with intermediate viral load, HBcrAg <10 KU/mL defines a low-risk group for disease progression.","Tseng, Tai-Chung; Liu, Chun-Jen; Yang, Wan-Ting; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Hong, Chun-Ming; Su, Tung-Hung; Tsai, Cheng-Hsueh; Chen, Chi-Ling; Yang, Hung-Chih; Liu, Chen-Hua; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Chen, Pei-Jer; Kao, Jia-Horng",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465271/,285

Commercially available molds offer minimal capabilities for adaptation to unique conditions or applications versus those for which they are specifically designed. Here we describe a replica molding method for the design and fabrication of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from laser-etched acrylic negative masters with ∼0.2 mm resolution. Examples of the variety of mold shapes, sizes, and patterns obtained from laser-etched designs are provided. We use the patterned PDMS molds for producing and culturing engineered cardiac tissues with cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that tight control over tissue morphology and anisotropy results in modulation of cell alignment and tissue-level conduction properties, including the appearance and elimination of reentrant arrhythmias, or circular electrical activation patterns. Techniques for handling engineered cardiac tissues during implantation in vivo in a rat model of myocardial infarction have been developed and are presented herein to facilitate development and adoption of surgical techniques for use with hydrogel-based engineered tissues.

In contrast to usual therapeutic plasma, the therapeutic agents of convalescent plasma do not represent clotting factor activities, but immunoglobulins. Quarantine storage of convalescent plasma as a measure to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission is not feasible. Therefore, pathogen inactivation (e.g., Theraflex®-MB, Macopharma, Mouvaux, France) is an attractive option. Data on the impact of pathogen inactivation by methylene blue (MB) treatment on antibody integrity are sparse. Methods Antigen-specific binding capacity was tested before and after MB treatment of plasma (n = 10). IgG and IgM isoagglutinin titers were tested by agglutination in increasing dilutions. Furthermore, the binding of anti-EBV and anti-tetanus toxin IgG to their specific antigens was assessed by ELISA, and IgG binding to Fc receptors was assessed by flow cytometry using THP-1 cells expressing FcRI and FcRII. Results There was no significant difference in the isoagglutinin titers, the antigen binding capacity of anti-EBV and anti-tetanus toxin IgG, as well as the Fc receptor binding capacity before and after MB treatment of plasma. Conclusion MB treatment of plasma does not inhibit the binding capacity of IgM and IgG to their epitopes, or the Fc receptor interaction of IgG. Based on these results, MB treatment of convalescent plasma is appropriate to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission if quarantine storage is omitted.","Raster, Johannes; Zimmermann, Kathrin; Wesche, Jan; Aurich, Konstanze; Greinacher, Andreas; Selleng, Kathleen",Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177418/,285
123649,Review of the published literature to characterise clinical excellence in COVID-19 care.,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND Elevated cardiac troponin, which indicates cardiomyocyte injury, is common after acute ischemic stroke and is associated with poor functional outcome. Myocardial injury is part of a broad spectrum of cardiac complications that may occur after acute ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that in most patients, the underlying mechanism of stroke-associated myocardial injury may not be a concomitant acute coronary syndrome. Evidence from animal research and clinical and neuroimaging studies suggest that functional and structural alterations in the central autonomic network leading to stress-mediated neurocardiogenic injury may be a key underlying mechanism (ie, stroke-heart syndrome). However, the exact pathophysiological cascade remains unclear, and the diagnostic and therapeutic implications are unknown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this CORONA-IS (Cardiomyocyte injury following Acute Ischemic Stroke) study is to quantify autonomic dysfunction and to decipher downstream cardiac mechanisms leading to myocardial injury after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS In this prospective, observational, single-center cohort study, 300 patients with acute ischemic stroke, confirmed via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset, will be recruited during in-hospital stay. On the basis of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels and corresponding to the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, 3 groups are defined (ie, no myocardial injury [no cardiac troponin elevation], chronic myocardial injury [stable elevation], and acute myocardial injury [dynamic rise/fall pattern]). Each group will include approximately 100 patients. Study patients will receive routine diagnostic care. In addition, they will receive 3 Tesla cardiovascular MRI and transthoracic echocardiography within 5 days of symptom onset to provide myocardial tissue characterization and assess cardiac function, 20-min high-resolution electrocardiogram for analysis of cardiac autonomic function, and extensive biobanking. A follow-up for cardiovascular events will be conducted 3 and 12 months after inclusion. RESULTS After a 4-month pilot phase, recruitment began in April 2019. We estimate a recruitment period of approximately 3 years to include 300 patients with a complete cardiovascular MRI protocol. CONCLUSIONS Stroke-associated myocardial injury is a common and relevant complication. Our study has the potential to provide a better mechanistic understanding of heart and brain interactions in the setting of acute stroke. Thus, it is essential to develop algorithms for recognizing patients at risk and to refine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

We sought to determine the impact of baseline anemia on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cessation patterns ≤2 years after PCI and the subsequent risk of clinical adverse events. METHODS AND RESULTS PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) was a prospective multicenter observational registry of PCI-treated patients (n=5018). Anemia was defined as baseline Hb (hemoglobin) <12 g/dL for men and <11 g/dL for women. DAPT cessation modes included physician-recommended discontinuation, temporary interruption (≤14 days), and disruption due to bleeding or noncompliance. The primary end point was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. We identified 824 (18%) anemic and 4194 (82%) nonanemic patients. Anemic patients were older and had a higher rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior PCI. DAPT interruption and disruption were significantly more common in anemic patients throughout 2 years after PCI, whereas physician-recommended discontinuation occurred more often in anemic patients during the first year after PCI and in nonanemic patients during the second year. The 2-year adjusted risks of MACE and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding events were significantly higher in anemic patients. Compared with uninterrupted DAPT, disruption, but not interruption and physician-recommended discontinuation, was associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in nonanemic patients and a higher risk of both myocardial infarction and MACE in anemic patients. There was no significant interaction between anemia and risk of clinical outcomes associated with each DAPT cessation mode. CONCLUSIONS Baseline anemia was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of MACE and major bleeding. Physicians more frequently recommend DAPT discontinuation to anemic patients during the first year, and to nonanemic patients during the second year after PCI. DAPT disruption was associated with a higher risk of MACE outcomes.","Faggioni, Michela; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Cohen, David J; Henry, Timothy D; Claessen, Bimmer E; Dangas, George D; Gibson, C Michael; Krucoff, Mitchell W; Vogel, Birgit; Moliterno, David J; Sorrentino, Sabato; Colombo, Antonio; Chieffo, Alaide; Kini, Annapoorna; Farhan, Serdar; Ariti, Cono; Witzenbichler, Bernard; Weisz, Giora; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Pocock, Stuart; Mehran, Roxana",Circulation.

OBJECTIVE To determine safety and efficacy of NOT based on current literature. DATA SOURCES Three electronic databases. STUDY SELECTION All articles reporting NOT for AUA in children. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently verified study inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS Ten articles reporting 413 children receiving NOT were included. Six, including 1 randomized controlled trial, compared NOT with appendectomy. The remaining 4 reported outcomes of children receiving NOT without a comparison group. NOT was effective as the initial treatment in 97% of children (95% confidence interval [CI] 96% to 99%). Initial length of hospital stay was shorter in children treated with appendectomy compared with NOT (mean difference 0.5 days [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8]; P = .002). At final reported follow-up (range 8 weeks to 4 years), NOT remained effective (no appendectomy performed) in 82% of children (95% CI 77% to 87%). Recurrent appendicitis occurred in 14% (95% CI 7% to 21%). Complications and total length of hospital stay during follow-up were similar for NOT and appendectomy. No serious adverse events related to NOT were reported. LIMITATIONS The lack of prospective randomized studies limits definitive conclusions to influence clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS Current data suggest that NOT is safe. It appears effective as initial treatment in 97% of children with AUA, and the rate of recurrent appendicitis is 14%. Longer-term clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of NOT compared with appendicectomy require further evaluation, preferably in large randomized trials, to reliably inform decision-making.","Georgiou, Roxani; Eaton, Simon; Stanton, Michael P; Pierro, Agostino; Hall, Nigel J",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-3003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213607/,285

The studies, irrespective of design or language, were included. The overall pooled frequency of various symptoms was estimated. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. Results Eleven studies, including 1,325 patients, were included in the pooled analysis. The pooled estimates for clinical presentation were; fever: 67.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.38-83.88), cough: 59.58% (95% CI, 45.01-72.63), diarrhea: 27.26% (95% CI, 19.51-36.69), running nose: 27% (95% CI, 15.26-43.19) and dyspnea: 25.29% (95% CI, 18.52-33.52). The pooled prevalence rates for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting were 13.08% (95% CI, 9.24-18.19), 10.08% (95% CI, 5.84-16.85) and 8.80% (95% CI, 4.43-16.70) per 100 population, respectively. Conclusions The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in IBD patients is similar to the general population.","Singh, Anupam K; Jena, Anuraag; Kumar-M, Praveen; Jha, Daya Krishna; Sharma, Vishal",Intestinal research,https://doi.org/10.5217/ir.2020.00108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440918/,285

We sought to determine whether COVID-19 affected the treatment and prognosis of hemorrhagic stroke in a regional medical center in mainland China. METHODS Patients with hemorrhagic stroke admitted in the Neurosurgery Department of West China Hospital from January 24, 2020, to March 25, 2020 (COVID-19 period), and from January 24, 2019, to March 25, 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period), were identified. Clinical characteristics, hospital arrival to neurosurgery department arrival time (door-to-department time), reporting rate of pneumonia and 3-month mRS (outcome) were compared. RESULTS A total of 224 patients in the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with 126 patients in the COVID-19 period. Milder stroke severity was observed in the COVID-19 period (NIHSS 6 [2-20] vs. 3 [2-15], p = 0.005). The median door-to-department time in the COVID-19 period was approximately 50 minutes longer than that in the pre-COVID-19 period (96.5 [70.3-193.3] vs. 144.5 [93.8-504.5], p = 0.000). A higher rate of pneumonia complications was reported in the COVID-19 period (40.6% vs. 60.7%, p = 0.000). In patients with moderate hemorrhagic stroke, the percentage of good outcomes (mRS < 3) in the pre-COVID-19 period was much higher than that in the COVID-19 period (53.1% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 may have several impacts on the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke and may influence the clinical outcomes of specific patients. Improvements in the treatment process for patients with moderate stroke may help to improve the overall outcome of hemorrhagic stroke during COVID-19.","Chen, Yuqi; Xia, Fan; Li, Yunke; Li, Hao; Ma, Lu; Hu, Xin; You, Chao",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338705/,285

However, some of its potential has yet to be realized, particularly in the area of bilayer patterning and phase/composition heterogeneity. In this work, we generate contiguous bilayer patterns as a model system that captures the general features of membrane domains and lipid rafts. Micropatterned polymer templates of two types are investigated for generating patterned bilayer formation: polymer blotting and polymer lift-off stenciling. While these approaches have been used previously to create bilayer arrays by corralling bilayers patches with various types of boundaries impenetrable to bilayer diffusion, unique to the methods presented here, there are no physical barriers to diffusion. In this work, interfaces between contiguous lipid phases define the pattern shapes, with continuity between them allowing transfer of membrane-bound biomolecules between the phases. We examine effectors of membrane domain stability including temperature and cholesterol content to investigate domain dynamics. Contiguous patterning of supported bilayers as a model of lipid rafts expands the application of the SLB to an area with current appeal and brings with it a useful toolset for characterization and analysis. These combined tools should be helpful to researchers investigating lipid raft dynamics and function and biomolecule partitioning studies. Additionally, this patterning technique may be useful for applications such as bioseparations that exploit differences in lipid phase partitioning or creation of membranes that bind species like viruses preferentially at lipid phase boundaries, to name a few.","Richards, Mark J; Daniel, Susan",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b04385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28092950/,285

The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the parents of pediatric patients about dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic through a questionnaire. MATERIALS AND METHODS A structured questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions and demographic information about the knowledge and attitudes of parents regarding dental treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak was used for the study. The participants were parents of pediatric patients (aged 8-14 years) who visited for a routine orthodontic examination at the department of orthodontics. RESULTS A total of 250 participants responded to the questionnaire. The findings indicate that more than 95% of parents had information about the transmission paths of the virus, took COVID-19 seriously, and told their children about this disease. 34% of the parents thought that dental clinics were more dangerous than other social areas, and 39.2% thought their children could be infected by medical instruments during dental treatment. A statistically significant difference was observed between educational levels in the answers given about the transmission paths of the virus, the danger of dental clinics in terms of the virus, the permitted dental treatment procedures, and the personal protective equipment of the dentist (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Although most parents have information about COVID-19, there are differences in the knowledge and attitudes of parents during the pandemic period according to their educational level.","Surme, Koray; Akman, Hayri; Cime Akbaydogan, Leyla; Akin, Mehmet",Oral health & preventive dentistry,https://doi.org/10.3290/j.ohpd.b1248969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881290/,285
126142,Evaluating the performance of high-sensitivity troponin-T in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-09-23,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This article provides a practical approach to acute vestibular syndrome while highlighting recent research advances. RECENT FINDINGS Acute vestibular syndrome is defined as sudden-onset, continuous vertigo lasting longer than 24 hours with associated nausea and vomiting, all of which are worsened with head movement. Acute vestibular syndrome is provoked by a variety of central and peripheral causes, the most common of which are vestibular neuritis and acute stroke (posterior circulation). A clinical approach focusing on timing, associated history, and ocular motor findings can improve diagnostic accuracy and is more sensitive and specific than early neuroimaging. Because of the shared neurovascular supply, both peripheral and central vestibular disorders can manifest overlapping signs previously considered solely peripheral or central, including vertical skew, nystagmus, abnormal vestibular ocular reflex, hearing loss, and gait instability. Although acute vestibular syndrome is typically benign, stroke should be considered in every person with acute vestibular syndrome because it can act as a harbinger of stroke or impending cerebellar herniation. Treatment is focused on physical therapy because the evidence is minimal for the long-term use of medication. SUMMARY The diagnosis of acute vestibular syndrome first requires the elimination of common medical causes for dizziness. Next, underlying pathology must be determined by distinguishing between the most common causes of acute vestibular syndrome: central and peripheral vestibular disorders. Central vestibular disorders are most often the result of ischemic stroke affecting the cerebellar arteries. Peripheral vestibular disorders are assumed to be caused mostly by inflammatory sources, but ischemia of the peripheral vestibular apparatus may be underappreciated. By using the HINTS Plus (Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew with Plus referring to hearing loss assessment) examination in addition to a comprehensive neurologic examination, strokes are unlikely to be missed. For nearly all acute vestibular disorders, vestibular physical therapy contributes to recovery.","Steenerson, Kristen K",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000000958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351112/,285

Conventional oxygen therapy and awake proning are options, but the use of high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure are controversial. There is an urgent need for effective rescue therapies. Our aim is to evaluate the role of inhaled nitric oxide 160 ppm as a possible rescue therapy in nonintubated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Design Retrospective evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients in respiratory distress receiving nitric oxide gas as rescue therapy. Setting Massachusetts General Hospital, between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, during the local coronavirus disease 2019 surge. Patients Coronavirus disease 2019 patients at high risk for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with worsening symptoms despite use of supplemental oxygen and/or awake proning. Interventions Patients received nitric oxide at concentrations of 160 ppm for 30 minutes twice per day via a face mask until resolution of symptoms, discharge, intubation, or the transition to comfort measures only. Measurements and Main Results Between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, five patients received nitric oxide inhalation as a rescue therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 at Massachusetts General Hospital. All received at least one dosage. The three patients that received multiple treatments (ranging from five to nine) survived and were discharged home. Maximum methemoglobin concentration after 30 minutes of breathing nitric oxide was 2.0% (1.7-2.3%). Nitrogen dioxide was below 2 ppm. No changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate were observed during or after nitric oxide treatment. Oxygenation and the respiratory rate remained stable during and after nitric oxide treatments. For two patients, inflammatory marker data were available and demonstrate a reduction or a cessation of escalation after nitric oxide treatment. Conclusions Nitric oxide at 160 ppm may be an effective adjuvant rescue therapy for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Wiegand, Steffen B; Safaee Fakhr, Bijan; Carroll, Ryan W; Zapol, Warren M; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Critical care explorations,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225304/,285

Despite this, research on the independent effect of psychological violence on mental health is scarce. Moreover, the lack of a clear and consistent definition of psychological violence has made results difficult to compare. The present study therefore aims to consolidate knowledge on psychological violence by conducting a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis on the association between psychological violence and mental health problems, when controlling for other types of violence (e.g. physical and sexual) and taking into account severity, frequency, and duration of psychological violence. METHOD The present study is registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; #CRD42018116026) and the study design follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Additional file 1). A dual search will be conducted in the electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data will be extracted using Endnote and Covidence and a meta-analysis will be conducted using Metafor-package in the programming language R. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project will be used to assess the quality of the included studies (i.e. weak, moderate and strong).

127763,"A Trio of Risk Factors for Childhood Sexual Abuse: Investigating Exposure to Parental Domestic Violence, Parental Addiction, and Parental Mental Illness as Correlates of Childhood Sexual Abuse.",2020-08-24,"INTRODUCTION Single-port laparoscopy (SPL) employs a 1.5- to 2.5-cm incision at the umbilicus for the placement of a single working port. We hypothesized that the longer incision created by SPL compared with multiport laparoscopy may increase the incidence of trocar-site hernias. We examined our experience with SPL in bariatric operations. METHODS There were 734 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures performed at our institution between 2001 and 2011. Fifty-eight patients were lost to follow-up or had a short duration of follow-up (<1 month). Of the remaining 676 cases, 163 were performed via SPL. All laparoscopic wounds created by trocar size greater than 12 mm were closed with absorbable suture. RESULTS Patient demographics of the SPL group and the multiport group were similar in terms of age, gender, and comorbidities. The average body mass index (BMI) of the SPL group was lower than the multiport group (43.5 ± 5.3 vs. 45.8 ± 7.7, p < 0.01). The mean follow-up for the SPL group was 11 months versus 24 months for the multiport group. There were three trocar-site hernias out of 513 cases in the multiport compared to one hernia out of 163 cases in the SPL group (0.6 vs. 0.6 %, p = 0.967). All trocar-site hernias occurred at the 15-mm port site. The median time to hernia occurrence for the multiport group was 13 months (range, 1-18). In the SPL group, the hernia occurred at 8 months. On multivariate analysis, age, BMI, SPL, procedure type, and the postoperative weight loss were not associated with the development of trocar-site hernias. CONCLUSIONS SPL did not increase the rate of trocar-site hernia in this series. A low rate of trocar-site hernia can be achieved with the use of SPL in bariatric surgery.","Lee, David Y; Rehmani, Sadiq S; Guend, Hamza; Park, Koji; Ross, Ronald E; Alkhalifa, Mohammed; McGinty, James J; Teixeira, Julio A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2597-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23232997/,285

Immunoassays are traditionally used to quantify endogenous proteins in these samples but require a separate assay for each protein. Recently, targeted mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed for generating highly-multiplexed assays for biomarker proteins in DBS samples. In this work, we report the first comparison of proteins in whole blood and DBS samples using an untargeted MS approach. The average number of proteins identified in undepleted whole blood and DBS samples by liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS was 223 and 253, respectively. Protein identification repeatability was between 77%-92% within replicates and the majority of these repeated proteins (70%) were observed in both sample formats. Proteins exclusively identified in the liquid or dried fluid spot format were unbiased based on their molecular weight, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, and grand average hydrophobicity. In addition, we extended this comparison to include proteins in matching plasma and serum samples with their dried fluid spot equivalents, dried plasma spot (DPS), and dried serum spot (DSS). This work begins to define the accessibility of endogenous proteins in dried fluid spot samples for analysis by MS and is useful in evaluating the scope of this new approach.","Chambers, Andrew G; Percy, Andrew J; Hardie, Darryl B; Borchers, Christoph H",Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13361-013-0678-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821375/,285

The objective of this work was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on liver resection for metastatic melanoma. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched (1990 to December 2012). Studies with at least ten patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic melanoma were included. Data on the outcomes of overall survival (OS) and/or disease-free survival (DFS) were abstracted and synthesized. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived from survival curves and subjected to meta-analysis using random-effects models. RESULTS Twenty-two studies involving 579 patients (13 per cent weighted resection rate) who underwent liver resection were included. Study quality was poor to moderate. Median follow-up ranged from 9 to 59 months. Median DFS ranged from 8 to 23 months, and median OS ranged from 14 to 41 months (R0, 22-66 months, R2, 10-16 months; R0 versus R1/R2: HR 0.52, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.37 to 0.73). The OS rate was 56-100 per cent at 1 year, 34-53 per cent at 3 years and 11-36 per cent at 5 years. Median OS with non-operative management ranged from 4 to 12 months. Comparison of OS with resection and non-operative management favoured resection (HR 0.32, 95 per cent c.i. 0.22 to 0.46). CONCLUSION Radical resection of liver metastases from melanoma appears to improve overall survival compared with non-operative management or incomplete resection, but this observation requires future confirmation as selection bias may have confounded the results.","Aubin, J-M; Rekman, J; Vandenbroucke-Menu, F; Lapointe, R; Fairfull-Smith, R J; Mimeault, R; Balaa, F K; Martel, G",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775340/,285
131542,COVID-19 and Adolescent Depression and Suicide Risk Screening Outcomes.,2021-06-17,"PURPOSE To evaluate changes in cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) after spinal anesthesia and compare the changes in rSO2 and systemic oxygenation between dexmedetomidine sedation and propofol sedation. METHODS Thirty-six patients scheduled to undergo transurethral surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine (n = 18) and propofol groups (n = 18). We used near-infrared spectroscopy sensors to measure rSO2, and obtained data from each side were averaged. After oxygen insufflation, baseline measurements of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, rSO2, pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2), bispectral index, and body temperature were made. After spinal anesthesia, we measured these parameters every 5 min. Twenty minutes after spinal injection, dexmedetomidine or propofol administration was started. We measured each parameter at 10, 25, and 40 min after the administration of dexmedetomidine or propofol. RESULTS The baseline rSO2 in the dexmedetomidine group was 71.3 ± 7.3%, and that in the propofol group was 71.8 ± 5.6%. After spinal anesthesia, rSO2 in both groups decreased significantly (dexmedetomidine group: 65.4 ± 6.9%; propofol group: 64.3 ± 7.4%). After administering sedatives, rSO2 was equivalent after spinal anesthesia. rSO2 was comparable between the two groups. MAP and SpO2 were significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group. CONCLUSION Spinal anesthesia decreased rSO2; however, the decline was not severe. Dexmedetomidine and propofol did not compromise cerebral oxygenation under spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, MAP and SpO2 were more stable in dexmedetomidine sedation than in propofol sedation. Dexmedetomidine may be suitable for spinal anesthesia.","Kumakura, Yasutomo; Ishiyama, Tadahiko; Matsuoka, Toru; Iijima, Tetsuya; Matsukawa, Takashi",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02816-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32556601/,285

IVIg may cause systemic adverse events (AEs); therefore, infusion of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) may be preferred by some patients. Here, we document experiences of patients transitioning from IVIg to SCIg. METHODS Transitioning subjects with CIDP were followed in a 6-month prospective, open-label study. Primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects who withdrew for any reason (including significant AEs). Secondary endpoint was symptom progression or relapse requiring a change in management. Quality of life (QOL) and treatment satisfaction were assessed using the Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), and Chronic Acquired Polyneuropathy Patient-Reported Index (CAP-PRI). Efficacy was assessed using the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS), hand-held dynamometry (HHD), limb motor strength testing (LMST), and timed 25-ft walk (T25-FW). RESULTS Fifteen CIDP subjects transitioned from IVIg to SCIg. Of these, three (20%) met the primary endpoint and one (7%) met the secondary endpoint. The SF-36 showed a statistically significant improvement for the role limitations physical domain after 24 weeks (p = 0.03) with no significant differences observed in other domains. TSQM and CAP-PRI showed significant differences in favor of SCIg (p = 0.003 and 0.02, respectively). No significant differences were observed in efficacy after 24 weeks, except for LMST which favored SCIg (p = 0.003). Eight of the 12 study completers (67%) continued with SCIg.

131825,Reasons to avoid vitamin D deficiency during COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-28,"INTRODUCTION Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer worldwide. In 2009 in China, the incidence and death rate of oesophageal cancer was 22.14 per 100 000 person-years and 16.77 per 100 000 person-years, respectively, the highest in the world. Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) was introduced into clinical practice with the aim of reducing the morbidity rate. The mechanisms of MIO may lie in minimising the reaction to surgical injury and inflammation. There are some randomised trials regarding minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy, with 100-850 subjects enrolled. To date, no large randomised controlled trial comparing minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy has been reported in China, where squamous cell carcinoma predominated over adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a 3 year multicentre, prospective, randomised, open and parallel controlled trial, which aims to compare the effectiveness of minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy to open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy for resectable oesophageal cancer. Group A patients receive MIO which involves thoracoscopic oesophagectomy and laparoscopic gastric mobilisation with cervical anastomosis. Group B patients receive the open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy which involves a right thoracotomy and laparotomy with cervical anastomosis. Primary endpoints include respiratory complications within 30 days after operation. The secondary endpoints include other postoperative complications, influences on pulmonary function, intraoperative data including blood loss, operative time, the number and location of lymph nodes dissected, and mortality in hospital, the length of hospital stay, total expenses in hospital, mortality within 30 days, survival rate after 2 years, postoperative pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

An interprofessional group of ED providers led optional, nightly debriefings using a web-based portal to connect with ED clinicians for six weeks. In total, 81 interprofessional staff participated in nightly debriefings with a 47% attendance rate. On average, three participants attended the BRIEF nightly (range = 2-8) to discuss the challenges of social distancing, scarce resources, high acuity, clinician burnout and mental health. Participation increased as rates of COVID-19 positive patients rose. Debriefing leaders provided ED leadership with summaries of clinician experiences and suggestions for improvements. Feedback supported quality improvement initiatives within the ED and greater mental health support for staff. Clinicians and administrators provided positive feedback regarding the program's impact on clinician morale, and clinical processes that promoted the safety and quality of patient care. Optional debriefing with receptive departmental leadership may be a successful tool to support clinicians and hospitals during critical events.","Azizoddin, Desiree R; Vella Gray, Kristen; Dundin, Andrew; Szyld, Demian",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1813697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990108/,285
132744,Rising to the Occasion During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-01,"Quercetin is a flavonoid abundantly found in fruits and vegetables. It possesses a wide spectrum of biological activities, thus suggesting a role in disease prevention and health promotion. The present review aimed to uncover the bone-sparing effects of quercetin and its mechanism of action. Animal studies have found that the action of quercetin on bone is largely protective, with a small number of studies reporting negative outcomes. Quercetin was shown to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, osteoblast apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response while promoting osteogenesis, angiogenesis, antioxidant expression, adipocyte apoptosis and osteoclast apoptosis. The possible underlying mechanisms involved are regulation of Wnt, NF-κB, Nrf2, SMAD-dependent, and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. On the other hand, quercetin was shown to exert complex and competing actions on the MAPK signalling pathway to orchestrate bone metabolism, resulting in both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on bone in parallel. The overall interaction is believed to result in a positive effect on bone. Considering the important contributions of quercetin in regulating bone homeostasis, it may be considered an economical and promising agent for improving bone health. The documented preclinical findings await further validation from human clinical trials.","Wong, Sok Kuan; Chin, Kok-Yong; Ima-Nirwana, Soelaiman",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899435/,285

Two analogues (9 and 57 atoms) were selected as precursors for the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of DOTA-conjugated dimeric [Tyr3]octreotate analogues for tumor targeting. These compounds were synthesized by using a two-stage click ligation procedure: a Cu(I) -catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (""copper-click"" reaction) and a thio acid/sulfonyl azide amidation (""sulfo-click"" reaction). The IC(50) values of these DOTA-conjugated [Tyr3]octreotate analogues were comparable, and internalization studies showed that the nine-atom (111) In-DOTA-labeled [Tyr3]octreotate dimer had rapid and high receptor binding. Biodistribution studies with BALB/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous AR42J tumors showed that the (111) In-labeled [Tyr3]octreotate dimer (nine atoms) had a high tumor uptake at 1 h p.i. (38.8 ± 8.3 % ID g(-1) ), and excellent tumor retention at 4 h p.i. (40.9 ± 2.5 % ID g(-1) ). However, the introduction of the extended hydrophilic 57 atoms spacer led to rapid clearance from the circulation; this limited tumor accumulation of the radiotracer (21.4 ± 4.9 % ID g(-1) at 1 h p.i.). These findings provide important insight on dimerization and spacer effects on the in vivo properties of DOTA-conjugated [Tyr3]octreotate dimers.","Yim, Cheng-Bin; van der Wildt, Berend; Dijkgraaf, Ingrid; Joosten, Lieke; Eek, Annemarie; Versluis, Cees; Rijkers, Dirk T S; Boerman, Otto C; Liskamp, Rob M J",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.201000639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21328514/,285
133570,Radiographic features of COVID-19 based on an initial cohort of 96 patients in Singapore.,2020-09-21,"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases are increasing rapidly worldwide. Similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome where cardiovascular diseases were present in nearly 30% of cases, the increased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities remains true for COVID-19 as well. The mechanism of this association remains unclear at this time. Therefore, we reviewed the available literature and tried to find the probable association between cardiovascular disease with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS We searched Medline (via PubMed) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published until Sept 5, 2020. Nineteen articles were included involving 6,872 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS The random-effect meta-analysis showed that cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with severity and mortality for COVID-19: odds ratio (OR) 2.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-4.21 for severity and OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.67-5.39 for mortality, respectively. Risk of COVID-19 severity was higher in patients having diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Similarly, patients with diabetes, hypertension, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease were at higher risk of mortality. CONCLUSION Our findings showed that cardiovascular disease has a negative effect on health status of COVID-19 patients. However, large prevalence studies demonstrating the consequences of comorbid cardiovascular disease are urgently needed to understand the extent of these concerning comorbidities.","Mishra, Pinki; Parveen, Rizwana; Bajpai, Ram; Samim, Mohammed; Agarwal, Nidhi Bharal","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://doi.org/10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.2020367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623958/,285

In 2019, the Louisiana legislature created the CHW Workforce Study Committee (Committee) of at least half CHWs to study the workforce and provide the state with policy recommendations. The Committee followed national best practices in CHW engagement. A CHW and an academic team identified CHWs and employers statewide, administered a survey in partnership with a CHW professional association, and conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs and employers. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey data and applied thematic analysis was used to interpret interview transcripts. Sixty-five CHWs and 37 employers participated in the survey. Twenty-one CHWs and 15 employers completed interviews. Survey data indicated that Louisiana CHW roles and activities are consistent with national research. Interviews revealed a lack of knowledge about CHWs among key stakeholders, CHW workforce challenges including lack of community and professional resources, and differing ideas about the value of common workforce development practices such as standardized training and credentialing. Findings suggest a need for widespread education about CHWs and support for CHW participation in professional associations to address common workforce challenges. CHW co-leadership and partnering with a CHW professional association enabled successful study execution and full participation of CHWs in the formation of Committee recommendations.

DESIGN The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 17 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine, was virtually convened during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The committee iteratively developed the recommendations and subsequent document. METHODS Each committee member submitted a list of what they believed were the most important priorities for coronavirus disease 2019 research. The entire committee voted on 58 submitted questions to determine top priorities for coronavirus disease 2019 research. RESULTS The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 13 priorities for coronavirus disease 2019. Of these, the top six priorities were identified and include the following questions: 1) Should the approach to ventilator management differ from the standard approach in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure?, 2) Can the host response be modulated for therapeutic benefit?, 3) What specific cells are directly targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and how do these cells respond?, 4) Can early data be used to predict outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 and, by extension, to guide therapies?, 5) What is the role of prone positioning and noninvasive ventilation in nonventilated patients with coronavirus disease?, and 6) Which interventions are best to use for viral load modulation and when should they be given? CONCLUSIONS Although knowledge of both biology and treatment has increased exponentially in the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, significant knowledge gaps remain.

We compared the changes in hemostatic properties on using nonelectrolyte solution in monopolar hysteroscopic surgery (HS) with that on using isotonic saline in bipolar HS via rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) analysis. METHODS A total of 54 patients were randomized into 2 groups: 1 group underwent monopolar HS using a mixture of 2.7% sorbitol and 0.54% mannitol (the HSMP group), whereas the other group underwent bipolar HS using 0.9% isotonic saline (the HSBP group). The effects of these 2 methods on coagulation were assessed via pre and postoperative laboratory tests, including estimation of the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and ROTEM analysis. In addition, the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and electrolyte levels and the platelet count were analyzed. RESULTS Patient characteristics, volume of irrigation fluid absorbed, and type of procedure were comparable between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the pre and postoperative values of ROTEM parameters between the 2 groups. Most postoperative ROTEM parameters, as compared with preoperative values, changed in both groups; clot formation time was prolonged, and the α-angle and maximum clot firmness were decreased. All ROTEM parameters were maintained within the normal range. Hematological parameters, including hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and platelet count, were significantly decreased postoperatively in both groups compared to the preoperative values. No pre and postoperative hematological and hemostatic parameters were significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION Irrigation fluid absorbed in healthy women during HS caused hypocoagulable changes in the blood, irrespective of the irrigant type, and no significant differences between HS using monopolar and bipolar electrodes were demonstrated.","Shin, Hyun-Jung; Na, Hyo-Seok; Han, Ji-Yun; Hwang, Jung-Won",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000499914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129665/,285

This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19. Methods We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively. Results A total of 1,519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies met our inclusion criteria, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low. Conclusions The existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhang, Jingyi; Yang, Yinmei; Yang, Nan; Ma, Yanfang; Zhou, Qi; Li, Weiguo; Wang, Xia; Huang, Liping; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Enmei; Yang, Kehu; Fu, Zhou",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566562/,285

Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities. This manuscript explores potential mechanisms by which telemedicine may play a role in exacerbating or ameliorating disparities in care.

METHODS Early upper gastric carcinoma with no metastasis had been diagnosed in the subjects of this study. Five surgical ports were inserted into the abdomen. The stomach was lifted to the abdominal wall side with a MLR. Three of five gastric arteries were divided using ultrasonically activated coagulating shears and ligated with ligation forceps. A fixed gastric part with MLR was properly changed according to the lymph node dissection. Reconstruction with a gastric tube (20 cm long, 3 cm wide) using a circular stapler was performed through a small incision, through which the specimen was removed. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent LAPG. The mean operating time and blood loss were 202 min and 236 ml, respectively. The operations were performed without serious complications. None was changed to a laparotomy, and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS This technique of LAPG and gastric tube reconstruction using MLR for the treatment of proximal early gastric cancer was simple and safe.","Aihara, Ryuusuke; Mochiki, Erito; Ohno, Teturo; Yanai, Mituhiro; Toyomasu, Yoshitaka; Ogata, Kyoichi; Ando, Hiroyuki; Asao, Takayuki; Kuwano, Hiroyuki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0947-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20376493/,285

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of picroside II on acute lung injury in mice and the inflammation in A549 cells which are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced. We evaluated the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vivo and vitro by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results showed picroside II significantly decreased the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in cells and mice. In addition, Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that picroside II suppressed the activation of p65 NF-κB signaling pathway compared with LPS stimulation. In the acute lung injury model of mice, after picroside II treatment, the pathologic changes of lung tissues had been alleviated and lung wet/dry weight ratio was decreased. In summary, picroside II showed the promising effects of anti-inflammation in cells and animals.","Shen, Bingyu; Zhao, Chenxu; Chen, Chengzhen; Li, Zheng; Li, Yang; Tian, Ye; Feng, Haihua",Inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-017-0519-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28161732/,285

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. RESULTS In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 ± 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 ± 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. CONCLUSION Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Boscari, Federico; Avogaro, Angelo; Bruttomesso, Daniela; Fadini, Gian Paolo","Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-020-00829-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394184/,285

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the difference in postoperative pain between the two procedures, focusing on whether LESS was conducted with a non-expanding port (LESSnonex) or a port expanding (LESSex) within the incision. METHOD EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on LESS versus CLS for general abdominal procedures. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS A total of 29 RCTs with 2999 procedures were included. Pain (VAS 0-10) 6 h after surgery was significantly lower in the group where LESS was conducted with LESSnonex compared to CLS, WMD=-0.72 (- 1.10 to - 0.33). Pain 18-24 h was significantly higher in the group where LESS was conducted with LESSex compared to CLS, WMD = 0.38 (0.01-0.75). Wound-related complications were significantly more frequent in LESSex procedures compared to CLS, OR = 1.94 (1.03-3.63). CONCLUSION The present meta-analysis indirectly indicates that the type of access device that is used for an abdominal LESS procedure may contribute to the development of early postoperative pain as the use of a non-expanding model was associated with a more advantageous outcome. Direct randomized comparison of LESSnonex and LESSex is warranted to confirm if the use of expanding access devices generates more pain and wound complications.","Dressler, Jannie; Jorgensen, Lars N",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5487-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364149/,285

We aimed to investigate the association of longitudinal changes in early nasal microbiota with the risk of developing asthma. METHODS In this prospective, population-based birth cohort study, we followed children from birth to age 7 years. The nasal microbiota was tested by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing at ages 2, 13, and 24 months. We applied an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles during age 2 to 13 months (the primary exposure) and during age 2 to 24 months (the secondary exposure) and examined the association of these profiles with the risk of physician-diagnosed asthma at age 7 years. RESULTS Of the analytic cohort of 704 children, 57 (8%) later developed asthma. We identified 4 distinct longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles during age 2 to 13 months. In the multivariable analysis, compared with the persistent Moraxella dominance profile during age 2 to 13 months, the persistent Moraxella sparsity profile was associated with a significantly higher risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-6.27). Similar associations were observed between the longitudinal changes in nasal microbiota during age 2 to 24 months and risk of asthma. CONCLUSIONS Children with an altered longitudinal pattern in the nasal microbiota during early childhood had a high risk of developing asthma. Our data guide the development of primary prevention strategies (eg, early identification of children at high risk and modification of microbiota) for childhood asthma. These observations present a new avenue for risk modification for asthma (eg, microbiota modification).","Toivonen, Laura; Karppinen, Sinikka; Schuez-Havupalo, Linnea; Waris, Matti; He, Qiushui; Hoffman, Kristi L; Petrosino, Joseph F; Dumas, Orianne; Camargo, Carlos A; Hasegawa, Kohei; Peltola, Ville",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-0421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934151/,285

Parastomal hernias can be prevented by prophylactic mesh placement; however, no trial results are available for incisional hernia prevention after stoma reversal. In this feasibility study, we explore the safety of placing an intraperitoneal mesh to prevent incisional herniation after temporary stoma reversal. METHODS Ten patients who underwent a low anterior resection with a deviating double-loop stoma for rectal cancer received an intraperitoneal parastomal mesh at the time of stoma formation. At stoma reversal, laparoscopy was performed and adhesions were scored. After reversal, the mesh defect was closed. Mesh and stoma complications were closely monitored. Incisional herniation was assessed at the 2-year follow-up after stoma reversal using ultrasonography. RESULTS No infections occurred after mesh placement. After a median of 6 months, stomas were reversed. Laparoscopy could be performed in seven patients; all patients had adhesions (median of 25 % of mesh surface). In three patients, the bowel was involved; one required a laparotomy for bowel mobilization during stoma reversal. No adhesion-related morbidity was noted at any time. Except for one superficial wound infection after stoma reversal, no infectious complications were observed. After a median follow-up of 26 months, no incisional herniations were demonstrated.

This paper examines how heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to declining mental health among this already vulnerable group. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. METHODS This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n = 1027) collected in June 2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates. RESULTS Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Findings address how the global health crisis is contributing to declining mental health status through heightened concerns over contracting the virus, increases in economic insecurity, and growing social isolation, speaking to how health pandemics exacerbate health inequalities.","Pettinicchio, David; Maroto, Michelle; Chai, Lei; Lukk, Martin",Disability and health journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33744158/,285
150177,"COVID-19: Complement, Coagulation, and Collateral Damage.",2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND People with MS (pwMS) have had higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population before the COVID-19 pandemic, placing them at higher risk of experiencing poor psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To assess mental health and its social/lifestyle determinants in pwMS during the first wave of the outbreak in the United Kingdom. METHODS This is a community-based, prospective longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional case-control online questionnaire study. It includes 2010 pwMS from the UK MS Register and 380 people without MS. RESULTS The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores of pwMS for anxiety and depression during the outbreak did not change from the previous year. PwMS were more likely to have anxiety (using General Anxiety Disorder-7) and/or depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9) than controls during the outbreak (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.58-2.91). PwMS felt lonelier (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.80) reported worse social support (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.18-3.07) and reported worsened exercise habits (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.18-2.32) during the outbreak than controls. CONCLUSION Early in the pandemic, pwMS remained at higher risk of experiencing anxiety and depression than the general population. It is important that multidisciplinary teams improve their support for the wellbeing of pwMS, who are vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic on their lifestyle and social support.","Garjani, Afagh; Hunter, Rachael; Law, Graham R; Middleton, Rodden M; Tuite-Dalton, Katherine A; Dobson, Ruth; Ford, David V; Hughes, Stella; Pearson, Owen R; Rog, David; Tallantyre, Emma C; Nicholas, Richard; Morriss, Richard; Evangelou, Nikos; das Nair, Roshan",Multiple sclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1177/13524585211020435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080892/,285

Although most people are immunocompetent to the virus, a small group fail to mount an effective antiviral response and develop chronic infections that trigger hyperinflammation. This results in major complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure, which all carry poor prognoses. Emerging evidence suggests that the complement system plays a key role in this inflammatory reaction. Indeed, patients with severe COVID-19 show prominent complement activation in their lung, skin, and sera, and those individuals who were treated with complement inhibitors all recovered with no adverse reactions. These and other studies hint at complement's therapeutic potential in these sequalae, and thus, to support drug development, in this review, we provide a summary of COVID-19 and review complement's role in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome and coagulopathy.","Lo, Martin W; Kemper, Claudia; Woodruff, Trent M",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699160/,285

A full-thickness dermal layer extending to the underlying cartilage was excised on the dorsal side of hairless mice (n = 27; 2·3 ± 0·3 mm2 ). A polyhexanide ointment, a chitosan solution and a sodium chloride group as control were analysed using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Angiogenesis, epithelialisation and microcirculatory standard parameters were measured over a time period of 20 days. The non-perfused area is regarded as a parameter for angiogenesis and showed the following results: on days 12, 16 and 20, the sodium chloride group was significantly superior to chitosan solution (P < 0·05) and, on days 8, 12, 16 and 20, the polyhexanide group was superior to chitosan solution (P < 0·05). The epithelialisation was measured significantly faster in the polyhexanide and control group on day 8 versus chitosan solution. Whereas polyhexanide and sodium chloride were nearly completely epithelialised, treatment with chitosan solution showed still an open wound of 11% of the initial wound size. Altogether, we could demonstrate the advantageous effects of a polyhexanide ointment on microcirculation, angiogenesis and epithelialisation. Chitosan solution appears to inhibit angiogenesis and delays epithelialisation. Further studies in different models would be worthwhile to confirm these results.","Goertz, Ole; Lauer, Henrik; Hirsch, Tobias; Daigeler, Adrien; Harati, Kamran; Stricker, Ingo; Lehnhardt, Marcus; von der Lohe, Leon",International wound journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.12434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25756458/,285

154595,Monetising your mum: The industrification of aged care.,2020-09-28,"Bifurcation aneurysms account for a large fraction of cerebral aneurysms and often present morphologies that render traditional endovascular treatments, such as coiling, challenging and problematic. Flow-diverter stents offer a potentially elegant treatment option for such aneurysms, but clinical use of these devices remains controversial. Specifically, the deployment of a flow-diverter device in a bifurcation entails jailing one or more potentially vital vessels with a low-porosity mesh designed to restrict the flow. When multiple device placement configurations exist, the most appropriate clinical decision becomes increasingly opaque. In this study, three bifurcation aneurysm geometries were virtually treated by flow-diverter device. Each aneurysm was selected to offer two possible device deployment positions. Flow-diverters similar to commercially available designs were deployed with a fast-deployment algorithm before transient and steady state computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed. Reductions in aneurysm inflow, mean wall shear stress and maximum wall shear stress, all factors often linked with aneurysm treatment outcome, were compared for different device configurations in each aneurysm. In each of the three aneurysms modelled, a particular preferential device placement was shown to offer superior performance with the greatest reduction in the flow metrics considered. In all the three aneurysm geometries, substantial variations in inflow reduction (up to 25.3%), mean wall shear stress reduction (up to 14.6%) and maximum wall shear stress reduction (up to 12.1%) were seen, which were all attributed to device placement alone. Optimal device placement was found to be non-trivial and highly aneurysm specific; in only one-third of the simulated geometries, the best overall performance was achieved by deploying a device in the daughter vessel with the highest flow rate. Good correspondence was seen between transient results and steady state computations that offered a significant reduction in simulation run time. If accurate steady state computations are combined with the fast-deployment algorithm used, the modest run time and corresponding hardware make a virtual treatment pipeline in the clinical setting a meaningful possibility.","Peach, Thomas; Spranger, Katerina; Ventikos, Yiannis","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The stability of aneurysm occlusion after this treatment was evaluated in the short and midterm, but not in the long term. This retrospective multicenter European study is the continuation of an already published series dealing with short- and midterm anatomic results and analyzes long-term data in patients treated with the WEB-DL. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve European neurointerventional centers initially participated in the study. In addition to data collected for the initial publication, images obtained at long-term follow-up were collected and independently analyzed by the same experienced interventional neuroradiologist. RESULTS Of the initial 45 patients, 26 (20 women and 6 men; 35-73 years of age; mean, 55.2 ± 10.6 years; median, 55.5 years) with 26 aneurysms treated with the WEB-DL device had long-term follow-up (median, 27.4 months). Three of 26 patients (11.5%) were retreated between short- and midterm follow-up, and none, between mid- and long-term follow-up. Long-term aneurysm occlusion in the 19 patients treated with the WEB only and not retreated during follow-up was complete occlusion in 13/19 patients (68.4%), including aneurysms with opacification of the proximal recess in 9/19 patients (47.4%), neck remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%). In all patients (100.0%), aneurysm occlusion was stable between midterm and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that WEB treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms offers long-term stable occlusion.","Pierot, L; Klisch, J; Liebig, T; Gauvrit, J-Y; Leonardi, M; Nuzzi, N P; Di Paola, F; Sychra, V; Mine, B; Lubicz, B",AJNR.

156403,Impact of COVID-19 on Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation Caregiver Training.,2020,"BACKGROUND Applications of causal inference methods to randomised controlled trial (RCT) data have usually focused on adjusting for compliance with the randomised intervention rather than on using RCT data to address other, non-randomised questions. In this paper we review use of causal inference methods to assess the impact of aspects of patient management other than the randomised intervention in RCTs. METHODS We identified papers that used causal inference methodology in RCT data from Medline, Premedline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from 1986 to September 2014, using a forward citation search of five seminal papers, and a keyword search. We did not include studies where inverse probability weighting was used solely to balance baseline characteristics, adjust for loss to follow-up or adjust for non-compliance to randomised treatment. Studies where the exposure could not be assigned were also excluded. RESULTS There were 25 papers identified. Nearly half the papers (11/25) estimated the causal effect of concomitant medication on outcome. The remainder were concerned with post-randomisation treatment regimens (sequential treatments, n =5 ), effects of treatment timing (n = 2) and treatment dosing or duration (n = 7). Examples were found in cardiovascular disease (n = 5), HIV (n = 7), cancer (n = 6), mental health (n = 4), paediatrics (n = 2) and transfusion medicine (n = 1). The most common method implemented was a marginal structural model with inverse probability of treatment weighting. CONCLUSIONS Examples of studies which exploit RCT data to address non-randomised questions using causal inference methodology remain relatively limited, despite the growth in methodological development and increasing utilisation in observational studies. Further efforts may be needed to promote use of causal methods to address additional clinical questions within RCTs to maximise their value.","Farmer, Ruth E; Kounali, Daphne; Walker, A Sarah; Savović, Jelena; Richards, Alison; May, Margaret T; Ford, Deborah",Trials,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2381-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321046/,285

However, it is unclear what youth friendliness means on a practical level. This scoping review explores (1) how youth friendliness in mental health services is defined in the literature, (2) what characteristics make MHA services youth friendly and (3) how youth friendliness is expected to impact service use by young people. METHODS A search will be conducted of eight electronic bibliographic databases over the last 15 years (2002-2017) to identify literature on youth friendliness consistent with the modern youth experience. Grey literature will also be searched. The search and literature selection process will include all study designs, as well as non-research literature. Two independent raters will determine eligibility based on a review of the titles and abstracts of the identified literature, followed by full text reviews when required. Data will be extracted from the identified literature and then synthesised using qualitative and quantitative approaches. As a final step, we will conduct stakeholder consultations with youth, family members and service provider groups to validate the findings and identify any characteristics of youth friendliness that they deem important that were not reported in the findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication, as well as international, national and local conference presentations. Agency reports will be developed to present the findings in a user-friendly format, including a youth-friendliness checklist for youth-serving organisations.

156652,Thermographic assessment of the immediate and short term-effects of blood flow restriction exercise on Achilles tendon skin temperature.,2021-01-26,"The application of ultrasound imaging to the diagnosis of lung diseases is nowadays receiving growing interest. However, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) is mainly limited to the analysis of imaging artifacts, such as B-lines, which correlate with a wide variety of diseases. Therefore, the results of LUS investigations remain qualitative and subjective, and specificity is obviously suboptimal. Focusing on the development of a quantitative method dedicated to the lung, in this work we present the first clinical results obtained with Quantitative LUS Spectroscopy when applied to the differentiation of pulmonary fibrosis. A previously-developed specific multi-frequency ultrasound imaging technique was utilized to acquire ultrasound images from 26 selected patients. The multi-frequency imaging technique was implemented on the ULA-OP platform, and a LA533® (Esaote, Florence, Italy) linear-array probe was utilized. RF-data obtained at different imaging frequencies (3, 4, 5 and 6 MHz) were acquired and processed in order to characterize B-lines based on their frequency content. In particular, B-line native frequencies (the frequency at which a B-line exhibits the highest intensity) and bandwidth (the range of frequencies over which a B-line shows intensities within -6 dB from its highest intensity), as well as B-line intensity, were analyzed. Results show how the analysis of these features allows (in this group of patients) the differentiation of fibrosis with a sensitivity and specificity equal to 92% and 92%, respectively. These promising results strongly motivate towards the extension of the clinical study, aiming at analyzing a larger cohort of patients and including a broader range of pathologies.","Mento, Federico; Soldati, Gino; Prediletto, Renato; Demi, Marcello; Demi, Libertario","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2020.3012289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746228/,285

One strategy for addressing this major public health concern is to offer vaccinations in nonprimary care settings such as schools, emergency rooms, hospitals, and pharmacies. This article reviews the unique advantages, challenges, and experiences regarding vaccine delivery in each alternative setting. It describes the key components that each must possess as well as other important factors to consider when assessing the ability of each to deliver vaccines to the children and adolescents they serve. It also highlights the need for sufficient funding and reimbursement for vaccine-related costs in these settings, the importance of orienting staff, providers, and practices to offering preventive care services through education and evidenced-based approaches, and the necessity of effective, efficient coordination of vaccination efforts across sites. By expanding the scope of non-primary care settings to include vaccine delivery and striving to capture all vaccination opportunities in these locations, the proportion of children and adolescents receiving on-time doses will undoubtedly increase. It is important to emphasize that these settings should not replace the medical home as the primary location for vaccination, but rather serve as a critical safety net for high-risk individuals and communities and in situations where access to traditional locations may be limited such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hofstetter, Annika M; Schaffer, Stanley",Academic pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2021.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958093/,285

This hybrid technique requires conventional laparoscopy via an umbilical incision. To date it is unclear if this procedure is safe and feasible in routine practice. METHODS We report on a case series of 128 women who consented to transvaginal cholecystectomy. Data, including visual analog scores (VAS), were collected prospectively via a standard digital spreadsheet. Patients completed satisfaction questionnaires within 10 days after discharge from hospital. We report on outcomes, age, body mass index, operating time, complications, pain scores, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS In 115 (89.8%) patients the procedure was performed as a transvaginal operation. In 11 women (8.6%), we converted to standard laparoscopy, and in 2 cases (1.6%), we converted to an open procedure. Mean age was 52.4 years (range = 23-78 years) and mean body mass index was 27.8 (range = 18.8-42). Mean operating time was 60.6 min (range = 22-110 min). Other procedures were combined with hybrid cholecystectomy in six cases. Complications following transvaginal access included one vaginal bleeding, one perforation of the urinary bladder, and one superficial lesion of the rectum. In one case the hepatic duct had to be stented due to leakage after the procedure via endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Mean VAS on day 1 was 2.26 (± 0.31 SEM) and on day 2 it was 1.53 (± 0.35 SEM). In a postoperative questionnaire, 95% of patients indicated that they would recommend this procedure to other patients. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal cholecystectomy is a safe and easy-to-learn procedure. Possible complications are different than those of standard laparoscopic procedures. Trauma to the abdominal wall and scarring is minimal. Postoperative pain scores were not different than those of standard laparoscopy and a high percentage of patients are satisfied with the procedure.","Federlein, Matthias; Borchert, Dietmar; Müller, Verena; Atas, Yüksel; Fritze, Frauke; Burghardt, Jens; Elling, Dirk; Gellert, Klaus",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0983-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20333406/,285
160562,COVID-19 Pandemic and Children: A Review.,2020,"Excessive anthropogenic activities have led to high-level ammonia loss and volatilization, which is regarded as a key factor in Chinese haze formation. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of ammonia emission estimations is accomplished at both temporal (1980-2016) and spatial (provincial) scales using a mass-balanced model, and emission projections through 2030 are also studied in different development scenarios. The results show that the ammonia emissions increased from 4.7 Tg N yr-1 in 1980 to 11 Tg N yr-1 in 2016, which is an approximately 2.4-fold increase. The cropland and livestock emissions are the largest contributors, as most reports show approximately 80% contributions; however, nonagriculture sources of fuel combustion, waste treatment and ammonia escape have grown rapidly in recent years, accounting for 14% in 2016. The spatial differences also reveal the complex heterogeneity in Chinese provinces. In addition, the emission intensities of major agriculture and non-agriculture sources are 0-80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and over 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, indicating a higher degree of ammonia concentration from non-agriculture emissions, which should attract wide concern. In terms of scenario analysis, emissions would reach 12.8 Tg N yr-1 in 2030 under the currently developed model and 7.3 Tg N yr-1 under a series of reduction policies; the spatial analysis also shows that the North China Plain has a 2.1 Tg N yr-1 reduction potential. The results of this study provide new insights into ammonia emission estimations and a better understanding of the environmental impacts of ammonia emitted from different sources.","Fu, Hang; Luo, Zhibo; Hu, Shanying",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408207/,285

Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, and the responses were analyzed anonymously. A large percentage of students used mobile phones (81.4%) to undertake online tests. Although most students (73.2%; P < 0.001) felt that online tests helped them substantially in learning the subject, network connectivity issues were considered to be a matter of serious concern (85.5%, P < 0.001). Among the assessment methods used, viva voce by video conferencing was thought to be most reliable (83%, P < 0.001). Multiple-choice question-based assessment when done online was felt to be more practically feasible with faster feedback than classroom assessment. The results of the study suggest that medical students find online formative assessments helpful for their learning, despite their concerns about reliability and practical challenges.","Snekalatha, S; Marzuk, S Mohamed; Meshram, Swapnatai A; Maheswari, K Uma; Sugapriya, G; Sivasharan, K",Advances in physiology education,https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00178.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529145/,285

METHODS A systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with mind-body exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. A panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a Delphi survey. A hierarchical alphabetical grading system (A, B, C+, C, D, D+, D-) was used, based on statistical significance ( P < 0.5) and clinical importance (⩾15% improvement). RESULTS The four high-quality studies identified demonstrated that various mind-body exercise programs are promising for improving the management of knee osteoarthritis. Hatha Yoga demonstrated significant improvement for pain relief (Grade B) and physical function (Grade C+). Tai Chi Qigong demonstrated significant improvement for quality of life (Grade B), pain relief (Grade C+) and physical function (Grade C+). Sun style Tai Chi gave significant improvement for pain relief (Grade B) and physical function (Grade B). CONCLUSION Mind-body exercises are promising approaches to reduce pain, as well as to improve physical function and quality of life for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.","Brosseau, Lucie; Taki, Jade; Desjardins, Brigit; Thevenot, Odette; Fransen, Marlene; Wells, George A; Imoto, Aline Mizusaki; Toupin-April, Karine; Westby, Marie; Gallardo, Inmaculada C Álvarez; Gifford, Wendy; Laferrière, Lucie; Rahman, Prinon; Loew, Laurianne; Angelis, Gino De; Cavallo, Sabrina; Shallwani, Shirin Mehdi; Aburub, Ala'; Bennell, Kim L; Van der Esch, Martin; Simic, Milena; McConnell, Sara; Harmer, Alison; Kenny, Glen P; Paterson, Gail; Regnaux, Jean-Philippe; Lefevre-Colau, Marie-Martine; McLean, Linda",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215517691083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183188/,285
163051,Using geospatial models to map zero-dose children: factors associated with zero-dose vaccination status before and after a mass measles and rubella vaccination campaign,2021-09-22,"The need for increased disaster resilience planning, especially at the community level, as well as the need to address sustainability are clear;these dual objectives have been deemed national priorities in a number of recent US Executive Orders. Major global climate agreements, (i.e., the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Paris Climate Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals) all emphasize the need to integrate disaster resilience and climate risks with continued sustainable development concerns. Current ways of assessing synergies and trade-offs across planning for disaster resilience and sustainability in investment projects that impact communities are limited. The driving research question in this paper is how researchers and practitioners may better express relative categories of co-benefits to meet this need. We draw upon the categorization of some co-benefits as contributing to the resilience dividend, which has helped communication across fields and created bridges from research to practical on-the-ground planning in recent years. Furthermore, we leverage the growing focus on the need to recognize the role of narratives in driving decisions about how and where to invest, which elucidates the inherent value of archetypes that resonate across stakeholders and disciplines to describe investments that may meet multiple objectives. We introduce the concept of a resilience windfall as an unexpected or sudden gain or advantage of resilience planning to be conceptualized alongside resilience dividends. We then assess the practicality of discerning resilience windfalls across various projects that have aspects of both resilience and sustainability. We recount five narrative vignettes that demonstrate disaster resilience interventions and associated resilience dividends and windfalls. This effort highlights the importance of considering resilience dividends and resilience windfalls during the planning, execution, and evaluation phases of disaster resilience projects. These typologies provide an important contribution to the integration agenda between disaster resilience, climate risks, and sustainable development. There are policy implications of framing incentives for interventions that address both disaster resilience and long-term sustainability objectives as well as encouraging robust tracking of both resilience dividends and windfalls.","Helgeson, Jennifer Cheyney O’Fallon",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084554,285
163146,Exploring the therapeutic role of nanomedicine in COVID-19 disease,2021,"With the rapid increase in the number of infected people in COVID-19, medical supplies have been increasing significantly. Medical waste treatment scheme selection may have long-term impacts on the economy, society, and environment. Determining the best treatment option is a considerable challenge. To solve this problem, in this paper, we proposed a multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) method based on single-valued neutrosophic numbers and partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (PMSM) operator. Because of the complexity of the medical waste treatment scheme selection problem, the single-valued neutrosophic numbers are applied to express the uncertain evaluation information. For the medical waste treatment scheme selection problem, the factors or criteria (these two terms can be interchanged.) in the same clusters are closely related, and the criteria in different clusters have no relationships. The partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean function can handle these complicated criterion relationships. Therefore, we extend the PMSM operator to process the single-valued neutrosophic numbers and propose the single-valued neutrosophic partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (SVNPMSM) operator and its weighted form (SVNWPMSM). Then, we analyze their properties and give typical examples of the proposed operators. An MCGDM model based on the SVNWPMSM aggregation operator is developed and applied to solve the medical waste treatment scheme selection problem. Finally, the validity and superiority of the developed model are verified by comparing it with the previous methods. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","Ling, J.; Lin, M.; Zhang, L.",AIMS Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3934/math.2021612,285

164758,COVID self-certification: Recognition of postgraduate training and experiences gained during the pandemic,2021,"We find that epidemic resurgence, defined as an upswing in the effective reproduction number (R) of the contagion from subcritical to supercritical values, is fundamentally difficult to detect in real time. Intrinsic latencies in pathogen transmission, coupled with often smaller incidence across periods of subcritical spread mean that resurgence cannot be reliably detected without significant delays, even if case reporting is perfect. This belies epidemic suppression (where R falls from supercritical to subcritical values), which can be ascertained 5-10 times more rapidly. These innate limits on detecting resurgence only worsen when spatial or demographic heterogeneities are incorporated. Consequently, we argue that resurgence is more effectively handled proactively, at the expense of false alarms. Responses to recrudescent infections or emerging variants of concern will more likely be timely if informed by improved syndromic surveillance systems than by optimised mathematical models of epidemic spread.","Parag, K.

165813,Exercise recommendations during coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to detail the actions of the Russian subsidiary of a multinational IT company, during the COVID–19 pandemic, aimed toward the exploration and exploitation of unexpected business opportunities. It depicts the strategic and tactical actions of the subsidiary and corporate initiatives during the pandemic, revealing tensions between the subsidiary and its corporate parent on implementation of each’s initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: A case study is presented, based on action research, using internal documents from the company under consideration, participation in various working meetings, meetings with customers and interviews with subsidiary management. Findings: The strategic actions implemented by the subsidiary during the pandemic exemplify strategic agility, i.e. a set of activities carried out by a company that create value in a turbulent and unpredictable environment which in turn require systematic variations in specific processes, products and structures. Some of those variations included the unauthorized amendment of internal corporate rules, leading to tensions between the subsidiary and parent company. This case illustrates that such parent-subsidiary tensions are an inevitable element of achieving agility at the subsidiary level, especially during rapid and unpredictable changes in the business environment. Research limitations/implications: This study presents the flow of events in one multinational corporation subsidiary. However, the authors speculate that similar situations (subsidiary actions exploiting emergent business opportunities and which have been restricted by rigid internal corporate rules and regulations and low receptivity from corporate headquarters) occurred in many multinational corporation subsidiaries, aiming to explore and exploit nascent business opportunities in local markets during the pandemic. Practical implications: The study confirms the necessity for the review of the functioning of the corporate immune system of large multinational corporations to allow more subsidiary initiatives to flourish than before the pandemic. Originality/value: The paper presents a case of strategic agility at subsidiary level during the pandemic. It also uncovers the black-boxing managerial decision-making processes in headquarters-subsidiary relations during the extreme turbulence of business environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gurkov, I.; Shchetinin, I.",Review of International Business and Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1108/ribs-02-2021-0030,285

It spread to several countries, which led the World Health Organization to decree, on March 11, 2020, a pandemic state that deeply affected Brazil. Due to the impossibility of leaving the house, the routine of children with autism was changed. Children in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have a qualitative deficit in social interaction. Clinical and daily observations reinforce several scientific studies that defend the importance of maintaining a routine as stable as possible for people with ASD, without this stability they may become emotionally disorganized, feel discomfort or even irritability.ObjectivesInvestigate the impact caused by social distancing on the development of children and adolescents with autism.MethodsAn online questionnaire based on the DIR/Floortime basic map of emotional functional capacity development was distributed in Brazil from April to May, 2020. The results were analyzed using SPSS software.ResultsResults obtained from 122 questionnaires showed that after 30 days of quarantine 20% of children no longer had the characteristic of being able to remain calm and organized for at least 2 minutes;11% no longer initiates interactions with their parents;27% demonstrated more protests and anger than before the social distancing;18% demonstrated more emotions such as anger, fear and intimacy, 28% began to understand their limits and 12% of the children are using greater facial expression during the social distancing.ConclusionsThis study brings results that can help to understand the processes in a child with autism.","Pacheco, P.; Pacheco, M.; Marinho, D.; Oliveira, T.; Marques, A.; Souza, K.; Franco, E.; Maia, J.; Silva, L.; Molini-Avejonas, D.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.704,285
166035,Trends in cancer screening volumes at an urban health center during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Covid-19 has had an important impact on the mental health conditions of over 5 million Italians suffering from one of the over 150 rheumatic diseases. In order to understand the psychological impact of the Covid-19 emergency and the restrictions imposed to counter it, the Italian National Association of People with Rheumatic and Rare Diseases -APMARR APS launched the research Living with a rheumatic pathology. Objectives: Gather data directly from Italian patients about the impact of the COVID-19 and consequent restrictions on their mental health and feelings;evaluate the most effective intervention to be implemented to face the pandemic by Patients organization. Methods: A qualitative-quantitative survey was carried out through a questionnaire administered throughout the national territory to a sample of N = 1,001 people. The people invited to complete the questionnaire were women (55,9%) and men (44,1%), aged 18-85 years (age 18-41=26,7%;age 42-65=64%;age >65=9,3%) with at least one rheumatic pathology. The questionnaire was made up of 39 questions, of which 29 were closed and 10 were open. For the administration of the questionnaires, the CAWI (Computer Aided Web Interview) methodology of on-line survey was used. The 1,001 interviews were carried out from 7 to 14 August 2020. Results: More than 4 out of 10 people (total sample 44.2%;male 60%, female 35,7%;age 18-41=39,1%;age 42-65=45,9%;age >65 = 50%) declared that the emergency period has somehow caused a worsening of their health condition. People declared that the deterioration of their health is due to the emergency period for the following reasons: 1) Psychological: such as stress and anxiety: Too much stress and anxiety made the symptoms worse.;The stress of the quarantine affected my problem;Insomnia. Nervousness. General ailments. Depression. Strong stress 2) Inability to perform physiotherapy and motor activities due to the lockdown 3) Postponement of examinations, visits and checks 4) remote working, in some cases described as harmful for people's mental and physical health: Due to Covid19 I had to do remote working and I worked even 12 hours a day including holidays to the detriment of my family life. Furthermore, from January 31, 2020 a significant increase emerged in communication problems with rheumatology specialist compared to the period before the emergency due to Covid-19. The sharp increase may be due to the situation of severe psychological stress to which also the doctors were subjected in the emergency phase: people could not find the comfort of being empathically listened to. Conclusion: The research shows that the most frequent symptoms among people with rheumatic diseases were depression and high levels of anxiety due to strong emotional stress. Psychological malaise caused direct effects in worsening the symptoms of rheumatic disease as well as other related effects, for example, insomnia. The forced isolation due to the lockdown has made people lack the social support that is fundamental for the psychological well-being especially for those suffering from some chronic pathology. Starting from the data collected, APMARR promptly activated a completely free psychological support service with 6 professional psychologists, two of them specialized in emergency psychology. The service is accessible online and is still going on for all who are not able to overcome the anxiety and fear related to the pandemic and its evolution. Thousands of accesses to the service have been measured to date.

The study found COVID-19 perceived threat and impacts (e.g., logistical, psychological) to be generally lower in Poland than in the United States. However, views on government responses (e.g., lockdowns) were largely similar. Conservatives and moderates perceived COVID-19 threat as lower than liberals did, but trust in science explained the effect for moderates. Also, women had a greater fear of coronavirus than did men.

This study focuses on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students' use and perceptions of Blackboard. It explores and compares EFL students' use and perceptions of Blackboard considering three phases: before COVID-19 in 2019, during online learning in 2020, and during online learning in 2021. A questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data. A total of 381 Saudi EFL students participated in the study. The results show that there are statistically significant differences in EFL students' use of Blackboard between the three phases. EFL students' use of Blackboard increased during online learning in 2020 compared to 2019, especially concerning the frequency of visiting Blackboard and the time students spent using it. Further, EFL students' use of Blackboard increased significantly during online learning in 2021 compared to 2019 with regard to visit frequencies, time spent, and Blackboard tools used. Considering perceptions, the results indicate that there are statistically significant differences in students' perceptions of Blackboard in terms of easiness and usefulness between the three phases. Interestingly, students had more positive perceptions of Blackboard before COVID-19 in 2019 and during online learning in 2021. The technical problems that students faced while using Blackboard during 2020 might have affected their perceptions. The study results of students' use and perceptions of Blackboard are discussed in light of institutional policies and support.","Alsuhaibani, Z.",Arab World English Journal,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call7.2,285

This powerful system is patterned with high-aspect ratio micropillars to enhance reporter probe binding. After surface modification and probe immobilization, CRISPR Cas12a/crRNA complex is injected into the fully enclosed system. With the presence of double-stranded DNA target, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and non-specifically cleaves the ssDNA reporters initially immobilized on the micropillars. This collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes into the assay, and the intensity is linearly proportional to the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM. Importantly, this system does not rely on traditional dye-quencher labeled probe thus eliminating the fluorescence background presented in the assay. Furthermore, our one-step detection protocol is performed at isothermal conditions (37°C) without using complicated and time-consuming off-chip probe hybridization and denaturation.

166770,Worldwide association of lifestyle related factors and COVID-19 mortality,2021-08-18,"The correlation between electrons in different quantum wires is expected to affect the electronic properties of quantum electron-electron biwire systems. Here, we use the variational Monte Carlo method to study the ground-state properties of parallel, infinitely thin electron-electron biwires for several electron densities ($r_\text{s}$) and interwire separations ($d$). Specifically, the ground-state energy, the correlation energy, the interaction energy, the pair-correlation function (PCF), the static structure factor (SSF), and the momentum distribution (MD) function are calculated. We find that the interaction energy increases as $\ln(d)$ for $d\to 0$ and it decreases as $d^{-2}$ when $d\to \infty$. The PCF shows oscillatory behavior at all densities considered here. As two parallel wires approach each other, interwire correlations increase while intrawire correlations decrease as evidenced by the behavior of the PCF, SSF, and MD. The system evolves from two monowires of density parameter $r_\text{s}$ to a single monowire of density parameter $r_\text{s}/2$ as $d$ is reduced from infinity to zero. The MD reveals Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid behavior with a power-law nature near $k_\text{F}$ even in the presence of an extra interwire interaction between the electrons in biwire systems. It is observed that when $d$ is reduced the MD decreases for $kk_\text{F}$, similar to its behavior with increasing $r_\text{s}$. The TL liquid exponent is extracted by fitting the MD data near $k_\text{F}$, from which the TL liquid interaction parameter $K_{\rho}$ is calculated. The value of the TL parameter is found to be in agreement with that of a single wire for large separation between the two wires.","Sharma, Rajesh O.; Drummond, N. D.; Ashokan, Vinod; Pathak, K.

168303,Applicability of vitamins in the management of COVID-19: An overview,2021,"Adaptive instructional systems (AIS) hold great promise for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of educational systems due to their ability to tailor instruction to the specific needs of learners. In addition, because AIS necessarily elicit evidence of learning from students to drive adaptive decisions, there has long been interest in mining data from these systems for broader assessment purposes such as program evaluation and policy making. Recently, this desire was accelerated by the novel Coronavirus pandemic. It became difficult and in some cases impossible to bring groups of students together to take standardized assessments capable of providing comparable data points suitable for aggregation at district and state levels. Simultaneously, online AIS became a part of daily instruction for many students. This paper examines theories of change that have been proposed for AIS and theories of change commonly associated with assessment and accountability in K-12 education in the United States. It then proposes a conceptual model for hybrid adaptive instructional and assessment systems (AIAS) with the unique contribution of explicitly representing the role of the AIS within the broader assessment eco-system.

With this comes the reinforcement of debates between the right to health and pharmaceutical patent rights. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how the Philippines could attempt to balance the right to health with pharmaceutical patent rights in the introduction of a potential COVID-19 vaccine into the country. Design/methodology/approach - This will be accomplished through an examination of the flexibilities allowed by international agreements and domestic patent laws. Findings - With the economic and health challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine Government will have a strong justification to pursue parallel importation and compulsory licencing under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This is exacerbated by the bold leadership of President Duterte, whose administration has so far shown a propensity to decide in favor of the right to health at the expense of other rights in dealing with the pandemic. Originality/value - While this paper focuses on the Philippines, it has a potential application in the least developed and developing countries which aim to gain access to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, while this study discusses the harmonization of laws on the right to health and patent laws as a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to vaccines, it also calls for solutions that go beyond the application of the law.","Cerilles, M.

While loading and targeting protocols have been developed for numerous VLP prototypes, induced disassembly under physiological conditions of neutral pH, moderate temperature, and aqueous medium, remain a challenge. Here, we implement and evaluate a ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) general mechanism for controllable VLP disassembly that is independent of cell-specific factors or the manipulation environmental conditions such as pH and temperature that cannot be readily controlled in vivo. The ROMP substrate norbornene is covalently conjugated to surface-exposed lysine residues of a P22 bacteriophage-derived VLP, and ROMP is induced by treatment of water-soluble ruthenium catalyst AquaMet. Disruption of the P22 shell and release of a GFP reporter is confirmed via native agarose electrophoresis and quantitative microscopy and light scattering analyses. Our ROMP disassembly strategy does not depend on the particular structure or morphology of the P22 nanocontainer and is adaptable to other VLP prototypes for the potential delivery of venom peptides for pharmacological applications.","Kelly, M.

The experiment utilized nine different heat inputs at three different levels of welding speed and beam current. The weld quality was characterized and ranked based on weld geometry, microhardness and mechanical properties. Fusion area and weld penetration depth were found to be proportional to the heat input. Microhardness measurement showed a wider and softer weld zone at the beam entrance. Voids, found at weld bottoms when welding at the highest beam power of 3250 watt and scanning speed exceeding 0.78 m/min, can be removed by a suitable machining process. All samples but one had tensile strength exceeding the specification for rolled IN718 (837 MPa); ductility of welded specimens also met the specification (57%) when welding with heat input less than 225 J/mm. At low heat inputs, the welded samples fractured outside of the weld zone and indicated their exceptional weld strength. The samples welded at higher heat inputs cracked and fractured at the weld. These results provide a benchmark for comparison with future study on EBW of selective laser melted IN718.","Patel, Vivek; Sali, Akash; Hyder, James; Corliss, Mike; Hyder, David; Hung, Wayne",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315171; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315171,285

Individuals with mental illness are suspected to be particularly affected by the societal consequences of the pandemic, but there is very limited data on this important aspect.ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to gauge the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being and symptom levels of individuals receiving treatment for mental disorder in psychiatric hospital services.MethodsWe are in the process of conducting a two-wave, questionnaire-based survey among patients with mental disorders receiving treatment in the psychiatric hospital services of the Central Denmark Region. The first wave was conducted in July 2020 and had 1180 respondents representing all major diagnostic categories. The main finding was that the majority of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently planning the second wave of the survey, which will be fielded in the fall of 2020. Here, we will reassess the mental health of the respondents from wave 1.ResultsWill be presented at the meeting.ConclusionsLongitudinal studies of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic of mental health are lacking. We therefore expect that the findings of this study will be of significant interest to the field.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Gil, Y.; Speed, M.; Jefsen, O.; Kølbæk, P.; Østergaard, S.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.270,285
172516,Second wave of COVID-19: Steps and future vision,2021,"Background: Good mental health improves the overall quality of life. Anxiety and depression in post-treatment cancer survivors is common and can affect adversely on the individual. CanCovDirect is a novel, tele-medicine self-care intervention for cancer survivors. We practiced a randomized controlled superiority trial to compare CanCovDirect with usual standard care (SC) in this population.Methods: Individuals completing cancer treatment within the past 3 years who had symptoms with or without anxiety or depression were recruited from clinical and community settings in Northern Kerala. We allocated the participants using block randomization (CanCovDirect plus SC or to SC alone). Assessments of anxiety and depression severity (Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale [CES-D];primary outcome) and secondary outcomes anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) health-related quality of life (Short Form Survey-12 mental and physical component summaries), were conducted at baseline, as well as 3 and 6 months (primary time point). Analyses of outcomes were adjusted for covariates using linear regression. Results: Participants recruited between June 2020 and November 2020 were randomly assigned to CanCovDirect (n = 152) or SC (n = 152). Among 350 participants randomly assigned, 304 (86.85%) completed the primary outcome at 6 months. CanCovDirect participants reported less severe anxiety and depressive symptoms on the CES-D than SC participants at 6 months, adjusted effect size (ES) 1.68 (95% CI, 1.28 to 2.05). CanCovDirect participants also had significantly greater quality of life compared with SC. Exploratory analysis suggested that types of cancer was a modifier of the primary outcome (interaction term P value =.04);the intervention was effective in women (ES, 0.62;95% CI, -0.45 to 0.89). Conclusions: CanCovDirect is an essential method of managing mild-moderate depression and anxiety symptoms in cancer survivors.","Warrier, N. E.; Sankar, U. V.; Sreedharan, P. S.; Parameswaran, P.

This study explored the skills that the informal manufacturers used to navigate the uncertain business environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA total of 27 telephone interviews were conducted with informal entrepreneurs who were manufacturers of agricultural machinery at Mbare Magaba and Gaza home industry in Harare, Zimbabwe. Purposive and snow ball sampling were used to identify information rich sources. The authors used thematic analysis in identifying recurrent themes from this study.FindingsThe study results show that business agility motivated most informal manufacturers to restructure their business to sustain their operations. With the closure of formal companies, the informal manufacturers adopted slowing and narrowing loops through purchasing broken down agricultural machines for repairs or remanufacturing of durable machines for their low-income customer base. Most young and formally trained manufacturers adopted a prospector strategic behaviour as they used digital platforms to network with business associates for supplies, gathering market intelligence, making and receiving electronic payments and establishing virtual distant markets whilst the older manufacturers resorted mostly to a defender strategic behaviour of engaging their usual customers for repair jobs and a few referrals.Originality/valueThis study offers unique insights with respect to skills required for the sustainable and strategic management of small and medium enterprises during times of crisis.","Manyati, Tarisai Kudakwashe Morgen Mutsau",Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies,https://doi.org/10.1108/jeee-07-2020-0236,285

This became more pressing during the COVID-19 pandemic since heritage institutions had, on the one hand, to temporarily close their doors to visitors while, on the other, find ways to communicate their collections to the public. Virtual tours, revamped websites, and 3D models of cultural artefacts were only a few of the means that museums devised to create alternative ways of digital engagement and counteract the physical and social distancing measures. Although 3D models and collections provide novel ways to interact, visualise, and comprehend the materiality and sensoriality of physical objects, their mediation in digital forms misses essential elements that contribute to (virtual) visitor/user experience. This article explores three-dimensional digitisations of museum artefacts, particularly problematising their aura and authenticity in comparison to their physical counterparts. Building on several studies that have problematised these two concepts, this article establishes an exploratory framework aimed at evaluating the experience of aura and authenticity in 3D digitisations. This exploration allowed us to conclude that even though some aspects of aura and authenticity are intrinsically related to the physicality and materiality of the original, 3D models can still manifest aura and authenticity, as long as a series of parameters, including multimodal contextualisation, interactivity, and affective experiences are facilitated.","Cardozo, T.

A latent class model classified 24% of participants as 'non-responders' not developing anti-spike antibodies. These seronegative non-responders were older, had higher SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values during infection (i.e. lower viral burden), and less frequently reported any symptoms. Among those who seroconverted, using Bayesian linear mixed models, the estimated anti-spike IgG peak level was 7.3-fold higher than the level previously associated with 50% protection against reinfection, with higher peak levels in older participants and those of non-white ethnicity. The estimated anti-spike IgG half-life was 184 days, being longer in females and those of white ethnicity. We estimated antibody levels associated with protection against reinfection likely last 1.5-2 years on average, with levels associated with protection from severe infection present for several years.

Morale became more important to ensure the ability to navigate this difficult challenge. My role as Chief Registrar was to link executive and junior medical teams. The key to my strategy was early and continued stakeholder engagement.We identified the ability to communicate with junior medical staff as a weakness. The Trust did not have a list of all junior doctors, or a way to communicate with them. I set up a ‘WhatsApp’ group for all junior medical staff and through this, organised daily video conferences led by a member of the senior clinical team. These conferences included updates on hospital status and guidelines which were then summarised into a text update for those unable to attend. This flexible approach was devised and implemented within a week.The working environment plays a pivotal role and wellbeing is impacted by access to food and rest. We arranged free food and access to the Doctors Mess, free parking, shower facilities and a ‘wobble room’, where people could go if they felt overwhelmed. We coordinated strategies alongside the Trust wellbeing team and recruited a GP, with psychiatry experience to be available for telephone consultations daily.We used online surveys to assess the impact of our intervention collecting both quantitative and qualitive data. Over 80% of junior doctors felt supported during the pandemic and reported a reduction in anxiety.Change can happen effectively even during a crisis within a complex system. The morale of the medical workforce has a direct impact on patient safety and the quality of care delivered.

181035,A review of the clinical assistant workforce during COVID-19 at a district general hospital,2021,"Background: Hospitalized cancer patients (pts) with COVID-19 have a severe disease course and high mortality. Pts with lung cancer, hematologic malignancies and metastatic disease may be at higher risk. Detailed prospective inpatient data may help to identify those at greatest risk for poor outcomes. Methods: NCCAPS is a longitudinal study aiming to accrue 2,000 cancer pts undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancy or solid tumor with COVID-19. For pts' first COVID-19 hospitalization, clinical data, research blood specimens and imaging are collected, and additional clinical data are collected during subsequent hospitalizations. Results: As of Jan. 22, 2021, among 757 enrolled adult patients from 204 sites, 124 (16.3%) reported at least one hospitalization for COVID-19, and discharge data was available for 98 hospitalizations in 88 patients. The median age was 67 (range 21-93, 1Q:56, 3Q:72), 35/88 (40%) were female. The most common malignancies in hospitalized adult pts were lymphoma (18.2%), lung cancer (15.9%) and multiple myeloma (10.2%). The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (65%), fatigue/malaise (64%), and fever (49%). 8/88 (9%) pts were neutropenic (ANC < 1000) at presentation;17/88 (19%) were thrombocytopenic. Median length of stay was 6.5 days (range 1-41, 1Q:4, 3Q:12). Among those hospitalized, 20/88 (22.7%) received care in the ICU or high dependency unit, with a median ICU stay of 7 days (range 1- 22, 1Q:2.5, 3Q:9.5);of those admitted to the ICU, 25% (5/20) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Of those in whom inpatient medications were recorded (n = 63), 63% received corticosteroids, 46% received remdesivir, and 14% received convalescent plasma. One pt received bamlanivimab and 2 patients received tocilizumab. Most (46/63;73%) received anticoagulation, primarily prophylactic low molecular weight heparin;11/63 (17%) received therapeutic dose anticoagulation. Inpatient D-dimer values were recorded in 43 inpatients, 26 of whom had multiple measurements. 16/98 hospitalizations ended with death (16%). Conclusions: Preliminary analysis of NCCAPS data reveals that inpatient hospital admission is common among oncology patients with COVID-19 and mortality rates appear high within this cohort. Hematologic malignancies and lung cancer are the most common underlying diagnoses in patients requiring hospitalization. Corticosteroids and anti-coagulation were the most commonly used therapies. Despite high rates of ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation may be instituted less often in an oncology cohort. These observations may inform decisions about vaccine policy and decisions to limit life sustaining treatment.","Mark, N. M.; Best, A. F.; Khorana, A. A.; Pergam, S.; Mishkin, G.

We developed the SIRDV-Virulence epidemiological model based on a population balance equation to study the effect of mutants of the virus and the effect of vaccination strategies on mitigating the transmission among the population in the United States. Based on the available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we obtain the key parameters governing the dynamic evolution of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context studied, the results show that a large fraction of infected cases comes from the adult and children populations in the presence of a mutant variant of COVID-19 with high infection rates. We further investigate the optimum vaccine distribution strategy among different age groups. Given the current situation in the United States, the results show that prioritizing children and adult vaccinations over that of seniors can contain the spread of the active cases, thereby preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed and minimizing subsequent deaths. The model suggests that the only option to curb the effects of this pandemic is to reduce the population of unvaccinated individuals. A higher fraction of 'Anti/Non-vaxxers' can lead to the resurgence of the pandemic.","Roy, J.; Heath, S.; Ramkrishna, D.; Wang, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.25.21264118v1?rss=1,285

However, in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), priority should be given to an early endoscopy. Objective: The main objective was to compare the time since arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy between both groups. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective study. Data contains information of patients who attended to the hospital with UGIB and underwent an endoscopy between October 19th, 2019 and June 6th, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 phases: Pre-pandemic and pandemic. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy in both phases were compared as well as other indicators such hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Results: With information from 219 patients, the median age was 69 years. 154 and 65 endoscopies were performed in pre-pandemic and pandemic phase, respectively. The time between arrival at the hospital and the performance of the endoscopy was significantly longer during the pandemic (10.00 vs. 13.08 hours, p-value = 0.019). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in hospital stay or mortality. Conclusion: The management of patients with UGIB during the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and requires the application of clinical judgment to decide the best timing to perform an endoscopy without affecting patient care.","Benites-Goñi, H.; Pascacio-Fiori, M.; Monge-Del Valle, F.; Plácido-Damián, Z.; Gonzales-Carazas, E.; Padilla-Espinoza, M.; Prado-Bustamante, J.; Llatas-Pérez, J.; Dávalos-Moscol, M.",Revista de Gastroenterologia del Peru,https://doi.org/10.47892/rgp.2020.403.1120,285

We, a large Dermatology Department based in the south of Ireland, recognised that a dramatic reduction in face-to-face interaction must be delivered on a tight timeline to ensure patient and staff safety.The response to a crisis like this required us to refocus on our core objectives;maintaining care and safety for returning patients, whilst also providing continued access for acute and serious new referrals.With the arrival of Covid-19 to Irish shores in late February we immediately moved to telephone clinics for returning patients. Video consultations for new patients were introduced within two weeks. Later we increased the number of ‘see-and-treat’ surgical lists to manage suspected skin cancers, thereby minimising exposure risk. Our pre-existing photo-advice email service for GP’s was re-advertised, which helped us to triage referrals. Meanwhile our multidisciplinary meetings for Melanoma, Dermatology/Pathology and Dermatology/Plastic Surgery were moved to teleconferencing.We employed a ‘fail fast, learn fast’ approach. By example we soon learned that patients referred with skin lesions are not suitable for video consultation due to video fidelity issues. This led to a successful increase in ‘see-and-treat’ surgical lists to compensate.As a result of these changes we have managed to maintain our service, an achievement which is demonstrated by our clinic numbers for new and returning patients, our clinical meetings proceed uninterrupted and even unintended benefits, such as a reduction in our ‘did not attend’ rate (a decreased from 22% pre-COVID to a ‘did not answer’ rate of 7% during lockdown).Change may be forced, but in the words of Voltaire ‘Perfect is the enemy of good’.

This paper explores the need for a fit for purpose pedagogical approach for online learning, as opposed to one in which a classroom based pedagogy is applied, often rather clumsily to an online learning environment.Design/methodology/approachThe engagement of students in an online learning environment is closely associated with student success. The argument is that students who are actively engaged are more likely to learn and to achieve greater success. Student engagement is facilitated through the design and arrangement of the learning material, and by the presence, attitude and the facilitation of learning by the online teacher or trainer.FindingsRather than presenting any research findings this paper simply explores concepts relating to online learning design and online teaching.Practical implicationsThe practical implication of this paper are better alignment between teaching/training interventions and learning design.Originality/valueThis paper is a viewpoint paper and is original.

These sites had passive acoustic monitors (PAMs) in place during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions that had the potential to affect global shipping activity. To investigate if noise levels changed after restrictions were put in place, we analyzed and compared the acoustic data collected from March 28 to April 28 and August 6 to October 22 in both 2019 and 2020 from a site located in the approaches to the Port of Halifax, one of Canada’s major ports. We also investigated possible changes in vessel traffic from February 1 through April 28 and July 1 through July 28 in 2019 and 2020 using terrestrial-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) data provided by the Canadian Coast Guard and cargo information provided by the Port of Halifax. The acoustic data were analyzed in 1/3 octave frequency bands. For the 89.1 to 112 Hz frequency band, we found an 8.4 dB increase in the daily minimum sound pressure level (SPL) in April 2020 compared to April 2019 due the presence of a large crane vessel stationed near the mooring site. For the period of August to October, we found an approximately 1.7 dB reduction in the same metric from 2019 to 2020. The most noticeable change in vessel composition was the dramatic decrease in the number and occurrence of pleasure craft in July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. While this analysis looked at only a single PAM and a limited amount of data, we observed changes in sound levels in the frequency band known to be associated with shipping as well as changes in vessel traffic;we conclude that these observed changes may be related to pandemic restrictions.","Breeze, Heather Li Shihan Marotte Emmaline C.; Theriault, James A.; Wingfield, Jessica Xu Jinshan",Frontiers in Marine Science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.674788,285

The study analysed over 179 million tweets posted between March 22 and April 13, 2020 and the global COVID-19 infection rates using evolutionary clustering analysis. Results showed six clusters constructed for each term type, including three-level n-grams (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams). The frequent occurrences of unigrams (""COVID-19"", ""virus"", ""government"", ""people"", etc.), bigrams (""COVID 19"", ""COVID-19 cases"", ""times share"", etc.) and trigrams (""COVID 19 crisis"", ""things help stop""and ""trying times share"") were identified. The results demonstrated that the unigram trends on Twitter were up to about two times and 54 times more common than the bigram terms and trigram terms, respectively. Unigrams like ""home""or ""need""also became important as these terms reflected the main concerns of people during this period. Taken together, the present findings confirm that many tweets were used to broadcast people's prevalent topics of interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the results indicate that the number of COVID-19 infections had a significant effect on all clusters, being strong on 86% of clusters and moderate on 16% of clusters. The downward slope in global infection rates reflected the start of the trending of ""social distancing""and ""stay at home"".

Highly efficient and high-power UV-LEDs, capable of inactivating viruses in a short time, are in demand. For this purpose, the growth technologies of n-type AlGaN contact layers were developed from two points of view: first, to decrease the resistivity of n-type Al0.62Ga0.38N by minimizing the electron compensation, resulting in electronic degeneracy with metallic conduction;second, to improve the light emission uniformity in AlGaN multiquantum wells (MQWs) by controlling the morphology of the underlying n-type AlGaN layer to inhibit macrostep formation. A UV-LED module emitting at 275 nm was demonstrated with the developed growth technology, and illuminated with an irradiation power of 2.6 mW cm(-2) on SARS-CoV-2 samples. Over 99.999 % of viruses were inactivated within 5 s owing to the high power of this module.","Saito, Y.; Wada, S.; Nagata, K.; Makino, H.; Boyama, S.; Miwa, H.; Matsui, S.; Kataoka, K.; Narita, T.; Horibuchi, K.",Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/ac10f2,285
185454,Case Report: Handwashing-Induced Dermatitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-15,"Determining an optimal protein configuration for the employment of protein binding analysis as completed by Temperature based Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (T-REMD) is an important process in the accurate depiction of a protein’s behavior in different solvent environments, especially when determining a protein’s top binding sites for use in protein-ligand and protein-protein docking studies. However, the completion of this analysis, which pushes out top binding sites through configurational changes, is an polynomial-state computational problem that can take multiple hours to compute, even on the fastest supercomputers. In this study, we aim to determine if graph cutting provide approximated solutions the MaxCut problem can be used as a method to provide similar results to T-REMD in the determination of top binding sites of Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) for binding analysis. Additionally, we utilize a quantum-hybrid algorithm within Iff Technology’s Polar+ package using an actual quantum processor unit (QPU), an implementation of Polar+ using an emulated QPU, or Quantum Abstract Machine (QAM), on a large scale classical computing device, and an implementation of a classical MaxCut algorithm on a supercomputer in order to determine the types of advantages that can be gained through using a quantum computing device for this problem, or even using quantum algorithms on a classical device. This study found that Polar+ provides a dramatic speedup over a classical implementation of a MaxCut approximation algorithm or the use of GROMACS T-REMD, and produces viable results, in both its QPU and QAM implementations. However, the lack of direct configurational changes carried out onto the structure of SP-A after the use of graph cutting methods produces different final binding results than those produced by GROMACS T-REMD. Thus, further work needs to be completed into translating quantum-based probabilities into configurational changes based on a variety of noise conditions to better determine the accuracy advantage that quantum algorithms and quantum devices can provide in the near future.","Sandeep, Samarth; Aramyan, Sona; Poghosyan, Armen H.; Gupta, Vaibhav",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.420968,285
186029,Promoting Social Connectedness among Cardiac Rehabilitation Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.,2020-11-02,"Rotavirus VP7 is a membrane-associated protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the product of rotavirus gene 9 which potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids that contains two amino terminal hydrophobic domains, h1 and h2, each preceded by an initiation codon. Comparison of the size of products derived from altered genes containing coding sequences for both h1 and h2 with those lacking the h1 sequence ('dhl' mutants), indicates that initiation takes place at M30 immediately preceding h2 (residues F32 to L48) and that h2 is cleaved, confirming the studies of others (Stirzaker, S.C., P.L. Whitfeld, D.L. Christie, A.R. Bellamy, and G.W. Both. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2897-2903). Our previous work had shown that deletions in the carboxy end of h2, extending to amino acid 61 in the open reading frame, resulted in secretion of VP7. The region from amino acid number 51-61, present in wild-type VP7 but missing in the secreted mutant delta 47-61, was thus implicated to have a role in ER retention. To test this, a series of chimeric genes were constructed by fusing the first 63 codons of wild-type VP7, delta 1-14 or delta 51-61/dhl, to the mouse salivary alpha-amylase gene, a secretory protein, such that the fusion junction was located at the exact mature terminus of amylase. The chimeric proteins VP7(63)/amylase, delta 1-14(63)/amylase and delta 51-61(63)/dhl/amylase were secreted when expressed in cells and the h2 domain was cleaved when mRNA was translated in vitro. These results imply that the sequence 51-61 is necessary but not sufficient for ER retention. When a second series of VP7/amylase chimera were constructed extending the VP7 contribution to amino acid 111, the product expressed by delta 1-14(111)/amylase was not secreted whereas that of delta 47- 61(111)/amylase was. Significantly, the intracellular delta 1- 14(111)/amylase product exhibited an amylase enzymatic specific activity that was similar to that of the wild-type amylase product. We conclude that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER, the first lies within the sequence 51-61 and the second within the sequence 62-111, which contains the glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient alone.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115309/,285
186052,Effect of Dexmedetomidine with Ropivacaine in Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block.,2019,"We tested the role of the “spring-loaded” conformational change in the fusion mechanism of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) by assessing the effects of 10 point mutants in the region of high coiled-coil propensity, HA2 54–81. The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction (∼60– 80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion. An alternate model is discussed.","Qiao, Hui; Pelletier, Sandra L.; Hoffman, Lucas; Hacker, Jill; Armstrong, R.

To examine this in the context of respiratory infections, acute-phase respiratory specimens submitted to our clinical diagnostic microbiology/virology laboratory for our routine VIRAP diagnosis protocol during the spring 2006 peak respiratory infection season were processed in parallel by analysis with Genaco (QiaPlex) ResPlex I and ResPlex II molecular diagnostic panels. A total of 1,742 specimens were examined for 21 relevant targets each. The resulting data reveal that multiple infections are frequent and provide evidence for complex interactions between different infectious agents. Statistically relevant association patterns (both positive and negative) were observed between particular pathogens. While some interactions we observed are substantiated by prior reports in the literature, several specific patterns do not appear to have been reported previously. In addition, we report preliminary clinical evidence which supports a hypothesis that these coinfections are medically relevant and that effective treatment for severe respiratory tract infections will increasingly require diagnosis of all involved pathogens, as opposed to single-pathogen reporting.","Brunstein, John D; Cline, Christy L; McKinney, Steven; Thomas, Eva",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17977985/,285
187534,Videoconferences of Infectious Diseases: An educational tool that transcends borders. A useful tool also for the current COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Mucosal antibody defense depends on a complex cooperation between local B cells and secretory epithelia. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue gives rise to B cells with striking J-chain expression that are seeded to secretory effector sites. Such preferential homing constitutes the biological basis for local production of polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) and pentameric IgM with high affinity to the epithelial pIg receptor that readily can export these antibodies to the mucosal surface. This ultimate functional goal of mucosal B-cell differentiation appears to explain why the J chain is also expressed by IgG- and IgD-producing plasma cells (PCs) occurring at secretory tissue sites; these immunocytes may be considered as 'spin-offs' from early effector clones that through class switch are on their way to pIgA production. Abundant evidence supports the notion that intestinal PCs are largely derived from B cells initially activated in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Nevertheless, insufficient knowledge exists concerning the relative importance of M cells, major histocompatibility complex class II-expressing epithelial cells, and professional antigen-presenting cells for the uptake, processing, and presentation of luminal antigens in GALT to accomplish the extensive and sustained priming and expansion of mucosal B cells. Likewise, it is unclear how the germinal center reaction in GALT so strikingly can promote class switch to IgA and expression of J chain. Although B-cell migration from GALT to the intestinal lamina propria is guided by rather well-defined adhesion molecules and chemokines/chemokine receptors, the cues directing preferential homing to different segments of the gut require better definition. This is even more so for the molecules involved in homing of mucosal B cells to secretory effector sites beyond the gut, and in this respect, the role of Waldever's ring (including the palatine tonsils and adenoids) as a regional inductive tissue needs further characterization. Data suggest a remarkable compartmentalization of the mucosal immune system that must be taken into account in the development of effective local vaccines to protect specifically the airways, eyes, oral cavity, small and large intestines, and urogenital tract.","Brandtzaeg, Per; Johansen, Finn-Eirik",Immunological reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16048541/,285

Here, we demonstrate that CD13 controls endothelial cell invasion in response to the serum peptide bradykinin by facilitating signal transduction at the level of the plasma membrane. Inhibition of CD13 abrogates bradykinin B(2) receptor internalization, leading to the attenuation of downstream events such as bradykinin-induced activation of Cdc42 and filopodia formation, and thus affects endothelial cell motility. Investigation into mechanisms underlying this block led us to focus on B(2)R internalization via membrane-dependent mechanisms. Membrane disruption by depletion of cholesterol or trypsinization halts B(2)R internalization, invasion, and filopodia formation, which can be recovered with addition of cholesterol. However, this functional recovery is severely impaired in the presence of CD13 antagonists, and the distribution of membrane proteins is disordered in treated cells, suggesting a role for CD13 in plasma membrane protein organization. Finally, exogenous expression of wild-type but not mutant CD13 further alters protein distribution, suggesting peptidase activity is required for CD13's regulatory activity. Therefore, CD13 functions as a novel modulator of signal transduction and cell motility via its influence on specific plasma membrane organization, thus regulating angiogenesis.","Petrovic, Nenad; Schacke, Wolfgang; Gahagan, J Reed; O'Conor, Catherine A; Winnicka, Beata; Conway, Rebecca E; Mina-Osorio, Paola; Shapiro, Linda H",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17363739/,285

METHODS This retrospective study included all breast cancer patients that underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in the General Surgery Clinic of Adana City Training and Research Hospital, a regional pandemic hospital, between March 11, 2020 and December 25, 2020. The patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively (the first 30 days) in terms of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, these patients were also evaluated in terms of admission to the hospital, length of hospital stay, and mortality due to COVID-19 infection during the follow-up period of the study. RESULTS Included in the study were 139 patients that underwent surgery for breast cancer during the pandemic period, with no observed mortality or morbidity associated with COVID-19 in any patient postoperatively within the first 30 days. In addition, within 121.22±70.05 days, the mean and standard deviation of the study's follow-up period, 19 patients (15.7%) were admitted to the hospital with a suspected COVID-19 infection (after the first 30 days postoperatively) and 6 of them (4.3%) returned a positive PCR test. All of the COVID-19 positive patients (6 patients, 4.3%) were hospitalised and 3 of them (2.2%) died due to the COVID-19 infection.

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common and caused by diarrheagenic E. coli and other patho- gens. Undifferentiated fever challenges physicians to correctly diagnose and includes ma- laria, dengue, and enteric fever. The pre-test probability for a disease which causes undiffer- entiated fever largely depends on the travel destination. Malaria is most common in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa while dengue is most common those returning from Southeast Asia and Latin America. Screening for asymptomatic travelers is not generally rec- ommended, but for long-term travelers and immigrants. Following outbreaks of highly infectious diseases in the past decades, hospital prepared- ness for travel-related infections focuses on infection prevention and control. Emerging viral pneumonias such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and avian influenza H7N9 are major concerns. As seen in the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, imported viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa fever is another concern. Since multidrug resistant bacteria silently spread globally by infected travelers, it would be of help to install appropriate isolation precaution for travelers with history of hospital admission abroad.","Kato, Yasuyuki",Nihon rinsho.

Antibiotics are often prescribed unnecessarily for it, although no evidence exists for any benefit in the CC. Effective alternatives are needed. Objective • The study intended to evaluate the efficacy of 7630, a proprietary extract of Pelargonium sidoides, the active ingredient in umckaloabo, compared with a placebo for the treatment of the CC. Design • This was a prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial (RCT), with an adaptive group-sequential design with 2 parts, both of which were 2-arm trials. The first used a standard dose (SD) of 3 × 30 drops per day of the active medication and the second used a high dose (HD) of 3 × 60 drops per day of the active medication, against 3 × 30 drops per day and 3 × 60 drops per day of a placebo, respectively. Setting • The study took place in 8 outpatient departments affiliated with hospitals. Participants • For the entire study, 207 adults with predefined cold symptoms that had been present for 24 to 48 h prior were included in the study, with 103 participating in the SD part and 104 participating in the HD part. Intervention • In the HD part, as covered in this article, the intervention group received treatment with 3 × 60 drops per day of the active medication and the control group received a placebo (control group), for a maximum period of 10 d. Outcome Measures • The primary outcome measure was the sum of differences in the cold intensity score (CIS) from day 1 to day 3 and from day 1 to day 5, defined as the sum of the symptom intensity differences (SSID). The criteria for the secondary outcome, efficacy, were (1) diverse response criteria according to the total CIS; (2) changes in individual CIS symptoms; (3) changes in further cold-relevant symptoms; (4) ability to work; (5) activity level; (6) general well-being; (7) health-related quality of life-the EuroQol questionnaire with 5 dimensions (EQ-5D), including the visual analogue scale EQ-VAS; (8) time until onset of treatment effect; (9) treatment outcome; and (10) satisfaction with treatment. Results • From baseline to day 5, the mean CIS decreased by 11.2 ± 4.8 points for the 7630 group and 6.3 ± 4.7 points for the control group. The mean SSID was 16.0 ± 7.6 points for the control group (P < .0001). After 10 d, 90.4% of the group receiving the active medication and 21.2% of the control group were clinically cured (P < .0001). In the treatment group, participants' inability to work was significantly lower, with a mean duration of 6.4 ± 1.6 d vs 8.3 ± 2.1 d for the control group (P < .0001), and treatment outcome-complete recovery or major improvement-was significantly better at day 5 for the active treatment group compared with the control group (P < .0001). Mild-to-moderate adverse events-all nonserious-occurred in 15.4% of those receiving active treatment vs in 5.8% for the control group. Conclusions • The active medication is an effective, well tolerated, and safe treatment for the CC. It significantly reduces the severity of symptoms and shortens the duration of the disease.","Riley, David S; Lizogub, Viktor G; Zimmermann, Andrea; Funk, Petra; Lehmacher, Walter",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29055287/,285

In this study, we found that a 9-nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the leader RNA up-regulated mRNA transcription and that a particular strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) lacking this 9-nucleotide transcribed subgenomic mRNA species containing unusually heterogeneous leader-fusion sites. These results suggest that the sequence complementarity between the leader and IG is not necessarily required for mRNA transcription. UV cross-linking experiments using cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells and the IG sequence showed that three different cellular proteins bound to IG of the template RNA. Deletion analyses and site-directed mutagenesis of IG further demonstrated a correlation between protein-binding and transcription efficiency, suggesting that these RNA-binding proteins are involved in the regulation of coronavirus mRNA transcription.

Thermo-scientific MIE pDR 1500 PM monitor was used to measure the particulate matter on the dumpsite. The CO2 levels (697±28.84 - 502±2.19) were above the minimum permissible levels of ASHRAE of 400ppm for all platforms at the dumpsite. CH4 levels range (73.33±3.32 - 18.33±4.27) was above the methane explosive limits (MEL) of 15% for all Platforms, however the level at 25m and 50m offsets (14.83±4.11 - 13.83±2.48) was below the MEL for 75m and 100m offsets. PM2.5 levels were lower in the morning and peaked in the afternoon at Platform 5, 6 and 9 locations with values of 62.76±6.03, 63.9±11.37 and 32.06±3.89 respectively which is not within the WHO minimum permissible limit of 25µg/m3. There was a significant positive correlation between CO2 and CH4 (r=0.7558, p=0.028) but no significant correlation between CO2 and other meteorological parameters (temperature and humidity) (r=-0.1309, p=0.67and r=0.09644, p=0.754). The carbon dioxide and methane content of the gaseous emission from the Awotan dump site are potential health hazard, hence the need for an engineering design that will reduce the quantum of the emission thereby reducing the hazard.","Oladejo, Oluyemisi J; Alaka, Oluwaseun E; Jarikre, Theophilus A; Ockiya, Michael A; Adeniran, Ganiyu Adetunji; Ajani, Rotimi S; Emikpe, Benjamin O",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084619/,285
199638,Proposal of Research Model for the Detection of COVID-19 among Asymptomatic Carriers,2020,"Background Antepartum assessment of the fetus is very important to prevent intra-uterine demise, birth asphyxia, neurological defect of newborns and neonatal mortality. Cardiotocography is the best indicator for fetal surveillance during labour in low resource country. Objective To assess on admission cardiotocography and predict perinatal outcome of antenatal mothers admitted to labour room for delivery at Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method A prospective, observational study was conducted from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2017. Antenatal mothers were evaluated in admission cardiotocography for 20 minutes. Cardiotocography studies were interpreted and categorized according to the classification proposed by National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)- clinical guidelines 2007. Result Total 204 mothers were enrolled, the mean age is 24.06±4.331. Cardiotocography interpretation shows, 81.4% of Normal, 13.7% suspected and only 4.9% accounts pathological. Mother having CTG of pathological had more operative delivery 80% compare to normal and suspicious (0.0001). Similarly, more meconium stained liquor fall in pathological group with p value of 0.002. Fetal distress in labour is seen in all groups, showing 13.3% in normal, 32.1% in suspicious and 80% in pathological with p value 0.000. The duration of on admission cardiotocography to occurrence of fetal distress found to be mean hour of 9.57. Conclusion The admission cardiotocography test is useful to detect fetal distress which is already present at the time of test and can predict fetal wellbeing during the next few hours of labour. This test might lead to higher incidence of operative delivery at low resource countries because of lack of fetal blood sampling test to confirm fetal hypoxia during labour.","Shrestha, S; Shrestha, I",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305748/,285

Based on prior results, it was hypothesized that compounds inhibiting biofilm formation by O104:H4 would reduce its pathogenesis. The nonionic surfactants polysorbate 80 (PS80) and polysorbate 20 (PS20) were found to reduce biofilms by ≥ 90% at submicromolar concentrations and elicited nearly complete dispersal of preformed biofilms. PS80 did not significantly impact in vivo colonization in a mouse infection model; however, mice treated with PS80 exhibited almost no intestinal inflammation or tissue damage while untreated mice exhibited robust pathology. As PS20 and PS80 are classified as 'Generally Recognized as Safe' (GRAS) compounds by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), these compounds have clinical potential to treat future O104:H4 outbreaks.","Sloup, Rudolph E; Cieza, Roberto J; Needle, David B; Abramovitch, Robert B; Torres, Alfredo G; Waters, Christopher M",Biofouling,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667095/,285

201653,COVID-19 outbreak in post-soviet states: Modeling the best and worst possible scenarios,2020,"The antigenic relationships among seven feline coronavirus isolates were investigated by using a panel of 26 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The MAbs were categorized into five immunoreactive groups which were used to delineate two antigenic types of feline coronaviruses. One antigenic type included the more virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) isolates (FIPV-UCD-1, FIPV-UCD-4, FIPV-TN406, FIPV-DF2, and FIPV-79-1146), whereas the second antigenic type was composed of the avirulent isolate FIPV-UCD-2. The feline enteric coronavirus isolate FECV-79-1683 shared some characteristics of both of the major antigenic groups. Epitopes on the nucleocapsid and envelope polypeptides were in general highly conserved among both antigenic types, although a few type-specific antigenic sites were discriminated. The most striking finding was the marked antigenic difference in the peplomer (E2) glycoproteins between the two antigenic types. Seven anti-E2 MAbs reacted with one antigenic type of E2, whereas seven other anti-E2 MAbs recognized a different antigenic form of E2. None of the 14 anti-E2 MAbs reacted with all of the isolates.","Fiscus, S A; Teramoto, Y A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3599183/,285

201982,What has caused the fall in stroke admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND Macrophages can imbibe low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through scavenger receptors to become foam cells, which is critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Mounting evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory nature of Chinese herbs have the capacity to halt the complex mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. This study examined the effects of Chinese herbs on foam cell formation. METHODS Chinese herbs were obtained from the Sun Ten pharmaceutic company. Using oxidized LDL (OxLDL) uptake and a cell toxicity assay, we screened more than 30 types of Chinese herbs. Western blotting was used to determine expressions of scavenger receptors (SRs) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities. RESULTS We found that Gentiana scabra reduced oxidized LDL uptake effectively in THP-1 macrophages (p < 0.05 vs. OxLDL treated control). Moreover, treatment with Gentiana scabra in THP-1 macrophages resulted in decreased expression of scavenger receptor- A (SR-A) (p < 0.05 vs. control). Molecular investigation revealed that Gentiana scabra inhibited SR-A protein expression, possibly by regulating ERK signaling pathways (p < 0.05 vs. control). CONCLUSIONS By regulating SR-A expression, Gentiana scabra reduced oxidized LDL uptake in human macrophages. These results support the potential use of Gentiana scabra in treating atherosclerosis.","Lin, Chin-Sheng; Liu, Pang-Yen; Lian, Chen-Hao; Lin, Ching-Heng; Lai, Jenn-Haung; Ho, Ling-Jun; Yang, Shih-Ping; Cheng, Shu-Meng",Acta Cardiologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471359/,285
202830,A rare case of constrictive pericarditis withco-existing positive COVID-19: Probableautoimmune or immunoglobulin related disease,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing has grown exponentially in the United States since the dawn of the pandemic, with the vast majority of samples being obtained via nasopharyngeal swab. Although convenient and widely used, the test itself carries potential adverse effects, particularly those at high risk of bleeding. We present a patient who developed several arrays of complications after being tested for COVID-19 using the nasal swab sampling technique. Case Presentation: An 80-yo female presented from home with a complaint of hematuria. Her past medical history includes rheumatic heart disease status post repair on warfarin, atrial fibrillation and stroke. Vital signs were normal. She had benign head and neck exam, clear lung sounds, an irregular heart rhythm and a normal abdominal exam. Labs were at baseline with hemoglobin of 10.4. Chest x-ray and CT abdomen were unremarkable. She received a PCR nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency room and subsequently developed profuse epistaxis. Initial nasal packing and Afrin sprays failed to control the bleeding and she required emergent intubation for airway protection. She also needed vasopressors due to hypotension. Repeat hemoglobin was 7.5 and lactic acid was 10.4. Bleeding eventually stopped after continuous nasal packing, transfusional support and IV vitamin K. In the following days, she developed fever, leukocytosis and lung infiltrates. She received empiric antibiotic coverage, although no growth from cultures. Endoscopy findings were consistent with ischemic colitis. Later, she stabilized hemodynamically but was unable to be liberated from the ventilator. She was discharge to a long-term care facility after 43 days of stay. Discussion: Nasopharyngeal swabs are the mainstay of testing for COVID-19, however, little has been discussed regarding its procedural risks. Common adverse effects include headaches, nasal pain, ear discomfort and rhinorrhea. Recent studies have suggested that the incidence of epistaxis can be as high as 10% after the test. Alternatively, multiple research centers, including Yale and University of Illinois have released promising data on saliva-based testing. Their evidence supported high sensitivity comparable to the nasopharyngeal method with simpler and safer nature. Also, the saliva-based testing can be done at home, which is believed to reduce healthcare cost and lower the risk of cross infection. This case vividly demonstrates that even the most common procedure can result in devastating outcomes. As such, health care providers should be cognizant of these complications and consider alternative testing method when possible.","Meng, W.; Miller, R. A.; Pate, S.; Nanavati, S.

The current study aimed to describe changes in family rules and routines during the first year of pediatric cancer treatment, and to explore associations with demographics, illness factors, and caregiver distress. METHODS: This exploratory mixed-methods, cross-sectional study examined 44 primary caregivers of youth in treatment for a new cancer diagnosis in 2019 and 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers completed validated questionnaires assessing demographic and child illness characteristics, psychosocial distress, and cancer-related stressors, and participated in a semi-structured interview about family rules and routines. RESULTS: Caregivers reported changes in bedtime, mealtime, and school routines, relaxed behavioral expectations and rules around screen time, and new rules and routines around treatment, medications, and infection control. Caregivers with elevated levels of psychosocial distress reported more changed routines than caregivers with low levels of psychosocial distress. Caregivers who endorsed more cancer-related stressors reported more new rules and routines than those who reported fewer cancer-related stressors. Demographic and illness factors were not significantly associated with the number of changed, new, or stable family rules and routines. CONCLUSIONS: Families may relax rules and routines during the first several months of diagnosis, and this may be related to side effects of treatment and limited caregiver capacity. The long-term impact of changes in family rules and routines during cancer treatment warrants further study given that accommodating parenting strategies have been associated with adverse short- and long-term child health and behavior outcomes.","Bates, Carolyn R; Pallotto, Isabella K; Moore, Rachel M; Fornander, Mirae J; Covitz, Lynne M; Dreyer Gillette, Meredith L",Psycho-oncol.

204428,Covid-19 outbreak highlights: Importance of home- based rehabilitation in orthopedic surgery,2020,"We performed a retrospective study from January to May 2020 to establish the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with mental health problems who arrived at an Italian emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak. We divided the sample into two groups taking as a watershed March 11, when the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Chi-square/t-tests, adjusted p values (Bonferroni method), and regression analysis were performed. Patients who arrived at the emergency department during the lockdown decreased by 56%; showed greater active suicidal ideation, more tension, and more severe psychopathological state; were living alone more frequently; and were taking home treatment mainly based on second-generation antipsychotics. According to our study, it seems that patients with mental disorders have consulted psychiatric services less frequently during the pandemic, but the economic, health, and social distress may be linked with an increase in suicidal risk and the severity of the psychopathological state.","Montalbani, Benedetta; Bargagna, Paride; Mastrangelo, Martina; Sarubbi, Salvatore; Imbastaro, Benedetta; De Luca, Gabriele Pasquale; Anibaldi, Gaia; Erbuto, Denise; Pompili, Maurizio; Comparelli, Anna",,,285

Prospective biomarkers may help to predict the severity of an individual's clinical course and mortality risk. We analyzed asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in blood samples from 31 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We calculated associations of ADMA and SDMA with mortality and organ failure, and we developed a predictive algorithm based upon these biomarkers to predict mortality risk. Nine patients (29%) experienced in-hospital death. SDMA and ADMA serum concentrations were significantly higher at admission in COVID-19 patients who died than in survivors. Cut-offs of 0.90 µmol/L for SDMA (AUC, 0.904, p = 0.0005) and 0.66 µmol/L for ADMA (AUC, 0.874, p = 0.0013) were found in ROC analyses to best discriminate both subgroups of patients. Hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality was 12.2 (95% CI: 2.2-31.2) for SDMA and 6.3 (1.1-14.7) for ADMA above cut-off. Sequential analysis of both biomarkers allowed discriminating a high-risk group (87.5% mortality) from an intermediate-risk group (25% mortality) and a low-risk group (0% mortality). Elevated circulating concentrations of SDMA and ADMA may help to better identify COVID-19 patients with a high risk of in-hospital mortality.","Hannemann, Juliane; Balfanz, Paul; Schwedhelm, Edzard; Hartmann, Bojan; Ule, Johanna; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Dahl, Edgar; Dreher, Michael; Marx, Nikolaus",Sci Rep,,285

Many ways to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus are sought to prevent the spread of this virus. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are considered for the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has a high similarity to previous colonic diseases. AIM: We aimed to determine whether azithromycin and clarithromycin, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, is effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 503 analogues of azithromycin and clarithromycin were studied to target SARS-CoV-2 the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein inhibition. Maestro program was used to compare the inhibition activities of these analogues. A detailed comparison was made using the numerical value of many parameters obtained. ADME / T properties were then examined to determine the effects and reactions of analogues on human metabolism. In this study, the SARS-CoV2 virus is 6NUR and 6NUS, which is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein. Among these proteins, the best inhibitor among the 503 analogues according to the docking score parameter was 9851445 with a great difference. This analogue was an analogue of azithromycin (Tab. 3, Fig. 6, Ref. 58).","Gedikli, M A; Tuzun, B; Aktas, A; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratisl Lek Listy,,285

209976,Can we safely use systemic treatment in atopic dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic? Overview of selected conventional and biologic systemic therapies,2021,"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been used to treat different residual solid tumors after tumor removal and has shown many advantages over other treatment methods. However, the use of IORT for invasive thymoma has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we tried to determine the safety and efficacy of INTRABEAM IORT for the treatment of invasive thymoma.Among the patients admitted to our hospital from September to December 2016 who were diagnosed with invasive thymoma, 14 were selected as study subjects. With medical histories taken beforehand, 8 of these patients were diagnosed with Masaoka stage IIA and 6 with Masaoka stage IIB; furthermore, 5 of the patients were diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). INTRABEAM radiation (8-10 Gy, low energy) was delivered to the postoperative tumor bed of each patient during surgery. The intra- and postoperative complications were observed and evaluated, and the improvement in symptoms was assessed. An additional 23 patients with stage II thymoma undergoing radical surgery from April to August 2016 were chosen as the control group.One month after the operation, only 1 patient in the IORT group had cough, increased levels of leucocytes and neutrophils, and pulmonary inflammation on chest computed tomography. Reactive inflammation and pleural effusion in the 2 groups were similar (Pâ>â.05). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the improvement of myasthenia gravis (Pâ>â.05). Postoperative chest computed tomography and routine blood examination at 3 and 12 months showed that all the patients recovered, with normal hemogram levels and no pulmonary fibrosis around the radiation field. In addition, ultrasonic cardiography and electrocardiography demonstrated no significant difference before or after surgery within the IORT group. At the end of the follow-up, all the patients were alive, no relapse or remote metastasis was observed in the IORT group, and 2 inpatients in the control group had experienced relapse at 24 and 26 months. There was a significant difference in disease-free survival between the 2 groups (Pâ=â.00).It is safe to administer low-energy INTRABEAM IORT at a dose of approximately 10 Gy in patients with stage II invasive thymoma. INTRABEAM IORT does not significantly increase operation- or radiation-related complications and has no significant effect on vital organs such as the lungs and heart. Its long-term efficacy is worth expecting.","Cui, Tian-Xiang; Dai, Ji-Gang; Li, Jing-Meng; Qian, Jin-Dong; Li, Guang-Hui; Sun, Jian-Guo",Medicine (Baltimore),,285

210384,Telemedicine for Outpatient Neurosurgical Oncology Care: Lessons Learned for the Future During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: The Malaysian government implemented MCO or lockdown for nearly 3 months from 18 Mar to 9 Jun 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This restricted access to usual food, workplace, and leisure sports, and also led to reduced clinic attendance. The effects of MCO on patients with chronic lifestyle diseases like DM is unknown. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study exploring effects of MCO on adult (&amp;gt;18 years) DM patients (both Type 1 and Type 2) attending endocrinologist-run DM clinics in 3 tertiary centres in Malaysia. Glycaemic and metabolic parameters were collected through medical record review while data on healthcare utilisation, dietary and lifestyle habits before MCO (17 Nov 2019 to 17 Mar 2020) and during MCO were collected by investigator-administered questionnaires during routine clinic follow-up after the MCO period (10 Jun to 30 Oct 2020). Results: From a total of 207 patients (56.5% female, 73.4% T2D and 80% on insulin) no significant difference between mean (SD) A1c [8.6(2.39) % vs 8.4(2.14) %;p=0.073] or BMI [29.2(7.57) vs 29.4(9.23)kg/m2;p=0.968] were seen before and during MCO respectively. More than 95% of the patients attended clinic before MCO and at least 20.3% saw either the DM nurse educator, DM pharmacist or dietitian. In contrast, during MCO only 31.4% of patients attended clinic and less than 10% had face-to-face consultation with the DM support team. More patients also reported missing insulin (11.6% vs 7.7%) and not checking blood glucose (17.9% vs 15.5%) during MCO. Before MCO, 61.8% of patients had home-cooked food daily. During MCO this increased to 83.1%. However, there was a trend towards unhealthy eating during MCO. Patients reported eating more frequently with those eating more than 4 meals a day nearly tripled during MCO (18.4% vs 6.8%). In addition, 22% of patients recalled consuming more confectionary;a similar percentage also reported higher consumption of processed food like dry snacks, canned food and instant noodles during MCO. Mean (SD) hours of sleep [6.8 (1.35) vs 7.2 (1.73) hours;p&amp;lt;0.001] and screen time [3.3 (2.51) vs 4.51 (3.10] hours, p&amp;lt;0.001) increased significantly during MCO compared to before. Notably, before MCO 44% of patients reported no exercise and this increased to 65.7% during MCO. Conclusion: Despite reduced clinic attendance and contact with the DM support team, there were no consequent significant change in A1c or BMI of our DM patients from the 3-month MCO in our short term study. However, a worrying increase in sedentariness and unhealthy eating existed. The imperative need to conduct work or lessons online, among others contributed to the inevitable rise in screen time and reduced physical activity. As the pandemic continues with imposed movement restrictions, the long-term implications of MCO to metabolic health warrant our attention. Innovative strategies to promote healthier living during MCO are urgently needed.","Kuan, Yueh Chien Tong Chin Voon Katiman Elliyyin Tiong Xun Ting Chan Pei Lin Tan Florence Noor Nurain Mohd",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,285

(Special Issue: COVID-19: disease progression, impact & comorbidity.)",2020,"In this paper, we propose an architecture to solve a novel problem statement that has stemmed more so in recent times with an increase in demand for virtual content delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All educational institutions, workplaces, research centers, etc. are trying to bridge the gap of communication during these socially distanced times with the use of online content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired author's voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the contents of the slides in the author's voice (or any customized voice). Almost all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.","Mansoor, Muvazima; Chandar, Srikanth; Srinath, Ramamoorthy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14213v1.pdf,285
210656,"Perceived stress, resilience, well-being, and COVID 19 response in Isha yoga practitioners compared to matched controls: A research protocol",2021,"In recent times, the way of learning as well as teaching in educational institutions and organizations has undergone a significant transformation. With the outbreak of the Covid-19, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education (higher education sector) has shifted the English language learning via Blackboard. Therefore, it prompts the need to understand the technology and its antecedents better. This paper aims to evaluate the use of Blackboard as a learning tool concerning its usefulness and effectiveness along with learner satisfaction and behavioural intention. This study takes an activity theory approach to develop a research model to assess learner attitudes toward the new technology, Blackboard. The data used in this study were obtained from 156 undergraduate students using Blackboard technology at the University of Jeddah through a comprehensive questionnaire. All data analyses were performed using the structural equation modelling technique through SPSS 22 and AMOS 22. The study involved the calculation of descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation). Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the standardized factor loading and analyze the hypotheses of the study. The convergent validity was determined using composite reliability and average variance extracted along with standardized factor loading. Perceived self-efficacy, self-regulation, anxiety, autonomy, and ease of use, as well as interactive learning environments, are expected to have a positive effect on the perceived usefulness and satisfaction of Blackboard as learning tools. These are important factors to determine learner behavioural intention that consequently promote learning effectiveness. The study contributes a significant part in the adoption of technology and e-learning, which can help an institution identify the factors that motivate the students to adopt e-learning.","Alqahtani, S.

Rapid adoption of telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject 50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining 80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of teledermatology care.","Vodrahalli, Kailas; Daneshjou, Roxana; Novoa, Roberto A; Chiou, Albert; Ko, Justin M; Zou, James",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02086v1.pdf,285
211237,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Operative Volume and Residency Training at Two Academic Neurosurgery Centers in New Orleans,2021,"The current study analyzed the relationship between Coronavirus (COVID-19) Awareness, mental health, and willingness to seek professional psychological help. This was made through a quantitative approach, using online questionnaires to collect data from 855 subjects. The questionnaires included the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53) to measure mental health indicators, the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-Short Form, and the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-10 (CAS-10). An Exploratory Factor Analysis suggests that three factors underlie the CAS-10: Coronavirus Concern, Exaggerated Perception, and Immunity Perception. Results indicate a significant positive correlation between Coronavirus Concern and both general anxiety and phobic anxiety symptoms. Immunity Perception is positively related to paranoid ideation and psychotic symptoms. A Mediation Analysis determined that Coronavirus Concern has a significant positive direct effect on Openness to Seeking Psychological Treatment (OSPT), while Exaggerated Perception and Immunity Perception scores have significant direct negative effects on the Value and Need in Seeking Treatment (VNST) scores. Indirectly, the relationship between Coronavirus Concern and OPST is significantly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Similar results were found for the VNST subscale. There is a negative significant effect of Immunity Perception over OSPT mediated by Paranoid Ideation. However, the overall model only achieved small r &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coefficients for the OSPT (0.060) and VNST (0.095) scores. Comparisons in Coronavirus Awareness between sex, age, and the presence of children and older adults at home were also made. These results are discussed regarding their practical implications for mental health providers and policymakers.","Landa-Blanco, M.; Landa-Blanco, A.; Mejia-Suazo, C. J.; Martinez-Martinez, C.

The author demonstrates how environmental factors negatively impact internal processes, such as anxiety and low self-esteem. It looks at the various external factors that have led to a significant rise in perfectionism among the age group, such as a tougher social and economic environment, changes in parental rearing practices, social media and the way that young people come to define themselves narrowly by wealth and success. This is further exacerbated by the financial and psychological repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis on young people. The author explores her clinical experience as a psychotherapist working with young adults who never feel ‘good enough’. The paper will suggest that parents, schools, universities, and employers need to understand that pushing for ever higher standards is problematic and proposes ways to help young adults to value themselves and be more resilient in tackling disappointments and challenges.","Kurz, Eva",European Journal of Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling,,285

In the current research, the accuracy of counting numbers and crowd density estimation are the main concerns. Although the emergence of deep learning has greatly promoted the development of this field, crowd counting under cluttered background is still a serious challenge. In order to solve this problem, we propose a ScaleAware Crowd Counting Network (SACCN) with regional and semantic attentions. The proposed SACCN distinguishes crowd and background by applying regional and semantic self-attention mechanisms on the shallow layers and deep layers, respectively. Moreover, the asymmetric multi-scale module (AMM) is proposed to deal with the problem of scale diversity, and regional attention based dense connections and skip connections are designed to alleviate the variations on crowd scales. Extensive experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SACCN achieves satisfied superior performances and outperform most state-of-the-art methods. All codes and pretrained models will be released soon.","Yi, Qiaosi; Liu, Yunxing; Jiang, Aiwen; Li, Juncheng; Mei, Kangfu; Wang, Mingwen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01479v2.pdf,285

The target audience for this guidance includes national, regional and international policymakers, public health and healthcare planners, staff working in migrant/refugee reception and detention centres, health researchers, health professionals, and civil society organisations working with migrant populations. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the vulnerabilities of migrants and refugees living in reception and detention centres. Whilst there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is higher amongst migrants and refugees, environmental factors such as overcrowding in reception and detention centres may increase their exposure to the disease. Outbreaks in reception and detention centres can also spread quickly in the absence of adequate prevention measures. All principles of physical distancing applied in the community should be applied in migrant reception and detention settings. If physical distancing and risk-containment measures cannot be safely implemented, measures to de-congest and evacuate residents should be considered. In addition to physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene are the main non-pharmaceutical measures that should be considered and implemented in migrant reception and detention centres. Providing free and equitable prevention, testing, treatment and care to migrants and refugees in settings of reception and detention is critical at all times, but particularly in the context of COVID-19. There is no evidence that quarantining whole camps effectively limits transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in settings of reception and detention, or provides any additional protective effects for the general population, outside those that could be achieved by conventional containment and protection measures. Migrant and refugee reception and detention centres should be given priority for testing, due to the risk of rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings. All individuals with COVID-19 compatible symptoms should be tested on arrival, and possible, probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases not needing hospitalisation should be isolated or separated from others in the premises.",,Guidance on infection prevention and control of coronavirus disease,,285

215082,Obesity and diabetes as comorbidities for COVID-19: Underlying mechanisms and the role of viral-bacterial interactions,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Increased autonomic arousal is a proposed risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few studies have prospectively examined the association between physiological responses to acute psychological stress prior to a traumatic event with later PTSD symptoms. The present prospective study examined whether cardiovascular responses to an acute psychological stress task prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic predicted PTSD symptoms related to the ongoing pandemic. METHOD: Participants (N = 120) were a subsample of an ongoing research study. Phase 1 consisted of a 10-minute baseline and 4-minute acute psychological stress task with blood pressure and heart rate recorded throughout. Phase 2 was initiated two weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the ongoing pandemic. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to examine whether cardiovascular stress reactivity predicted COVID-19 PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Heart rate reactivity significantly predicted IES-intrusion, b = -.208, t = -2.28, p = .025, DR = .041, CI: [-.021 - -.001] and IES-hyperarousal b = -.224, t = -2.54, p = .012, DR = .047, CI: [-0.22 - - .003], but not IES-avoidance (p = .077). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for gender, socioeconomic status, baseline cardiovascular activity, neuroticism, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and adverse childhood experiences. There were no statistically significant associations between blood pressure with any of the IES-R subscales (p's > .12). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished heart rate responses (i.e., lower physiological arousal) to acute psychological stress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicted reported PTSD symptoms during the crisis.","Ginty, Annie T; Young, Danielle A; Tyra, Alexandra T; Hurley, Page E; Brindle, Ryan C; Williams, Sarah E",Psychosom. med,,285

Of the respondents, 44.5% self-reported weight gain during the lockdown; of these, 58.0% were women, 69.9% had previous excess weight, 44.7% lived with a relative who also gained weight, and 73.5 experienced increased appetite. Further, an increased consumption of energy-dense products was found relative to respondents who did not gain weight (p &#8804; 0.016 for all). Additionally, respondents were unaware that obesity is a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 infection, lived in smaller flats, and had a lower level of education and lower monthly income. The factors independently associated with weight gain were female gender, previous overweight or obesity, lack of food care, increased appetite, and increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages, and snacks (p &#8804; 0.023 for all). Should another lockdown be mandated, extra caution is warranted to prevent weight gain.","Sánchez, Enric; Lecube, Albert; Bellido, Diego; Monereo, Susana; Malagón, María M; Tinahones, Francisco J",Nutrients,,285

216893,Correction,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by an RNA virus termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 possesses an almost 30kbp long genome. The genome contains open-reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene, the largest one of SARS-CoV-2, encoding polyprotein PP1ab and PP1a responsible for viral transcription and replication. Several vaccines have already been approved by the respective authorities over the world to develop herd immunity among the population. In consonance with this effort, RNA interference (RNAi) technology holds the possibility to strengthen the fight against this virus. Here, we have implemented a computational approach to predict potential short interfering RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are presumed to be intrinsically active against SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we have screened miRNA library and siRNA library targeting the ORF1ab gene. We predicted the potential miRNA and siRNA candidate molecules utilizing an array of bioinformatic tools. By extending the analysis, out of 24 potential pre-miRNA hairpins and 131 siRNAs, 12 human miRNA and 10 siRNA molecules were sorted as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 based on their GC content, melting temperature (Tm), heat capacity (Cp), hybridization and minimal free energy (MFE) of hybridization. This computational study is focused on lessening the extensive time and labor needed in conventional trial and error based wet lab methods and it has the potential to act as a decent base for future researchers to develop a successful RNAi therapeutic.","Hasan, Mahedi; Ashik, Arafat Islam; Chowdhury, Md Belal; Tasnim, Atiya Tahira; Nishat, Zakia Sultana; Hossain, Tanvir; Ahmed, Shamim",Inform Med Unlocked,,285

Currently, there is no consensus on effective treatment modalities for immunodeficient CRS patients. This review aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the treatment outcomes and its limitations in patients with CRS and immunodeficiency. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from inception to April 2019 for studies reporting measurable medical or surgical treatment outcomes for adult patients with CRS and underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency. RESULTS: Of the 2459 articles screened, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria: 2 prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trials, 2 prospective case-control studies, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 7 case series. The high degree of study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Antibiotic monotherapy was not linked with significant improvement in clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic outcomes. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may potentially reduce the frequency of acute or chronic sinusitis in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) but may not improve their sinonasal symptoms. Outcomes from endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) were reported in 8 studies, which found that surgery was linked with improvement in symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, endoscopy scores, and radiographic scores. The average reported ESS revision rate was 14%. CONCLUSION: Patients with CRS and immunodeficiency likely benefit from ESS based on the available evidence. Data supporting medical therapy in this targeted population is limited overall, but there may be a potential role for immunoglobulin therapy in patients with PID and CRS.","Samargandy, Shireen; Grose, Elysia; Chan, Yvonne; Monteiro, Eric; Lee, John M; Yip, Jonathan",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,285

Fear appeals, also known as scare tactics, have been widely used to promote recommended preventive behaviors. We contend that unintended negative outcomes can result from fear appeals that intensify the already complex pandemic and efforts to contain it. We encourage public health professionals to reevaluate their desire to use fear appeals in COVID-19 health communication and recommend that evidence-based health communication be utilized to address the needs of a specific community, help people understand what they are being asked to do, explain step-by-step how to complete preventative behaviors, and consider external factors needed to support the uptake of behaviors. To aid health professionals in redirecting away from the use of fear appeals, we offer a phased approach to creating health communication messages during the COVID-19 crisis.","Stolow, Jeni A; Moses, Lina M; Lederer, Alyssa M; Carter, Rebecca",Health Educ Behav,,285
217427,Reply to: Early detection of COVID-19 in Portugal: Use of clinical records,2021,"In late December 2019, a new type of coronavirus, called novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a major outbreak of severe pneumonia in Wuhan (Huanan seafood market) and then, across China. As of 31 March 2020, COVID-19 has spread in 200 countries, including Iran, and imposed serious health-related threats to the public worldwide. Fever, dry (non-productive) cough, myalgia, and pneumonia seem to be the symptoms of COVID-19 disease. To date, and despite various studies and investigations, except for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have recently been temporarily approved by FDA, no other vaccines and/or antiviral agents have been clinically endorsed for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, prevention of the disease and control of the infection is deemed a top priority for the general public. Owing to the characteristics of different dental treatments and settings, the risk of virus transmission can be considered high between patients and dental practitioners. Therefore, the need for strict and tough effective infection control protocols in dental practice is of great importance, namely for the dental centers in the potentially affected areas with COVID-19. This study, based on relevant evidence, aimed to review the basic knowledge of COVID-19 and address the recommended protocols of infection control for the dental practitioners and treatments in hypothetically stricken areas.","Shamszadeh, Sayna; Parhizkar, Ardavan; Mardani, Masoud; Asgary, Saeed",Arch.

Teste pré-clínico em doença renal crônica canina, com o uso de célulastronco amnióticas. 2017. 59p. Dissertação (Mestrado) Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. A doença renal crônica (DRC) é uma afecção frequente em cães idosos, de alta morbidade e mortalidade, sendo definida como uma injúria renal morfo-funcional irreversível, de um ou ambos os rins, que está intrinsecamente associada à degeneração celular. Seu tratamento é paliativo, sendo que nos estágios mais avançados, o animal pode necessitar de hemodiálise ou transplante renal, prática dificultada e muitas vezes inviável na medicina veterinária. As células-tronco mesenquimais derivadas do tecido amniótico caracterizam-se por ser uma população de células de alta plasticidade e de grande potencial imunomodulador, sendo capazes de se diferenciar e produzir diferentes tipos celulares necessários num processo de reparação. Os avanços nos estudos das células-tronco podem tornar a terapia celular uma forma viável de tratamento alternativo ou adjuvante dessa doença, uma vez que estas poderiam restaurar a funcionalidade e manter a integridade do rim. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar se o tratamento experimental com células-tronco mesenquimais derivadas do âmnio (CTMAs) canino podem reduzir ou estabilizar a taxa de progressão e o quadro clínico da DRC em cães. Para tanto, células-tronco provenientes da membrana amniótica foram cultivadas até a segunda passagem (P2) e criopreservadas para posterior aplicação. Onze cães domésticos, machos e/ou fêmeas, acometidos pela DRC adquirida em graus II ou III segundo classificação da IRIS e sem outra afecção adjacente receberam duas aplicações de CTMAs nos dias D0 e D30, por via endovenosa. Para avaliar a progressão ou estabilização do quadro clínico foram colhidas amostras de sangue total, soro sanguíneo e urina para exames de hemograma, bioquímica sérica e urinaria e urinálise em quatro momentos: D0, D7, D30 e D60. A análise estatística foi realizada através da aplicação do teste ANOVA, para comparação de médias nas diferentes fases de tratamento, seguida pelo teste de Tukey, para comparação das médias entre os grupos. Do ponto de vista clínico, dois animais apresentaram melhora e se mantiveram estáveis durante todo o período de acompanhamento, dois animais apresentaram melhora nos primeiros 30 dias, apresentando novamente sintomatologia da doença após esse período e os demais apresentaram melhora nos primeiros sete dias de tratamento, havendo uma piora geral do quadro após esse período. Contudo, os exames laboratoriais em todos os casos não revelaram uma melhora significativa com o tratamento. Aparentemente, a utilização de células-tronco de origem amniótica não influencia de forma relevante na melhora da doença devido à extensa lesão renal que cães apresentam.","GOMES, INGRID DA SILVA",,,285

219880,Newly Developed COVID-19 Bundle Greatly Reduces the Infection Fatality Rate for a Highly Vulnerable Nursing Home Population,2021,"BACKGROUND: Often thought of as a minor health concern, sore throat or pharyngitis is an important public health issue. It is one of the most common symptoms of upper respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and is a leading cause of physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions. However, few over-the-counter medications are proven to heal sore throat inflammation. METHODS: Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and three dimensional organotypic human respiratory tissues were used to study inflammation and various treatment effects on respiratory epithelia. The cells and tissues were studied both in the presence and absence of bradykinin, one of the first inflammatory mediators of pharyngitis. Inflammation was measured by analyzing the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Tissue morphology was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In studying pharyngitis using organotypic human respiratory tissue stimulated with bradykinin, we saw an increase in PGE2 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in response to bradykinin. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), a nonspecific COX inhibitor, was able to mitigate a bradykinin-induced increase in PGE2 in our studies. However, ASA was inflammatory above its therapeutic window, increasing the levels of PGE2 and IL-8 above those seen with bradykinin stimulation alone. We describe a novel, scientifically validated treatment for sore throat, that contains a low dose of ASA and other anti-inflammatory ingredients. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the complex mechanisms involved in healing pharyngitis, an inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory epithelia. An ASA-based formula (Biovanta) mitigated bradykinin-induced inflammation more strongly than ASA alone in organotypic human respiratory tissues. Surprisingly, we found that many of the most common over the counter sore throat therapies exacerbate inflammation and IL-8 in organotypic human respiratory tissues, suggesting these common treatments may increase the likelihood of further respiratory complications.","Leyva-Grado, Victor; Pugach, Pavel; Sadeghi-Latefi, Nazlie",Immun.

222921,Mental Disorder and Suicide: What's the Connection?,2021,"Introduction Le contact tracing (CT) permet d’identifier les contacts d’un cas contagieux. Dans le contexte d’épidémie à la Covid-19, c’est un outil majeur pour casser la chaîne de transmission. En ville, supervisé par la CPAM (Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie) il a gagné en efficience. Dans un centre hospitalier régional, le CT des patients diagnostiqués Covid à l’hôpital a d’abord été une mission médicale. Sa réalisation était alors partielle et non systématique et dans un but de santé publique pour minimiser le risque de cas secondaires (hospitaliers ou non), l’EOH s’est portée volontaire pour le coordonner. Matériels et méthodes Ce projet d’organisation contact tracing a été présenté en cellule de crise COVID et au CLIN et les actions suivantes ont été pilotées par l’EOH : – Réflexion sur une organisation du CT avec les professionnels concernés : EOH, Directeur médical de crise, Département information médicale, Direction des soins, Qualité. Parallèlement, contact avec la CPAM, interlocuteur référent pour l’envoi des données par serveur sécurisé ;– Elaboration d’un dossier de demande de temps infirmier et secrétariat affecté à l’EOH, dédié au CT quotidiennement ;– Création d’un formulaire informatique pour recueillir les informations du CT: période de contagiosité du patient, identification des cas contacts, co-exposés en intra-hospitalier (IH) et extra-hospitalier (EH) … Création d’un protocole CT précisant ses étapes: réception quotidienne de la liste des patients covid (source laboratoire), tri des patients relevant du CT, identification des contacts IH via le logiciel établissement et EH au cours d’un entretien au lit du patient. Saisie des données dans le formulaire, transmission à la CPAM. Prise en charge des contacts EH et IH rentrés à domicile par la CPAM et des contact IH encore hospitalisés en lien avec l’unité de soin. Traçabilité du CT dans le dossier du patient. Résultats Cette organisation du CT est opérationnelle depuis le 8/02/2021. La création d’une équipe CT rattachée à l’EOH est de 1.2 équivalent temps plein infirmier et 0.5 secrétariat. Au 25/03/2021, le CT, réalisé pour 123 patients hospitalisés découverts positifs à la Covid-19, a permis d’identifier 167 contacts et 44 co-exposés, déclarés à la CPAM. Le nombre de cas contacts identifiés peut paraître faible au regard des moyens alloués. Soulignons que notre taux d’incidence local était assez bas à cette période avec peu de variants identifiés et des patients hospitalisés âgés avec une vie sociale restreinte. L’augmentation des nouveaux variantes plus contagieux avec des hospitalisations de patients plus jeunes avec une vie sociale active, risque de faire évoluer cette activité. Conclusion La création d’une équipe CT spécifique, rattachée à l’EOH, permet un recensement plus exhaustif des cas contacts EH, IH et des co-exposés et un traitement des données plus rapide et efficace. Ce circuit de CT clarifié permet une gestion des cas quasi en temps réel et d’atteindre l’objectif: plus vite identifié, plus vite isolé et dépisté.","Pyot, A.; Provent, A.; Poggio, M.; Fourneret-Vivier, A.; Forestier, E.; Mallaval, F.",Infectious Diseases Now,,285

Before the pandemic, the management of clerkships was starting to depend less on checkerboards. This study aims to explore undergraduates’ perceptions of doing rotations in teaching hospitals using different teaching styles and elicit their views regarding the options of managing practices to design a mobile app that substitutes for checkerboards. Methods: In this sequential exploratory mixed methods study, 38 semi-structured interviews at a teaching hospital were conducted. The data was used to survey 124 students doing their rotations in four teaching hospitals during the first wave of COVID-19. Results: 21 themes highlighted concerns related to the practices, the teacher involvement in the students’ education, and the students’ adaptation to clinical culture. The students reported positive perceptions concerning self-managing and organizing practices via a mobile application. However, problems emerged regarding transparency, the lack of feedback, and the need for new tools. Regarding the teaching styles, the facilitator and personal models were perceived as optimal, but the personal style had no effect on using or not using a tool. Conclusions: A mobile-learning application designed like an educational opportunities’ manager tool can probably promote self-directed learning, flexible teaching, and bidirectional assessments. However, teachers who employ a personal teaching style may not need either checkerboards or a tool. This solution supports teaching at hospitals in pandemic times without checkerboards.","Guadalajara, Héctor Palazón Álvaro Lopez-Fernandez Olatz Esteban-Flores Pilar Garcia José Miguel Gutiérrez-Misis Alicia Baca-García Enrique Garcia-Olmo Damián",Healthcare,,285

Because increases in work-family conflict are likely as family dynamics change, strategies that help reduce conflict should be explored such as providing broad organizational support (i.e., improving attitudes and perceptions around family needs) or specific support for work-family needs (i.e., emotional and instrumental support;French etal., 2018).","Howard, Gino J.; Green, Sydney N.; Hannah Perkins, Stark Traylor Horatio D.",Industrial and Organizational Psychology,,285
225550,Home dialysis machine use for emergency dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has affected more than 1 270 000 people worldwide. The numbers of reported cases continue to rise and threaten global health. Transmissions among family members are frequently observed, although the route of transmission is partially known. Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family. Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection. Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings. Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.","Xiong, Yong; Song, Shihui; Ye, Guangming; Wang, Xinghuan",BMJ case reports,,285
225715,Parenting Stress During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Factors and Implications for Children Emotion Regulation,2020,"PURPOSE: Health care systems in most European countries were temporarily restructured to provide as much capacity as possible for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Subsequently, all elective surgeries had to be cancelled and postponed for months. The aim of the present study was to assess the pretreatment health status before and after COVID-19-related cancellation and the psychosocial distress caused by the cancellation. METHODS: For this study, a questionnaire was developed collecting sociodemographic data and information on health status before and after the cancellation. To assess psychosocial distress, the validated depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), was implemented. PHQ-9-Scores of 10 and above were considered to indicate moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In total, 119 patients whose elective orthopaedic surgery was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed once at least 8 weeks after the cancellation. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (65%; 34 female, 43 male) completed the questionnaire and were included. The predominant procedures were total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip arthroscopy and foot and ankle surgery. The mean pain level significantly increased from 5.5 ± 2.2 at the time of the initially scheduled surgery to 6.2 ± 2.5 at the time of the survey (p < 0.0001). The pain level before cancellation of the surgery was significantly higher in female patients (p = 0.029). An increased analgetic consumption was identified in 46% of all patients. A mean PHQ-9 score of 6.1 ± 4.9 was found after cancellation. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were found in 14% of patients, and 8% exhibited scores of 15 points or above. Significantly higher PHQ-9 scores were seen in female patients (p = 0.046). No significant differences in PHQ-9 scores were found among age groups, procedures or reasons for cancellation. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery resulted in pain levels that were significantly higher than when the surgery was scheduled, leading to increased analgesic use. Additionally, significant psychosocial distress due to the cancellation was identified in some patients, particularly middle-aged women. Despite these results, confidence in the national health care system and in the treating orthopaedic surgeons was not affected.

226574,Upheaval in cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"ObjectiveTo systematically assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point-of-care tests for diagnosis of current SARS-CoV-2 infections in children under real-life conditions. Study designMultiple bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, clinical trial registries and further information sources were systematically searched for literature (last bibliographic search: May 7, 2021). Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies that included pediatric study participants and evaluated rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections against RT-PCR as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. ResultsWe included 17 studies with a total of 6355 pediatric study participants. All included studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in pediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI: 57.4%-70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.5%), respectively. In symptomatic children, the pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 71.8% (95% CI: 63.6%-78.8%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.7% (95% CI: 96.6%-99.5%). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in asymptomatic children was 56.2% (95% CI: 47.6%-64.4%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.6% (95% CI: 97.3%-99.3%). ConclusionsPerformance of current antigen tests under real-life conditions varies broadly. Policymakers should especially be aware of the low diagnostic sensitivity of current antigen tests. Results should be interpreted with caution since risk of bias was predominantly judged as unclear due to poor reporting.

Wind speed and COVID-19 had positive correlation in Pakistan and its provinces. The inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was found for wind speed and COVID-19 in Punjab. Initially, the dose-response curve showed a positive link between wind speed and COVID-19 in Pakistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. Later, it becomes downward sloped in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. The expected log count of COVID-19 was increased by 0.113 times (Pakistan), 0.074 times (Punjab), 0.042 times (Sindh), and 0.082 times (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) for a 1 km/h increase in the wind speed. The correlation between particulate matter and COVID-19 was positive (Pakistan, Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory) and negative (Sindh). The dose-response curve for particulate matter and COVID-19 had inverted U-shaped (Pakistan, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) positively sloped (Islamabad Capital Territory), and negatively sloped (Sindh). The inverted U-shaped association shows that the COVID-19 initially increased due to a rise in the particulate matter but reduced when the particulate matter was above the threshold level. The particulate matter was also responsible to wear face masks and restricted mobility. The expected log count of COVID-19 cases was reduced by 0.005 times in Sindh for 1 unit increase in particulate matter. It is recommended to reduce particulate matter to control respiratory problems.

This material was formed by mixing pluronic F127 (F127) with a polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicle, which was formed with 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid. The color of the system started to change from blue to light purple at 37 degrees C, finally turning reddish at 40 degrees C. Thus, the developed material can be used to detect changes in body temperature, and thus, detect signs of fever. The mixing ratio of the PDA vesicle and F127 was an important factor for controlling the temperature at which the color change started. The results showed that the color change accompanied by the separation of the PDA vesicle with F127. We believe that this phenomenon plays an important role in reducing the conjugation length in the double and triple bond of PDA.","Kim, H.; Heo, E.; Shin, M.

229335,Letter: Evaluation and Surgical Treatment of Functional Neurosurgery Patients With Implanted Deep Brain Stimulation and Vagus Nerve Stimulation Pulse Generators During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The present study examines the impact of coronavirus-related restrictions on mental health among American adults, and how this relationship varies as a function of time and two measures of vulnerability (preexisting physical symptoms and job insecurity). METHODS: We draw on data from two waves of Corona Impact Survey, which were fielded in late April and early of May 2020. Multilevel models were used to analyze the hierarchically nested data. RESULTS: Experiencing coronavirus disease-2019 restrictions significantly raise mental distress. This association is stronger for individuals with preexisting health conditions and those who worry about job prospects. These findings hold with the inclusion of region-wave covariates (number of deaths, wave dummy and aggregate measure of restrictions). Finally, there is a cross-level interaction: the restriction-distress connection is more pronounced in the second wave of data. CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that people who are more physically and/or financially vulnerable suffer more from the imposed restrictions, i.e. 'social isolation'. The mental health impact of coronavirus pandemic is not constant but conditional on the level of vulnerability.","Kim, Harris Hyun-Soo; Laurence, James",J Public Health (Oxf),,285
230391,Camping Alone-Recovering From COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been reported as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the effect of pharmacologic agents used to treat T2DM, such as metformin, on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. Metformin increases the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a known receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data from people with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 were used to test the hypothesis that metformin use is associated with improved survival in this population. METHODS: Retrospective analyses were performed on de-identified clinical data from a major hospital in Wuhan, China, that included patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 during the recent epidemic. One hundred and thirty-one patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and T2DM were used in this study. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, diabetes medications, and respiratory therapy data were also included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of these 131 patients, 37 used metformin with or without other antidiabetes medications. Among the 37 metformin-taking patients, 35 (94.6%) survived and 2 (5.4%) did not survive. The mortality rates in the metformin-taking group versus the non-metformin group were 5.4% (2/37) versus 22.3% (21/94). Using multivariate analysis, metformin was found to be an independent predictor of survival in this cohort (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a significant association between metformin use and survival in people with T2DM diagnosed with COVID-19. These clinical data are consistent with potential benefits of the use of metformin for COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Li, Jinghong; Wei, Qi; Li, Willis X; McCowen, Karen C; Xiong, Wei; Liu, Jiao; Jiang, Wenlijun; Marin, Traci; Thomas, Robert L; He, Ming; Gongol, Brendan; Hepokoski, Mark; Yuan, Jason X-J; Shyy, John Y-J; Xiong, Nian; Malhotra, Atul",Endocr Pract,,285
230901,"COVID-19: Analysis of cavitary air inspired through a mask, in competitive adolescent athletes",2021,"BACKGROUND: In patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data are scarce and conflicting regarding whether chronic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) influences disease outcomes. In patients with severe COVID-19, we assessed the association between chronic ACEI/ARB use and the occurrence of kidney, lung, heart, and liver dysfunctions and the severity of the inflammatory reaction as evaluated by biomarkers kinetics, and their association with disease outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study on consecutive patients with newly diagnosed severe COVID-19. Independent predictors were assessed through receiver operating characteristic analysis, time-series analysis, logistic regression analysis, and multilevel modeling for repeated measures. RESULTS: On the 149 patients included in the study 30% (44/149) were treated with ACEI/ARB. ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with the following biochemical variations: phosphorus >40 mg/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-6.14), creatinine >10.1 mg/L (OR, 3.22, 2.28-4.54), and urea nitrogen (UN) >0.52 g/L (OR, 2.65, 95% CI, 1.89-3.73). ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with acute kidney injury stage &#8805;1 (OR, 3.28, 95% CI, 2.17-4.94). The daily dose of ACEI/ARB was independently associated with altered kidney markers with an increased risk of +25 to +31% per each 10 mg increment of lisinopril-dose equivalent. In multivariable multilevel modeling, UN >0.52 g/L was independently associated with the risk of acute respiratory failure (OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.05-11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Patients chronically treated with ACEI/ARB who have severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury. In these patients, the increase in UN associated with ACEI/ARB use could predict the development of acute respiratory failure.","Oussalah, Abderrahim; Gleye, Stanislas; Clerc Urmes, Isabelle; Laugel, Elodie; Callet, Jonas; Barbé, Françoise; Orlowski, Sophie; Malaplate, Catherine; Aimone-Gastin, Isabelle; Caillierez, Beatrice Maatem; Merten, Marc; Jeannesson, Elise; Kormann, Raphaël; Olivier, Jean-Luc; Rodriguez-Guéant, Rosa-Maria; Namour, Farès; Bevilacqua, Sybille; Losser, Marie-Reine; Levy, Bruno; Kimmoun, Antoine; Gibot, Sébastien; Thilly, Nathalie; Frimat, Luc; Schvoerer, Evelyne; Guéant, Jean-Louis",Clin Infect Dis,,285

A 75-year-old man underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing before a right hemicolectomy;SARS-CoV-2 was incidentally diagnosed following his test. The patient underwent a period of isolation and recovery before a second pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise test 6 weeks later. His resting pulmonary function tests did not vary between tests but his peak work, anaerobic threshold, oxygen pulse, pulse oximetry nadir, ventilation perfusion matching and heart rate response to exercise all improved significantly after this recovery period. These are unique results that add to the existing knowledge of the pathophysiology and management of SARS-CoV-2 in the peri-operative setting. While our patient demonstrated dramatic improvement in his functional capacity following 6 weeks of recovery, he remained in a high-risk group for surgery according to our local guidelines. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing has a valuable role in individualised risk assessment and shared decision-making in complex, urgent surgical cases where the benefits of delaying surgery to recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection should be balanced against the potential risks.","Whitfield, C.; Adamson, M.; Davies, R.",Anaesthesia Reports,,285

Misconceptions and stigmatization towards the use of face masks may hinder the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We address this previous debate by analyzing the advice on the community use of masks across different credible health authorities: countries that promoted the use of masks acknowledged that masks are effective but also explained the importance of their proper use along with other hygiene measures. In contrast, authorities that recommended against the community use of masks mainly cited shortage of supplies, the argument that the public do not have the adequate skills to wear them, or that wearing masks might reduce compliance with other important behaviors. We suggest promoting effective behavioral changes in personal protective measures by teaching microbiological knowledge instead of just listing out the ""do's-and-don'ts.""","Tso, Ricky V; Cowling, Benjamin J",Clin Infect Dis,,285

233606,Prevention and management of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers,2020,"Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has reached unprecedented pandemic levels and is affecting almost every country in the world. Ramping up the testing capacity of a country supposes an essential public health response to this new outbreak. A pool testing strategy where multiple samples are tested in a single reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit could potentially increase a country's testing capacity. The aim of this study is to propose a simple mathematical model to estimate the optimum number of pooled samples according to the relative prevalence of positive tests in a particular healthcare context, assuming that if a group tests negative, no further testing is done whereas if a group tests positive, all the subjects of the group are retested individually. The model predicts group sizes that range from 11 to 3 subjects. For a prevalence of 10% of positive tests, 40.6% of tests can be saved using testing groups of four subjects. For a 20% prevalence, 17.9% of tests can be saved using groups of three subjects. For higher prevalences, the strategy flattens and loses effectiveness. Pool testing individuals for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a valuable strategy that could considerably boost a country's testing capacity. However, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT-PCR. The strategy best works in settings with a low prevalence of positive tests. It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion. The model can be adapted to specific prevalences, generating a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy.","Aragón-Caqueo, Diego; Fernández-Salinas, Javier; Laroze, David",J. med. virol,,285

In transplant patients, female gender (OR = 13.49, 95% CI: 2.17-83.8), a longer interval since transplantation (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (OR = 7.11, 95% CI: 1.47-34.50) were independently associated with persistence of antibodies beyond 6 months after COVID-19. Therefore, as compared with immunocompetent patients, liver transplant recipients show a lower prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and more pronounced antibody levels decline.","Caballero-Marcos, Aránzazu; Salcedo, Magdalena; Alonso-Fernández, Roberto; Rodríguez-Perálvarez, Manuel; Olmedo, María; Graus Morales, Javier; Cuervas-Mons, Valentín; Cachero, Alba; Loinaz-Segurola, Carmelo; Iñarrairaegui, Mercedes; Castells, Lluís; Pascual, Sonia; Vinaixa-Aunés, Carmen; González-Grande, Rocío; Otero, Alejandra; Tomé, Santiago; Tejedor-Tejada, Javier; Álamo-Martínez, José María; González-Diéguez, Luisa; Nogueras-Lopez, Flor; Blanco-Fernández, Gerardo; Muñoz-Bartolo, Gema; Bustamante, Francisco Javier; Fábrega, Emilio; Romero-Cristóbal, Mario; Martin-Mateos, Rosa; Del Rio-Izquierdo, Julia; Arias-Milla, Ana; Calatayud, Laura; Marcacuzco-Quinto, Alberto A; Fernández-Alonso, Víctor; Gómez-Gavara, Concepción; Colmenero, Jordi; Muñoz, Patricia; Pons, José A",Am. j. transplant,,285
235259,Preparing dental schools to refunction safely during the COVID-19 pandemic: an infection prevention and control perspective,2021,"This consensus statement about the indications and modalities of corticosteroid treatment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic was jointly written by experts from the French Association of Otology and Oto-Neurology (AFON) and from the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery (SFORL). There is currently not enough data in favour of danger or benefit from corticosteroids in COVID-19, so until this matter is resolved it is advisable to limit their indications to the most serious clinical pictures for which it is well established that this type of treatment has a positive impact on the progression of symptoms. In Grade V and VI Bell's palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a week's course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a week's course of oral medication. In rhinology, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation. However, patients are advised to continue with their local corticosteroid therapy in the form of a nasal spray or by inhalation. Treatments with corticosteroid nasal sprays can still be prescribed if there is no alternative. Finally, systemic or local corticosteroid therapy is not indicated for bacterial ENT infections.","Herman, P; Vincent, C; Parietti Winkler, C; Loundon, N; Couloigner, V; Tankere, F; Tringali, S; Gallet, P; Papon, J-F; Montava, M; Lavieille, J-P; Charpiot, A; Schmerber, S",Eur. ann. otorhinolaryngol. head neck dis,,285

235641,Pediatric Surgery in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"Background: Rapid testing for an infection is paramount during a pandemic to prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate, test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of cases identified; and number of false positives. Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%. Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily wastes valuable time and resources.","Wolff, Timo de; Pfluger, Dirk; Rehme, Michael; Heuer, Janin; Bittner, Martin-Immanuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11851v1.pdf,285
235786,Response to comment on 10.1002/bjs.11679,2020,"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased attention to the critical mathematical literacy of citizens in the United States and around the world. A statistically and mathematically literate society is crucial for ensuring that citizens are able to sift through political rhetoric to maintain life-saving procedures such as social distancing and other infection dampening efforts. Additionally, recent civil unrest due to the disproportionate killings of Black men by police provokes investigation into the public’s mathematical literacy. In this paper, we investigate adolescent students’ critical mathematics consciousness and mathematics literacy as they reason through two interview tasks on the coronavirus and police shooting data. Drawing on Frankenstein’s program of Critical Mathematics Education, we introduce an analytic framework for documenting the critical mathematics consciousness of adolescent students. We interviewed fifteen 14- to 16-year-old students as they solved five tasks designed to elicit their critical and ethical mathematical awareness. Our findings indicate that students exhibit very little critical mathematics consciousness in the context of the police problem but show awareness that data can be presented in ways that manipulate the public’s emotions in the coronavirus problem. We conclude the paper with a discussion of implications for designing future instruction to support students’ growth in critical mathematics consciousness.

236717,On Patient Safety: COVID-19 Exposes the Dangerous State of Drug and Device Supply Chains,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal contact time and concentration for viricidal activity of oral preparation of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 ('corona virus') to mitigate the risk and transmission of the virus in the dental practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was tested against oral antiseptic solutions consisting of aqueous povidone-iodine (PVP-I) as the sole active ingredient. The PVP-I was tested at diluted concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%. Test media without any virus was added to 2 tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls. Ethanol (70%) was tested in parallel as a positive control, and water only as a negative control. The test solutions and virus were incubated at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) for time periods of 15 and 30 seconds. The solution was then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in minimum essential medium (MEM) 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 µg/mL gentamicin. Surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end-point dilution assay and the log reduction value (LRV) of each compound compared to the negative (water) control was calculated. RESULTS: PVP-I oral antiseptics at all tested concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%, completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 15 seconds of contact. The 70% ethanol control group was unable to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 after 15 seconds of contact, but was able to inactivate the virus at 30 seconds of contact. CONCLUSIONS: PVP-I oral antiseptic preparations rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. The viricidal activity was present at the lowest concentration of 0.5 % PVP-I and at the lowest contact time of 15 seconds. This important finding can justify the use of preprocedural oral rinsing with PVP-I (for patients and health care providers) may be useful as an adjunct to personal protective equipment, for dental and surgical specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bidra, Avinash S; Pelletier, Jesse S; Westover, Jonna B; Frank, Samantha; Brown, Seth M; Tessema, Belachew",J Prosthodont,,285

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred and four patients with CCI and COVID-19 were observed, group 1 (n=152) consisted of patients receiving basic therapy and mexidol, group 2 (n=152) received only basic therapy. Mexidol was administered intravenously for 14 days, 500 mg (10 ml) per 400 ml of saline solution, then Mexidol FORTE 250 was administered in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day for 2 months. The state of cognitive functions (MoCA scale), sleep (Spiegel questionnaire), asthenia (MFI-20 scale), and quality of life (SIP questionnaire) were evaluated. Examinations were performed before treatment, 30 and 75 days after start of treatment. RESULTS: In group 1, there was a more complete and earlier recovery of the state of cognitive functions (an increase in indicators on the MoCA scale, p<0.01), a regression of asthenia (p<0.05), and normalization of sleep (p<0.01). By the end of the study, there were significantly more patients in group 1 with complete or significant recovery of all quality of life indicators. CONCLUSION: Long-term sequential therapy with mexidol provides a more complete recovery of impaired functions in patients with CCI and COVID-19.","Kovalchuk, V V; Ershova, I I; Molodovskaya, N V",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,,285

240677,COVID-19: A UK Children's Hospital Experience,2020,"The newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that spread from China is causing the pandemic COVID-19 with a fatality rate from 5-15%. It causes fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue up to dyspnoea, responsible for hospitalization and artificial oxygenation. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using ACE2, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Once bound to ACE2 and the other two proteases in concert they allow the virus replication and spread throughout the body. Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 as its binding to by the virus increases bradykinin and its metabolites, which facilitate inflammation in the lung (causing cough and fever), coagulation and the complement system. These three systems are involved in angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which occur in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we propose that blocking the kallikrein-kinin system with lanadelumab, approved for hereditary angioedema, will prevent facilitation of these 3 systems.

240826,Adapting Multidisciplinary Adult Cystic Fibrosis Care during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Since several seabird species have sexual size dimorphism, in which one sex is larger than the other, and may consume bigger prey, this size difference may affect the contamination concentration in the seabird's tissues depending on their sex and age. In this study, mercury contamination was investigated in brown booby (Sula leucogaster) adults and juveniles during their breeding season at the Santana Archipelago, on the southeast coast of Brazil. Two hypotheses were evaluated: 1. As females consume larger prey than males due to the reverse sexual dimorphism, higher total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations are expected in females tissues than in males; 2. Adult seabirds have more time to accumulate mercury than juveniles, so it is expected that adults will show higher THg and MeHg concentrations than juveniles in their feathers, but none in blood since the last indicates the exposure of short time (30-60 days), as it is a constantly synthesized tissue. Feathers and blood were sampled from 20 individuals of each group (males, females and juveniles). Also, 10 eggs of the brown booby and muscle tissue samples of their main prey were collected, from February to October 2018. Females and males had similar THg concentrations in the tissues with no statistical differences between sexes. Thus, the sexual size dimorphism did not influence mercury concentrations among the tissues and both genders can be used as a biomonitor. Brown booby juveniles had low THg and MeHg concentrations compared to adults due to a shorter time of exposure for mercury to bioaccumulate in their tissues. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, analyzing methylmercury in feathers, blood and eggs of a tropical seabird, which can be a useful baseline for future studies on the effects of contaminants on this species in tropical regions.","Bighetti, G P; Padilha, J A; Cunha, L S T; Kasper, D; Malm, O; Mancini, P L",Environ Pollut,,285

We wanted to describe the effects of a 6 week shutdown of a large German botulinum toxin (BT) outpatient clinics on patients and their well-being. 45 patients (age 61.9 ± 9.8 years, 29 females, 16 males) receiving BT therapy (319.3 ± 201.9MU-equivalent, treatment duration 8.3 ± 5.5 years) were surveyed with a standardised questionnaire. The shutdown delayed BT therapy by 6.6 ± 2.3 weeks. 93% of the patients noticed increased muscle cramps and 82% increased pain reducing their quality of life by 40.2 ± 19.5%. For 23 patients with cervical dystonia this reduction was 41.1 ± 18.3%, for 3 patients with blepharospasm 33.3 ± 15.3%, for 9 patients with spasticity 37.8 ± 15.6%, for 4 patients with pain conditions 37.4 ± 35.7% and for 3 patients with hemifacial spasm 27.5 ± 17.1%. After the shutdown 66% of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before, 32% perceived it as unchanged. For all patients long-term availability of BT therapy was very important or important. 98% of the patients perceived the shutdown as inadequate and felt their patient rights not respected.

Yet we do not know what behavioral characteristics of dogs and their owners are relevant to dog training or if owner cognitive abilities play a role in training success. The aim of this study is to determine which characteristics of both dogs and owners predict success in completing the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen training program. Before the first session of a dog training course, owners completed surveys evaluating the behavior and cognition of their dog and themselves. Additionally, we collected the dogs' initial training levels via behavioral tasks. We then examined what factors predicted whether the dogs passed the Canine Good Citizen test after the class ended. In terms of dog characteristics, we found that, while dog age, sex and neuter status did not predict success, owner-rated levels of disobedience did predict completion of the program. In terms of owner characteristics, owners who scored higher on cognitive measures were more likely to have their dogs complete the program. Finally, dog-owner characteristics such as the time spent training predicted success. Thus, characteristics of the dogs, owners, and how they interact seem to predict training success. These findings suggest that there are some owner, dog, and dog-owner characteristics that can facilitate or hinder dog training.","Stevens, Jeffrey R; Wolff, London M; Bosworth, Megan; Morstad, Jill",Anim. cogn,,285

ACE2 is a major player in the protective arm, highly expressed in lungs and gut with the ability to mitigate cardiopulmonary diseases such as inflammatory lung disease. ACE2 also exhibits activities involving gut microbiome, nutrition, and as a chaperone stabilizing the neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1, in gut. But the current interest in ACE2 arises because it is the cell surface receptor for the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, to infect host cells, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. This suggests that ACE2 be considered harmful, however, because of its important other roles, it is paradoxically a potential therapeutic target for cardiopulmonary diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. This review describes the discovery of ACE2, its physiological functions, and its place in the renin-angiotensin system. It illustrates new analyses of the structure of ACE2 that provides better understanding of its actions particularly in lung and gut, shedding of ACE2 by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 protein), and role of TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine proteases 2) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 entry into host cells. Cardiopulmonary diseases are associated with decreased ACE2 activity and the mitigation by increasing ACE2 activity along with its therapeutic relevance are addressed. Finally, the potential use of ACE2 as a treatment target in COVID-19, despite its role to allow viral entry into host cells, is suggested.","Sharma, Ravindra K; Stevens, Bruce R; Obukhov, Alexander G; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y; Li, Qiuhong; Richards, Elaine M; Pepine, Carl J; Raizada, Mohan K",Hypertension,,285

248271,Cancer Treatment and Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of the First 6 Months,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic patients persistently seek for health information on the internet for medication information seeking, nutrition, disease management, information regarding disease preventive actions and so on. Consumers ability to search, find, appraise and use health information from the internet is known as eHealth literacy skill. eHealth literacy is a congregate set of six basic skills (traditional literacy, health literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy and computer literacy). The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy level and associated factors among internet user chronic patients in North-west Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 423 study participants among chronic patients. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) was used for data collection. The eHEALS is a validated eight-item Likert scaled questionnaire used to asses self-reported capability of eHealth consumers to find, appraise, and use health related information from the internet to solve health problems. Statistical Package for Social science version 20 was used for data entry and further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between the eHealth literacy skill and associated factors. Significance was obtained at 95% CI and p < 0.05. RESULT: In total, 423 study subjects were approached and included in the study from February to May, 2019. The response rate to the survey was 95.3%. The majority of respondents 268 (66.3%) were males and mean age was 35.58 ± 14.8 years. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that participants with higher education (at least having the diploma) are more likely to possess high eHealth literacy skill with Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.48, 95% CI (1.54, 7.87). similarly, being government employee AOR: 1.71, 95% CI (1.11, 2.68), being urban resident AOR: 1.37, 95% CI (0.54, 3.49), perceived good health status AOR: 3.97, 95% CI (1.38, 11.38), having higher income AOR: 4.44, 95% CI (1.32, 14.86), Daily internet use AOR: 2.96, 95% CI (1.08, 6.76), having good knowledge about the availability and importance of online resources AOR: 3.12, 95% CI (1.61, 5.3), having positive attitude toward online resources AOR: 2.94, 95% CI (1.07, 3.52) and higher level of computer literacy AOR: 3.81, 95% CI (2.19, 6.61) were the predictors positively associated with higher eHealth literacy level. CONCLUSION: Besides the mounting indication of efficacy, the present data confirm that internet use and eHealth literacy level of chronic patients in this setting is relatively low which clearly implicate that there is a need to fill the skill gap in eHealth literacy among chronic patients which might help them in finding and evaluating relevant online sources for their health-related decisions.","Shiferaw, Kirubel Biruk; Tilahun, Binyam Chakilu; Endehabtu, Berhanu Fikadie; Gullslett, Monika Knudsen; Mengiste, Shegaw Anagaw",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,285

249260,Orthopedic Surgery Residency Application Process in 2020 - Has Diversity been Affected?,2021,"The presence of highly toxic and persistent pesticides in water bodies causes serious problems to human beings as well as aquatic life. Quinalphos is one such widely used organophosphorus pesticide in agricultural fields. Herein, for degradation and mineralization of quinalphos, ZnO nanoflowers and their hybrid nanocomposite with graphene oxide have been synthesized. FESEM analysis confirmed the formation of ZnO nanoflowers over nanosheets of graphene oxide having a thickness of 20 ± 10 nm. GO-ZnO composite exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity in comparison to pure ZnO. 98 % degradation of quinalphos was achieved using GO-ZnO nano-catalyst at 6 pH within 45 min of irradiations, whereas it was 80 % for bare ZnO nanoflowers. Higher degradation with hybrid nanocomposite was attributed to improved surface area (36 m2 g-1), a substantial reduction in bandgap energy from 3.10 to 2.90 eV and enhanced charge separation (e-/h+ pairs) after the addition of GO. Reaction kinetics study followed pseudo-first-order behaviour. Further, mineralization to the extent of 90 % in 90 min was confirmed by TOC analysis. Based on identified intermediates, using LCMS analysis, degradation pathways were proposed. The plausible pathways confirmed the presence of smaller and safer reaction intermediates supported by excitation of e- from nanocomposite followed by oxidation of quinalphos with huge free radicals. Overall, this study is significant in terms of using photocatalysis as a tertiary treatment of quinalphos pesticide wastewater at pH 6 in a short duration.","Garg, Renuka; Gupta, Renu; Singh, Nirmal; Bansal, Ajay",Chemosphere,,285

251263,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Living with Vasculitis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared an international public health emergency, and it may have long-lasting effects on people's mental health. There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Green, Jennifer; Huberty, Jennifer; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad",JMIR Ment Health,,285

251756,Emotional Resilience and Bariatric Surgical Teams: a Priority in the Pandemic,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already affected 2883603 and killed 198842 people, as of April 27, 2020. Because there is no specific therapeutic drug, drug repurposing has been proposed. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control its replication, and several compounds have been suggested. The present study predicts relative efficacies of thirty known or repurposed compounds in inhibiting the RdRp. Methods: The three-dimensional structure of the target enzyme was loaded into Molegro virtual docker software, followed by chemical structures of the test compounds. The docking was performed between the compounds and the active site of the enzyme to determine docking scores, and the energy liberated when the two dock. Thus, docking scores signify the affinity of ligand(s) with the active site of enzyme(s) and thus its inhibitory potential. Results: Among known inhibitors, remdesivir was found to have the highest affinity for the active site of the RdRp. Among all compounds, chlorhexidine was predicted as the most potent inhibitor. Furthermore, the results predict the relative efficacy of different drugs as inhibitors of the drug target. Conclusion: While the study identifies several compounds as inhibitors of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, the prediction of their relative efficacies may be useful in future studies. While nucleoside analogs compete with the natural substrate of RdRp, thereby terminating RNA replication, other compounds would physically block entry of the natural substrates into the active site. Thus, based on the findings, we recommend in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials to determine their effectiveness against COVID-19.","Choudhury, Shuvasish; Moulick, Debojyoti; Saikia, Purbajyoti; Mazumder, Muhammed Khairujjaman",,,285

253579,COVID-19 Pandemic: Cardiovascular Complications and Future Implications,2020,"Objective.We derive and demonstrate how residual voltage (RV) from a biphasic electrical stimulation pulse can be used to recognize degradation at the electrode-tissue interface.Approach.Using a first order model of the electrode-tissue interface and a rectangular biphasic stimulation current waveform, we derive the equations for RV as well as RV growth over several stimulation pulses. To demonstrate the use of RV for damage detection, we simulate accelerated damage on sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes using potential cycling. RV measurements of the degraded electrodes are compared against standard characterization methods of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.Main results.Our theoretical discussion illustrates how an intrinsic RV arises even from perfectly balanced biphasic pulses due to leakage via the charge-transfer resistance. Preliminary data inin-vivorat experiments follow the derived model of RV growth, thereby validating our hypothesis that RV is a characteristic of the electrode-tissue interface. RV can therefore be utilized for detecting damage at the electrode. Our experimental results for damage detection show that delamination of SIROF electrodes causes a reduction in charge storage capacity, which in turn reflects a measurable increase in RV.Significance.Chronically implanted electrical stimulation systems with multi-electrode arrays have been the focus of physiological engineering research for the last decade. Changes in RV over time can be a quick and effective method to identify and disconnect faulty electrodes in large arrays.

In this review, we describe the most recent published innovations in neonatal telehealth, spanning the neonatal ICU (NICU), community/rural hospitals and the patient's home. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine for neonatal subspecialty care has continued to expand, from well established uses in retinopathy of prematurity screening and tele-echocardiography, to applications in genetics and neurology. Within the NICU itself, neonatologist-led remote rounding has been shown to be a feasible method of increasing access to expert care for neonates in rural hospitals. Telehealth has improved parental and caregiver education, eased the NICU-to-home transition experience and expanded access to lactation services for rural mothers. Telemedicine-assisted neonatal resuscitation has improved the quality of resuscitation and reduced unnecessary neonatal transports to higher levels of care. Finally, the global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the expansion of neonatal telehealth. SUMMARY: Telehealth provides increased access to expert neonatal care and improves patient outcomes, while reducing the cost of care for neonates in diverse settings. Continued high-quality investigation of the impacts of telehealth on patient outcomes and healthcare systems is critical to the continued development of neonatal telemedicine best practices.","Lapcharoensap, Wannasiri; Lund, Kelli; Huynh, Trang",Curr. opin. pediatr,,285

Building off the affordance lens and cognitive load theory, we investigate how motivational factors and personal attributes influence social media fatigue and the sharing of unverified information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we develop a model which we analyse using the structural equation modelling and neural network techniques with data collected from young adults in Bangladesh (N = 433). The results show that people, who are driven by self-promotion and entertainment, and those suffering from deficient self-regulation, are more likely to share unverified information. Exploration and religiosity correlated negatively with the sharing of unverified information. However, exploration also increased social media fatigue. Our findings indicate that the different use purposes of social media introduce problematic consequences, in particular, increased misinformation sharing.","Islam, A.K.M.

However, there are knowledge gaps about the severity, prevalence, etiology, and duration of OD in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Olfactory function was assessed in all participants using questionnaires and the butanol threshold test (BTT). Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal olfaction were further evaluated using the smell identification test (SIT), sinus imaging, and nasoendoscopy. Selected patients received nasal biopsies. Systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed items from January 1, 2020 to April 23, 2020 were searched. Studies that reported clinical data on olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: We included 18 COVID-19 patients and 18 controls. Among COVID-19 patients, 12 of 18 (67%) reported olfactory symptoms and OD was confirmed in 6 patients by BTT and SIT. Olfactory dysfunction was the only symptom in 2 patients. Mean BTT score of patients was worse than controls (P =. 004, difference in means = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-2.9). Sinusitis and olfactory cleft obstruction were absent in most patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal biopsy revealed the presence of infiltrative CD68+macrophages harboring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in the stroma. Olfactory dysfunction persisted in 2 patients despite clinical recovery. Systematic review showed that the prevalence of olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 ranged from 5% to 98%. Most studies did not assess olfaction quantitatively. Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction is common in COVID-19 and may be the only symptom. Coronavirus disease 2019-related OD can be severe and prolonged. Mucosal infiltration by CD68+macrophages expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen may contribute to COVID-19-related OD.","Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Sridhar, Siddharth; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Li, Hang-Long; Wong, Fergus Kai-Chuen; Ng, Ming-Yen; Tsang, Raymond King-Yin; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Ho, Ronnie Siu-Lun; Luk, Shiobhon Yiu; Kan, Wai-Kuen; Lam, Sonia Hiu-Yin; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Leung, Sau-Man; Chan, Wai-Ming; Ng, Pauline Yeung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Open Forum Infect.

255556,Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 involving the gastrointestinal tract,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused acute respiratory distress syndrome affecting more than 200 countries with varied mortality rate. Successive genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 become evident across the globe immediately after its complete genome sequencing. Here, we found a decent association of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a mutation with higher mortality rate. Extensive in silico studies revealed several amino acid changes in ORF3a protein which ultimately leads to diverse structural modifications like B cell epitope loss, gain/loss of phosphorylation site and loss of leucine zipper motif. We could further relate these changes to the enhanced antigenic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Through protein&#8722;protein network analysis and functional annotation studies, we obtained a close federation of ORF3a protein with host immune response via divergent signal transduction pathways including JAK-STAT, chemokine and cytokine-related pathways. Our data not only unveil the fairly appreciable association of ORF3a mutation with higher mortality rate, but also suggest a potential mechanistic insight towards the immunopathogenic manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Majumdar, Parinita; Niyogi, Sougata",Epidemiol Infect,,285

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged traditional medical student recruitment and outreach. Instagram is a platform that can be used by residency programs to increase engagement and as a potential recruitment tool. The authors present social media failed and successful strategies used to increase engagement and gain new followers. Methods: In June 2020, an initiative began to use Instagram on a more frequent and intentional basis. Three different strategies were implemented during the pandemic: mirroring Twitter posts, increasing multimedia, and leveraging Instagram Stories. The outcomes of interest included number of followers and engagement on posts. Data were collected October 2020. Results: After June 1, 2020, the @mayoanesthesia account gained 1000 followers through 127 days, an average of 4.26 new followers each day. Before June 1, there were 24 total posts over 3.3 years with a total of 458 followers. Three different strategies were implemented at different times during the pandemic. During the mirroring Twitter posts period, the mean number of interactions per post was 14.5. During the second phase after separating the Twitter and Instagram strategy, the mean number of interactions per post increased to 57.8. Conclusion: Residency programs can creatively, yet methodically, use Instagram posts to increase social media engagement during resident recruitment season during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely beyond.","Plack, D.

We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with algebraic growth and at a later epidemic stage also with a combined algebraic growth with exponential decay. Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where $T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic parameters. Note that although the model shows a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the real size of the pandemics as a relation of the observed reported data to the total number of infected in the population is still unknown.","Bodova, Katarina; Kollar, Richard",Phys. biol,,285

METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational study from a prospectively collected database of consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) who received HFNO on ICU admission during a 22-week period (March 12-August 13, 2020). Outcomes of interest were factors on the day of ICU admission associated with the need for endotracheal intubation. We used multivariable logistic regression and mixed effects models. A predictive model for endotracheal intubation in patients treated with HFNO was derived and internally validated. RESULTS: From a total of 259 patients initially treated with HFNO, 140 patients (54%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Baseline non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [odds ratio (OR) 1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.35], and the ROX index calculated as the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction divided by respiratory rate (OR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37-0.72), and pH (OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24-0.86) were associated with intubation. Hospital site explained 1% of the variability in the likelihood of intubation after initial treatment with HFNO. A predictive model including non-respiratory SOFA score and the ROX index showed excellent performance (AUC 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Among adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 initially treated with HFNO, the SOFA score and the ROX index may help to identify patients with higher likelihood of intubation.","Mellado-Artigas, Ricard; Mujica, Luis Eduardo; Ruiz, Magda Liliana; Ferreyro, Bruno Leonel; Angriman, Federico; Arruti, Egoitz; Torres, Antoni; Barbeta, Enric; Villar, Jesús; Ferrando, Carlos",J Intensive Care,,285
256841,Commentary: COVID in Care Homes-Challenges and Dilemmas in Healthcare Delivery,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has created huge trepidation worldwide, has a mortality rate of 0.5% to 1% and is growing incessantly. There are currently no therapies and/or vaccines that may help abate this viral disease, but the use of masks and social distancing can limit the spread. Boosting immunity has been a simple way to resist viral infection and limit fatalities. In this context, the use of nutraceuticals appears to be a potential panacea. The ability of algae-based nutraceuticals, mainly Spirulina, to boost immunity against viral diseases has already been reported clinically. Spirulina-based nutraceuticals boost the adaptive and innate immunity, and bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor peptides, phycobiliproteins, sulfated polysaccharides, and calcium-Spirulan, can serve as antiviral agents. The presence of these molecules indicates its potential role in resisting infection and COVID-19 disease progression. This review focuses on the potential role of algal nutraceuticals as immune boosters to combat the human coronavirus and other viral diseases. The potential use of Spirulina-based nutraceuticals for combating COVID-19, its mechanism, and future directions have also been discussed.","Ratha, Sachitra K; Renuka, Nirmal; Rawat, Ismail; Bux, Faizal",Nutrition,,285

This study identifies excess oceanic evaporation, in conjunction with the RCMs' boundary conditions, as drivers contributing to these biases in RCMs with forced sea surface temperatures in a CORDEX RCM ensemble over Europe. The RCMs are relaxed to the prescribed lateral boundary conditions originating from a global model, effectively matching the driving model's overall atmospheric moisture flux divergence. As a consequence, excess oceanic evaporation results in positive precipitation biases over land due to forced internal recycling of moisture to maintain the overall flux divergence prescribed by the boundary conditions. This systematic behaviour is shown through an analysis of long-term atmospheric water budgets and atmospheric moisture exchange between oceanic and continental areas in a multi-model ensemble.","Goergen, Klaus; Kollet, Stefan",Sci Rep,,285

As COVID-19, takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply billions of peoples, currently living on the planet earth. Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS: The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents. CONCLUSION: The most important pharmaceutical analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171 ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), Assay content (about 99.6% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis (by High performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8%) were performed and described to give a more clear industrial scheme.","Dadras, Akbar; Rezvanfar, Mohammad Amin; Beheshti, Abolghasem; Naeimi, Sedigheh Sadat; Siadati, Seyyed Amir",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),,285

METHODS: We used Python tools to search for the relevant data on the Baidu Post Bar. Next, a text analysis was performed on the posts' contents using a combination of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), sentiment analysis, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: According to the LDA analysis, the public was highly interested in topics such as COVID-19 prevention, infection symptoms, infection and coping measures, sources of transmission and treatments, community management, and work resumption. The majority of the public had negative emotional values, yet a portion of the public held positive emotional values. We also performed a correlation analysis of the influencing factors was established. CONCLUSIONS: Netizens' degree of concern shown in their posts was greatly associated with the spread of COVID-19. With the rise, diffusion, outbreak, and mitigation of COVID-19 in China, netizens have successively created a large number of posts, and the topics of discussion varied over time. Therefore, the media and the government have the responsibility to distribute positive information, to correctly guide the public's emotions to bring some sort of reassurance to the public.","Zhong, Zufeng",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,285

In our country, new measures to be taken were announced after the first case was seen on March 11, 2020. In this study, patients who admitted to the smoking cessation clinic in 2018 and followed up by phone, regarding smoking cessation status in 2019 were questioned for their smoking cessation status after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In this descriptive study, the patients who applied to the smoking cessation outpatient clinic in 2018 were questioned regarding their smoking cessation status after 1 year and after the pandemic. It was investigated whether coronapandemia had an effect on smoking cessation. The data were evaluated by using SPSS 22 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 357 individuals with a median of Fagerström score of 7.0 were included in the study. Seventy-one (19.9%) of the subjects used nicotine tape, 268 (75.1%) used varenicline, and 18 (5.0%) used both. When the success of those who quit smoking before pandemic and those who quit smoking after pandemic were compared, a statistically significant relationship was found (p < 0.001). In our study, the rate of smoking cessation after 1 year was 23.7%, and the most common side effects were psychiatric complaints, whereas the rate of smoking cessation during the pandemic period was 31.1%. In order to increase the rate of smoking cessation, which is an important public health problem, more counseling should be provided, during the pandemic period.","Kayhan Tetik, Burcu; Gedik Tekinemre, Isilay; Tas, Servet",J. community health,,285

Several current publications have considered Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients to be particularly vulnerable during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and clinicians were advised to adjust treatments accordingly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the two- and six-month impacts of COVID-19 on the symptom severity of OCD patients. METHODS: A cohort of OCD patients, actively treated with Exposure and Response Prevention [ERP] combined with pharmacological treatment, was evaluated as part of their regular psychiatric assessment twice: 113 patients were evaluated at their two-month follow-up, and 90 patients (from that cohort), were evaluated at their six-month follow up. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the patients at the two-month follow-up and 96% of the patients at the six-month follow-up did not show OC symptom deterioration. The results were also replicated in the OCD subgroup that included contamination (washers) and patients with illness obsessions who were believed to be particularly vulnerable, considering their obsessional content. CONCLUSION: OCD patients (including those with obsessions related to contamination and health) who are under an active ERP and pharmacological treatment, did not experience exacerbated symptoms during COVID-19 at their two- and six-month follow-ups.","Carmi, Lior; Ben-Arush, Oded; Fostick, Leah; Cohen, Hagit; Zohar, Joseph",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,,285

263684,Return to training in the COVID-19 era: The physiological effects of face masks during exercise,2020,"The importance of Zn for human health becomes obvious during Zn deficiency. Even mild insufficiencies of Zn cause alterations in haematopoiesis and immune functions, resulting in a proinflammatory phenotype and a disturbed redox metabolism. Although immune system malfunction has the most obvious effect, the functions of several tissue cell types are disturbed if Zn supply is limiting. Adhesion molecules and tight junction proteins decrease, while cell death increases, generating barrier dysfunction and possibly organ failure. Taken together, Zn deficiency both weakens the resistance of the human body towards pathogens and at the same time increases the danger of an overactive immune response that may cause tissue damage. The case numbers of Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) are still increasing, which is causing enormous problems for health systems and economies. There is an urgent need to reduce both the number of severe cases and the resulting deaths. While therapeutic options are still under investigation, and first vaccines have been approved, cost-effective ways to reduce the likelihood of or even prevent infection, and the transition from mild symptoms to more serious detrimental disease, are highly desirable. Nutritional supplementation might be an effective option to achieve these aims. In this review, we discuss known Zn deficiency effects in the context of an infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 and its currently known pathogenic mechanisms and elaborate on how severe pre-existing Zn deficiency may pre-dispose patients to a severe progression of COVID-19.

265689,Sequencing Treatments for Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a global shift toward online distance learning due to travel limitations and physical distancing requirements as well as medical school and university closures. In low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, where medical education faces a range of challenges-such as lack of infrastructure, well-trained educators, and advanced technologies-the abrupt changes in methodologies without adequate preparation are more challenging than in higher income countries. In this article, the authors discuss the COVID-19-related changes and challenges in Nepal that may have a drastic impact on the career progression of current medical students. Outside the major cities, Nepal lacks dependable internet services to support medical education, which frequently requires access to and transmission of large files and audiovisual material. Thus, students who are poor, physically disadvantaged, and who do not have a home situation conducive to online study may be affected disproportionately. Further, the majority of teachers and students do not have sufficient logistical experience and knowledge to conduct or participate in online classes. Moreover, students and teachers are unsatisfied with the digital methodologies, which will ultimately hamper the quality of education. Students' clinical skills development, research activities, and live and intimate interactions with other individuals are being affected. Even though Nepal's medical education system is struggling to adapt to the transformation of teaching methodologies in the wake of the pandemic, it is important not to postpone the education of current medical students and future physicians during this crisis. Looking ahead, medical schools in Nepal should ensure that mechanisms are proactively put into place to embrace new educational opportunities and technologies to guarantee a regular supply of high-quality physicians capable of both responding effectively to any future pandemic and satisfying the nation's future health care needs.","Sigdel, Shailendra; Ozaki, Akihiko; Dhakal, Rachana; Pradhan, Bishwas; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",Acad. med,,285

266186,The close relationship between sudden loss of smell and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. METHODS: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.","Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K; Fadel, William F; Duszynski, Thomas J; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir",PLoS One,,285

To contain its spread and prevent further fatalities, the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent prerequisite. Thus, in this article, by utilizing the in-silico approach, a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed. Moreover, the effectiveness and safety measures of our proposed epitopic vaccine candidate have been evaluated by in-silico tools and servers (AllerTOP and AllergenFP servers). We observed that the vaccine candidate has no allergenicity and successfully combined with Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein to elicit an inflammatory immune response. Stable, functional mobility of the vaccine-TLR protein binding interface was confirmed by the Normal Mode Analysis. The in-silico cloning model demonstrated the efficacy of the construct vaccine along with the identified epitopes against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our proposed in-silico vaccine candidate has potent efficacy against COVID-19 infection, and successive research work might validate its effectiveness in in vitro and in vivo models.","Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Patra, Prasanta; Ghosh, Pratik; Sharma, Garima; Patra, Bidhan Chandra; Saha, Rudra P.; Lee, Sang-Soo; Chakraborty, Chiranjib",Inform.

Although glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia (GCIH) is well-known, there is no report describing the glycemic profile following a single dose of IV dexamethasone as captured on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a patient with diabetes treated with insulin. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with diabetes and pancreatic adenocarcinoma was treated with chemotherapy containing dexamethasone every other week. CGM data of 23 cycles revealed a reproducible triphasic glycemic pattern consisting of a constant hyperglycemia period, followed by a transient improvement, and ending with another hyperglycemic plateau. Given this recurrent pattern, basal insulin and correction insulin were adjusted with subsequent GCIH attenuation. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of CGM glycemic profile following recurring doses of IV dexamethasone in a patient with diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin.

According to historians, death was familiar and tamed, it was at the center of social and cultural life. With the coming of modern secular society, death was increasingly sequestrated and tabooed, moved to the outskirts of society, made invisible and forbidden. Death became a stranger, and the prevalent attitude towards death was that of alienation. At the threshold of the 21st century, the topic of death again began to attract attention, becoming part of a revived death attitude described as 'Spectacular Death'. In the article, the authors diagnose, analyze, and discuss the impact of the return of death during the current 'Corona Crisis', arguing that despite the fact that the concern with death is at the very core of the management of the crisis, death as such remains largely invisible.

268509,Sex and COVID-19: A Protective Role for Reproductive Steroids,2020,"Sporotrichosis is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by Sporothrix species, of which the main aetiological agents are S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa. Infection occurs after a traumatic inoculation of Sporothrix propagules in mammals' skin and can follow either a classic route through traumatic inoculation by plant debris (e.g., S. schenckii and S. globosa) or an alternative route through zoonotic transmission from animals (e.g., S. brasiliensis). Epizootics followed by a zoonotic route occur in Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as the epicenter of a recent cat-transmitted epidemic. DNA-based markers are needed to explore the epidemiology of these Sporothrix expansions using molecular methods. This paper reports the use of amplified-fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLP) to assess the degree of intraspecific variability among Sporothrix species. We used whole-genome sequences from Sporothrix species to generate 2,304 virtual AFLP fingerprints. In silico screening highlighted 6 primer pair combinations to be tested in vitro. The protocol was used to genotype 27 medically relevant Sporothrix. Based on the overall scored AFLP markers (97-137 fragments), the values of polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.2552-0.3113), marker index (MI = 0.002-0.0039), effective multiplex ratio (E = 17.8519-35.2222), resolving power (Rp = 33.6296-63.1852), discriminating power (D = 0.9291-0.9662), expected heterozygosity (H = 0.3003-0.3857), and mean heterozygosity (Havp = 0.0001) demonstrated the utility of these primer combinations for discriminating Sporothrix. AFLP markers revealed cryptic diversity in species previously thought to be the most prevalent clonal type, such as S. brasiliensis, responsible for cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, and S. globosa responsible for large sapronosis outbreaks in Asia. Three combinations (#3 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-TT, #5 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-AG, and #6 EcoRI-FAM-TA/MseI-AA) provide the best diversity indices and lowest error rates. These methods make it easier to track routes of disease transmission during epizooties and zoonosis, and our DNA fingerprint assay can be further transferred between laboratories to give insights into the ecology and evolution of pathogenic Sporothrix species and to inform management and mitigation strategies to tackle the advance of sporotrichosis.","de Carvalho, Jamile Ambrósio; Hagen, Ferry; Fisher, Matthew C; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires; Rodrigues, Anderson Messias",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,285
269290,Medical research during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"AIM: In spring 2020, the first Covid-19-related lockdown included the closing of kindergartens and schools. Home schooling, the lack of social contacts with peers and the care of the children at home posed an enormous challenge for many families. METHODS: The present study investigated the leisure behavior of 285 one- to 10-year-old German children at two time points (t1 and t2) during the Covid-19-related lockdown in spring 2020. In the subsample of primary school children (n = 102), we also explored children's attitudes towards schoolwork at home. Analyses focused on the change of behavior from t1 to t2, on differences in these changes depending on socio-economic status (SES), and on associations of behavior with SES, the number of children at home, and the frequency of receiving learning materials from school. RESULTS: While the frequency of playing outside increased significantly from t1 to t2, the frequency of handicrafts, playing board games, indoor sports, and motivation to do schoolwork decreased. The observed changes between t1 and t2 did not differ depending on SES. However, a lower SES was associated with higher media use, less outdoor activity, and (though only marginally significant) a reduced time doing schoolwork and a reduced ability to concentrate on schoolwork at t1. In households with more children, children played outside more often, but were read to less frequently and (though only marginally significant) watched movies and series less frequently. Children receiving learning materials from school on a regular basis spent significantly more time doing schoolwork at home than children receiving materials only irregularly. CONCLUSIONS: A continuing loss of childcare in day-care facilities and schools entails the danger of declining education in the form of (inter)active indoor activities and schoolwork.","Poulain, Tanja; Meigen, Christof; Sobek, Carolin; Ober, Peggy; Igel, Ulrike; Körner, Antje; Kiess, Wieland; Vogel, Mandy",PLoS One,,285

269559,Cancer management challenge in a developing country in COVID-19 pandemic: reflection of a group of Moroccan oncologists,2020,"DETAILS OF THE CLINICAL CASE: A 51-yr-old man underwent a respiratory rehabilitation program (RRP), after being tracheostomized and ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Respiratory care, early mobilization, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were started in the ad hoc isolation ward of our rehabilitation center. At baseline, muscle function was consistent with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and the patient still needed mechanical ventilation (MV) and oxygen support. During the first week of RRP in isolation, the patient was successfully weaned from MV, the tracheal cannula was removed, and the walking capacity was recovered. At the end of the RRP, continued in a standard department, respiratory muscles strength increased by 7% and muscle function improved as indicated by the quadriceps size enlargement of 13% and the change of the Medical Research Council sum score from 48/60 to 58/60. DISCUSSION: Providing RRP in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS involves risks for operators and organizational difficulties, especially in rehabilitation centers; nevertheless, its continuity is important to prevent the development of permanent disabilities in previously healthy subjects. Limited to the experience of only one patient, we were able to carry out a safe RRP during the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting the complete functional recovery of a COVID-19 young patient. SUMMARY: Most patients who develop serious consequences of COVID-19 infection risk a reduction in their quality of life. However, by organizing and directing specialized resources, subacute rehabilitation facilities could ensure the continuity of the RRPs even during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pancera, Simone; Galeri, Silvia; Porta, Roberto; Pietta, Irene; Bianchi, Luca Nicola Cesare; Carrozza, Maria Chiara; Villafañe, Jorge Hugo",J Cardiopulm Rehabil Prev,,285

269953,Myositis due to COVID-19,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that people can adapt quickly to ensure that their social needs are met after being forced to isolate and socially distance. Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music. In a time when people across the globe have been unable to meet in person, they have found a way to meet in the music.

They offer a unique opportunity for remote communication in which to promote a social distancing strategy that has been taken to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, health organizations, governments, and academics have built mobile applications to potentially combat the pandemic. However, academics have made special efforts in the fight against the novel disease. The aim of this review is to explore the mobile applications being developed by academics to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this aim, firstly, the related applications were selected through conducting a search in the top indexed journals. Secondly, the goal of each app was identified. Thirdly, the technology used to achieve the app's goal was extracted. The review results revealed four goals for applications related to COVID-19, and eight technologies were utilised to achieve these goals. The significant finding of this review is that academics mostly depend on manual rather than automated data collection methods due to the users’ concerns about protecting their privacy. However, they still face the challenge of unskilled users of smart phones especially older adults.","Zainab Hameed, Alfayez",International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration,,285

Comments: First, infectious diseases are either patterned according to socioeconomic status (SES), determined by e.g. habitus, nutrition and crowded housing or clustering, or not according to SES. Second, the focus on economic inequality measured as income inequality (Gini index) should be complemented with measures of wealth inequality (Gini index for wealth), following the globalization process with tax exempted multinational companies.

According to a report, comorbidity enhances the risk factors with complications of COVID-19. Here, we propose and explore a mathematical framework to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with comorbidity. Within this framework, the model is calibrated by using new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India. The qualitative properties of the model and the stability of feasible equilibrium are studied. The model experiences the scenario of backward bifurcation by parameter regime accounting for progress in susceptibility to acquire infection by comorbidity individuals. The endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if recruitment of comorbidity becomes higher without acquiring the infection. Moreover, a larger backward bifurcation regime indicates the possibility of more infection in susceptible individuals. A dynamics in the mean fluctuation of the force of infection is investigated with different parameter regimes. A significant correlation is established between the force of infection and corresponding Shannon entropy under the same parameters, which provides evidence that infection reaches a significant proportion of the susceptible.","Das, Parthasakha; Nadim, Sk Shahid; Das, Samhita; Das, Pritha",Nonlinear Dyn,,285

A comparative analysis was conducted to examine average travel time distributions (TTD), and their associated TTR metrics, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel time data for four urban arterial corridors in Nebraska, disaggregated by peak period and direction, were analyzed. It was found that in 2020, the average TTD mean and standard deviation values for all 16 scenarios were reduced by an average of 14.0% and 43.4%, respectively. The travel time index, the planning time index, the level of travel time reliability (LOTTR), and the buffer index metrics associated with these TTDs were reduced, on average, by 14.0%, 19.7%, 3.5%, and 35.0%, respectively. In other words, whether the test corridors were more reliable during the pandemic was a function of which TTR metric was used. The paper concludes by arguing for a fundamental change in how arterial TTR is measured and reported to different user groups. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Rilett, L.

However, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV shared within few days of outbreak shows the better response of China and the world against the virus, perhaps due to the availability of advanced technology and lesson learned from previous epidemics. The researchers trying to determine the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission of 2019-nCoV. It is believed that disease reporting and data sharing about the emerged Coronavirus with international researchers are important steps to reduce the spread of the virus to the rest of the world. This report is aimed to understand the current status of the 2019-nCoV, problems related to it and possible measures for prevention. The infection may spread through wildlife and asymptomatic patients. People in underdeveloped countries having no basic facilities are at higher risk. Ban on wildlife trade and avoiding unnecessary traveling for a certain period is required to minimize the spread of the disease. The use of face masks, keeping away from the public gathering are other possible means of precautions, capacity building of health workers and provided relevant facilities (equipment, kits, etc.) to underdeveloped countries will further help to contain the pandemic. In the current scenario, it is concluded that 2019-nCoV is spreading irrespective of the borders and become pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 963 mandibular posterior teeth were analyzed in CBCT scans from 133 patients. The buccolingual and mesiodistal dimensions of the root and the buccal bone thickness overlying the root were measured at the site of root resection (apical 3 mm). At this location, the relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root was classified into three types (separated, contact, and exposed), and the distance from the root apex to the mandibular canal was measured. RESULTS: The thickest buccolingual dimension of the roots was found in the mesial roots of first molars, at 5.59 ± 0.97 mm. The buccal bone thickness overlying the root became thicker in posterior tooth locations. In the first premolar and first molar mesial root, contact was the most common type of relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root. As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the distance from the apex to the mandibular canal became shorter. CONCLUSIONS: As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the buccal bone thickness increased and the distance to the mandibular canal became closer; therefore, particular attention is required for posterior teeth. The first premolar and the first molar mesial root are often in contact with the buccal cortical bone, which may allow infections to spread to the buccal structure more easily and negatively affect for post-surgical healing. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When planning and performing endodontic microsurgery, understanding the anatomical structure of the surgical site will help minimize tissue damage and reduce complications.","Jeon, Kug Jin; Lee, Chena; Choi, Yoon Joo; Han, Sang-Sun",,,285

During five months, an amount of 14,588 scientific publications about nCoV-2 and COVID-19 has been generated intensively (as indexed in Scopus on 31 May 2020). Such a knowledge outburst has created ample interest in understanding the research landscape of this newly configured area. This paper demonstrates on scientometric dimensions of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) research using quantifiable characteristics of the publication dataset. Findings reveal that the rate of publication growth (1600%) is very significant to a synergic response of the researchers to combat with the most extended sequence of an RNA virus. Indeed their response has geared up to an average of 100 articles per day. Many scholarly publishers have disclosed their preprint servers to make the publications available immediately, even by enabling Open Access. The scientific contents have published in more than 500 journals from 240 academic publishers. While the top-ten publishers occupied almost 70% of the articles, then about 25% of the studies were sponsored by 300 funding agencies. Among the notable journals Lancet, Nature, BMJ, JAMA, JMV, and NEJM are prominent.

The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities' restrictions could impact the citizens' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.","Azizi, Asmaa; Achak, Doha; Aboudi, Khalid; Saad, Elmadani; Nejjari, Chakib; Nouira, Youness; Hilali, Abderraouf; Youlyouz-Marfak, Ibtissam; Marfak, Abdelghafour",Data Brief,,285

We aim to investigate healthcare staff’s mental health issues and the associated predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this paper aims to identify some unique predictors of healthcare staff’s mental health issues in Iran, the second country after China to experience a major COVID-19 crisis. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all 31 provinces of Iran assessed staff’s mental distress (K6), depression, and anxiety (PHQ-4) during April 5– 20, 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff surpassed the cutoff for distress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Females or more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression symptoms. The number of COVID-19 cases among a healthcare worker’s colleagues or friends positively predicted the worker’s anxiety symptoms. Amongst healthcare staff, doctors were less likely than radiology technologists to experience distress and anxiety symptoms. Technicians and obstetrics staff experienced fewer anxiety symptoms. The age and the weekly working days of healthcare staff interacted such that age is asignificant predictor of mental health issues among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: The identification of the predictors of mental health issues can guide healthcare organizations to screen healthcare workers who are more likely to be mentally vulnerable in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Gong, Haitong Zhang Stephen X.; Nawaser, Khaled Asghar Afshar Jahanshahi Xu Xingzi Li Jizhen Bagheri Afsaneh",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,,285

In this research, we examine how talking about crises such as COVID-19 at the team level affects team dynamics and behaviors. Drawing upon cultural tightness-looseness theory, we propose that talking about the COVID-19 crisis among team members is positively associated with team cultural tightness, which in turn benefits teams by decreasing team deviance but hurts teams by decreasing team creativity. Furthermore, we suggest that team virtuality moderates and weakens these indirect effects because face-to-face communication about COVID-19 is more powerful in influencing team cultural tightness than virtual communication. Results from a multisource, three-wave field study during the pandemic lend substantial support to these hypotheses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and directions for future research.

Conclusion: From 1950 to 2009 or even to 2019, large amount of body fat clearly became more prevalent in young adults from Slovenia, which mostly is in line with secular trend in fat tissue in other parts of the world; however, in many measurements this trend slows down or even reverses after 2009 in Slovenia. Slovenian population appears to be leaner compared to other populations.","Robic Pikel, Tatjana",Anthropol. anz,,285
278553,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will create a disease surge among cancer patients,2020,"With the fast development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, scientists around the globe are desperately searching for effective antiviral therapeutic agents. Bridging systems biology and drug discovery, we propose a deep learning framework for conditional de novo design of antiviral candidate drugs tailored against given protein targets. First, we train a multimodal ligand--protein binding affinity model on predicting affinities of antiviral compounds to target proteins and couple this model with pharmacological toxicity predictors. Exploiting this multi-objective as a reward function of a conditional molecular generator (consisting of two VAEs), we showcase a framework that navigates the chemical space toward regions with more antiviral molecules. Specifically, we explore a challenging setting of generating ligands against unseen protein targets by performing a leave-one-out-cross-validation on 41 SARS-CoV-2-related target proteins. Using deep RL, it is demonstrated that in 35 out of 41 cases, the generation is biased towards sampling more binding ligands, with an average increase of 83% comparing to an unbiased VAE. We present a case-study on a potential Envelope-protein inhibitor and perform a synthetic accessibility assessment of the best generated molecules is performed that resembles a viable roadmap towards a rapid in-vitro evaluation of potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Born, Jannis; Manica, Matteo; Cadow, Joris; Markert, Greta; Mill, Nil Adell; Filipavicius, Modestas; Mart'inez, Mar'ia Rodr'iguez",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13285v2.pdf,285

Earlier reports have demonstrated complicated postoperative courses and high fatality rates in patients undergoing emergent cardiothoracic surgery who were diagnosed postoperatively with COVID-19. These reports raise the possibility that active COVID-19 might precipitate a catastrophic pathophysiological response to infection in the postoperative period and lead to unfavorable surgical outcomes. Hence, it is imperative to screen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection before surgery and to carefully monitor them in the postoperative period to identify any signs of active COVID-19. In this report, we present the successful outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation in a patient with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with an acute coronary syndrome and requiring urgent surgical intervention. We employed a thorough strategy to identify subclinical COVID-19 disease, and after confirming the absence of active disease, proceeded with the CABG operation. The patient outcome was successful with the absence of any overt COVID-19 manifestations in the postoperative period.","Yandrapalli, Srikanth; Cooper, Howard A; Malekan, Ramin",J. card. surg,,285

Still, the cross-species transmission has produced some unusually ICLE virulent strains which now causing viral pneumonia, in severe cases, even acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2 is the most threatening issue which leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. An effective vaccine to cure this virus is not yet available, so it requires concerted efforts at various scales. The viral Main Protease controls coronavirus replication and is a proven drug discovery target for SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive computational study e.g., molecular docking and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) profiling were employed to predict the efficacy of medicinal plant-based bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2 MPP. Paritaprevir and lopinavir-previously approved viral main protease inhibitors were used as standards for comparison. MPP was docked with 90 phytochemical compounds, and the screening revealed that four compounds (azadirachtin,-12.5 kcal/mol;rutin,-9 kcal/mol;theaflavin,-9 kcal/mol;astragalin,-8.8 kcal/mol) showed the highest binding affinity than the controls paritaprevir and lopinavir (-8.7 and-7.9 kcal/mol, respectively). Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that the compounds have intense interaction with the vital catalytic residue His-41 and Cys-145. Furthermore, the pharmaco-kinetics and drug-likeness properties of the antiviral phytochemicals suggested that the compounds do not have any considerable detrimental effects and can be considered potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. These compounds can be further explored for in vitro experimental validation against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Bangladesh Society for Microbiology, Immunology and Advanced Biotechnology.

for COVID-19 mortality This risk may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking history, pulmonary disease burden and cancer-directed therapies Methods: TERAVOLT is a global consortium examining outcomes and assessing risk factors associated with mortality of patients with thoracic malignancies and COVID-19 infection Results: As of July 15, 2020, 1012 patients from 20 countries have been entered;median age was 68 with 58 % male, 80% current/former smokers, most common comorbidities of HTN (49%) & COPD (26%);82% NSCLC, 68 % patients with stage IV disease at COVID diagnosis, 65% on treatment (38% chemotherapy, 26% immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), 16 % targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Of these, 72% were hospitalized;56% of patients developed complications, most frequently pneumonia (40%) and 47% who did not have prior oxygen therapy required it 32% of patients died during their COVID-19 infection Only 33 % of patients continued their oncology treatment after infection Patients presenting with pneumonia (OR 2 7 2-3 5), consolidation (OR 2 CI 1,5-2,8), bilateral lung abnormalities (OR 2,8 CI 2-3,9) and pleural effusion (OR 2,7 CI 1,8-4) were at increased risk of mortality In multivariate analysis age ≥ 65 (OR 1,53 CI 1,11-2,1), active smoking (OR 2 CI 1,3-3), higher stage of cancer (OR 1,9 CI 1,3-2,7), ECOG PS ≥2 (OR 3,7 CI 2,7-5), steroids prior to COVID diagnosis (OR 1,8 CI 1,2-2,7), were associated with increased risk of death, while chemotherapy and TKI therapy use were not and interestingly patients on immunotherapy appeared to be at decreased risk for mortality (OR 0,6 CI 0,5-0,97) Conclusions: Facing this ongoing global pandemic, TERAVOLT is the largest thoracic malignancy database confirming the high risk for COVID-19 mortality in this specific patient group Physicians need to evaluate the risk of mortality from COVID-19 based on age, smoking status, stage of cancer, performance status, need for steroids and specific therapy

282368,Estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: the choice of treatment of chronic grade III acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is controversial. Several surgical techniques have been described in the literature, responding differently to nonoperative treatment. The aim of this study is to describe a modified technique of stabilizing an AC joint dislocation with the new Infinity-Lock Button System, in order to demonstrate that it is effective in optimizing outcomes and decreasing complications. METHODS: this is a retrospective study of 15 patients who underwent surgical stabilization of the AC joint dislocation between 2018 and 2019, through modified surgical technique using the Infinity-Lock Button System. Active range of motion (ROM), Specific Acromio Clavicular Score (SACS) and Constant Score (CS) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at last 18 months follow up. Patients rated their outcomes as very good, good, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. RESULTS: a total of twelve patients rated their outcome as very good and three as good; no patients were dissatisfied with surgery. The mean Constant Score increased from 38 points preoperatively to 95 postoperatively, the average SACS score decreased from 52 points preoperatively to 10 postoperatively, both significantly. No complications were detected. CONCLUSION: the described technique is effective for treatment of chronic grade III AC joint dislocation, resulting in elevated satisfaction ratings and predictable outcomes. Nevertheless, further longer term follow-up studies are required.","Romano, Alfonso Maria; Casillo, Pasquale; De Simone, Monica; Nastrucci, Guglielmo; Risorto, Donatella; Susanna, Massimiliano; Di Giunta, Angelo; Ascione, Francesco",,,285

The purpose was to investigate the influence of the occlusal splint on three-element implant-supported fixed prosthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-dimensional virtual model was created consisting of a cortical and spongy bone block simulating the region from first premolar to the maxillary first molar using two HE or MT implants (4 x 11mm) with Ti and/or Y-TZP abutments. The second premolar was the pontic of the prosthesis. The three-element fixed prosthesis with a zirconia infrastructure and Y-TZP coating were cemented, in addition to using a flat occlusal splint made of acrylic resin in the region. Combined axial and oblique loads of 100N and 300N were applied. RESULTS: The tensile stresses on MT implant bone tissue produced values of 4-19% lower than those of HE implants. The lowest differences were observed for oblique loading with an occlusal splint, with a 4% (Ti-Y-TZP) and 9% (Ti-Ti) decrease. When the compressive stresses were evaluated, HE implants produced lower values than MT implants. CONCLUSION: A significant increase was observed in the oblique loading stresses in the absence of occlusal splints, regardless of the applied load.","Henrique, M N; Caldas, R A; Baroudi, K; Amaral, M; Vitti, R P; Silva-Concílio, L R",Eur. j. prosthodont. restor. dent,,285

Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729. FINDINGS: From April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%. Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.","Jeronimo, Christiane Maria Prado; Farias, Maria Eduarda Leão; Val, Fernando Fonseca Almeida; Sampaio, Vanderson Souza; Alexandre, Marcia Almeida Araújo; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Safe, Izabella Picinin; Borba, Mayla Gabriela Silva; Abreu-Netto, Rebeca Linhares; Maciel, Alex Bezerra Silva; Neto, João Ricardo Silva; Oliveira, Lucas Barbosa; Figueiredo, Erick Frota Gomes; Dinelly, Kelry Mazurega Oliveira; Rodrigues, Maria Gabriela de Almeida; Brito, Marcelo; Mourão, Maria Paula Gomes; Pivoto João, Guilherme Augusto; Hajjar, Ludhmila Abrahão; Bassat, Quique; Romero, Gustavo Adolfo Sierra; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Vasconcelos, Heline Lira; Tavares, Michel de Araújo; Brito-Sousa, José Diego; Costa, Fabio Trindade Maranhão; Nogueira, Maurício Lacerda; Baía-da-Silva, Djane; Xavier, Mariana Simão; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Lacerda, Marcus Vinícius Guimarães",Clin Infect Dis,,285

285465,How COVID-19 case fatality rates have shaped perceptions and travel intention?,2021,"Abstract Introduction The main prevention strategy for reducing the dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2 has been social distancing. Several investigations began to explore its psychological impact since it began, but there are no data about its effect on social and family behavior. Objectives Were: First, to analyze the reliability of an ad-hoc designed questionnaire to measure sociofamily behavior changes in a sample of parents of children from one to twelve years old. Second, to characterize effects of voluntary social isolation by COVID-19 over sociofamily behavior at a personal level and over children's activities at home. Third, to determine vulnerability predictors for a negative experience by isolation itself. Method An online Questionnaire for Perceptions of Changes in Sociofamily Behavior was applied to 365 Mexican participants. Results Factor analysis showed a reliability of the ad-hoc designed questionnaire for this study. Correlations were found between voluntary social isolation and self-perceived experiences, such as sleep quality, irritability, emotional control, hope about the future, motivation, attention span, and problem solving. Discussion and conclusion The results of this study suggest that family well-being during voluntary social isolation is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, which addresses specific effects in different domains, especially in sociofamily behavior.","Torres González, Cynthia; Galindo-Aldana, Gilberto; García León, Ibza America; Padilla-López, Luis Alfredo; Alvarez Núñez, Daniel Nikolaus; Espinoza Gutiérrez, Yojana Irlanda",Salud ment,,285

Still, there is a lack of systematic knowledge about the roles that different types of nontechnological third parties – that is, other customers, pets, other employees and other firms – can adopt in relation to customers and service providers during encounters. The present study aims to unravel these roles and highlight their implications for customers, service providers and/or third parties.Design/methodology/approachThis research relies on a systematic review of literature in the Web of Science using a search string pertaining to the research study’s objectives. In total, 2,726 articles were screened by title and abstract using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, thereby extracting 189 articles for full-text eligibility. The final sample consisted of 139 articles for coding and analysis.FindingsThe analyses reveal that other customers, pets, other employees and other firms can adopt five roles: bystander, connector, endorser, balancer and partner. Each role has different implications for customers, service providers and/or third parties. Additionally, the five roles are associated with distinct constellations of the customer, the service provider and the third party. These roles and constellations are dynamic and not mutually exclusive.Originality/valueThis research contributes to the service encounter literature by providing a thorough understanding of the various third-party roles and their implications for customers, service providers and/or third parties during encounters. As such, this research sheds light on the conditions under which third parties become “significant others” in service encounters and identifies avenues for future research.","Abboud, Liliane As039; ad, Nabila Bilstein Nicola Costers Annelies Henkens Bieke Verleye Katrien",Journal of Service Management,,285

Dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells, as newly discovered T-helper cells, have the functions of Th2 and Th17 cells and can coproduce Th2 and Th17 cytokines. Previous studies have shown that dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells increase the chances of asthma and correlate with asthma severity. However, the exact role of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells in asthma is not known. Since there is no mature differentiation method for dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells, the present study aimed to clarify the strict differentiation conditions and reveal how dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells regulate asthma phenotypes. In this study, we confirmed that IL-1ß, IL-6, anti-IFN-Î³, and IL-21 promoted biphenotypic cell differentiation. Moreover, more proportion of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells can be obtained by conditioned differentiation of mouse CD4+ T cells after classical allergic asthma modeling. Before asthma modeling, adoptive dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells promoted T cells to differentiate into the same biphenotype cells and exacerbated the severity of asthma. Together, our results clarify the differentiation conditions of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells and further confirm that it stimulates asthma T cells to differentiate into the same biphenotype cells, leading to exacerbation of asthma.","Sun, Wenjin; Yuan, Yu; Qiu, Lulu; Zeng, Qingping; Jia, Jingsi; Xiang, Xudong; Jia, Aijun; Ma, Libing; Liu, Shaokun; Xiao, Bing",Can Respir J,,285
288518,Shifting paradigms in two common abdominal surgical emergencies during the pandemic,2021,"There are important individual differences in adaptation and reactivity to stressful challenges. Being subjected to strict social confinement is a distressful psychological experience leading to reduced emotional well-being, but it is not known how it can affect the cognitive and empathic tendencies of different individuals. Cortisol, a key glucocorticoid in humans, is a strong modulator of brain function, behavior, and cognition, and the diurnal cortisol rhythm has been postulated to interact with environmental stressors to predict stress adaptation. The present study investigates in 45 young adults (21.09 years old, SD = 6.42) whether pre-pandemic diurnal cortisol indices, overall diurnal cortisol secretion (AUCg) and cortisol awakening response (CAR) can predict individuals' differential susceptibility to the impact of strict social confinement during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on working memory, empathy, and perceived stress. We observed that, following long-term home confinement, there was an increase in subjects' perceived stress and cognitive empathy scores, as well as an improvement in visuospatial working memory. Moreover, during confinement, resilient coping moderated the relationship between perceived stress scores and pre-pandemic AUCg and CAR. In addition, in mediation models, we observed a direct effect of AUCg and an indirect effect of both CAR and AUCg, on change in perceived self-efficacy. These effects were parallelly mediated by the increase in working memory span and cognitive empathy. In summary, our findings reveal the role of the diurnal pattern of cortisol in predicting the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential biomarker for the identification of at-risk groups following public health crises.","Baliyan, Shishir; Cimadevilla, José Manuel; de Vidania, Silvia; Pulopulos, Matías M; Sandi, Carmen; Venero, César",,,285
288599,The Emergence of Pediatric Telehealth as a Result of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: We aimed to identify motivators and barriers to volunteering during a disaster and knowledge and medical school curriculum of disaster and pandemic medicine. Method: We systematically searched the literature on 28/6/2020, following PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria including 11,168 medical students and 91 medical schools. 24 studies evaluated knowledge (64.9%), 16 evaluated volunteering (43.2%), and five evaluated medical school curricula (13.5%). Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD=21.7%, n=2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (P&lt;.001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this difference. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD=15.1%, n=2985). Conclusions: There is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are likely to be under-prepared for these roles due to poor overall knowledge and limited teaching. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters, medical students may be required to volunteer as auxiliary staff. Medical schools need to develop infrastructure to facilitate this process. as well as providing education and training to ensure students are adequately prepared for these roles.","Byrne, M.; Ashcroft, J.; Alexander, L.; Wan, J.; Harvey, A.",British Journal of Surgery,,285

The model takes into account the hesitancy and refusal of vaccination. To this aim, we employ the information index, which mimics the idea that individuals take their decision on vaccination based not only on the present but also on the past information about the spread of the disease. Theoretical analysis and simulations show clearly as a voluntary vaccination can certainly reduce the impact of the disease but it is unable to eliminate it. We also show how the information-related parameters affect the dynamics of the disease. In particular, the hesitancy and refusal of vaccination is better contained in case of large information coverage and small memory characteristic time. Finally, the possible influence of seasonality is also investigated.","Buonomo, Bruno; Marca, Rossella Della; d'Onofrio, Alberto; Groppi, Maria",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11745v1.pdf,285

We obtain an explicit characterization of the optimal wage along with the optimal action provided by the agent. The optimal contract is linear by offering both a fixed share of the output which is similar to the standard shutdown-free Holmstr{\""o}m-Milgrom model and a linear prevention mechanism that is proportional to the random lifetime of the contract.

291215,Medicines for the Treatment Of COVID-19: Awaiting the Evidence,2020,"Preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in correctional and detention facilities* can be challenging because of population-dense housing, varied access to hygiene facilities and supplies, and limited space for isolation and quarantine (1). Incarcerated and detained populations have a high prevalence of chronic diseases, increasing their risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and making early detection critical (2,3). Correctional and detention facilities are not closed systems; SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted to and from the surrounding community through staff member and visitor movements as well as entry, transfer, and release of incarcerated and detained persons (1). To better understand SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in these settings, CDC requested data from 15 jurisdictions describing results of mass testing events among incarcerated and detained persons and cases identified through earlier symptom-based testing. Six jurisdictions reported SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 0%-86.8% (median = 29.3%) from mass testing events in 16 adult facilities. Before mass testing, 15 of the 16 facilities had identified at least one COVID-19 case among incarcerated or detained persons using symptom-based testing, and mass testing increased the total number of known cases from 642 to 8,239. Case surveillance from symptom-based testing has likely underestimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities. Broad-based testing can provide a more accurate assessment of prevalence and generate data to help control transmission (4).","Hagan, Liesl M; Williams, Samantha P; Spaulding, Anne C; Toblin, Robin L; Figlenski, Jessica; Ocampo, Jeanne; Ross, Tara; Bauer, Heidi; Hutchinson, Justine; Lucas, Kimberley D; Zahn, Matthew; Chiang, Chun; Collins, Timothy; Burakoff, Alexis; Bettridge, Juli; Stringer, Ginger; Maul, Randolph; Waters, Kristen; Dewart, Courtney; Clayton, Jennifer; de Fijter, Sietske; Sadacharan, Radha; Garcia, Linda; Lockett, Naomi; Short, Kirstin; Sunder, Laxman; Handanagic, Senad",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,285

292185,Clinical trials and Haemophilia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Madrid's experience,2020,"Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity-using dendritic spines as proxies-of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting Arc as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express Arc have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.","Castello-Waldow, Tim P; Weston, Ghabiba; Ulivi, Alessandro F; Chenani, Alireza; Loewenstein, Yonatan; Chen, Alon; Attardo, Alessio",PLoS Biol,,285

Italy, in the context of the research, has been severely affected. The economic crisis has mainly affected women. In this scenario, entrepreneurial perceived success (objective and subjective) is influenced by increasingly burdensome job demands that entrepreneurs have to face up. Using the job demand-resources model, the study aims to broaden the knowledge of the determinants of entrepreneurial perceived success in the current emergency moment. In particular, as regards of the demands, alongside the specific entrepreneurial demands (time demands, uncertainty and risk, and responsibility), we also decided to include the negative interface family-work in both directions from-family-to-work (NEGWIF) and from-work-to-family (NEGFIW). Regarding the resources, we considered entrepreneurial self-efficacy (researching, planning, marshaling, implementing people, and implementing financial), proactive and elaborate social strategies (SS), and both directions of the positive interface: from-family-to-work (POSWIF) and from-work-to-family (POSFIW). All participants are women entrepreneurs (N = 137) who have completed a self-report questionnaire. We explored the associations between demands, resources, and the dimensions of success through hierarchical regressions. As for the demands, time demands, uncertainty and risk, NEGWIF, and NEGFIW negatively influenced the perceived entrepreneurial success. Regarding resources, planning, implementing financial, proactive and elaborate SS positively influenced the perceived entrepreneurial success.","De Simone, S.; Pileri, J.; Rapp-Ricciardi, M.; Barbieri, B.",Frontiers in Psychology,,285

Sequence analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12) sequences from 30,366 different isolates were analysed for possible mutations. FDA-approved and investigational drugs were screened for interaction with both mutant and wild-type Nsp12-Nsp8 interfaces. Sequence analysis revealed that 70.42% of Nsp12 sequences showed conserved P323L mutation, located in the Nsp8 binding cleft. Compounds were screened for interface interaction, any with XP GScores lower than -7.0 kcal/mol were considered as possible interface inhibitors. RX-3117 (fluorocyclopentenyl cytosine) and Nebivolol had the highest binding affinities in both mutant and wild-type enzymes, therefore they were selected and resultant protein-ligand complexes were simulated for analysis of stability over 100 ns. Although the selected ligands had partial mobility in the binding cavity, they were not removed from the binding pocket after 100 ns. The ligand RX-3117 remained in the same position in the binding pocket of the mutant and wild-type enzyme after 100 ns MD simulation. However, the ligand Nebivolol folded and embedded in the binding pocket of mutant Nsp12 protein. Overall, FDA-approved and investigational drugs are able to bind to the Nsp12-Nsp8 interaction interface and prevent the formation of the Nsp12-Nsp8 complex. Interruption of viral replication by drugs proposed in this study should be further tested to pave the way for in vivo studies towards the treatment of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

298807,[Impact of COVID-19 on Gastroenterology Fellowship Training],2021,"The pandemic associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) and its disease named COVID-19 challenged the scientific community to discover effective therapeutic solutions in a short period. Repurposing existing drugs is one viable approach that emphasizes speed during these urgent times. Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, some HIV protease inhibitors are presently being used against SARS-CoV2. However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs. Finally, analysis of famotidine's pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that its effect against SARS-CoV2 infection could be reached only upon intravenous administration. This work will contribute to the pharmacological knowledge of famotidine as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2.","Ortega, Joseph T; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Jastrzebska, Beata",Biomolecules,,285
298808,[Impact of COVID-19 on Gastroenterology Fellowship Training],2021,"BACKGROUND: Approach to acute cerebrovascular disease management has evolved in the past few months to accommodate the rising needs of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we investigated the changes in practices and policies related to stroke care through an online survey. METHODS: A 12 question, cross-sectional survey targeting practitioners involved in acute stroke care in the US was distributed electronically through national society surveys, social media and personal communication. RESULTS: Respondants from 39 states completed 206 surveys with the majority (82.5%) from comprehensive stroke centers. Approximately half stated some change in transport practices with 14 (7%) reporting significant reduction in transfers. Common strategies to limit healthcare provider exposure included using personal protective equipment (PPE) for all patients (127; 63.5%) as well as limiting the number of practitioners in the room (129; 64.5%). Most respondents (81%) noted an overall decrease in stroke volume. Many (34%) felt that the outcome or care of acute stroke patients had been impacted by COVID-19. This was associated with a change in hospital transport guidelines (OR 1.325, Pâ¯=â¯0.047, 95% CI: 1.004-1.748), change in eligibility criteria for IV-tPA or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) (OR 3.146, Pâ¯=â¯0.052, 95% CI: 0.988-10.017), and modified admission practices for post IV-tPA or MT patients (OR 2.141, Pâ¯=â¯0.023, 95% CI: 1.110-4.132). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights a change in practices and polices related to acute stroke management in response to COVID-19 which are variable among institutions. There is also a reported reduction in stroke volume across hospitals. Amongst these changes, updates in hospital transport guidelines and practices related to IV-tPA and MT may affect the perceived care and outcome of acute stroke patients.","Kamdar, Hera A; Senay, Blake; Mainali, Shraddha; Lee, Vivien; Gulati, Deepak Kumar; Greene-Chandos, Diana; Hinduja, Archana; Strohm, Tamara",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,285

300339,Recommendations for the Operation of Endoscopy Centers in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic - World Endoscopy Organization guidance document,2020,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Nebulizer use has been suspended in Malaysian public health facilities due to the potential to aggravate COVID-19 nosocomial transmission. Currently, our facility uses the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) bronchodilator with Venturi mask modified spacer (VMMS) in patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) for mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to assess the outcomes and acceptance of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI-VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI-VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs. The direct discharge rate was similar for both nebulizer (n = 2162, 92.5%) and pMDI-VMMS method (n = 768, 90.7%) (p-value = 0.120). Twenty-eight patients (27.2%) favoured the pMDI-VMMS over the nebulizer, whereas 36 patients (35.0%) had no preference for either method. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) felt that the current pMDI-VMMS method was better or at least as effective in relieving their symptoms as a nebulizer. The current method was favoured over the nebulizer by twenty-seven AMOs (84.4%). Twenty-eight (87.5%) AMOs suggested that the current method was more effective than the nebulizer. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The bronchodilator delivered via pMDI-VMMS appeared to be comparable to nebulizer in treating mild to moderate asthma and COPD exacerbations in the outpatient ED. Most patients and AMOs accepted the use of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Venturi mask modified spacer can be a cheap and effective alternative to the commercial spacer in a resource-limited situation.","Koh, Hock Peng; Shamsudin, Nurul Shaliza; Tan, Marilyn May Yeen; Mohd Pauzi, Zulsairi",J Clin Pharm Ther,,285

Our collaboration with LTCH&S was initiated to facilitate the increasingly challenging task of scheduling nursing staff and reduce high absenteeism rate observed among the part-time nurses. We developed a spreadsheet-based scheduling tool to automate the generation of schedules and incorporate nurses' preferences for different shifts into the schedules. At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements which prioritized more senior nurses when allocating the available shifts. Our scheduling tool was implemented in a 391-bed home in Toronto. The tool allowed nursing managers to generate feasible schedules within a fraction of an hour, in contrast to the status-quo manual approach which could took up to tens of hours. In addition, the schedules successfully accounted for preferences with on average above 94% of the allocated shifts ranked as most preferred.","Anderson, Manion; Bodur, Merve; Rathwell, Scott; Sarhangian, Vahid",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09461v1.pdf,285

302752,In reply to COVID-19 intubation kits and intubation spots,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) and feeding intolerance (FI) are known independent determinants of worse outcomes and high mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, the incidence of AGI and FI in critically ill COVID-19 patients and their prognostic importance have not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II (P-value <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AGI and FI among critically ill COVID-19 patients was high. AGI grades III/IV were associated with higher risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to AGI 0/I/II, while it also correlated with higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. FI was independently associated with higher mortality. The development of high-grade AGI and FI during the first days of ICU stay can serve as prognostic tools to predict outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Drakos, Panagiotis; Volteas, Panagiotis; Cleri, Nathaniel A; Alkadaa, Leor N; Asencio, Anthony A; Oganov, Anthony; Pryor, Aurora; Talamini, Mark; Rubano, Jerry; Bannazadeh, Mohsen; Mikell, Charles B; Spaniolas, Konstantinos; Mofakham, Sima",J. gastrointest. surg,,285

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We describe a simplified protocol of a Diabetes Telemedicine Clinic that utilizes technological tools readily available to most people with diabetes and clinics around the world. We report the satisfaction of 145 patients and 14 HCPs who participated in the virtual clinic and 210 patients who attended the virtual educational sessions about ""Diabetes and Ramadan."" RESULTS: The majority of patients agreed or strongly agreed that the use of telemedicine was essential in maintaining a good glucose control during the pandemic (97%) and they would use the clinic again in the future (86%). A similar high satisfaction was reported by patients who attended the ""Diabetes and Ramadan"" virtual educational session and 88% of them recommended continuing this activity as a virtual session every year. Majority of the HCPs (93%) thought the clinic protocol was simple and did not require a dedicated orientation session prior to implementing. CONCLUSIONS: The simplicity of our Diabetes Telemedicine Clinic protocol and the high satisfaction reported by patients and HCPs make it a suitable model to be adopted by clinics, especially during pandemics or disasters in resource-limited settings. This clinic model can be quickly implemented and does not require technological tools other than those widely available to most people with diabetes, nowadays. We were able to successfully reduce the number of patients, HCPs, and staff physically present in the clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic without negatively impacting the patients' nor the HCPs' satisfaction with the visits.","Al-Sofiani, Mohammed E; Alyusuf, Ebtihal Y; Alharthi, Sahar; Alguwaihes, Abdullah M; Al-Khalifah, Reem; Alfadda, Assim",J Diabetes Sci Technol,,285

PATIENTS AND METHODS: US community sites are enrolling non-transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) with no evidence of progressive disease after 3 cycles of bortezomib-based therapy to receive IRd (up to 39 cycles or until progression or toxicity). The patients use mobile or wearable digital devices to collect actigraphy (activity and sleep) data and electronically complete HRQoL, treatment satisfaction and medication adherence questionnaires. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. The key secondary endpoints include response rates and therapy duration. RESULTS: At the data cutoff, 84 patients had been treated (median age 73 years; 44% aged &#8805; 75 years; 49% men; 15% Black or African American; and 10% Hispanic or Latino). Of the 84 patients, 62% were continuing therapy. The mean duration of total PI therapy was 10.1 months and for the IRd regimen was 7.3 months. With an 8-month median follow-up, the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 86% (95% confidence interval, 73%-93%) from both the start of bortezomib-based treatment and the start of IRd. The overall response rate was 62% (complete response, 4%; very good partial response, 25%; partial response, 33%) after bortezomib-based induction and 70% (complete response, 26%; very good partial response, 29%; partial response, 15%) after iCT. The IRd safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial data, and HRQoL and treatment satisfaction were maintained. CONCLUSION: The patients included in the US MM-6 study are representative of the real-world US MM population. The use of iCT might permit prolonged PI-based therapy with promising efficacy, without impacting patients' HRQoL or treatment satisfaction.","Manda, Sudhir; Yimer, Habte A; Noga, Stephen J; Girnius, Saulius; Yasenchak, Christopher A; Charu, Veena; Lyons, Roger; Aiello, Jack; Bogard, Kimberly; Ferrari, Renda H; Cherepanov, Dasha; Demers, Brittany; Lu, Vickie; Whidden, Presley; Kambhampati, Suman; Birhiray, Ruemu E; Jhangiani, Haresh S; Boccia, Ralph; Rifkin, Robert M",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

307310,Restoring the Performance of a Health Care Organization Following the First Wave of COVID-19 by Using Patient Complaint Data,2021,"Background & objectives: COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic that necessitates the implementation of effective infection prevention and control steps. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of healthcare professionals toward COVID-19 affect their compliance to prevention and control initiatives. During the evolving pandemic, we examined the KAP among healthcare professionals against COVID-19 in this research. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among Riyadh region health care professionals from the beginning of December 2020 to the end of February 2021 using a validated self-administered questionnaire. The knowledge questionnaire contained questions about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, prevention, and management. The evaluation of attitudes and practices included questions regarding actions and adjustments in COVID-19 response activities. Knowledge scores were measured and compared using demographic characteristics, as well as attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Using SPSS-IBM 25, bivariate statistics were done to analyze the data. Results: 146 healthcare professionals completed the survey. Physicians were the most prominent party in the survey, accounting for 74 (51 percent), followed by nurses 44 (30 percent) and pharmacists 28 (19 percent). The participants' average age was 39.69 ± 8.48 years. The participant's mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 11.43 ± 1.34, 3.89 ± 0.93, and 3.85 ± 0.81, respectively. With a positive attitude, the mean knowledge score was 11.52, and with proper practice, it was 11.32. With an improvement in knowledge, the attitude score increased significantly (r = 0.172, P = 0.001). Besides, there was a greater association between attitudes and practices (r = 0.170, P = 0.029). A significant enhancement in the practice score of the professionals was noted with an increase in knowledge score (r = 0.095, P = 0.010), an indicator for a positive correlation between practice and knowledge scores. Interpretation & conclusion: Healthcare practitioners have a good understanding of COVID-19. Improved knowledge and a positive attitude toward COVID-19 infection are linked to appropriate practice. There is a need for more manpower, better COVID-19 management training, and strategies to reduce anxiety among healthcare professionals.","Mohammed Basheeruddin Asdaq, Syed; A S, Alshrari; Imran, Mohd; Sreeharsha, Nagaraja; Sultana, Rokeya",,,285

Methods We conducted individual semi-structured interviews of child and adolescent psychiatrists (n = 24) practicing in the US. Participants were selected as a diverse purposive sample of active members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP). We analyzed anonymized transcripts through iterative coding using thematic analysis aided by NVivo software. Results We identified three main thematic domains within participants' response to the pandemic, which have engendered a reevaluation of and a recommitment to the aims of each clinician and the field of CAP more broadly. These domains, paired with representative questions, include: 1) Unsettling , or ""who have we been?"" (identifying discontents such as daily inefficiencies and intraprofessional loss of trust);2) Adaptation , or ""who are we now?"" (exploring affordances and limitations of virtual work, and the evolution of personal and professional identity);and 3) Reimagination , or ""who will we become?"" (renewing a commitment to psychiatry as advocacy). Even as we identified a collective agreement toward the need for implementing change, just what needs to change, and how that change will be realized, remain contested. Conclusion These three thematic domains, augmented by a national confrontation with race and equity, have engendered a field-wide reckoning with known inequities. They have reinvigorated collective responses and calls to action. The divergent mindsets to change and leadership have provided an aperture for what values and practices the field might instill in its next generation of practitioners.","DiGiovanni, M.; Weller, I.; Martin, A.",,,285
308300,Covid-19: all non-urgent elective surgery is suspended for at least three months in England,2020,"It has become increasingly clear that COVID-19 is transmitted between individuals. It stands to reason that the spread of the virus depends on sociocultural ecologies that facilitate or inhibit social contact. In particular, the community-level tendency to engage with strangers and freely choose friends, called relational mobility, creates increased opportunities to interact with a larger and more variable range of other people. It may therefore be associated with a faster spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Here, we tested this possibility by analyzing growth curves of confirmed cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 in the first 30 days of the outbreaks in 39 countries. We found that growth was significantly accelerated as a function of a country-wise measure of relational mobility. This relationship was robust either with or without a set of control variables, including demographic variables, reporting bias, testing availability, and cultural dimensions of individualism, tightness, and government efficiency. Policy implications are also discussed.","Salvador, Cristina E; Berg, Martha K; Yu, Qinggang; San Martin, Alvaro; Kitayama, Shinobu",Psychol Sci,,285

Understanding 2-1-1 PrEP facilitators and barriers, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, may guide researchers and healthcare providers in future studies and clinical preparedness. We conducted a national cross-sectional study of MSM in the US who had taken 2-1-1 PrEP to examine facilitators and barriers of this on-demand PrEP dosing option. With the shelter-in-place orders in March 2020, this study was adapted to include questions on how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected participants' PrEP use. A total of 140 individuals participated in the survey, 106 of which completed questions pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The most common reasons for switching from once-daily to 2-1-1 PrEP included having sex less frequently (63.6%) and wanting to take fewer pills (46.4%). Participants reported high medication adherence based on each component of 2-1-1 PrEP dosing (>84%). The most common barriers with 2-1-1 PrEP dosing included unplanned sexual encounters resulting in missing the double-dose pre-sex (43.6%) and trouble remembering doses post-sex (29.3%). Facilitators of the 2-1-1 PrEP dosing strategy included reductions in sexual encounters (63.6%), preference to take fewer pills (46.4%), need to reduce cost (22.1%), and desire to reduce side effects (19.3%). Challenges to receiving PrEP services during the pandemic included obtaining laboratory testing (25.5%) and PrEP refills (either receipt of a refill authorization from a healthcare provider or processing of a refill from the pharmacy) (18.9%). 2-1-1 PrEP is an effective HIV prevention method; therefore, understanding facilitators and barriers of this dosing strategy can result in continuous provision of HIV prevention efforts, particularly during a pandemic.","Camp, Christina; Saberi, Parya",PLoS One,,285

While many patients have clinically recovered, little is known about long-term alterations in T cell responses of COVID-19 convalescents. In this study, T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a long-time COVID-19 clinically recovered (20-26 weeks) cohort (LCR) were measured via flow cytometry and ELISpot. The T cell responses of LCR were comparatively analyzed against an age and sex matched short-time clinically recovered (4-9 weeks) cohort (SCR) and a healthy donor cohort (HD). All volunteers were recruited from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China. Phenotypic analysis showed that activation marker PD-1 expressing on CD4+ T cells of LCR was still significantly lower than that of HD. Functional analysis indicated that frequencies of Tc2, Th2 and Th17 in LCR were comparable to those of HD, but Tc17 was higher than that of HD. In LCR, compared to the HD, there were fewer IFN-Î³ producing T cells but more IL-2 secreting T cells. In addition, the circulating Tfh cells in LCR were still slightly lower compared to HD, though the subsets composition had recovered. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in LCR were comparable to that of SCR. Collectively, T cell responses experienced long-term alterations in phenotype and functional potential of LCR cohort. However, after clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses could be sustained at least for six months, which may be helpful in resisting re-infection.","Zhao, Bali; Zhong, Maohua; Yang, Qingyu; Hong, Ke; Xia, Jianbo; Li, Xia; Liu, Ying; Chen, Yao-Qing; Yang, Jingyi; Huang, Chaolin; Yan, Huimin",Virol. sin.

309821,Rethinking Clinical Trials Reform During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the need for assessment of long-term humoral immunity in convalescent subjects. Our objectives were to evaluate long-term IgG antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and B-cell memory response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a cohort of subjects recovering from COVID-19 and from healthy subjects who donated blood. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantitatively detected by ELISA using anti-S1 spike IgG. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B cells were evaluated by reversed B-cell FluroSpot based on human IgG SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain in a randomly selected group of subjects recovering from COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed with clinical variables and time post COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Antibody response was not detected in 26 of 392 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (6.6%). Over a period of 9 months, the level of antibodies decreased by 50% but stabilized at 6 months, and a protective level prevailed for up to 9 months. No differences were found regarding IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels for age, gender, and major blood types over time. Over time, asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects did not differ in antibody level from subjects with mild to severe disease. Repeated paired IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody level analyses disclosed that, over 6 and 9 months, 15.3% (nine of 59) and 15.8% (three of 19) of subjects became SARS-CoV-2 IgG-seronegative, respectively, all with a low antibody level at 3 months. Rate of antibody decline was not affected by age, gender, or clinical symptomatology. In a subgroup of recovering subjects, memory B-cell response up to 9 months post-COVID-19 infection was undetectable in 31.8% of subjects (14/44), and there was no correlation with age, SARS-CoV-2 antibody level, or time post infection. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of convalescent COVID-19 subjects develop an IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and a protective level prevails over a period of up to 9 months, regardless of age, gender, major blood types or clinical symptomatology.","Achiron, Anat; Gurevich, Michael; Falb, Rina; Dreyer-Alster, Sapir; Sonis, Polina; Mandel, Mathilda",Clin. microbiol. infect,,285

METHODS: Japan DMAT dispatched and managed the medical operation for DP passengers and crew members. The records of communication logs for the DMAT were evaluated. RESULTS: 472 DMAT members were responded. DMAT took 3 to 4 days to manage patients due to a lack of medical supplies at the early phase of operation. The prescription was delayed for prescription required passengers that include passengers who will be in critical health conditions without prescriptions. DMAT conducted a strategic operation and developed categorization for medical care and patient transport. Eventually, DMAT constructed flow to provide rapid medical care and prescription distributions for passengers and crew members. CONCLUSION: DMAT has been required to respond to unforeseen disasters in the framework since the Fukushima Nuclear Plant accident in 2011. All the past several types of disaster response were contributed to managing medical operations at the DP. These operations are thought to reduce preventable deaths from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Kondo, Hisayoshi; Koido, Yuichi; Kohayagawa, Yoshitaka; Anan, Hideaki",Am J Disaster Med,,285
311521,"Good rules for ICU admission allow a fair allocation of resources, even in a pandemic",2020,"Few studies have explored the microbiomes of glass sponges (Hexactinellida). The present study seeks to elucidate the composition of the microbiota associated with the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii and the functional strategies of the main symbionts. We combined microscopic approaches with metagenome-guided microbial genome reconstruction and amplicon community profiling toward this goal. Microscopic imaging revealed that the host and microbial cells appeared within dense biomass patches that are presumably syncytial tissue aggregates. Based on abundances in amplicon libraries and metagenomic data, SAR324 bacteria, Crenarchaeota, Patescibacteria, and Nanoarchaeota were identified as abundant members of the V. pourtalesii microbiome; thus, their genomic potentials were analyzed in detail. A general pattern emerged in that the V. pourtalesii symbionts had very small genome sizes, in the range of 0.5 to 2.2 Mb, and low GC contents, even below those of seawater relatives. Based on functional analyses of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we propose two major microbial strategies: the ""givers,"" namely, Crenarchaeota and SAR324, heterotrophs and facultative anaerobes, produce and partly secrete all required amino acids and vitamins. The ""takers,"" Nanoarchaeota and Patescibacteria, are anaerobes with reduced genomes that tap into the microbial community for resources, e.g., lipids and DNA, likely using pilus-like structures. We posit that the existence of microbial cells in sponge syncytia together with the low-oxygen conditions in the seawater environment are factors that shape the unique compositional and functional properties of the microbial community associated with V. pourtalesii IMPORTANCE We investigated the microbial community of V. pourtalesii that forms globally unique, monospecific sponge grounds under low-oxygen conditions on the Scotian Shelf, where it plays a key role in its vulnerable ecosystem. The microbial community was found to be concentrated within biomass patches and is dominated by small cells (<1 µm). MAG analyses showed consistently small genome sizes and low GC contents, which is unusual compared to known sponge symbionts. These properties, as well as the (facultatively) anaerobic metabolism and a high degree of interdependence between the dominant symbionts regarding amino acid and vitamin synthesis, are likely adaptations to the unique conditions within the syncytial tissue of their hexactinellid host and the low-oxygen environment.","Bayer, Kristina; Busch, Kathrin; Kenchington, Ellen; Beazley, Lindsay; Franzenburg, Sören; Michels, Jan; Hentschel, Ute; Slaby, Beate M",,,285

METHODS: Healthcare providers enrolled consecutively by non-random sampling PWH with lab-confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed at their facilities between April 1st and July 1st, 2020. De-identified data were entered into an electronic Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The primary endpoint was severe outcome, defined as a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was the need for hospitalization. RESULTS: 286 patients were included; the mean age was 51.4 years (SD, 14.4), 25.9% were female, and 75.4% were African-American or Hispanic. Most patients (94.3%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 88.7% had HIV virologic suppression, and 80.8% had comorbidities. Within 30 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, 164 (57.3%) patients were hospitalized, and 47 (16.5%) required ICU admission. Mortality rates were 9.4% (27/286) overall, 16.5% (27/164) among those hospitalized, and 51.5% (24/47) among those admitted to an ICU. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 17.5% (50/286) of all patients and 30.5% (50/164) of hospitalized patients. Older age, chronic lung disease, and hypertension were associated with severe outcomes. A lower CD4 count (<200 cells/mm³) was associated with the primary and secondary endpoints. There was no association between the antiretroviral regimen or lack of viral suppression and predefined outcomes. CONCLUSION: Severe clinical outcomes occurred commonly in PWH and COVID-19. The risk for poor outcomes was higher in those with comorbidities and lower CD4 cell counts, despite HIV viral suppression.","Dandachi, Dima; Geiger, Grant; Montgomery, Mary W; Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Golzy, Mojgan; Antar, Annukka A R; Llibre, Josep M; Camazine, Maraya; Díaz-De Santiago, Alberto; Carlucci, Philip M; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Rahimian, Joseph; Wanjalla, Celestine N; Slim, Jihad; Arinze, Folasade; Kratz, Ann Marie Porreca; Jones, Joyce L; Patel, Shital M; Kitchell, Ellen; Francis, Adero; Ray, Manoj; Koren, David E; Baddley, John W; Hill, Brannon; Sax, Paul E; Chow, Jeremy",Clin. infect. dis,,285

312565,Impact of COVID-19-related care disruptions on cervical cancer screening in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: As of November 1, 2020, there have been more than 230K deaths and 9M confirmed and probable cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.","Zelner, Jon; Trangucci, Rob; Naraharisetti, Ramya; Cao, Alex; Malosh, Ryan; Broen, Kelly; Masters, Nina; Delamater, Paul",Clin. infect. dis,,285

When consultations involve members of traditionally underrepresented groups, these are not only more inclusive, which is in itself an ethical aim, but pool ideas and observations from a much more diverse array of inhabitants.

312729,Headache Related to PPE Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: Injection devices for administration of biopharmaceuticals enable subcutaneous self-administration by patients. To meet patient specific capabilities, injection forces need to be characterized. We address the open question of whether tissue resistance significantly contributes to overall injection forces, especially for large injection volumes. METHODS: Subcutaneous tissue resistance was systematically quantified for injection volumes up to 11 mL depending on viscosity (1-20 mPa·s) and injection rates (0.025-0.2 mL/s) using Göttingen Minipigs as the animal model. The contribution of an artificially applied external force at the injection site simulating autoinjector needle cover depression was tested between 2.5-7.5 N. RESULTS: Tissue resistance reached average values of ~120 mbar for injection volumes up to 11 mL independent of viscosity and injection rate, and maximum values of 300 mbar were determined. Artificially applied external forces led to higher values, independent of the absolute applied force - maximum values of 1 bar were obtained when injecting 4.5 mL of the 20 mPa·s solution at an injection rate of 0.1 mL/s with the application of an artificial 5 N force, corresponding to ~450 mbar. All conditions yield defined injection sites suggesting tissue resistance is defined by mechanical properties of the subcutaneous tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We set our results in relation to overall injection forces, concluding that maximum values in tissue resistance may cause challenges during subcutaneous injection when using injection devices.

312754,Telepsychiatry and COVID-19: Preparing for What's Next,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients affected by COVID-19 may develop disease related malnutrition (DRM) due to the catabolic situation, symptoms that interfere with intake and prolonged hospital stay. This study aims to know the percentage of patients admitted for COVID-19 who required artificial nutrition (AN), their clinical characteristics, as well as the prevalence of DRM and the risk of sarcopenia at hospital discharge and after 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective study, with successive inclusion of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 in whom institutional nutritional support (NS) care protocol was applied. Those who received AN underwent a nutritional screening by Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and an assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) at hospital discharge, as well as a screening for sarcopenia (SARC-F test) and SNAQ re-test 15 days and 6 months after by a phone call. Symptoms related to food intake, anthropometric and analytical data were also collected. RESULTS: We evaluated 936 patients with a mean age of 63.7 ± 15.3 years; predominantly male (59.7%), overweight 41%, obesity 40.4%; hypertension 52.9%; diabetes mellitus 26.6% and cancer 10.4%. The stay hospital length was 17.3 ± 13.8 days and 13.6% patients died during hospitalization. The modality of nutritional support was: 86.1% dietary adaptation + oral nutritional supplements (ONS); 12.4% enteral nutrition (EN) by nasogastric (NG) tube; 0.9% parenteral nutrition (PN) and 0.6% EN plus PN. Focusing on patients who received AN, follow-up post discharge was possible in 62 out of 87 who survived. Of these, at the time of hospital discharge, 96.7% presented nutritional risk by SNAQ and 100% malnutrition by SGA (20% B; 80% C). During admission, 82.3% presented intense anorexia and the mean weight loss was 10.9 ± 6 Kg (p < 0.001). Fifteen days after being discharged, 12.9% still had anorexia, while hyperphagia appeared in 85.5% of the patients and risk of sarcopenia by SARC-F was present in 87.1% of them. Six months after discharge, 6.8% still had anorexia and 3.4% hyperphagia, with a global weight gain of 4.03 ± 6.2 Kg (p=<0.0001). Risk of malnutrition was present in only 1.7% of the patients, although risk of sarcopenia persisted in 49.2%. CONCLUSION: All patients admitted by COVID-19 for whom EN or PN were indicated following an institutional protocol still presented malnutrition at hospital discharge, and almost all showed risk of sarcopenia, that persisted in almost half of them at 6 months. These findings suggest that nutritional and functional problems persist in these patients after discharge, indicating that they require prolonged nutritional support and monitoring.","Ramos, Analía; Joaquin, Clara; Ros, Mireia; Martin, Mariona; Cachero, Montserrat; Sospedra, María; Martínez, Eva; Sánchez Migallón, José Manuel; Sendrós, María-José; Soldevila, Berta; Puig-Domingo, Manel",Clin. nutr.

312832,"Insight on Sex-Based Immunity Differences, With COVID-19 Implications",2020,"BACKGROUND: The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases has rapidly increased all over the world. Specific information about immunity in non-survivors with COVID-19 is scarce. This study aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics and abnormal immunity of the confirmed COVID-19 non-survivors. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 125 patients with COVID-19 who were died between January 13 and March 4, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A total of 414 randomly recruited patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the same hospital during the same period served as control. The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings at admission, and treatment used in these patients were collected. The immunity-related risk factors associated with in-hospital death were tested by logistic regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Non-survivors (70 years, IQR: 61.5-80) were significantly older than survivors (54 years, IQR: 37-65) (P < 0.001). 56.8% of non-survivors was male. Nearly half of the patients (44.9%) had chronic medical illness. In non-survivors, hypertension (49.6%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes (20.0%) and coronary heart disease (16.0%). The common signs and symptoms at admission of non-survivors were fever (88%), followed by cough (64.8%), dyspnea (62.4%), fatigue (62.4%) and chest tightness (58.4%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher white blood cell (WBC) count (7.85 vs 5.07 × 109/L), more elevated neutrophil count (6.41 vs 3.08 × 109/L), smaller lymphocyte count (0.69 vs 1.20 × 109/L) and lower platelet count (172 vs 211 × 109/L), raised concentrations of procalcitonin (0.21 vs 0.06 ng/mL) and CRP (70.5 vs 7.2 mg/L) (P < 0.001). This was accompanied with significantly decreased levels of CD3+ T cells (277 vs 814 cells/µl), CD4+ T cells (172 vs 473 cells/µl), CD8+ T cells (84 vs 262.5 cells/µl, P < 0.001), CD19+ T cells (88 vs 141 cells/µl) and CD16+ 56+ T cells (79 vs 128.5 cells/µl) (P < 0.001). The concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) G (13.30 vs 11.95 g/L), IgA (2.54 vs 2.21 g/L), and IgE (71.30 vs 42.25 IU/ml) were increased, whereas the levels of complement proteins (C)3 (0.89 vs 0.99 g/L) and C4 (0.22 vs 0.24 g/L) were decreased in non-survivors when compared with survivors (all P < 0.05). The non-survivors presented lower levels of oximetry saturation (90 vs 97%) at rest and lactate (2.40 vs 1.90 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). Old age, comorbidity of malignant tumor, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, decreased C3, and low oximetry saturation were the risk factors of death in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The frequency of CD4+ T cells positively correlated with the numbers of lymphocytes (r = 0.787) and the level of oximetry saturation (r = 0.295), Whereas CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with age (r =-0.323) and the numbers of neutrophils (r = - 0.244) (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal cellular immunity and humoral immunity were key features of non-survivors with COVID-19. Neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, and decreased C3 were immunity-related risk factors predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19.","Zhao, Yang; Nie, Han-Xiang; Hu, Ke; Wu, Xiao-Jun; Zhang, Yun-Ting; Wang, Meng-Mei; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhi-Shui; Li, Xiao-Chen; Zeng, Shao-Lin",Infect Dis Poverty,,285

This paper, therefore, subjected the daily cumulative reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to nine (9) curve estimation statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms. It further identified the best of the thirty-six (36) models and used the same for prediction and forecasting purposes. The data collected by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for sixty-four (64) days, two (2) months and three (3), were daily monitored and eventually analyzed. We identified the best models to be Quartic Linear Regression Model with an autocorrelated error of order 1 (AR(1)); and found the Ordinary Least Squares, Cochrane Orcutt, Hildreth–Lu, and Prais-Winsten and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimators useful to estimate the models’ parameters. Consequently, we recommended the daily cumulative forecast values of the LAD estimator for May and June 2020 with a 99% confidence level. The forecast values are alarming, and so, the Nigerian Government needs to hastily review her activities and interventions towards COVID-19 to provide some tactical and robust structures and measures to avert these challenges.","Ayinde, Kayode; Lukman, Adewale F.; Rauf, Rauf I.; Alabi, Olusegun O.; Okon, Charles E.; Ayinde, Opeyemi E.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,285

In the galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gene induction is unimodal or bimodal depending on natural genetic variation and pre-induction conditions. Here, we find that this variation in modality arises from regulation of two features of the pathway response: the fraction of cells that show induction, and their level of expression. GAL3, the galactose sensor, controls the fraction of induced cells, and titrating its expression is sufficient to control modality; moreover, all the observed differences in modality between different pre-induction conditions and amongst natural isolates can be explained by changes in GAL3's regulation and activity. The ability to switch modality by tuning the activity of a single protein may allow rapid adaptation of bet hedging to maximize fitness in complex environments.","Palme, Julius; Wang, Jue; Springer, Michael",eLife (Cambridge),,285

Despite the unprecedented research interest in this field, the lack of specific treatments leads to severe complications in a high number of cases. Current treatment includes antivirals, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, antimalarials, interleukin-6 inhibitors, anti-GM-CSF, convalescent plasma, immunotherapy, antibiotics, circulation support, oxygen therapy, and circulation support. Due to the limited results, until specific treatments are available, other therapeutic approaches need to be considered. The endocannabinoid system is found in multiple systems within the human body, including the immune system. Its activation can lead to beneficial results such as decreased viral entry, decreased viral replication, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-&#945;, or IFN-Î³. Moreover, endocannabinoid system activation can lead to an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly represented by IL-10. Overall, the cannabinoid system can potentially reduce pulmonary inflammation, increase the immunomodulatory effect, decrease PMN infiltration, reduce fibrosis, and decrease viral replication, as well as decrease the 'cytokine storm'. Although the cannabinoid system has many mechanisms to provide certain benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, research in this field is needed for a better understanding of the cannabinoid impact in this situation.","Lucaciu, Ondine; Aghiorghiesei, Ovidiu; Petrescu, Nausica Bianca; Mirica, Ioana Codruta; Benea, Horea RareÈ Ciprian; Apostu, DragoÈ",Drug Metab Rev,,285

This cysteine protease acts by processing the viruses' precursor polyproteins. As proteases, together with polymerases, are main targets of antiviral drug design, we here have performed biochemical high throughput screening (HTS) with recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. A fluorescent assay was used to identify inhibitors in a compound library containing known drugs, bioactive molecules and natural products. These screens led to the identification of 13 inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 µM to 23 µM. The screens confirmed several known SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, such as the organo-mercuric compounds thimerosal and phenylmercuric acetate. Benzophenone derivatives could also be identified among the most potent screening hits. Additionally, Evans blue, a sulfonic acid-containing dye, could be identified as an Mpro inhibitor.

This study describes patient experiences with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. STUDY DESIGN: This is a mixed-methods study which includes a web-based or phone survey and in-depth phone interviews with patients who had telemedicine visits for contraception. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients had eligible telemedicine visits between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Of these, 86 (51%) responded to the survey, and 23 (14%) participated in the interviews. We found that 86% of survey respondents were very satisfied with the telemedicine visit, and 63% said it completely met their needs. A majority (73%) strongly agreed that these visits should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic, and half (51%) would be very likely to choose them over in-person visits. In-depth interviews highlighted the convenience of telemedicine, especially for those with work or parenting responsibilities. Although some patients had in-person visits after telehealth, many appreciated the counseling they received remotely, and found the subsequent in-person visits more efficient. Patients identified visits that do not require physical exams as ideal visits for telehealth, and some hoped that all or most of their future visits would be telehealth visits. Many patients (43%) expressed a preference for phone over video visits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported an overall positive experience with telemedicine visits for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. They appreciated the convenience of telemedicine visits and valued the virtual counseling experience.","Stifani, Bianca M; Smith, Abigail; Avila, Karina; Boos, Elise W; Ng, June; Levi, Erika E; Benfield, Nerys C",Contraception,,285

Although not considered the frontline specialty in managing COVID-19 patients, neurosurgical service and training were also significantly affected. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at a low- and/or middle-income country (LMIC) academic tertiary referral hospital, the university and hospital policies and actions for the neurosurgical service and training program during the outbreak, and the contingency plan for future reference on preparedness for service and education. METHODS: The authors collected data from several official databases, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health database, East Java provincial government database, hospital database, and neurosurgery operative case log. Policies and regulations information was obtained from stakeholders, including the Indonesian Society of Neurological Surgeons, the hospital board of directors, and the dean's office. RESULTS: The curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia had not flattened by the 2nd week of June 2020. Surabaya, the second-largest city in Indonesia, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. The neurosurgical service experienced a significant drop in cases (50% of cases from normal days) along all lines (outpatient clinic, emergency room, and surgical ward). Despite a strict preadmission screening, postoperative COVID-19 infection cases were detected during the treatment course of neurosurgical patients, and those with a positive COVID-19 infection had a high mortality rate. The reduction in the overall number of cases treated in the neurosurgical service had an impact on the educational and training program. The digital environment found popularity in the educational term; however, digital resources could not replace direct exposure to real patients. The education stakeholders adjusted the undergraduate students' clinical postings and residents' working schemes for safety reasons. CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgery service at an academic tertiary referral hospital in an LMIC experienced a significant reduction in cases. The university and program directors had to adapt to an off-campus and off-hospital policy for neurosurgical residents and undergraduate students. The hospital instituted a reorganization of residents for service. The digital environment found popularity during the outbreak to support the educational process.","Suryaningtyas, Wihasto; Wahyuhadi, Joni; Turchan, Agus; Subagio, Eko Agus; Parenrengi, Muhammad Arifin; Apriawan, Tedy; Al Fauzi, Asra; Bajamal, Abdul Hafid",Neurosurg Focus,,285
320543,ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Management of thyroid nodules and cancer,2020,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a wide spectrum of disease severity. Initial manifestations include fever, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms, which may progress to respiratory disease. There may also be neurological and psychiatric manifestations, involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. MethodsWe performed a literature search of the databases PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science for observational studies reporting neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19. This was followed by a narrative synthesis to summarise the data and discuss neuropsychiatric associations, symptom severity, management, and recovery. FindingsThe most frequently reported neurological symptoms were ageusia, hyposmia/anosmia, dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness. Statistically significant relationships were noted between Asian ethnicity and peripheral neuropathy (p=0.0001) and neuro-syndromic symptoms (p=0.001). ITU admission was found to have a statistically significant relationship with male sex (p=0.024). Depression and anxiety were also identified both during and after infection.

320615,Practical Techniques to Adapt Surgical Resident Education to the COVID-19 Era,2020,"With international arrivals surpassing 1.5 billion for the first time in 2019 the long-term evolution of tourism demonstrates prolific path dependence with a decade of growth since the global financial crisis. This latest period of unfettered international tourism development has come to an abrupt end as the impact of COVID-19 has brought the sector to a near standstill. As the world grapples with the realities of the global pandemic there is an opportunity to rethink exactly what tourism will look like for the decades ahead. Key concepts in evolutionary economic geography, especially path dependence/creation and institutional inertia/innovation, show variations in pathways for travel and tourism in a COVID-19 world. A path that leads to transformation in tourism can be realized if sufficient institutional innovation occurs on both the demand and supply side of tourism that can foster the emergence of new paths. COVID-19 presents a once in a generation opportunity where the institutional pump is primed for transformation. Whether that leads to a radical transformation of the tourism sector remains to be seen, but the imprint it will leave on both the demand and supply of tourism will have long-term, incremental impacts for years to come and ultimately move us closer towards the transformation of tourism.","Brouder, Patrick",Tour.

The study's objective was to group counties with similar trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths and identify county-level correlates of the distinct trajectory groups. METHODS: Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from 3141 US counties from January through June 2020. Clusters of epidemic curve trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 people were identified with Proc Traj. We utilized polytomous logistic regression to estimate Odds Ratios for trajectory group membership in relation to county-level demographics, socioeconomic factors, school enrollment, employment and lifestyle data. RESULTS: Six COVID-19 case trajectory groups and five death trajectory groups were identified. Younger counties, counties with a greater proportion of females, Black and Hispanic populations, and greater employment in private sectors had higher odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Percentage of counties enrolled in grades 1-8 was associated with earlier-start case trajectories. Counties with more educated adult populations had lower odds of being in worse case trajectories but were generally not associated with worse death trajectories. Counties with higher poverty rates, higher uninsured, and more living in non-family households had lower odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Counties with higher smoking rates had higher odds of being in worse death trajectory counties. DISCUSSION: In the absence of clear guidelines and personal protection, smoking, racial and ethnic groups, younger populations, social, and economic factors were correlated with worse COVID-19 epidemics that may reflect population transmission dynamics during January-June 2020. After vaccination of high-risk individuals, communities with higher proportions of youth, communities of color, smokers, and workers in healthcare, service and goods industries can reduce viral spread by targeting vaccination programs to these populations and increasing access and education on non-pharmaceutical interventions.","DuPre, Natalie C; Karimi, Seyed; Zhang, Charlie H; Blair, Lyndsey; Gupta, Arushi; Alharbi, Lamyaa Mousa A; Alluhibi, Mariyam; Mitra, Riten; McKinney, W Paul; Little, Bert",Sci Total Environ,,285

The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public health priority.

323845,Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic period,2020,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mesenchymal precursors of various origins, with well-known immunomodulatory effects. Natural killer (NK) cells, the major cells of the innate immune system, are critical for the antitumor and antiviral defenses; however, in certain cases, they may be the main culprits in the pathogenesis of some NK-related conditions such as autoimmunities and hematological malignancies. On the other hand, these cells seem to be the major responders in beneficial phenomena like graft versus leukemia. Substantial data suggest that MSCs can variably affect NK cells and can be affected by these cells. Accordingly, acquiring a profound understanding of the crosstalk between MSCs and NK cells and the involved mechanisms seems to be a necessity to develop therapeutic approaches based on such interactions. Therefore, in this study, we made a thorough review of the existing literature on the interactions between MSCs and NK cells with a focus on the underlying mechanisms. The current knowledge herein suggests that MSCs possess a great potential to be used as tools for therapeutic targeting of NK cells in disease context and that preconditioning of MSCs, as well as their genetic manipulation before administration, may provide a wider variety of options in terms of eliciting more specific and desirable therapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the effects of MSCs on NK cells is still in its infancy, and further studies with well-defined conditions are warranted herein.","Moloudizargari, Milad; Govahi, Ali; Fallah, Marjan; Rezvanfar, Mohammad A; Asghari, Mohammad H; Abdollahi, Mohammad",,,285

With more and more people getting affected during the second wave, the hospitals were over-burdened, running out of supplies and oxygen. In this scenario, prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases beforehand might have helped in the better utilization of limited resources and supplies. This manuscript deals with the prediction of new COVID-19 cases, new deaths and total active cases for multiple days in advance. The proposed method uses gated recurrent unit networks as the main predicting model. A study is conducted by building four models that are pre-trained on the data from four different countries (United States of America, Brazil, Spain and Bangladesh) and are fine-tuned or retrained on India's data. Since the four countries chosen have experienced different types of infection curves, the pre-training provides a transfer learning to the models incorporating diverse situations into account. Each of the four models then give a multiple days ahead predictions using recursive learning method for the Indian test data. The final prediction comes from an ensemble of the predictions of the combination of different models. This method with two countries, Spain and Brazil, is seen to achieve the best performance amongst all the combinations as well as compared to other traditional regression models.","Chakraborty, Debasrita; Goswami, Debayan; Ghosh, Susmita; Ghosh, Ashish; Chan, Jonathan H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09131v1.pdf,285

These help understand the healthcare burden posed by a pandemic and respond accordingly. However, the problem of how college/university campuses should function during a pandemic is new for the following reasons:(i) social contact in colleges are structured and can be engineered for chosen objectives, (ii) the last pandemic to cause such societal disruption was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a critical part of society, (ii) not much was known about causes of pandemics, and hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and (iii) today with distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is possible. Our approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system, containing a suite of model libraries, one for each major component. The system integrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network approach, and models the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors, classrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the system can be used to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable the administrator to make informed decisions. While current approaches are good for infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact modeling. Our ABM approach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach to contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's Sunrise Plan is presented. For each decisions made, its impact was assessed, and results used to get a measure of confidence. We believe this flexible tool can be a valuable asset for various kinds of organizations to assess their infection risks in pandemic-time operations, including middle and high schools, factories, warehouses, and small/medium sized businesses.","Kharkwal, Himanshu; Olson, Dakota; Huang, Jiali; Mohan, Abhiraj; Mani, Ankur; Srivastava, Jaideep",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10112v1.pdf,285

Methods: CGF was prepared from venous blood of healthy volunteers, and then CGF extracts (CGFe) were prepared. In vitro experiment: human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were divided into 4 groups. Groups A, B, and C were cultured with &#945;-MEM medium [containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% double antibody] containing 2%, 5%, and 10%CGFe, respectively; group D was cultured with &#945;-MEM medium (containing 10%FBS and 1% double antibody) without CGFe. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the effect of CGFe on cell adhesion. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) was used to detect the effect of CGFe on cell proliferation. After osteogenic induction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected and Western blot was performed to detect osteopontin (OPN) expression. In vivo experiment: Eighteen New Zealand big-eared rabbits were used to prepare circular bone defect models on the left and right mandibles, and implant CGF gel (prepared from autologous venous blood)+MC material (volume ratio 1â¶1, experimental group) and simple MC material (control group), respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, 6 rabbits were sacrificed respectively to obtain materials, and Micro-CT scanning was performed to observe the formation of new bone and material degradation in vivo. Results: In vitro experiments: Scanning electron microscopy showed that the cells of groups A, B, and C spread better on MC materials than group D, with more pseudopodia. CCK-8 method showed that different concentrations of CGFe could promote cell proliferation, and the absorbance ( A) value of cells cultured for 2, 3, 5, and 7 days was in the order of group C>group B>group A>group D, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). ALP activity test showed that its activity was proportional to the osteogenic induction time and CGFe concentration ( P<0.05). Western blot analysis of osteogenic induction culture for 14 days showed that the relative expression of OPN protein in groups A, B, and C was significantly higher than that in group D, and the higher the CGFe concentration, the higher the relative expression of OPN protein ( P<0.05). In vivo experiment: Micro-CT observation showed that the new bone formation and material degradation of the experimental group were better than those of the control group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative detection showed that the volume of new bone volume, new bone volume fraction, trabeculae number, and trabecular thickness of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group at each time point, the residual material volume, residual material volume fraction, and trabecular separation were significantly lower than those of the control group, all showing significant differences ( P<0.05). Conclusion: CGF can effectively promote the adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs on MC materials, and 10%CGFe has the most significant effect. The combined application of CGF and MC material can significantly promote bone formation in vivo.","Zhang, Yue; Liu, Keda; Yan, Ming; Wang, Wei",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,285

AIM: We aimed to examine the effects of social distancing, loneliness, difficulties in emotion regulation, and self-regulation on participants self-reported coping using sex during lockdown in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Participants had to be residents of the United Kingdom, aged between 18-60 years, fluent in English, and had to have an Internet connection. They were instructed not to participate if they had consumed alcohol in the previous 24 hours. A total of 789 participants aged 18-59 years completed an online survey. Participants provided self-report measures of social distancing, loneliness, and difficulties in emotion regulation. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess self-regulation. OUTCOMES: Participants self-reported their use of sex to cope over a 14-day period during lockdown, as well as retrospectively for a 14-day period immediately preceding lockdown. Coping using sex items included consensual and non-consensual themes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no increase in coping using sex during lockdown compared with before lockdown. Findings showed that 30% of participants reported increased coping using sex during lockdown compared with before, 29% reported decreased coping using sex, and 41% reported no change. All regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis of psychiatric condition, level of education, being at high-risk for difficulties relating to COVID-19, living alone, and diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 as covariates. Being younger, being male, and greater emotion dysregulation were associated with higher coping using sex total and consent subscale scores during lockdown. Being younger, being male, not living alone, and less adherence to social distancing advice were associated with coping using sex with a theme of rape/violence during lockdown. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: A proportion of participants used sex to cope more often during lockdown compared with before. Less adherence to social distancing advice and emotion dysregulation were associated with using sex to cope during lockdown. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study were the large sample size and inclusion of key sociodemographic characteristics as covariates. The main limitations were the cross-sectional design and a sample that was mostly white, educated, and female. CONCLUSION: Participants who had difficulty regulating emotions were more likely to use sex to cope. It is important that support is available for people who have problems regulating their emotions during the pandemic and that they have access to appropriate help and advice.

Furthermore, 236 surgical cases were reviewed for transmission: 213 (90%) had negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing, 21 (9%) had a positive test on or before the date of surgery, and 2 (<1%) did not have a preoperative test performed. In addition, 40 patients underwent postoperative testing (mean, 13 days to postoperative testing), and 2 returned positive results. Neither of these 2 cases was linked to our outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Complacency in infection control practices among staff during peak community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have driven staff-to-staff transmission. Prompt identification of the outbreak led to rapid interventions, ultimately allowing for uninterrupted surgical service.","McDougal, April N; Elhassani, Dana; DeMaet, Mary Ann; Shores, Shirley; Plante, Kenneth S; Plante, Jessica A; Pyles, Richard; Weaver, Scott C; Williams-Bouyer, Natalie; Tyler, Brenda J; Davis, Hollie R; Patel, Janak",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,285

METHODS: We surveyed 147 HCWs (73% response rate) in two clinics in the summer of 2020 on their burnout, job-person fit, perceptions of the pandemic, and demographic/job characteristics. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore relationships between these variables. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of HCWs reported burnout. Lower HCW burnout was associated with better job-person fit in the areas of recognition or appreciation at work (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.67) and congruent worker-organization goals and values (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Working environments with better job-person fit may be key to reducing HCW burnout even after the current crisis.","Apaydin, Eric A; Rose, Danielle E; Yano, Elizabeth M; Shekelle, Paul G; McGowan, Michael G; Antonini, Tami L; Valdez, Cassandra A; Peacock, Michelle; Probst, Laura; Stockdale, Susan E",J. occup. environ. med,,285

Methods: The observations of social distancing, daily deaths, infections along with the needed hospital resources for COVID-19 patient hospitalizations including the numbers of all hospital beds, beds needed in ICUs and infection wards, nursing staffs needed in ICUs and infection wards were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by the University of Washington. The observations of social distancing were based on the reduction in human contact relative to background levels for each location quantified by cell phone mobility data collected from IHME. The weighted data per 100,000 population gathered in a 40-day period of the first wave of the pandemic in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Statistical technique of panel data analysis is used to measure the associations between our social distancing and COVID-19 indicators in long-run. Results: Results of dynamic long-run models confirm that a 1% rise in social distancing by reducing human contacts may decline daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, beds/nurses needed in ICUs and beds/nurses needed in infection wards due COVID-19 pandemic by 1.13%, 15.26%, 1.10%, 1.17% and 1.89%, respectively. Moreover, results of error correction models verify that if the equilibriums between these series are disrupted by a sudden change in social distancing, the lengths of restoring back to equilibrium are 67, 62, 40, 22 and 49 days for daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, nurses/beds needed in ICUs and nurses/beds needed in infection wards, respectively. Conclusion: Proper social distancing was a successful policy for tackling COVID-19 with falling mortality and infection rates as well as the needed hospital resources for patient hospitalizations in Nordic countries. The results alert governments of the need for continuously implementing social distancing policies while using vaccines to prevent outbreaks and reduce the burden of patient hospitalizations on nursing and medical staff.","Amiri, Arshia",,,285

This article describes the implementation of centralized nationwide mailed HIV/STI home testing (CareKit). METHODS: The Emory Center for AIDS Research developed CareKit for research study participants to request HIV self-test kits, STI specimen collection kits, and condom/lubricant packs to be shipped to any mailing address in the United States. Sexually transmitted infection kits were customized according to study needs and could include materials to collect whole blood, dried blood spots, urine sample, and rectal and pharyngeal swab samples for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing. Specimens were mailed back to a central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory for testing, and results were returned to participants. RESULTS: CareKit was used by 12 MSM studies and mailed 1132 STI kits to 775 participants between January 2018 and March 2020. Participants returned 507 (45%) STI kits, which included 1594 individual specimens. Eighty-one kits (16%) had at least one positive STI test result: pharyngeal chlamydia (n = 7), pharyngeal gonorrhea (n = 11), rectal chlamydia (n = 15), rectal gonorrhea (n = 12), genital chlamydia (n = 6), genital gonorrhea (n = 1), and syphilis (n = 54). In this same 2-year period, 741 HIV self-test kits were mailed to 643 MSM. CONCLUSIONS: CareKit successfully met studies' needs for home HIV/STI testing and diagnosed many STIs. These processes continue to be adapted for research and programs. The ability to mail home test kits has become increasingly important to reach those who may have limited access to health care services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Norelli, Jenna; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Sanchez, Travis; Sullivan, Patrick S",Sex Transm Dis,,285

The pathogenesis of the disease is imbalance of &#945;/ß globin chains. The excess of &#945;-globin chains will form hemichromes which can damage red blood cell membranes and lead to hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and secondary iron overload. Iron overload in turn can cause complications such as growth retardation, liver cirrhosis, cardiac insufficiency, and aggravate the disease phenotype. In recent decades, genes participating in iron metabolism have been discovered, and the mechanism of iron metabolism in the development of thalassemia has gradually been elucidated. Subsequently, by manipulating the expression of key genes in iron metabolism such as hepcidin and transferrin receptor, researchers have revealed that iron restriction can improve ineffective hematopoiesis and iron overload, which may provide a potential approach for the treatment of thalassemia. This article reviews the progress of research on iron metabolism-related genes and related pathways in ß-thalassemia.","Chen, Diyu; Sun, Xiaofang",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,285

Therefore, thromboprophylaxis is strongly recommended in these patients, with some experts even advocating for therapeutic dosing to prevent thromboembolic events. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a well-known complication of heparin therapy. In this article, we report a case of HIT in a patient with COVID-19. A 63-year-old male presented with 1 week of dry cough and diarrhea. He had a positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. On admission, the platelet count and liver function tests were within normal limits. During his hospitalization, he developed a right femoral deep venous thrombosis and was started on therapeutic anticoagulation. Due to worsening respiratory failure, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Between days 11 and 12 of hospitalization, platelet count dropped from 304 000 to 96 000 cells/µL. He had a high pretest probability for HIT with a 4T score of 6 and a positive anti-PF4/heparin antibody. Heparin drip was discontinued and was switched to argatroban. The serotonin release assay eventually returned positive, which confirmed the diagnosis of HIT. We also discuss potential overdiagnosis of HIT in COVID-19 through 4 cases with false-positive HIT antibodies.","Lingamaneni, Prasanth; Gonakoti, Sriram; Moturi, Krishna; Vohra, Ishaan; Zia, Maryam",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,285

Past studies have shown that simulated patients are a valuable teaching tool in training current and prospective healthcare professionals. Few studies have examined its use in the geriatric context. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review presents the effectiveness of simulated patients in healthcare education for geriatric care and eldercare purposes among current and prospective healthcare professionals. DATA SOURCES: Search on CINAHL, Cochrane, ScienceDirect and Medline were completed on studies published between January 2009 to January 2020. A manual hand searching of reference lists for relevant articles was also conducted. REVIEW METHODS: This scoping review follows the methods of Arksey and O-Malley to synthesize the literature on simulated patients in the teaching of geriatric care to current and prospective healthcare professionals. Inclusion criteria were, primary studies, with full-text articles, and in English. RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included in this review. These articles were of wide variation by study design, settings, populations. Four broad themes were identified from existing literature: (i) improvement in geriatric knowledge, (ii) improvement in technical and non-technical skills, (iii) greater confidence in clinical and non-clinical skills, and (iv) learners' perception towards simulation as a learning pedagogy. CONCLUSION: Simulated patients may have potential in improving geriatric education. Students generally enjoyed the learning methodology, finding it engaging and easy to learn by practising.

Generation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (seroconversion) may inform on acquired immunity from prior exposure, and antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) are speculated to neutralize virus infection. Some serology assays rely solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) as the antibody detection antigen; however, whether such immune responses correlate with S-RBD response and COVID-19 immunity remains unknown. Here, we generated a quantitative serological ELISA using recombinant S-RBD and N-protein for the detection of circulating antibodies in 138 serial serum samples from 30 reverse transcription PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2-hospitalized patients, as well as 464 healthy and non-COVID-19 serum samples that were collected between June 2017 and June 2020. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the 2 different viral proteins showed a moderate correlation. Antibodies against N-protein were detected at a rate of 3.6% in healthy and non-COVID-19 sera collected during the pandemic in 2020, whereas 1.9% of these sera were positive for S-RBD. Approximately 86% of individuals positive for S-RBD-binding antibodies exhibited neutralizing capacity, but only 74% of N-protein-positive individuals exhibited neutralizing capacity. Collectively, our studies show that detection of N-protein-binding antibodies does not always correlate with presence of S-RBD-neutralizing antibodies and caution against the extensive use of N-protein-based serology testing for determination of potential COVID-19 immunity.","McAndrews, Kathleen M; Dowlatshahi, Dara P; Dai, Jianli; Becker, Lisa M; Hensel, Janine; Snowden, Laura M; Leveille, Jennifer M; Brunner, Michael R; Holden, Kylie W; Hopkins, Nikolas S; Harris, Alexandria M; Kumpati, Jerusha; Whitt, Michael A; Lee, J Jack; Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis L; Papanna, Ramesha; LeBleu, Valerie S; Allison, James P; Kalluri, Raghu",JCI insight,,285

The catalytic active site of IDO1 enzyme consists of hydrophobic Pocket-A positioned in the distal heme site and remains connected to a second hydrophobic Pocket-B towards the entrance of the active site. IDO1 enzyme also relates directly to the modulation of the innate and adaptive immune system. Various studies proved that the over expression of IDO1 enzyme play a predominant role in the escape of immunity during cancer progression. Recently, there has been considerable interest in evaluating the potential of IDO1 inhibitors to mobilize the body's immune system against solid tumours. In the last two decades, enormous attempts to advance new IDO1 inhibitors are on-going both in pharmaceutical industries and in academia which resulted in the discovery of a diverse range of selective and potent IDO1 inhibitors. The IDO1 inhibitors have therapeutic utility in various diseases and in the near future, it may have utility in the treatment of COVID-19. Despite various reviews on IDO1 inhibitors in last five years, none of the reviews provide a complete overview of diverse chemical space including naturally occurring and synthetic IDO1 inhibitors with detailed structure activity relationship studies. The present work provides a complete overview on the IDO1 inhibitors known in the literature so far along with the Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) in each class of compounds.","Singh, Rahul; Salunke, Deepak B",Eur J Med Chem,,285

This study aims to investigate the psychological effect of quarantine on persons living in Morocco when the first COVID-19 cases were identified. The associations between anxiety, depression symptoms, and their predictors (sociodemographics, fatigue, and religious coping) were examined. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey, with a total of 1435 participants (&#8805;18 years) recruited anonymously, was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 3 to 30 April 2020). A structured questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, and religious coping. Religious coping, fatigue, and depression, and anxiety were measured by Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE), Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. A generalized linear model (logistic regression) was used to determine the predictive factors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.0% (n = 621) and 53.0% (n = 766), respectively. Both were associated with female gender, household income decline, tracking COVID-19 news, and fear to contract COVID-19 (aOR = 1.36 to 2.85). Additionally, 32.0% (n = 453) and 26.0% (n = 372) reported severe physical fatigue, and mental fatigue, respectively. Both latter factors were significantly and positively associated with depression as well as with anxiety. Depressive and anxious patients used more negative religious coping, while positive religious coping was slightly associated with depression. CONCLUSION: In this online survey of the general population in Morocco, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic and psychosocial factors, such as female gender, income decline, infection fears, massive COVID-19 news exposure, negative religious coping, and fatigue were associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Psychosocial and financial support should be provided to the quarantined population.","Zarrouq, Btissame; Abbas, Nivine; Hilaly, Jaouad El; Asri, Achraf El; Abbouyi, Samira; Omari, Majid; Malki, Hicham; Bouazza, Samira; Moutawakkil, Salma Ghofrane; Halim, Karima; Ragala, Mohammed Elamine",BMC Psychiatry,,285

340623,Respiratory Illness Presenteeism in Academic Medicine: A Conceivable COVID-19 Culture Change for the Better,2021,"G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1 (GPER1), predicted to be a novel oestrogen receptor, has been linked to the development and progression of breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein levels of GPER1 are negatively associated with those of ER&#945; and that higher expression of GPER1 correlated with a better clinical outcome in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Activation of GPER1 decreases ER&#945; protein levels, which subsequently suppresses ER&#945;-mediated transcription and target gene expression but does not affect its mRNA expression in ER + breast cancer cells. A mechanistic study revealed that GPER1 mediates ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome-dependent degradation of ER&#945; via upregulation of the Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), and depletion of SPOP abrogates GPER1-induced ER&#945; ubiquitination and degradation. Functionally, GPER1 activation inhibits 17ß-oestradiol (E2)-induced ER + breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which GPER1 negatively modulates the ER&#945; signalling pathway via promoting its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation, which may contribute to its inhibition of breast cancer progression.","Zhang, Nan; Sun, Peng; Xu, Yuanyuan; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Huatao; Wang, Ling; Cao, Yue; Zhou, Kewen",Cancer lett,,285
340796,Gender Differences in COVID-19;A Narrative Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Major infectious disease outbreaks are a constant threat to human health. Clinical research responses to outbreaks generate evidence to improve outcomes and outbreak control. Experiences from previous epidemics have identified multiple challenges to undertaking timely clinical research responses. This scoping review is a systematic appraisal of political, economic, administrative, regulatory, logistical, ethical and social (PEARLES) challenges to clinical research responses to emergency epidemics and solutions identified to address these. METHODS: A scoping review. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycINFO, Scopus and Epistemonikos) for articles published from 2008 to July 2018. We included publications reporting PEARLES challenges to clinical research responses to emerging epidemics and pandemics and solutions identified to address these. Two reviewers screened articles for inclusion, extracted and analysed the data. RESULTS: Of 2678 articles screened, 76 were included. Most presented data relating to the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak or the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The articles related to clinical research responses in Africa (n = 37), Europe (n = 8), North America (n = 5), Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 3) and Asia (n = 1) and/or globally (n = 22). A wide range of solutions to PEARLES challenges was presented, including a need to strengthen global collaborations and coordination at all levels and develop pre-approved protocols and equitable frameworks, protocols and standards for emergencies. Clinical trial networks and expedited funding and approvals were some solutions implemented. National ownership and community engagement from the outset were a key enabler for delivery. Despite the wide range of recommended solutions, none had been formally evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: To strengthen global preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics, identified solutions for rapid clinical research deployment, delivery, and dissemination must be implemented. Improvements are urgently needed to strengthen collaborations, funding mechanisms, global and national research capacity and capability, targeting regions vulnerable to epidemics and pandemics. Solutions need to be flexible to allow timely adaptations to context, and research led by governments of affected regions. Research communities globally need to evaluate their activities and incorporate lessons learnt to refine and rehearse collaborative outbreak response plans in between epidemics.","Sigfrid, Louise; Maskell, Katherine; Bannister, Peter G; Ismail, Sharif A; Collinson, Shelui; Regmi, Sadie; Blackmore, Claire; Harriss, Eli; Longuere, Kajsa-Stina; Gobat, Nina; Horby, Peter; Clarke, Mike; Carson, Gail",BMC Med,,285

341935,Utility of telemedicine in the COVID-19 era,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to the daily habits of billions of people. Users increasingly have to rely on home broadband Internet access for work, education, and other activities. These changes have resulted in corresponding changes to Internet traffic patterns. This paper aims to characterize the effects of these changes with respect to Internet service providers in the United States. We study three questions: (1) How did traffic demands change in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?;(2) What effects have these changes had on Internet performance?;(3) How did service providers respond to these changes? We study these questions using data from a diverse collection of sources. Our analysis of interconnection data for two large ISPs in the United States shows a 30–60% increase in peak traffic rates in the first quarter of 2020. In particular, we observe traffic downstream peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13–20% while upstream peaks increased by more than 30%. Further, we observe significant variation in performance across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects, at more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video conferencing applications have increased their network footprint, more than doubling their advertised IP address space. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Liu, S.; Schmitt, P.; Bronzino, F.; Feamster, N.","22nd International Conference on Passive and Active Measurement, PAM 2021",,285

To date there are few reports of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by type 1 myocardial infarction in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, angiographic, and procedural characteristics alongside clinical outcomes of consecutive cases of COVID-19 positive STEMI patients compared to COVID-19 negative patients. METHODS: This was a single-centre, observational study of 115 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention at Barts Heart Centre between 01/03/2020 and 20/05/2020. RESULTS: STEMI patients presenting with concurrent COVID-19 infection had higher levels of Troponin T, lower lymphocyte count, but elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein. There was significantly higher rates of multi-vessel thrombosis, stent thrombosis, higher modified thrombus grade post first device with consequently higher use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and thrombus aspiration. Myocardial blush grade and left ventricular function were significantly lower in COVID patients with STEMI. Higher doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic ACTs were also noted. Importantly, STEMI patients presenting with COVID-19 infection had a longer in-patient admission and higher rates of intensive care admission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with STEMI and concurrent COVID-19 infection there is a strong signal towards higher thrombus burden and poorer outcomes. This supports the need for establishing COVID status in all STEMI cases. Further work is required to understand the mechanism of increased thrombosis and the benefit of aggressive anti-thrombotic therapy in selected cases.","Choudry, Fizzah A; Hamshere, Stephen M; Rathod, Krishnaraj S; Akhtar, Mohammad M; Archbold, R Andrew; Guttmann, Oliver P; Woldman, Simon; Jain, Ajay K; Knight, Charles J; Baumbach, Andreas; Mathur, Anthony; Jones, Daniel A",J.

342948,Early Warnings of COVID-19 Second Wave in Detroit,2021,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to be a pandemic disease. SARS-CoV2 was first identified in China and, despite the restrictive measures adopted, the epidemic has spread globally, becoming a pandemic in a very short time. Though there is growing knowledge of the SARS-CoV2 infection and its clinical manifestations, an effective cure to limit its acute symptoms and its severe complications has not yet been found. Given the worldwide health and economic emergency issues accompanying this pandemic, there is an absolute urgency to identify effective treatments and reduce the post infection outcomes. In this context, phosphodiesterases (PDEs), evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide (cAMP/cGMP) hydrolyzing enzymes, could emerge as new potential targets. Given their extended distribution and modulating role in nearly all organs and cellular environments, a large number of drugs (PDE inhibitors) have been developed to control the specific functions of each PDE family. These PDE inhibitors have already been used in the treatment of pathologies that show clinical signs and symptoms completely or partially overlapping with post-COVID-19 conditions (e.g., thrombosis, inflammation, fibrosis), while new PDE-selective or pan-selective inhibitors are currently under study. This review discusses the state of the art of the different pathologies currently treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, highlighting the numerous similarities with the disorders linked to SARS-CoV2 infection, to support the hypothesis that PDE inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19.","Giorgi, Mauro; Cardarelli, Silvia; Ragusa, Federica; Saliola, Michele; Biagioni, Stefano; Poiana, Giancarlo; Naro, Fabio; Massimi, Mara",,,285

First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state's COVID-19 time series into a first wave and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction of mortality, a factor of 16, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries and U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the United States, in which Northeastern states have been the most successful in the country. Such analysis may help European countries learn from each other's experiences and differing successes to develop the best policies to combat COVID-19 as a collective unit.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Radchenko, Peter",Chaos,,285

Especially for image classification tasks, many state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes. In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and self-efficacy than two state-of-the-art systems that work with saliency maps, namely LIME and LRP.","Mertes, Silvan; Huber, Tobias; Weitz, Katharina; Heimerl, Alexander; Andr'e, Elisabeth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11905v3.pdf,285

Pigs were immunised with either adjuvanted, whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines or viral vectored (ChAdOx1 and MVA) vaccines expressing either the homologous or heterologous influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein as well as an influenza viral pseudotype (S-FLU) vaccine expressing heterologous HA. Only two vaccines containing homologous HA, which also induced high hemagglutination inhibitory antibody titers, significantly reduced virus shedding in challenged animals. Nevertheless, virus transmission from challenged to naive, in-contact animals occurred in all groups, although was delayed in groups of vaccinated animals with reduced virus shedding.IMPORTANCE This study was designed to determine whether vaccination of pigs with conventional, WIV or viral-vectored vaccines reduces pH1N1 swine influenza virus shedding following challenge and can prevent transmission to naive in-contact animals. Even when viral shedding was significantly reduced following challenge, infection was transmissible to susceptible co-housed recipients. This knowledge is important to inform disease surveillance and control strategies, and to determine the vaccine coverage required in a population, thereby defining disease moderation or herd protection. WIV or viral-vectored vaccines homologous to the challenge strain significantly reduced virus shedding from directly infected pigs, but vaccination did not completely prevent transmission to co-housed naive pigs.","Everett, Helen E; van Diemen, Pauline M; Aramouni, Mario; Ramsay, Andrew; Coward, Vivien J; Pavot, Vincent; Canini, Laetitia; Holzer, Barbara; Morgan, Sophie; Woolhouse, Mark E J; Tchilian, Elma; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Charleston, Bryan; Gilbert, Sarah",J. virol,,285
346304,Prevalence of comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19: A rapid review of current literature,2020,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative status in patients with silicosis by detecting dynamic thiol disulfide homeostasis (TDH), ischemia-modified albumin level (IMA) catalase (CAT) activity, and the correlation of these markers with pulmonary function tests. Male ceramic workers with silicosis (n = 91) and healthy individuals (n = 47) were recruited for the study. Radiographic abnormalities of pneumoconiosis were classified into three profusion categories (categories 1, 2, and 3), and patients with silicosis, those with category 1, were defined as group 1 and those with category 2 or 3 were defined as group 2. Plasma levels of native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulfide (Ds), IMA, and CAT activities were determined. Pulmonary function tests of groups were compared. NT, TT, and NT/TT ratios were significantly lower in groups 1 and 2 than the control group (p < 0.05). These did not differ between patients with silicosis (groups 1 and 2) and control group (p = 0.421). Ds/NT and Ds/TT ratios were significantly higher in group 2 than the control group (p < 0.05). NT, TT, and Ds did not differ significantly between groups 1 and 2. The oxidant biomarker IMA was higher (p < 0.001), and the antioxidant parameters albumin and CAT were lower in groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001) compared with the control group. The mean FEV1act, FVCact, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (%), and value of 25-75 percent maximum expiratory flow were significantly lower in groups 1 and 2 than control group. We have used a novel colorimetric method to assess TDH in patients with silicosis. Alteration of plasma thiol/disulfide homeostasis and IMA levels might be novel indicators of oxidative stress in silicosis.","Karatas, Mevlüt; Büyüksekerci, Murat; Gündüzöz, Meside; Özakinci, Gökhan; Özis, Türkan Nadir; Gök, Gamze; Neselioglu, Salim; Erel, Özcan",Toxicol Ind Health,,285
346506,How a portable negative pressure incubator for COVID-19 was created with minor modifications,2020,"Purpose: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, American medical schools made swift changes to clinical education based on guidelines provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The purpose of this study was to collect medical student perceptions of the solely online learning environment, their quality of life (QoL), and the pandemic response by their School of Medicine (SoM) to provide suggestions to inform medical schools' responses during the continuation of this pandemic and the next. Methods: Between April 29, 2020 and May 16, 2020, the authors distributed a 60-item questionnaire that assessed demographics, learning environment, QoL, and the SoM response. Likert-type items were analyzed on an item-by-item basis, whereas themes were identified for open-ended questions. Results: A total of 330 medical students (of 632; 52.2%) responded. Those who responded had positive perceptions of the online learning environment with moderate QoL disruptions to concentration and sleep. Although most students perceived being able to contribute meaningfully to the healthcare setting, they viewed themselves as underutilized. Three themes encapsulated both positive and negative perceptions of the SoM's response-communication, learning environment, and empathy and support. Conclusion: These findings provide insight into medical student perceptions of their learning environment and QoL as they acclimated to changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can help inform a SoM's response during the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as during future pandemics or crises. Follow-up surveys of medical students at multiple institutions across the USA and abroad will be essential to better characterize student perceptions.","Villanueva, Eric W; Meissner, Hannah; Walters, Ryan W",Med Sci Educ,,285
346666,Boosting telemedicine through remote monitoring of cardiac electronic devices during the Italian COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is putting health professionals under increasing pressure. This population is already acknowledged to be at risk of burnout. AIM: We aim to provide a 'snapshot' of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 open to any UK healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, distress and subjective measures of stress were also recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. RESULTS: A total of 539 persons responded to the survey; 90% female, 53% nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% versus 33% under 40 years, P = 0.004), more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P = 0.031), twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; P = 0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, P < 0.001), and were almost 4 times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Independent predictors of burnout were being younger, redeployment, exposure to patients with COVID-19, being female, and a history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.","Ferry, Amy V; Wereski, Ryan; Strachan, Fiona E; Mills, Nicholas L",QJM,,285

The approaches targeting the autophagy processes might have promising diagnostic and therapeutic values against Coronavirus infection. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship of Beclin-1 (BECN1), an autophagy-related protein, with blood parameters and the clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 108 patients with COVID-19 and 21 healthy controls in this study, from September 2020 to January 2021 and divided all patients into two groups according to the severity of the disease: The non-severe group and the severe group. BECN1 levels and blood parameters were measured with Enzyme-Linked Absorbent Assay and routine techniques, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Serum BECN1 levels were increased in patients with COVID-19 compared to the healthy controls, and its concentrations were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (p < 0.001). BECN1 levels showed a significantly positive correlation with coagulation markers such as D-dimer and Fibrinogen (FIB) and inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), Ferritin and biochemical markers such as Blood urea nitrogen and Lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001). We detected that areas under the ROC curve for BECN1, D-dimer, FIB, PCT, CRP and Ferritin were 0.8662, 0.9110, 0.8278, 0.9996 and 0.9284, respectively (p < 0.0001). SIGNIFICANCE: BECN1 may serve as a predictive biomarker in evaluating the disease severity of COVID-19. Our data suggest that BECN1 mediated-autophagy modulation might have a promising value in improving the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","Okuyan, Hamza Malik; Dogan, Serdar; Bal, Tayibe; Çabalak, Mehmet",Life Sci,,285

348025,A new phase of healthcare: COVID-19 and medical advancements,2020,"Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as the research area, this paper used OD cluster analysis based on Baidu migration data from January 11 to January 25 (before the sealing-off of Wuhan) and concluded that there is a significant correlation 1the migration level from Wuhan to the GBA and the epidemic severity index. This paper also analyzed the migration levels and diffusivity of the outer and inner cities of the GBA. Lastly, four evaluation indexes were selected to research the possibility of work resumption and the rating of epidemic prevention and control through kernel density estimation. According to the study, the amount of migration depends on the geographical proximity, relationship and economic development of the source region, and the severity of the epidemic depends mainly on the migration volume and the severity of the epidemic in the source region. The epidemic risk is related not only to the severity of the epidemic in the source region but also to the degree of urban traffic development and the degree of urban openness. After the resumption of work, the pressure of epidemic prevention and control has been concentrated mainly in Shenzhen and Canton; the further away a region is from the core cities, the lower the pressure in that region. The mass migration of the population makes it difficult to control the epidemic effectively. The study of the relationship between migration volume, epidemic severity and epidemic risk is helpful to further analyze transmission types and predict the trends of the epidemic.","Wang, Fangxiong; Tan, Ziqian; Yu, Zaihui; Yao, Siqi; Guo, Changfeng",PLoS One,,285

348430,COVID-19 and telehealth: a window of opportunity and its challenges,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The emergence of the novel coronavirus infection that arose in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has resulted in an epidemic that has quickly expanded to become one of the most significant public health threats in recent times. The objective of this review is to summarize how this pandemic has affected the activity of a Reproductive Medicine Center, which established a series of measures in parallel with governments decisions and scientific societies. RECENT FINDINGS: The control measures adopted for restarting the healthcare activity should be equitable and inclusive. Moreover, this pandemic has implied changes in treatments and strategies to be alert regarding the daily changing information. Finally, for ensuring a safe practice both for patients and staff, it is important to detect asymptomatic patients, so Reproductive Medicine centers must take special care with screening and testing procedures. SUMMARY: The pandemic has pushed up toward a new reality in terms of Assisted Reproductive treatments, where social distance and responsibility are protagonists. We face a new challenge of balancing between responding to the committed efforts of infertile couples to achieve pregnancy and safeguarding the health of the future parents and their children during this time of pandemic.","Cruz, M; Requena, Antonio",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,,285

We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help. METHODS: The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: ORâ¯=â¯1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), Pâ¯=â¯0.0006). The proportion of underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease were statistically significant higher in critical/mortal patients compared to the non-critical patients (diabetes: OR=3.68, 95% CI (2.68, 5.03), P < 0.00001; hypertension: ORâ¯=â¯2.72, 95% CI (1.60,4.64), Pâ¯=â¯0.0002; cardiovascular disease: ORâ¯=â¯5.19, 95% CI(3.25, 8.29), P < 0.00001; respiratory disease: ORâ¯=â¯5.15, 95% CI(2.51, 10.57), P < 0.00001).

The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a -4.8951% (t = -2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.","Prata, David N; Rodrigues, Waldecy; Bermejo, Paulo H",Sci Total Environ,,285

352466,Patient Satisfaction With a COVID-19 Telehealth Lactation Care Model,2021,"Respiratory failure in the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is hypothesized to be driven by an overreacting innate immune response, where the complement system is a key player. In this prospective cohort study of 39 hospitalized coronavirus disease COVID-19 patients, we describe systemic complement activation and its association with development of respiratory failure. Clinical data and biological samples were obtained at admission, days 3 to 5, and days 7 to 10. Respiratory failure was defined as PO2/FiO2 ratio of &#8804;40 kPa. Complement activation products covering the classical/lectin (C4d), alternative (C3bBbP) and common pathway (C3bc, C5a, and sC5b-9), the lectin pathway recognition molecule MBL, and antibody serology were analyzed by enzyme-immunoassays; viral load by PCR. Controls comprised healthy blood donors. Consistently increased systemic complement activation was observed in the majority of COVID-19 patients during hospital stay. At admission, sC5b-9 and C4d were significantly higher in patients with than without respiratory failure (P = 0.008 and P = 0.034). Logistic regression showed increasing odds of respiratory failure with sC5b-9 (odds ratio 31.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 746, P = 0.03) and need for oxygen therapy with C4d (11.7, 1.1 to 130, P = 0.045). Admission sC5b-9 and C4d correlated significantly to ferritin (r = 0.64, P < 0.001; r = 0.69, P < 0.001). C4d, sC5b-9, and C5a correlated with antiviral antibodies, but not with viral load. Systemic complement activation is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients and provides a rationale for investigating complement inhibitors in future clinical trials.","Holter, Jan C; Pischke, Soeren E; de Boer, Eline; Lind, Andreas; Jenum, Synne; Holten, Aleksander R; Tonby, Kristian; Barratt-Due, Andreas; Sokolova, Marina; Schjalm, Camilla; Chaban, Viktoriia; Kolderup, Anette; Tran, Trung; Tollefsrud Gjølberg, Torleif; Skeie, Linda G; Hesstvedt, Liv; Ormåsen, Vidar; Fevang, Børre; Austad, Cathrine; Müller, Karl Erik; Fladeby, Cathrine; Holberg-Petersen, Mona; Halvorsen, Bente; Müller, Fredrik; Aukrust, Pål; Dudman, Susanne; Ueland, Thor; Andersen, Jan Terje; Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof; Heggelund, Lars; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne M; Mollnes, Tom E",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,285
352536,Psychological Interventions for Depression and Anxiety during the Covid Pandemic: Effects of a Telehealth Intervention for Individuals with Cf and Parent Caregivers,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has a direct impact on the gastrointestinal system, as up to 50% of fecal samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients contain detectable viral RNA despite a negative rhino-pharyngeal swab. This finding, together with an intestinal expression of angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 protein, suggests a possible fecal-oral transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients including watery diarrhea, vomiting-particularly in children-nausea, and abdominal pain. Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents significant similarities to those of some immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the hypothesis that targeted therapies used for the treatment of immune-mediated disease could be effective to treat (and possibly prevent) the main complications of COVID-19. In this review, we synthesize the present and future impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal system and on gastroenterology practice, hypothesizing a potential role of the ""gut-lung axis"" and perhaps of the gut and lung microbiota into the interindividual differential susceptibility to COVID-19 19 disease. Finally, we speculate on the reorganization of outpatient gastroenterology services, which need to consider, among other factors, the major psychological impact of strict lockdown measures on the whole population.","Scaldaferri, Franco; Ianiro, Gianluca; Privitera, Giuseppe; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo; Vetrone, Lorenzo Maria; Petito, Valentina; Pugliese, Daniela; Neri, Matteo; Cammarota, Giovanni; Ringel, Yehuda; Costamagna, Guido; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Boskoski, Ivo; Armuzzi, Alessandro",Inflamm Bowel Dis,,285

Yet, little work explores the correlates of misperceptions in varying contexts – that is, how do factors such as group affiliations, media exposure, and lived experiences correlate with the number of misperceptions people hold? We address these questions by investigating misperceptions about COVID-19, focusing on the role of racial/ethnic, religious, and partisan groups. Using a large survey, we find the number of correct beliefs held by individuals far dwarfs the number of misperceptions. When it comes to misperceptions, we find that minorities, those with high levels of religiosity, and those with strong partisan identities – across parties – hold a substantially greater number of misperceptions than those with contrasting group affiliations. Moreover, we show other variables (e.g., social media usage, number of COVID-19 cases in one's county) do not have such strong relationships with misperceptions, and the group-level results do not reflect acquiescence to believing any information regardless of its truth value. Our results accentuate the importance of studying group-level misperceptions on other scientific and political issues and developing targeted interventions for these groups.

354811,COVID-19 and thrombosis: Beyond a casual association,2020,"Objective: To investigate whether preserved vestibular function in the high-frequency range influences the prognosis after vestibular rehabilitation in patients with BVP. Methods: Twenty-four patients followed up with vestibular rehabilitation were recruited. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups according to the preservation of high6 frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) based on the video head impulse test (vHIT). The results on the computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) survey collected at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up with vestibular rehabilitation therapy were analysed. Results: Both groups showed significantly increased composite and DHI scores after follow up with vestibular rehabilitation. The high-frequency VOR preserved group showed a better composite score (p = 0.064) and vestibular score (p = 0.008) than the high-frequency VOR loss group at the 6-month follow up. The DHI score was significantly decreased only in the high-frequency VOR loss group (p = 0.047). Among the three vestibular function tests (caloric test, rotary chair test, vHIT) used to diagnose BVP, only vHIT showed a significant correlation (p = 0.015) with favourable prognosis (composite score &#8805; 70). Conclusion: Better treatment outcomes are likely in patients with BVP with preserved vestibular function in response to the high-frequency stimulation measured by the vHIT.","Bae, Seong Hoon; Nam, Gi Sung; Kwak, Sang Hyun; Kim, Sung Huhn",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,,285

At the root of SARS-CoV infection is the interaction between the viral spike protein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein, which allows the virus to gain entry into host cells through endocytosis. In this work, we apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to provide a detailed view of the functional footprint and conformational dynamics associated with this interaction. Our results broadly agree with the binding interface derived from high resolution X-ray crystal structure data but also provide insights into shifts in structure and dynamics that accompany complexation, including some that occur immediately outside of the core binding interface. We propose that dampening of these ""binding-site adjacent"" dynamic shifts could represent a mechanism for neutralizing activity in a multitude of spike protein-targeted mAbs that have been found to specifically bind these ""peripheral"" sites. Our results highlight the unique capacity of HDX-MS to detect potential neutralization ""hotspots"" outside of the core binding interfaces defined by high resolution structural data.","Narang, Dominic; James, D Andrew; Balmer, Matthew T; Wilson, Derek J",J Am Soc Mass Spectrom,,285

The GNEC mask exhibits an excellent hydrophobic ability (water contact angle: 157.9°) and an outstanding filtration efficiency with 100% bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). In addition, the GNEC mask shows the prominent photo-sterilize performance, heating up to 110 °C quickly under the solar illumination. These high performances may facilitate the combat against the COVID-19 outbreaks, while the reusable masks help reducing the economic and resource consumption.

362296,The fast-motion research process about COVID-19 in children: a bibliometric review,2021,"The effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for rehabilitation is proportional to the evoked torque. The progressive increase in torque (extra torque) that may develop in response to low intensity wide-pulse high-frequency (WPHF) NMES holds great promise for rehabilitation as it overcomes the main limitation of NMES, namely discomfort. WPHF NMES extra torque is thought to result from reflexively recruited motor units at the spinal level. However, whether WPHF NMES evoked force can be modulated is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of two interventions known to change the state of spinal circuitry in opposite ways on evoked torque and motor unit recruitment by WPHF NMES. The interventions were high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and anodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS). We show that TENS performed before a bout of WPHF NMES results in lower evoked torque (median change in torque time-integral: - 56%) indicating that WPHF NMES-evoked torque might be modulated. In contrast, the anodal tsDCS protocol used had no effect on any measured parameter. Our results demonstrate that WPHF NMES extra torque can be modulated and although the TENS intervention blunted extra torque production, the finding that central contribution to WPHF NMES-evoked torques can be modulated opens new avenues for designing interventions to enhance WPHF NMES.","Donnelly, Chris; Stegmüller, Jonathan; Blazevich, Anthony J; Crettaz von Roten, Fabienne; Kayser, Bengt; Neyroud, Daria; Place, Nicolas",Sci Rep,,285

362942,The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on oral medicine services in a tertiary referral center,2020,"BACKGROUND: Effective conservation management of highly mobile species depends upon detailed knowledge of movements of individuals across their range; yet, data are rarely available at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. Flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.) are large bats that forage by night on floral resources and rest by day in arboreal roosts that may contain colonies of many thousands of individuals. They are the largest mammals capable of powered flight, and are highly mobile, which makes them key seed and pollen dispersers in forest ecosystems. However, their mobility also facilitates transmission of zoonotic diseases and brings them in conflict with humans, and so they require a precarious balancing of conservation and management concerns throughout their Old World range. Here, we analyze the Australia-wide movements of 201 satellite-tracked individuals, providing unprecedented detail on the inter-roost movements of three flying-fox species: Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, and P. scapulatus across jurisdictions over up to 5 years. RESULTS: Individuals were estimated to travel long distances annually among a network of 755 roosts (P. alecto, 1427-1887 km; P. poliocephalus, 2268-2564 km; and P. scapulatus, 3782-6073 km), but with little uniformity among their directions of travel. This indicates that flying-fox populations are composed of extremely mobile individuals that move nomadically and at species-specific rates. Individuals of all three species exhibited very low fidelity to roosts locally, resulting in very high estimated daily colony turnover rates (P. alecto, 11.9 ± 1.3%; P. poliocephalus, 17.5 ± 1.3%; and P. scapulatus, 36.4 ± 6.5%). This indicates that flying-fox roosts form nodes in a vast continental network of highly dynamic ""staging posts"" through which extremely mobile individuals travel far and wide across their species ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme inter-roost mobility reported here demonstrates the extent of the ecological linkages that nomadic flying-foxes provide across Australia's contemporary fragmented landscape, with profound implications for the ecosystem services and zoonotic dynamics of flying-fox populations. In addition, the extreme mobility means that impacts from local management actions can readily reverberate across jurisdictions throughout the species ranges; therefore, local management actions need to be assessed with reference to actions elsewhere and hence require national coordination. These findings underscore the need for sound understanding of animal movement dynamics to support evidence-based, transboundary conservation and management policy, tailored to the unique movement ecologies of species.","Welbergen, Justin A; Meade, Jessica; Field, Hume E; Edson, Daniel; McMichael, Lee; Shoo, Luke P; Praszczalek, Jenny; Smith, Craig; Martin, John M",BMC Biol,,285

364106,Reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland with a focus on the Cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a significant public health issue in China. Early warning and forecasting are one of the most cost-effective ways for HFMD control and prevention. However, relevant research is limited, especially in China with a large population and diverse climatic characteristics. This study aims to identify local specific HFMD epidemic thresholds and construct a weather-based early warning model for HFMD control and prevention across China. METHODS: Monthly notified HFMD cases and meteorological data for 22 cities selected from different climate zones from 2014 to 2018 were extracted from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System and the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System, respectively. A generalized additive model (GAM) based on meteorological factors was conducted to forecast HFMD epidemics. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to determine the value of optimal warning threshold. RESULTS: The developed model was solid in forecasting the epidemic of HFMD with all R square (R2) in the 22 cities above 85%, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) less than 1%. The warning thresholds varied by cities with the highest threshold observed in Shenzhen (n=7,195) and the lowest threshold in Liaoyang (n=12). The areas under the curve (AUC) was greater than 0.9 for all regions, indicating a satisfied discriminating ability in epidemics detection. CONCLUSIONS: The weather-based HFMD forecasting and early warning model we developed for different climate zones provides needed information on occurrence time and size of HFMD epidemics. An effective early warning system for HFMD could provide sufficient time for local authorities to implement timely interventions to minimize the HFMD morbidity and mortality.","Gao, Qi; Liu, Zhidong; Xiang, Jianjun; Tong, Michael; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Shuzi; Zhang, Yiwen; Lu, Liang; Jiang, Baofa; Bi, Peng",Environ Res,,285

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in intensive care unit (ICU). All patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for whom RNAemia remained positive more than 14 days after onset of the infection were included and given CPT. The primary objective was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia 7 days (D7) after CPT. A total of 14 patients were included and they received a median CPT volume of 828 ml (range: 817-960). CPT was administered in a median time of 14 days after ICU admission. At D7, 13/14 patients had negative SARS-CoV-2 blood PCR and one patient had negative blood PCR 11 days after CPT. At D7 and at D14, the clinical status was improved in 7/14 and 11/14 patients, respectively. The 28-day mortality rate was 14%. No CPT-related adverse effects had been reported. CPT is safe and may be efficient in patients with protracted RNAemia admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Our study looks at adverse effects and problems of adherence to oral immunotherapy therapy (OIT) during this period. Patients and methods: A total of 132 patients, mostly children (95%), with an atopic history (60%) followed for an OIT were included in 3 allergology centers in Île-de-France, during the period of confinement from 03/16 to 05/11/20. The main food allergens used for OIT were peanut (38%), cow's milk (24%), hazelnut (14%), egg (9%), cashew nut and pistachio nut (8%). Results: Adverse effects were found in 13 patients or 10% of the cases. These reactions were mainly grade 1 and 2 according to the Ring and Messmer classification. Three patients had grade 3 reactions and six patients used epinephrine at home. Adherence was correct in 81% of cases with no omissions. Three patients increased their daily dose without medical advice. No significant difference was found in the subgroup analysis comparing age-matched children followed up in OIT in 2019 and 2020 over the same period in the same hospital. Conclusion: There was no increase in adverse events in OIT during the confinement period. Therapeutic education during OIT is paramount and helps to reduce the occurrence of adverse events.","Le-Thai, C; Guiddir, T; Stern, R; Smilov, M; Pigeot, J-C; Merzouk, A; Billard-Larue, C; de Menibus, A-C; Nemni, A",,,285

Our objective was to evaluate if prone positioning is associated with a reduced intubation rate when compared to usual care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in the emergency department of a large quaternary hospital in Sao Paulo. We retrieved data from all admitted patients in need of oxygen supplementation (>3 L/min) and tachypnea (>24 ipm) from March 1 to April 30, 2020, excluding those who had any contraindication to the prone position or who had an immediate need for intubation. The primary endpoint was endotracheal intubation up to 15 days. Secondary outcomes included a 6-point clinical outcome ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation-free days, admission to the intensive care unit, and need of hemodialysis and of vasoactive drugs, all assessed at or up to 15 days. We analyzed unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates with Cox proportional hazards models, logistic regression, quantile regression, and sensitivity analyses using propensity score models. RESULTS: Of 925 suspected COVID-19 patients admitted off mechanical ventilation, 166 patients fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria: 57 were exposed to prone positioning and 109 to usual care. In the intervention group, 33 (58%) were intubated versus 53 (49%) in the control group. We observed no difference in intubation rates in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78 to 1.88, p = 0.39) nor in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.49, p = 0.69). Results were robust to the sensitivity analyses. Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning was not associated with lower intubation rates.

The health perception scales used in the survey consists of the six dimensions of mental health, disease, physical activity, sleep, diet, and sanitary health. The data were primarily analyzed using paired sample t-test for analysis of difference and importance-performance analysis (IPA). The IPA results were presented in four quadrants-""keep up the good work,"" ""concentrate here,"" ""low priority,"" and ""possible overkill."" The results indicated that first, there was a positive relationship between the importance and performance of all the subdimensions of health perception. Second, sanitary healthcare was rated as being of the greatest importance and was performed most, while physical activity management was rated least important and performed least. Third, statistically significant differences were found between importance and performance for all items of mental health, disease, physical activity, sleep, and diet dimensions, and some differences were found for items assessing the hygiene control dimension. Fourth, in the two-dimensional IPA model, ""sanitary health"" and ""disease"" are in Quadrant I (keep up the good work); ""mental health,"" in Quadrant II (concentrate here); and ""physical activity,"" ""sleep,"" and ""diet,"" in Quadrant III (low priority). No components of healthcare were in Quadrant IV (possible overkill).

367887,Resuming arthroplasty: A well aligned and a balanced approach in the COVID-19 era,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), underscoring the urgent need for simple, efficient, and inexpensive methods to decontaminate masks and respirators exposed to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The 2 arms of the study included (1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment and (2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on 3 N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and 2 medical mask models. We inoculated FFR and medical mask materials with 3 coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and we treated them with 10 µM MB and exposed them to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5 cycles of decontamination using multiple US and international test methods, and the process was compared with the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all 3 coronaviruses with 99.8% to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and medical masks tested. FFR and medical mask integrity was maintained after 5 cycles of MBL treatment, whereas 1 FFR model failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O3. CONCLUSIONS: MBL treatment decontaminated respirators and masks by inactivating 3 tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5 cycles of decontamination. MBL decontamination is effective, is low cost, and does not require specialized equipment, making it applicable in low- to high-resource settings.","Lendvay, Thomas Sean; Chen, James; Harcourt, Brian H; Scholte, Florine E M; Lin, Ying Ling; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Lamb, Molly M; Homdayjanakul, Kamonthip; Cui, Yi; Price, Amy; Heyne, Belinda; Sahni, Jaya; Kabra, Kareem B; Lin, Yi-Chan; Evans, David; Mores, Christopher N; Page, Ken; Chu, Larry F; Haubruge, Eric; Thiry, Etienne; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F; Wielick, Constance; Clark, Tanner; Wagner, Thor; Timm, Emily; Gallagher, Thomas; Faris, Peter; Macia, Nicolas; Mackie, Cyrus J; Simmons, Sarah M; Reader, Susan; Malott, Rebecca; Hope, Karen; Davies, Jan M; Tritsch, Sarah R; Dams, Lorène; Nauwynck, Hans; Willaert, Jean-Francois; De Jaeger, Simon; Liao, Lei; Zhao, Mervin; Laperre, Jan; Jolois, Olivier; Smit, Sarah J; Patel, Alpa N; Mayo, Mark; Parker, Rod; Molloy-Simard, Vanessa; Lemyre, Jean-Luc; Chu, Steven",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,285

Pharmacokinetics of STR-324 could not be determined due to most concentrations being below quantifiable limits. STR-324 metabolite concentrations were measurable, showing dose proportionality of Cmax and AUCinf with an estimated T1/2 of 0.2-0.5h. Significant changes on pharmacodynamic parameters were observed, however these were not consistent or dose-dependent. CONCLUSION: STR-324 displayed favourable safety and tolerability profiles at all doses up to 11.475mg h-1. Although pharmacokinetic characterisation of STR-324 was limited, dose proportionality could be assumed based on major metabolite data assayed as proxy. No clear effects on nociceptive thresholds or other pharmacodynamic measures were observed.","Moss, Laurence M; Berends, Cecile L; van Brummelen, Emilie M J; Kamerling, Ingrid M C; Klaassen, Erica S; Bergmann, Kirsten; Ville, Vanessa; Juarez-Perez, Victor; Benichou, Annie-Claude; Groeneveld, Geert Jan",,,285

Herein, we investigated the effectiveness of commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes in inactivating SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces of personal items. We contaminated glass, metal, and plastic samples representing the surfaces of personal items such as smartphones, coins, or credit cards with SARS-CoV-2 formulated in an organic matrix mimicking human respiratory secretions. For disinfection, the samples were placed at different distances from UVC emitting LEDs inside commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes and irradiated for different time periods (up to 10 min). High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were effectively inactivated on all surfaces after 3 min of irradiation. Even 10 s of UVC-exposure strongly reduced viral loads. Thus, UVC-LED boxes proved to be an effective method for disinfecting SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces that are typically found on personal items.","Bormann, Maren; Alt, Mira; Schipper, Leonie; van de Sand, Lukas; Otte, Mona; Meister, Toni Luise; Dittmer, Ulf; Witzke, Oliver; Steinmann, Eike; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Viruses,,285

The two countries responded to the symmetric economic shock with very similar furlough and business credit schemes to stabilize the demand and supply sides of the economy. However, since these policies fed into very different political-economic structures in both countries, they produced very different results. We attribute this divergence to the effect of ""institutional complementarities,""the notion in Varieties of Capitalism that different elements of a system are mutually articulated and, therefore, mutually reinforcing beyond their initial contribution, or vice versa.

371120,Proposed Imaging Guidelines for Pregnant Women Suspected of Having COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 13 (SCV nsP13), a superfamily 1 helicase, plays a central role in viral RNA replication through the unwinding of duplex RNA and DNA with a 5' single-stranded tail in a 5' to 3' direction. Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5'-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.","Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Jeong, Seonghwan; Kang, Dong Young; Sp, Nipin; Yang, Young Mok; Kim, Dong-Eun",Sci Rep,,285

371675,Double prevalence of appendicular peritonitis during COVID times,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly variable between individuals, ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Such variability stresses the need for novel biomarkers associated with disease outcome. As SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a kidney proximal tubule dysfunction with urinary loss of uric acid, we hypothesized that low serum levels of uric acid (hypouricemia) may be associated with severity and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study using two independent cohorts, we investigated and validated the prevalence, kinetics and clinical correlates of hypouricemia among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a large academic hospital in Brussels, Belgium. Survival analyses using Cox regression and a competing risk approach assessed the time to mechanical ventilation and/or death. Confocal microscopy assessed the expression of urate transporter URAT1 in kidney proximal tubule cells from patients who died from COVID-19. RESULTS: The discovery and validation cohorts included 192 and 325 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively. Out of the 517 patients, 274 (53%) had severe and 92 (18%) critical COVID-19. In both cohorts, the prevalence of hypouricemia increased from 6% upon admission to 20% within the first days of hospitalization for COVID-19, contrasting with a very rare occurrence (< 1%) before hospitalization for COVID-19. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 148 days (50-168), 61 (12%) patients required mechanical ventilation and 93 (18%) died. In both cohorts considered separately and in pooled analyses, low serum levels of uric acid were strongly associated with disease severity (linear trend, P < 0.001) and with progression to death and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in Cox (adjusted hazard ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 3.6-7.8, P < 0.001) or competing risks (adjusted hazard ratio 20.8, 95% confidence interval 10.4-41.4, P < 0.001) models. At the structural level, kidneys from patients with COVID-19 showed a major reduction in urate transporter URAT1 expression in the brush border of proximal tubules. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, low serum levels of uric acid are common and associate with disease severity and with progression to respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.","Dufour, Inès; Werion, Alexis; Belkhir, Leila; Wisniewska, Anastazja; Perrot, Marie; De Greef, Julien; Schmit, Gregory; Yombi, Jean Cyr; Wittebole, Xavier; Laterre, Pierre-François; Jadoul, Michel; Gérard, Ludovic; Morelle, Johann",Crit Care,,285

The evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake detection aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid development of the DeepFake-related studies in the community, both sides (i.e., DeepFake generation and detection) have formed the relationship of the battleground, pushing the improvements of each other and inspiring new directions, e.g., the evasion of DeepFake detection. Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the new direction is unclear and neglected by recent surveys due to the rapid increase of related publications, limiting the in-depth understanding of the tendency and future works. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the research work on the topic of DeepFake generation, DeepFake detection as well as evasion of DeepFake detection, with more than 191 research papers carefully surveyed. We present the taxonomy of various DeepFake generation methods and the categorization of various DeepFake detection methods, and more importantly, we showcase the battleground between the two parties with detailed interactions between the adversaries (DeepFake generation) and the defenders (DeepFake detection). The battleground allows fresh perspective into the latest landscape of the DeepFake research and can provide valuable analysis towards the research challenges and opportunities as well as research trends and directions in the field of DeepFake generation and detection. We also elaborately design interactive diagrams (http://www.xujuefei.com/dfsurvey) to allow researchers to explore their own interests on popular DeepFake generators or detectors.","Juefei-Xu, Felix; Wang, Run; Huang, Yihao; Guo, Qing; Ma, Lei; Liu, Yang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00218v1.pdf,285

From this perspective, this work demonstrated that curcumin urges as a potential antiviral key for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 based on its relation to the infection pathways. Moreover, the use of curcumin-loaded nanocarriers for increasing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency was highlighted. Additionally, the potential of the nanostructured systems by themselves and their synergic action with curcumin on molecular targets for viral infections have been explored. Finally, a viewpoint of the studies that need to be carried out to implant curcumin as a treatment for COVID-19 was addressed.","Dourado, Douglas; Freire, Danielle T; Pereira, Daniel T; Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Alencar, Éverton N; de Barros, André Luís Branco; Egito, E Sócrates T",Biomed Pharmacother,,285

In this editorial, the authors describe the scientific evidence underlying a possible role of vitamin D in the prevention and development of the pandemic, considering its immunomodulatory role and antiviral effects. They conclude that further studies are needed to (1) better explore possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 morbidity and lethality, and (2) assess if compensating such deficiency could avoid or mitigate the worst manifestations of COVID-19. They highlight the need for public health campaigns to promote consumption of vitamin D-rich foods and proper sunlight exposition or, when this is not possible, controlled pharmaceutical supplementation, especially in countries with high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.","Isaia, Giancarlo; Medico, Enzo",Aging Clin Exp Res,,285

We performed detailed characterization of B cell responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation and shared B cell repertoire features previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody-secreting cell expansion and early production of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies. Yet, these patients had severe disease with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multiorgan failure and death. Overall, these findings strongly suggest a pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of patients with COVID-19. Our study provides further evidence that targeted immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in specific patient subpopulations and can be informed by careful immune profiling.","Woodruff, Matthew C; Ramonell, Richard P; Nguyen, Doan C; Cashman, Kevin S; Saini, Ankur Singh; Haddad, Natalie S; Ley, Ariel M; Kyu, Shuya; Howell, J Christina; Ozturk, Tugba; Lee, Saeyun; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Case, James Brett; Bugrovsky, Regina; Chen, Weirong; Estrada, Jacob; Morrison-Porter, Andrea; Derrico, Andrew; Anam, Fabliha A; Sharma, Monika; Wu, Henry M; Le, Sang N; Jenks, Scott A; Tipton, Christopher M; Staitieh, Bashar; Daiss, John L; Ghosn, Eliver; Diamond, Michael S; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Hu, William T; Lee, F Eun-Hyung; Sanz, Ignacio",Nat Immunol,,285

For instance, female workers at Uber earn less than their male colleagues per mile driven. Similar observations have been made for other minority subgroups in other two-sided markets. Here, we suggest a novel market-clearing mechanism for two-sided markets, which promotes equalisation of the pay per hour worked across multiple subgroups, as well as within each subgroup. In the process, we introduce a novel notion of subgroup fairness (which we call Inter-fairness), which can be combined with other notions of fairness within each subgroup (called Intra-fairness), and the utility for the customers (Customer-Care) in the objective of the market-clearing problem. While the novel non-linear terms in the objective complicate market clearing by making the problem non-convex, we show that a certain non-convex augmented Lagrangian relaxation can be approximated to any precision in time polynomial in the number of market participants using semi-definite programming. This makes it possible to implement the market-clearing mechanism efficiently. On the example of driver-ride assignment in an Uber-like system, we demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the approach, and trade-offs between Inter- and Intra-fairness.","Zhou, Quan; Marecek, Jakub; Shorten, Robert N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02702v1.pdf,285

The main aim of this study was to analyse the impact of lockdown (imposed in March and continued in April 2020) on the existing air quality in three megacities of India (Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata) by assessing the trends of PM10 and NO2 concentrations. A comparison of the percentage reduction in concentrations of lockdown period with respect to same period in year 2019 and pre-lockdown period (February 14-March 24) was made. It was observed from the study that an overall decrease of pollutant concentrations was in the ranges of 30-60% and 52-80% of PM10 and NO2, respectively, in the three cities during lockdown in comparison with previous year and pre-lockdown period. The overall decrease in concentrations of pollutants at urban sites was greater than the background sites. Highest decline in concentrations of PM10 were observed in Kolkata city, followed by Mumbai and Delhi, while decline in NO2 was highest in Mumbai. Results also highlighted that capital city Delhi had the worst air quality amongst three cities, with particulate matter (PM10) being the dominant pollutant. Although COVID-19 has significantly affected the human life considering the mortality and morbidity, lockdowns imposed to control the pandemic had significantly improved the air quality in the selected study locations, although for the short amount of period.","Ganguly, Rajiv; Sharma, Divyansh; Kumar, Prashant",Environ Dev Sustain,,285

METHODS: The mixed methods design included a subset of cancer patients who responded to a cross-sectional survey in May 2020. Data were collected through telephone interviews. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT), and Connor-Davidson-Resilience Scale (CD-RISC2) were used to measure distress and resilience. Data were analysed by thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Forty patients with lung, breast, colorectal and skin (melanoma) cancer were included; 65% were women. Mean age was 62.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 13.2). Most patients had curable disease (65%); 50% were in treatment and 50% in post-treatment follow up. The interviews revealed four themes: 1) the cost of living with cancer during COVID-19, 2) changes in cancer care delivery, 3) particularly vulnerable, and 4) importance of family support. Mean NCCN DT score was 2.3 (SD, 2.6) while the mean CD-RISC2 score was 7.25 (SD, 1.1). CONCLUSION: Despite drastic changes in daily life imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, Danish cancer patients had remarkably low levels of distress and high levels of resilience.

However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in a major US health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients with COVID-19. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1 to April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographic and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of inhaled corticosteroids did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (relative risk, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.90-2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization.

The adoption of social distancing and heavy lockdown measures is posing a heavy burden on the population and the economy. The timing of the measures has crucial policy-making implications. Using publicly available data for the pandemic progression in Italy, we quantitatively assess the effect of the intervention time on the pandemic expansion, with a methodology that combines a generalized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model together with statistical learning methods. The modeling shows that the lockdown has strongly deviated the pandemic trajectory in Italy. However, the difference between the forecasts and real data up to 20 April 2020 can be explained only by the existence of a time lag between the actual issuance date and the full effect of the measures. To understand the relative importance of intervention with respect to other factors, a thorough uncertainty quantification of the model predictions is performed. Global sensitivity indices show that the the time of intervention is 4 times more relevant than quarantine, and eight times more important than intrinsic features of the pandemic such as protection and infection rates.

Most results were derived from global-level gray literature with recommendations for interventions and implicit links to the sustainable development goals. Based on research gaps uncovered in the review, future implementation science research needs to focus on designing, implementing, evaluating, and scaling: effective evidence-based socioeconomic interventions; equity-focused, redistributive, and transformative interventions; comprehensive packages of complementary interventions; interventions to upend root causes of systemic social inequities; collaborative and participatory approaches; interventions that integrate environmental sustainability; and city-level interventions.

377294,"The impact of symptomatic femoral neck anteversion and tibial torsion on gait, function and participation in children and adolescents",2021,"Complement, a part of the innate arm of the immune system, is integral to the frontline defense of the host against innumerable pathogens, which includes RNA viruses. Among the major groups of viruses, RNA viruses contribute significantly to the global mortality and morbidity index associated with viral infection. Despite multiple routes of entry adopted by these viruses, facing complement is inevitable. The initial interaction with complement and the nature of this interaction play an important role in determining host resistance versus susceptibility to the viral infection. Many RNA viruses are potent activators of complement, often resulting in virus neutralization. Yet, another facet of virus-induced activation is the exacerbation in pathogenesis contributing to the overall morbidity. The severity in disease and death associated with RNA virus infections shows a tip in the scale favoring viruses. Growing evidence suggest that like their DNA counterparts, RNA viruses have co-evolved to master ingenious strategies to remarkably restrict complement. Modulation of host genes involved in antiviral responses contributed prominently to the adoption of unique strategies to keep complement at bay, which included either down regulation of activation components (C3, C4) or up regulation of complement regulatory proteins. All this hints at a possible ""hijacking"" of the cross-talk mechanism of the host immune system. Enveloped RNA viruses have a selective advantage of not only modulating the host responses but also recruiting membrane-associated regulators of complement activation (RCAs). This review aims to highlight the significant progress in the understanding of RNA virus-complement interactions.","Kumar, Nisha Asok; Kunnakkadan, Umerali; Thomas, Sabu; Johnson, John Bernet",Front Immunol,,285

Para tentar elucidar a etiologia dessa doença e suas possíveis rotas de transmissão dentro de uma propriedade leiteira, foram realizadas 37 biópsias de animais acometidos pela DD e foram coletadas 13 amostras de fluido ruminal e 13 amostras de fezes de vacas portadoras dessa lesão. Amostras ambientais de áreas específicas da propriedade também foram coletadas, como o material acumulado ao redor do bebedouro, pista de alimentação, sala de espera da ordenha, lava-pés e pedilúvio e para comparar o microbioma encontrado nas lesões com a pele sadia, foram realizadas três biópsias de pele íntegra localizadas adjacentes a lesão. Para análise dos microbiomas da DD e pele íntegra foram utilizadas as técnicas moleculares de Hibridização Fluorescente in Situ (FISH) e sequenciamento de nova geração e as amostras de fluido ruminal, fezes e ambiente foram analisadas pelo método de sequenciamento de nova geração. Foi encontrado pela técnica de FISH a presença bacteriana em 96,55% das lesões e as bactérias do gênero Treponema foram as mais frequentes, estando presentes em 93,55%. Já Dichelobacter nodosus estava presente em 58,06%; Fusobacterium necrophorum em 35,49% e Porphyromonas levii em 33,43%. As bactérias do gênero Treponema foram as que tiveram maior densidade nas amostras analisadas, seguidas por Dichelobacter nodosus; Fusobacterium necrophorum e Porphyromonas levii. Foram identificados sete filotipos diferentes nas amostras de DD: T. pedis, T. refringes, T. phagedenis, T. medium e alguns filotipos que não foram previamente cultivados e foram classificados nesse estudo como: PT18, PT13 e PT3, sendo T. phagedenis e T. pedis as espécies encontradas em maiores densidades nas lesões. Pela técnica de sequenciamento de nova geração os Treponemas estavam presentes em 68,6% das lesões, Porphyromonas em 91,4%, Mycoplasma em 85,7%, Helcococccus em 74,4%, Corynebacterium em 60%, Fusobacterium em 45,7%, Dichelobacter em 40%, e Alloiococcus em 17,1% e também foi encontrado filotipos que ainda não foram previamente identificados pela literatura. Nas amostras de fluido ruminal, fezes e ambiente foram encontrados Treponemas, mas em baixas proporções e dentre os Treponemas encontrados nesses locais os mais prevalentes ainda são desconhecidos pela literatura. Os dados encontrados nesse estudo apoiam o conceito de que a etiologia da DD é principalmente multitreponemal e polimicrobiana, onde vários agentes, podem agir sinergicamente com os Treponemas para causar a lesão de DD. As bactérias do gênero Treponema foram também encontradas no rúmen, fezes e amostras ambientais da propriedade, principalmente Treponemas que ainda não foram classificados pela literatura. Sugerindo que a microbiota do trato gastrointestinal e o ambiente da fazenda podem atuar como reservatórios de bactérias envolvidas na patogênese da DD.

BACKGROUND: TAVR is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with ESLD and ESRD, though current outcomes data are limited. METHODS: We compared 309 patients (N = 29 ESLD and/or ESRD, N = 280 control) age > 18 who underwent transfemoral TAVR from 2014 to 2020 have been compared. RESULTS: Patients with ESLD and ESRD were younger (69.9 ± 11.7 vs. 79.1 ± 9.8, p < .01) with higher STS-PROM scores (8.1 ± 6.7 vs. 4.6 ± 3.9, p < .01). ESRD and ESLD patients had similar rates of in-hospital major vascular complications (3.4% vs. 3.2%, p = .96), major bleeding events (3.4% vs. 3.2%, p = .95), and mortality (0.0% vs. 1.8%, p = .47). Mortality rates were similar at 30-days (3.4% vs. 2.1%, p = .65) with trend to higher mortality at 6-months (6.9% vs. 3.2%, p = .31) and 1-year (15.4% vs. 7.0%, p = .13). Readmission rates were higher in the ESLD and ESRD cohort at 6-months (53.2% vs. 28.6%, p < .01) and 1-year (65.4% vs. 41.0%, p = .02). One patient received dual kidney-liver transplant, 1 patient received a liver transplant, and 7 additional patients were listed for transplant. CONCLUSION: Patients with ESLD and/or ESRD who underwent TAVR had similar mortality at discharge and 30-days compared with patients without these comorbidities with a trend toward increased mortality at 1-year. This study suggests that TAVR is an option for aortic valve disease patients with ESRD and/or ESLD in order to remove cardiac barriers to liver or kidney transplant.","Caughron, Hope; Parikh, Devang; Allison, Zev; Deuse, Tobias; Mahadevan, Vaikom S",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,285
378754,Patient experience of postal CPAP in COVID era: A unique mode of CPAP trials,2021,"Background: Early-stage interventions in a potential pandemic are important to understand as they can make the difference between runaway exponential growth that is hard to turn back and stopping the spread before it gets that far. COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal;while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine two factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread and the risks of basing strategy on untested claims, such as potential protective value of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. An early study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are would have informed policy on nonpharmaceutical interventions but could still be of value to understand containment during vaccine roll out. Conclusions: When a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread. Understanding mild cases could shed light on the disease in the longer term, including whether vaccines prevent contagiousness. © 2021 Machanick P.","Machanick, P.",,,285

In addition, due to pandemic restrictions and in order to help contain the spread of the virus (COVID-19), all educational institutions have been forced to switch immediately to online education. The application of augmented reality (AR) in education provides important benefits, such as increased engagement and interactivity, and can help to minimize the negative effects of the disruption of face-to-face education. Therefore, this paper focuses on describing the effect of an augmented reality mobile application (NetAR) that was developed for engineering students as a complement to traditional education. To achieve this objective, an experimental group and a control group were established to work with the application for three weeks for three hours a day. Moreover, there are a number of usability issues with AR that may impact learning effectiveness and motivation. Therefore, the usability of the application was evaluated with the IBM Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) tool. The usability results show that users are satisfied with NetAR, and the statistical data from the control group indicate that the application positively affects learning.","Criollo, S.; Abad-Vasquez, D.; Martic-Nieto, M.; Velasquez, F.

METHODS: Interrupted time series analysis of daily ED encounters from October 2015 through October 2020 for suicide attempt and intentional self-harm (subject n=3002; 62% female; 78% Caucasian) using an autoregressive integrated moving average modelling approach. RESULTS: There were 39.9% (95% CI 22.9% to 53.1%) fewer ED encounters for suicide attempt and intentional self-harm during the first 12 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, on or after 10 March 2020, when the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in Michigan). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer individuals sought emergency care for suicide-related behaviour during the earlier phase of the COVID-19 pandemic than expected when compared to prior years. This suggests initial outbreaks of COVID-19 and state of emergency executive orders did not increase suicide-related behaviour in the short term. More work is needed to determine long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide-related behaviour and whether there are high-risk groups.","Bergmans, Rachel S; Larson, Peter S",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,285

We investigated whether the two families represent the tip of the iceberg of a subset of COVID-19 male patients. Methods: This is a nested case-control study in which we compared male participants with extreme phenotype selected from the Italian GEN-COVID cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected participants (<60 y, 79 severe cases versus 77 control cases). We applied the LASSO Logistic Regression analysis, considering only rare variants on young male subsets with extreme phenotype, picking up TLR7 as the most important susceptibility gene. Results: Overall, we found TLR7 deleterious variants in 2.1% of severely affected males and in none of the asymptomatic participants. The functional gene expression profile analysis demonstrated a reduction in TLR7-related gene expression in patients compared with controls demonstrating an impairment in type I and II IFN responses.

381168,How can we reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on timely access to liver transplantation in children?,2021,"This article explores the territorial differences in the onset and spread of COVID-19 and the excess mortality associated with the pandemic, across the European NUTS3 regions and US counties. Both in Europe and in the US, the pandemic arrived earlier and recorded higher Rt values in urban regions than in intermediate and rural ones. A similar gap is also found in the data on excess mortality. In the weeks during the first phase of the pandemic, urban regions in EU countries experienced excess mortality of up to 68pp more than rural ones. We show that, during the initial days of the pandemic, territorial differences in Rt by the degree of urbanisation can be largely explained by the level of internal, inbound and outbound mobility. The differences in the spread of COVID-19 by rural-urban typology and the role of mobility are less clear during the second wave. This could be linked to the fact that the infection is widespread across territories, to changes in mobility patterns during the summer period as well as to the different containment measures which reverse the causality between mobility and Rt.","Natale, Fabrizio; Iacus, Stefano Maria; Conte, Alessandra; Spyratos, Spyridon; Sermi, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08321v1.pdf,285

METHODS: A retrospective study at a tertiary paediatric centre. Admitted individuals who had prior attempts at ambulatory stabilisation were matched with intervention naïve controls who underwent outpatient intervention. The mean age was 14.6 years in the admitted group and 14.7 years in the ambulatory group. Mean duration of diabetes was 6.1 years in the admitted group and 7.3 years in the ambulatory group. Change in HbA1c from baseline was assessed to 12 months. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c was 11.3% (100 mmol/mol), with 11.4% in the admitted group and 11.2% in the ambulatory group. Sustained reduction in HbA1c at 12 months was seen in both groups (n = 35 in each): mean (standard deviation) 10.1% (1.5) in admitted (mean reduction in HbA1c 1.4%) and 9.7% (1.4) in ambulatory (mean reduction in HbA1c 1.5%). Proportions achieving delta HbA1c &#8805;2% (22 mmol/mol) at 12 months were 25 and 31% in admitted and ambulatory groups, respectively. A sustained reduction in HbA1c of &#8805;2% (22 mmol/mol) after 12 months was more likely in those who attained this reduction by 6 months (17/24 who achieved this at 6 months vs. 3/41 who had not). CONCLUSIONS: Both inpatient and outpatient stabilisation strategies achieved sustained improvements in HbA1c. We recommend an individualised approach to stabilisation, with review of the intervention's success at 6 months with further intensification as needed.","Atlas, Gabby; O039,; Connell, Michele A; White, Mary",J. paediatr. child health,,285
381397,Delivering healthcare at distance to cardiac patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiences from clinical practice,2020,"Research on visuomotor control suggests that visually guided actions toward objects rely on functionally distinct computations with respect to perception. For example, a double dissociation between grasping and between perceptual estimates was reported in previous experiments that pit real against illusory object size differences in the context of the Ponzo illusion. While most previous research on the relation between action and perception focused on one-handed grasping, everyday visuomotor interactions also entail the simultaneous use of both hands to grasp objects that are larger in size. Here, we examined whether this double dissociation extends to bimanual movement control. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with different-sized objects embedded in the Ponzo Illusion. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the dissociation between perception and action extends to a different illusion, the Wundt-Jastrow illusion, which has not been previously used in grasping experiments. In both experiments, bimanual grasping trajectories reflected the differences in physical size between the objects; At the same time, perceptual estimates reflected the differences in illusory size between the objects. These results suggest that the double dissociation between action and perception generalizes to bimanual movement control. Unlike conscious perception, bimanual grasping movements are tuned to real-world metrics, and can potentially resist irrelevant information on relative size and depth.","Ozana, Aviad; Ganel, Tzvi",Sci Rep,,285

Complementary approaches (electrophysiology, pH measurements, use of plasma membrane vesicles) suggest that it was less efficient than 2,4D to activate the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM-H+-ATPase). However, it modified the various ion-driven reactions of Mimosa pudica and Cassia fasciculata pulvini in a similar way as 2,4D. Additionally, it was much more effective than fusicoccin to inhibit seismonastic movements of M. pudica leaves and, at low concentrations, to promote leaflet opening in dark, indicating that its mode of action is more complex than the only activation of the PM-H+-ATPase. Various substitutions on 2,4D-L-Lys affected its activity in correlation with the molecular descriptor ""halogen ratio"" of these derivatives. Conjugation with D-Lys also led to a decrease of pulvinar reaction, suggesting that 2,4D-Lys maintains the main signaling properties of 2,4D involved in pulvinar movements providing that the terminal zwitterion is in a suitable orientation. Our data guide future investigations on the effect of 2,4D and 2,4D-L-Lys on the vacuolar pump activity of motor cells.","Roblin, Gabriel; Bonnemain, Jean-Louis; Chollet, Jean-François",Plant Physiol Biochem,,285
382115,The other side of COVID-19 pandemic: Effects on male fertility,2021,"Analysis of 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from early in the Boston area epidemic revealed numerous introductions of the virus, a small number of which led to most cases. The data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, while other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed significantly in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results show how genomic epidemiology can help understand the link between individual clusters and wider community spread.","Lemieux, Jacob E; Siddle, Katherine J; Shaw, Bennett M; Loreth, Christine; Schaffner, Stephen F; Gladden-Young, Adrianne; Adams, Gordon; Fink, Timelia; Tomkins-Tinch, Christopher H; Krasilnikova, Lydia A; DeRuff, Katherine C; Rudy, Melissa; Bauer, Matthew R; Lagerborg, Kim A; Normandin, Erica; Chapman, Sinéad B; Reilly, Steven K; Anahtar, Melis N; Lin, Aaron E; Carter, Amber; Myhrvold, Cameron; Kemball, Molly E; Chaluvadi, Sushma; Cusick, Caroline; Flowers, Katelyn; Neumann, Anna; Cerrato, Felecia; Farhat, Maha; Slater, Damien; Harris, Jason B; Branda, John A; Hooper, David; Gaeta, Jessie M; Baggett, Travis P; O039,; Connell, James; Gnirke, Andreas; Lieberman, Tami D; Philippakis, Anthony; Burns, Meagan; Brown, Catherine M; Luban, Jeremy; Ryan, Edward T; Turbett, Sarah E; LaRocque, Regina C; Hanage, William P; Gallagher, Glen R; Madoff, Lawrence C; Smole, Sandra; Pierce, Virginia M; Rosenberg, Eric",Science (Wash.),,285

We describe an interprofessional, student-run vaccine outreach program (VOP) in Davidson County, Tennessee that lowers barriers to vaccination through free vaccination events in nontraditional community locations. We provide this framework as a model to expand novel, seasonal, or outbreak-oriented vaccine outreach to resource-poor populations. Demographic data were collected from the patients who received an influenza vaccine between 2015 and 2019 through an optional survey to determine whether these events were reaching unhoused, uninsured, and/or unemployed individuals. Of 1,803 patients, 1,733 (96.1%) completed at least one field of the demographic form. Overall, 481 (27.8%) were individuals without homes or living in temporary housing and 673 (38.8%) were unemployed. Most patients, 1,109 (64.0%), did not have health insurance at any point during the prior two years. With the addition of a nurse practitioner student to VOP leadership, the 2018-2019 VOP reached the most unhoused or temporarily-housed (228, 32.3%), unemployed (313, 18.5%), and disabled (60, 8.5%) patients. The VOP can be adapted to meet community needs, funding, and volunteer interest. The VOP model may be applicable to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, especially since the economic impact of COVID-19 has increased unemployment rates and housing instability. Healthcare students serve as an eager, underutilized resource who can be leveraged to disseminate vaccines to individuals with limited access to care.","Brown, Sarah H; Fisher, Emilie L; Taylor, Alexandra Q; Neuzil, Kevin E; Trump, Samuel W; Sack, Daniel E; Fricker, Gregory P; Miller, Robert F",Prev Med,,285

Crowded regions with actively moving people (called at-risk regions) are susceptible to spreading the disease, especially if they contain asymptomatic infected people together with healthy people. Methods: Our scheme identifies at-risk regions using existing cellular network functionalities— handover and cell (re)selection—used to maintain seamless coverage for mobile end-user equipment (UE) . The frequency of handover and cell (re)selection events is highly reflective of the density of mobile people in the area because virtually everyone carries UEs. Results: These measurements, which are accumulated over very many UEs, allow us to identify the at-risk regions without compromising the privacy and anonymity of individuals. Conclusions: The inferred at-risk regions can then be subjected to further monitoring and risk mitigation.","Alsaeedy, Alaa A. R.; Chong, Edwin K.

384631,Six Lessons for COVID-19 Rehabilitation From HIV Rehabilitation,2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in March a pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This new infectious disease was named Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), and at October 2020, more than 39,000,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected worldwide leading to near 1,100,000 deaths. Clinically, COVID-19 is characterized by clinical manifestations, such as fever, dry cough, headache, and in more severe cases, respiratory distress. Moreover, neurological-, cardiac-, and renal-related symptoms have also been described. Clinical evidence suggests that migration of immune cells to the affected organs can produce an exacerbated release of proinflammatory mediators that contribute to disease and render the immune response as a major player during the development of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the current sanitary situation, the development of vaccines is imperative. Up to the date, 42 prototypes are being tested in humans in different clinical stages, with 10 vaccine candidates undergoing evaluation in phase III clinical trials. In the same way, the search for an effective treatment to approach the most severe cases is also in constant advancement. Several potential therapies have been tested since COVID-19 was described, including antivirals, antiparasitic and immune modulators. Recently, clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine-a promising drug in the beginning-were suspended. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved convalescent serum administration as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, monoclonal antibody therapy is also under development to neutralize the virus and prevent infection. In this article, we describe the clinical manifestations and the immunological information available about COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss current therapies under study and the development of vaccines to prevent this disease.","Canedo-Marroquín, Gisela; Saavedra, Farides; Andrade, Catalina A; Berrios, Roslye V; Rodríguez-Guilarte, Linmar; Opazo, María C; Riedel, Claudia A; Kalergis, Alexis M",Front Immunol,,285

Two datasets for the SARS-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, the correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures was established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, a cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in SARS -CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Given the inverse relationship of the specific DEG pathways highlighted in our results, BCG-vaccine may incur a protective role against COVID-19 by mounting a non-specific immunological response and further investigation of this relationship is warranted.

386512,COVID-19 testing strategy in response to infection among healthcare workers in a large non-COVID-designated hospital,2020,"In late 2019, a human coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA-approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available, and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of the highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics, as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins and the viral life cycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we report a new assay to identify inhibitors of 3CLpro Our reporter is based on a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-derived protein that fluoresces only after cleavage by 3CLpro This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level 2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 700,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level 2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Froggatt, Heather M; Heaton, Brook E; Heaton, Nicholas S",J. virol,,285

386754,COVID-19 Diary From a Psychiatry Department in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in 2019 and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 µM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 µM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.","Yao, Xueting; Ye, Fei; Zhang, Miao; Cui, Cheng; Huang, Baoying; Niu, Peihua; Liu, Xu; Zhao, Li; Dong, Erdan; Song, Chunli; Zhan, Siyan; Lu, Roujian; Li, Haiyan; Tan, Wenjie; Liu, Dongyang",Clin Infect Dis,,285

A number of recent papers have focused on the behaviour and estimation of extreme expectile-based risk measures and their potential for risk management. Joint inference of several extreme expectiles has however been left untouched; in fact, even the inference of a marginal extreme expectile turns out to be a difficult problem in finite samples. We investigate the simultaneous estimation of several extreme marginal expectiles of a random vector with heavy-tailed marginal distributions. This is done in a general extremal dependence model where the emphasis is on pairwise dependence between the margins.

Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.

Impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgery resident training and education,2020,"Together, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma account for the most common non-infectious respiratory pathologies. Conflicting preliminary studies have shown varied effect for COPD and asthma as prognostic factors for mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to explore the association of COPD and asthma with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 by systematically reviewing and synthesizing with a meta-analysis the available observational studies. MEDLINE, Scopus, and medRxiv databases were reviewed. A random-effects model meta-analysis was used, and I-square was utilized to assess for heterogeneity. In-hospital mortality was defined as the primary endpoint. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed. Thirty studies with 21,309 patients were included in this meta-analysis (1465 with COPD and 633 with asthma). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with COPD had higher risk of death compared to those without COPD (OR: 2.29;95% CI: 1.79–2.93;I2 59.6%). No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was seen in patients with and without asthma (OR: 0.87;95% CI: 0.68–1.10;I2 0.0%). The likelihood of death was significantly higher in patients with COPD that were hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to patients without COPD. Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not. No significant difference was demonstrated in COVID-19-related mortality between patients with and without asthma.","Reyes, Felix M.; Hache-Marliere, Manuel Karamanis Dimitris Berto Cesar G.; Estrada, Rodolfo Langston Matthew Ntaios George Gulani Perminder Shah Chirag D.; Palaiodimos, Leonidas",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,285
394296,Diagnosing COVID-19: Did We Miss Anything?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment has gained interest worldwide. However, there is lack of evidence on its dosing, safety and effectiveness. Until data from clinical studies are available to provide solid evidence for worldwide applicable guidelines, there is a need to provide guidance to the transfusion community and researchers on this emergent therapeutic option. This paper aims to identify existing key gaps in current knowledge in the clinical application of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) initiated a multidisciplinary working group with worldwide representation from all six continents with the aim of reviewing existing practices on CCP use from donor, product and patient perspectives. A subgroup of clinical transfusion professionals was formed to draft a document for CCP clinical application to identify the gaps in knowledge in existing literature. RESULTS: Gaps in knowledge were identified in the following main domains: study design, patient eligibility, CCP dose, frequency and timing of CCP administration, parameters to assess response to CCP treatment and long-term outcome, adverse events and CCP application in less-resourced countries as well as in paediatrics and neonates. CONCLUSION: This paper outlines a framework of gaps in the knowledge of clinical deployment of CPP that were identified as being most relevant. Studies to address the identified gaps are required to provide better evidence on the effectiveness and safety of CCP use.","Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Schäfer, Richard; van den Berg, Karin; Bloch, Evan M; Estcourt, Lise J; Goel, Ruchika; Hindawi, Salwa; Josephson, Cassandra D; Land, Kevin; McQuilten, Zoe K; Spitalnik, Steven L; Wood, Erica M; Devine, Dana V; So-Osman, Cynthia",Vox sang,,285

395179,COVID-19: Effect on patients with gastrointestinal cancer and surgery,2020,"Many medical schools have transitioned to teaching anatomy with prosections and models1. The efficacy of these curricular approaches as they compare to the gold standard of dissection anatomy has been evaluated2. In addition to helping students acquire professional competencies3, students who participate in dissection achieve higher scores on written examinations than students who participate in prosection1,4. Dissection helps students develop integrated three-dimensional models of the human body, which is fundamental to clinical practice2. In a typical year, medical students at our university take Clinical Morphology which includes histology, embryology, imaging, and dissection anatomy. In 2020, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory access was significantly restricted, requiring a shift to a prosection and virtual learning hybrid model. All other components of the course were retained. This necessary change in curriculum provided a natural experiment to investigate the impact of eliminating dissection anatomy on students? academic performance. We hypothesized a negative impact. Students in the 2020 cohort worked in small groups to complete a weekly two-hour online simulated dissection, and attended an optional weekly in-person prosection lab. Faculty-produced prosection videos were available to view asynchronously. Virtual office hours were held in the laboratory. In contrast, the 2019 cohort participated in a traditional dissection anatomy lab that included six hours of instructor-supported dissection each week and 24-hour lab access. All other course components were comparable. Respectively, for the 2020 and 2019 cohorts, mean quiz scores were 86.2 and 85.6;lab practical averages were 92.5 and 86.3;mean NBME scores were 80.9 and 82.2;and course numeric score means were 84.7 and 84.8 (no significant differences, t-test). The frequency of passing and failing scores followed a similar pattern with no differences identified between the two cohorts (Chi Square). All 2020 students had a passing average for lab practicals;significantly better than the 2019 cohort (p &lt; 0.05, Chi Square). Pairwise Pearson r correlation coefficients showed a strong relationship (r &gt; 0.75) for quiz, NBME, and lab practical scores in the 2019 cohort. For the 2020 cohort, there was a strong relationship (r = 0.72) only for quiz and NBME scores. Dissection anatomy correlates strongly with quizzes and the NBME exam performance, while virtual-prosection anatomy does not. The lack of strong pairwise correlations between virtual anatomy with either NBME or quiz performance suggest that the virtual-prosection model did not align well with academic objectives. These data support the continued inclusion of dissection in medical school anatomy. 1. Eppler E, Serowy S, Link K, Filgueira L. Anat Sci Educ. 2018;11:32-43. doi:10.1002/ase.1707 2.

METHODS: Participants (n = 866,192; BMI 33.6 [SD 7.4] kg/m2 ) who joined a digital weight management program (WW) in the first 30 weeks of 2020 (COVID-19 cohort) were compared with participants (n = 624,043; BMI 33.1 [SD 7.2] kg/m2 ) who joined the same program during the same time period in 2019 (control cohort). Weight change (percentage) and self-monitoring over the first 4 weeks of enrollment were compared between the cohorts. Significance was defined as meeting the criteria for a small effect (d &#8805; 0.2). RESULTS: Over the 30-week enrollment period, the COVID-19 cohort experienced significantly less weight loss than the control cohort but only for 7 weeks of enrollments. The COVID-19 cohort also had fewer days of food tracking but only for 3 weeks of enrollments. There were no differences in the self-monitoring of weight and activity at any time between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Over a 30-week enrollment period, COVID-19 had negative effects on both weight loss and food self-monitoring, but the effects were short-lived. Those participating in evidence-based weight management programs can expect similar levels of initial weight loss as those experienced before the pandemic.","Bullard, Tiffany; Medcalf, Adam; Rethorst, Chad; Foster, Gary D",Obesity (Silver Spring),,285

397524,"Pediatric ophthalmology, strabismus and neuro-ophthalmology practice in the COVID-19 era: All India Ophthalmological Society guidelines",2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected millions across the world. Significant patient surges have caused severe resource allocation challenges in personal protective equipment, medications, and staffing. The virus produces bilateral lung infiltrates causing significant oxygen depletion and respiratory failure thus increasing the need for ventilators. The patients who require ventilation are often requiring prolonged ventilation and depleting hospital resources. Tracheostomy is often utilized in patients requiring prolonged ventilation, and early tracheostomy in critical care patients has been shown in some studies to improve a variety of factors including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilation weaning, and decreased sedation medication utilization. In a patient surge setting, as long as adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is available to minimize spread to healthcare workers, early tracheostomy may be a beneficial management of these patients. Decreasing sedative medication utilization may help prevent shortages in future waves of infection and improve patient-provider communication as patients are more alert. Tracheostomy care is easier than endotracheal intubation and may have decreased viral aerosolization risk, particularly if repeat intubation is necessary after a weaning trial. Additionally, tracheostomy patients can be monitored with less staff, decreasing total healthcare worker exposure to infection. To manage risk of exposure, coordination of ventilation controlled by an anesthesiologist or a critical care physician with a surgeon during the procedure can minimize aerosolization to the team. Risk management and resource allocation is of the utmost importance in any global crisis and procedures must be appropriately planned and benefits to patients, as well as minimized exposure to healthcare providers, must be considered. Early tracheostomy could be a beneficial procedure for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients to minimize long-term virus aerosolization and exposure for healthcare workers while decreasing sedation, allowing for earlier transfer out of the ICU, and improving hospital resource utilization.","Sier, Rachel S; Onugha, Osita I",Surg. technol. int.

397562,COVID-19 and neurocognitive disorders,2021,"On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan (Hubei Province of China). In January 2020, a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 was isolated and, since that time, SARS-CoV2 related disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread all over the world becoming pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak dramatically affected the public-health and the health-care facilities organization. Bilio-pancreatic endoscopy is considered a high-risk procedure for cross-contamination and, even though it is not directly involved in COVID-19 diagnosis and management, its reorganization is crucial to guarantee high standards of care minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV2 transmission among patients and health-care providers. Bilio-pancreatic endoscopic procedures often require a short physical distance between the endoscopist and the patient for a long period of time, a frequent exchange of devices, the involvement of a large number of personnel, the use of complex endoscopes difficult to reprocess. On this basis, endoscopic units should take precautions with adjusted management of bilio-pancreatic endoscopy. The aim of this article is to discuss the approach to bilio-pancreatic endoscopy in the COVID-19 era with focus on diagnostic algorithms, indications, management of the endoscopic room, proper use of Personal Protective Equipment and correct reprocessing of instrumentation.","Bove, Vincenzo; Schepis, Tommaso; Boškoski, Ivo; Landi, Rosario; Orlandini, Beatrice; Pontecorvi, Valerio; Familiari, Pietro; Tringali, Andrea; Perri, Vincenzo; Costamagna, Guido",Ther.

398683,Home delivery of the communicator for remote monitoring of cardiac implantable devices: A multicenter experience during the covid-19 lockdown,2021,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is arranged as a trimer on the virus surface, composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits. Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The variation between infected individuals in domain specificity of the antibodies and in their relative neutralization efficacy is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples from 85 COVID-19 convalescent subjects using 7 immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. We observed strong correlations between the levels of NTD- and RBD-specific antibodies, with a fixed ratio of each type to all anti-spike antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects, and was not associated with the overall amount of anti-spike antibodies produced. Accordingly, the ability of immunoassays that use RBD, NTD and different forms of S1 or S1/S2 as capture antigens to estimate the neutralizing efficacy of convalescent samples was largely similar. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency. IMPORTANCEInfection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD, NTD and S2. Different infected individuals generate vastly different amounts of anti-spike antibodies. By contrast, as we show here, there is a remarkable similarity in the properties of the antibodies produced. Different individuals generate the same proportions of antibodies against each domain of the spike protein. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of anti-spike antibodies produced and their neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved. Therefore, the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or relative antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.","Ert, Hanora A Van; Bohan, Dana W; Rogers, Kai J; Fili, Mohammad; Chavez, Anthony Roberth Rojas; Qing, Enya; Han, Changze; Dempewolf, Spencer M; Hu, Guiping; Schwery, Nathan; Sevcik, Kristina M; Ruggio, Natalie; Boyt, Devlin; Pentella, Michael; Gallagher, Tom; Jackson, J Brooks; Merrill, Anna E.; Knudson, C Michael; Brown, Grant; Maury, Wendy; Haim, Hillel",,,285

401365,High-fidelity simulation training with PPE may optimise resuscitation outcomes in the COVID-19 era,2021,"Innovation systems are increasingly oriented towards the solution of societal and environmental problems. Social entrepreneurship can be regarded as a market-based actor, inherently aimed at finding solutions for these problems. The development of technologically advanced social entrepreneurship represents an outcome of problem-oriented innovation systems, requiring a closer link between social and technological innovation. Nonetheless, the literature has not yet explored a key element of these innovation systems: the technology transfer processes, which may enable social entrepreneurial organizations to act as innovation actors leveraging on technology. This paper investigates the relationship between the technology transfer processes targeting social entrepreneurship and different models of problem-oriented innovation ecosystems. The paper relies on a multiple-case-study design, including two problem-oriented innovation ecosystems in the Italian context, namely, MIND and Torino Social Impact, which are technology transfer projects designed to target social entrepreneurship. Drawing from content analysis of interviews, documents and direct observations, the results stress that the different objectives and contents of technology transfer, coupled with different perceptions of the idiosyncratic features of social entrepreneurship compared to commercial entrepreneurship, fit different ecosystem models in terms of the participating actors, governance and primary orientation to social or economic value generation.","Chiodo, Veronica Bengo Irene",Sustainability,,285

Few countries have systematically investigated ethnic variations in infection. METHODS: We linked the Scotland 2001 Census, including ethnic group, to national databases of hospitalizations/deaths and serological diagnoses of bloodborne viruses for 2001-2013. We calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) in 12 ethnic groups for all infections combined, 15 infection categories, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. RESULTS: We analysed over 1.65 million infection-related hospitalisations/deaths. Compared with White Scottish, RRs for all infections combined were 0.8 or lower for Other White British, Other White and Chinese males and females, and 1.2-1.4 for Pakistani and African males and females. Adjustment for socioeconomic status or birthplace had little effect. RRs for specific infection categories followed similar patterns with striking exceptions. For HIV, RRs were 136 in African females and 14 in males; for HBV, 125 in Chinese females and 59 in males, 55 in African females and 24 in males; and for HCV, 2.3-3.1 in Pakistanis and Africans.

401663,Informed consent and a risk-based approach to oncologic surgery in a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Histopathology of most cases in the acute phase showed reddish-grey discolouration of the brainstem grey matter with lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding vessels and diffuse inflammation with haemorrhage 1 In the chronic phase, persistent inflammation was evident with generalised brain atrophy and degeneration of the substantia nigra 1 The aetiology remains unproven, and it is not clear whether all the cases in the literature truly represent a single disease 5 The prevailing contemporary hypothesis was that proposed by von Economo himself—that the disease was owing to an infectious agent, although he observed that cases appeared to predate the emergence of the 1918 influenza pandemic 2 5 von Economo’s view that the disease was the result of direct viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has now been largely superseded by the proposition that the disease reflected a para/post-infectious inflammatory process 5 Although evidence for this is lacking, it fits neatly with the modern view of other neurological syndromes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antibody encephalitis, the latter of which may be triggered by herpes simplex virus in some 6 7 Indeed, NMDA-R antibodies were present in serum (and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when available for study) in around 50% of 20 children with dyskinetic ‘encephalitis lethargica’ (collected over many years),8 and antibodies to the dopamine receptor in a proportion of the remaining more akinetic cases Many of the clinical features overlap, although encephalitis lethargica is more heterogeneous in both its acute symptoms and its natural history 2 A para/postinfectious pathogenesis, rather than direct viral infection, is in keeping with the observations that single members of families were often affected, which puzzled epidemiologists at the time;and that an infectious agent was not readily detected in CSF or brain tissue 2 It is possible that encephalitis lethargica represented a final common pathway of brain inflammation potentially triggered by several different infectious agents, although were this the case the reasons for the disease’s decline remain obscure A young patient had been admitted in April 1918 with self-inflicted laceration across the neck, preceded by headache and sleeplessness for 2 weeks 10 Six months after the initial presentation, they developed neck and back pain with reduced mobility, 2 months later developing expressive aphasia with retained comprehension, and death occurred less than a month later 10 The postmortem results describe a widespread meningoencephalomyelitis with vascular proliferation, perivascular inflammation, thrombosis, haemorrhage and destruction of nervous tissue 10 A subsequent case series collated by Sir Thomas Horder, also published in 1920, comprises 25 cases described by several neurologists from Bristol, and is notable for detailed and varied descriptions of cases of encephalitis lethargica in patients of all ages 11 Their dilemmas trying to unify these disparate clinical presentations are clearly evident The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with complications of the nervous system in up to 4% of those diagnosed with H1N1 influenza infection and most commonly included altered mental status, seizures, narcolepsy and encephalopathy, particularly in children 16–18 Several seemingly pathognomic encephalopathy syndromes have emerged, including acute necrotising encephalopathy with bilateral thalamic involvement 16–18 The virus is rarely identified by molecular tests of the CSF in these patients, and it has been suggested that the mechanism for the complications may be a parainfectious cytokine storm 18 Coronaviruses The severe CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS, have been associated with limited reports of both central and peripheral nervous system disease, including ADEM 19 Sporadic, seasonal CoV have also occasionally been implicated in neurological disease 20 COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the most devastating respiratory pandemic since the influenza pandemics of 1918 (‘Spanish flu’;H1N1), 1957 (‘Asian flu’;H2N2) and 1968 (‘Hong Kong flu’;H3N2) 21 Reports of neurological syndromes associated with SARS-CoV2 are frequent, initially reported where the virus began in Wuhan,22 and continued in case reports and series from across the world 21 23 24 A UK-wide surveillance study identified 153 cases with CNS disorders reflecting cerebrovascular events, altered mental status including 7 patients with encephalitis, and a surprising number of psychiatric syndromes, such as psychosis and catatonia 21 It is currently unclear how many cases are causally related to SARS-CoV-2 and in what proportion this is a coincidental infection 23 It is becoming apparent that dysfunction of the clotting cascade, together with possible endotheliopathy, is in some cases associated with cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 21 23 24 The number of patients with encephalopathy is also striking, and in a few cases the virus has been detected in CSF 21 25 Many cases of GBS and its variants are also emerging 26 Conclusion The historical papers of

401726,Lessons and strategies from an orthopaedic unit at the epicenter of COVID-19 in Singapore,2020,"Defensive medicine is a practice that has been utilized by clinicians in efforts of preventing patient dissatisfaction and malpractice claims and may be done through either omission or commission. As much as 57% of physicians have disclosed that they practice defensive medicine. However, this practice does not necessarily prevent malpractice claims and more importantly, neither does it equate to good medical practice, with some leading to poor outcomes. Unfortunately, there is a high percentage of malpractice claims lodged against clinicians in both primary care and hospital settings. Specialists such as surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists face the highest claims. In particular, during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, with new challenges and limited treatment algorithms, there is an even greater concern for possible bourgeoning claims. Counteracting defensive medicine can be accomplished through decriminalizing malpractice claims, leaving physician oversight up to state medical boards and hospital claims management committees. Additional tort reform measures must also be taken such as caps on noneconomic damages to ensure emphasis on beneficence and nonmaleficence. Once these are in place, it may well serve to increase clinician-patient trust and improve patient independence in the shared decision-making process of their treatment, allowing clinicians to practice their full scope of practice without feeling wary of potential malpractice claims.","Williams, Preston L; Williams, Joanna P; Williams, Bryce R",J Forensic Leg Med,,285

402292,Challenges of non-COVID-19 patients with chronic illness during the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. METHODS: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines.","Alhazzani, Waleed; Møller, Morten Hylander; Arabi, Yaseen M; Loeb, Mark; Gong, Michelle Ng; Fan, Eddy; Oczkowski, Simon; Levy, Mitchell M; Derde, Lennie; Dzierba, Amy; Du, Bin; Aboodi, Michael; Wunsch, Hannah; Cecconi, Maurizio; Koh, Younsuck; Chertow, Daniel S; Maitland, Kathryn; Alshamsi, Fayez; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Greco, Massimiliano; Laundy, Matthew; Morgan, Jill S; Kesecioglu, Jozef; McGeer, Allison; Mermel, Leonard; Mammen, Manoj J; Alexander, Paul E; Arrington, Amy; Centofanti, John E; Citerio, Giuseppe; Baw, Bandar; Memish, Ziad A; Hammond, Naomi; Hayden, Frederick G; Evans, Laura; Rhodes, Andrew",Crit Care Med,,285

402403,COVID-19 and Refractive Errors: A New Potential Threat for Children and Adolescents,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic required reevaluation of the therapeutic approach and added emotional stress for patients with hematological malignancies at high risk of contracting the virus. We aimed to evaluate how it affected such patients during the second lockdown in Israel. METHODS: This national survey included Hebrew-speaking patients with hematological malignancy. This included three tools with 28 items of sociodemographic and medical baseline characteristics, management of hematological disease, and evaluation of emotional coping during COVID-19 pandemic; the Hebrew version of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9; and 3 qualitative open-ended questions. Data was analyzed by mixed methods which combined both quantitative and qualitative thematic analyses. RESULTS: Four hundred eight patients responded to the survey. The management of their hematological disease included a decrease in the number of visits to the hematology clinic (37.0%), delay of some treatment schedules (9.1%), and prescription of replacement therapies permitting less visits to the clinic (2.2%). The frequency and intensity of ""feeling afraid"" regarding COVID-19 infection was increased (mean ± SD: 4 ± 1 to 5 ± 2 in a 1-7 Likert scale), and a high rate of depression was recorded, which appeared to be more evident in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The management of hematological malignancies during pandemics should always take into consideration patients' fears, as well as the development of depression related to isolation and loneliness, in addition to the high risk of severe disease. Patients with CML had a high rate of depression which obviously needs to be managed very carefully during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Levy, Ilana; Sharf, Giora; Norman, Shlomit; Tadmor, Tamar",Support. care cancer,,285

Behavior analysts can use telehealth, such as videoconferencing technology, to deliver interventions to families of these children. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the common barriers to accessing behavioral interventions, it is imperative to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of delivering behavioral interventions via telehealth. This study evaluated the efficacy of a parent-implemented intervention with coaching via telehealth to improve daily living skills. Children ranging in age from 5 to 9 years participated in the study with 1 or 2 of their parents serving as the primary implementer(s). Parents implemented the intervention with fidelity and the intervention yielded increases in independent daily living skill completion for all 4 participants.","Gerow, Stephanie; Radhakrishnan, Supriya; S Akers, Jessica; McGinnis, Kristina; Swensson, Remington",J. appl. behav. anal,,285

It was enforced in four phases (i.e., MCO 1, MCO 2, MCO 3 and MCO 4). In this paper, we propose an initiative to assess the impact of MCO by using time-varying reproduction number (Rt). We used data from the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus repository. Day 1 was taken from the first assumed local transmission of COVID-19. We estimated Rt by using the EpiEstim package and plotted the epidemic curve and Rt. Then, we extracted the mean Rt at day 1, day 5 and day 10 for all MCO phases and compared the differences. The Rt values peaked around day 43, which was shortly before the start of MCO 1. The means for Rt at day 1, day 5, and day 10 for all MCOs ranged between 0.665 and 1.147. The average Rt gradually decreased in MCO 1 and MCO 2. Although spikes in the number of confirmed cases were observed when restrictions were gradually relaxed in the later MCO phases, the situation remained under control with Rt values being stabilised to below unity level (Rt value less than one).","Musa, Kamarul Imran; Arifin, Wan Nor; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Jamiluddin, Mohammad Subhi; Ahmad, Noor Atinah; Chen, Xin Wee; Hanis, Tengku Muhammad; Bulgiba, Awang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,285

Gynecology is a specialty department with a large number of critical and severe patients. Consequently, it is of preeminent importance to formulate the in-patient management process. Rearranging the gynecological wards and managing ward partition, as well as the medical protection measures in specialized areas, are suitable for the current prevention and control for COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic requirements of patients. To effectively minimize nosocomial infections during the COVID- 19 pandemic period, our department implemented a novel prevention strategy based on the ward redesign and partition management. With this model, our department effectively protected the safety and health of patients and medical care staff from cross and nosocomial infection in the hospital.

403280,Assessing Environmental Factors within the One Health Approach,2021,"The variety and widespread of coronavirus in natural reservoir animals is likely to cause epidemics via interspecific transmission, which has attracted much attention due to frequent coronavirus epidemics in recent decades. Birds are natural reservoir of various viruses, but the existence of coronaviruses in wild birds in central China has been barely studied. Some bird coronaviruses belongs to the genus of Deltacoronavirus. To explore the diversity of bird deltacoronaviruses in central China, we tested fecal samples from 415 wild birds in Hunan Province, China. By RT-PCR detection, we identified eight samples positive for deltacoronaviruses which were all from common magpies, and in four of them, we successfully amplified complete deltacoronavirus genomes distinct from currently known deltacoronavirus, indicating four novel deltacoronavirus stains (HNU1-1, HNU1-2, HNU2 and HNU3) . Comparative analysis on the four genomic sequences showed that these novel magpie deltacoronaviruses shared three different S genes among which the S genes of HNU1-1 and HNU1-2 showed 93.8% amino acid (aa) identity to that of thrush coronavirus HKU12, HNU2 S showed 71.9% aa identity to that of White-eye coronavirus HKU16, and HKU3 S showed 72.4% aa identity to that of sparrow coronavirus HKU17. Recombination analysis showed that frequent recombination events of the S genes occurred among these deltacoronavirus strains. Two novel putative cleavage sites separating the nonstructural proteins in the HNU coronaviruses were found. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showed that the south coast of China might be a potential origin of bird deltacoronaviruses existing in inland China. In summary, these results suggest that common magpie in China carries diverse deltacoronaviruses with novel genomic features, indicating an important source of environmental coronaviruses closed to human communities, which may provide key information for prevention and control of future coronavirus epidemics.","Wang, Qiong; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; You, Zhi; Wu, Deng-Yu; Liu, Shu-Jing; Zhang, Wan-Lin; Fan, Ke-Rui; Luo, Rui; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We assessed the association of a validated MEDLIFE index with metabolic syndrome and its components in a non-Mediterranean working population. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at baseline among 249 US career firefighters in Feeding America's Bravest 2016-2018. The MEDLIFE index consisted of 26 items on food consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, rest, and social interactions that scored 0 or 1 point. Thus, total scores could range from 0 to 26 points. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the associations across tertiles of MEDLIFE adherence with metabolic syndrome and each of its individual components. Multivariable linear models further assessed each component as a continuous outcome. RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 17.7%. Participants with higher MEDLIFE adherence (T3: 11-17 points) had 71% lower odds of having metabolic syndrome compared to those with lower MEDLIFE adherence (T1: 2-7 points) (OR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.10 to 0.90, p for trend = 0.04). Furthermore, significant inverse associations were found for T3 versus T1 on abdominal obesity (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.99, p for trend = 0.07) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.24; 95%CI: 0.09 to 0.63, p for trend = 0.002). Significant inverse associations for continuous outcomes included total-cholesterol (total-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total-c:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p for trend <0.05). CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to traditional Mediterranean lifestyle habits, as measured by a comprehensive MEDLIFE index, was associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and a more favorable cardiometabolic profile in a non-Mediterranean working population. Future studies employing the MEDLIFE index in other populations are warranted to support this hypothesis.","Hershey, Maria S; Sotos-Prieto, Mercedes; Ruiz-Canela, Miguel; Christophi, Costas A; Moffatt, Steven; Martínez-González, Miguel Ángel; Kales, Stefanos N",Clin Nutr,,285

The WHO has accepted COVID-19 as a pandemic disease. The outbreak of COVID-19 has gained ground in many countries, leading towards a global health emergency. Increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak leading to total ""lockdown"" of many countries directly affecting urban economies on a multi-lateral level.. This is a perspective paper, written from a classical engineering point of view only four months after detecting the COVID-19 pandemic. All known studies for COVID-19 are done based on statistical models. These statistical approaches depend solely on correlation factors. The factor of causality has not been considered due to the luck of sufficient mathematical models based on causality. Correlation does not imply causality while causality always implies correlation. The approach of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) that is considering the causality factors is proposed, for the first time, to investigate the whole spectrum of COVID-19. An FCM model is proposed and referred as the classical FCM methods. Early theoretical simulation studies using a COVID-19 FCM are very promising. Simulations were performed and results were compared with the classical FCM approach. Useful conclusions and future research directions are provided.","Groumpos, P.

OBJECTIVES: Assess the effect of glycemic control on BMA;correlate the parameters of BH with BMA and correlate BMA with the use of hypoglycemic agents and with BMD. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated 26 premenopausal women with T2DM were divided into groups with HbA1c<7% (GC,n=10) and HbA1c>7% (PC,n=16).BMA parameters (Ad.N, Ad.Pm, Ad.Ar, Ad.V/Ma.V and peri-trabecular adipocyte number (Ad.N/BS) were evaluated.BH static(BV/TV, O.Th, OS/BS) and dynamic parameters and serum IGF-1 were measured.BMA data were compared between the GC vs PC groups. Correlations were performed. RESULTS: Ad.N, Ad.Pm and Ad.Ar were higher in PC(all, p=0.04). HbA1c correlated positively with Ad.N/BS(p< 0.01) and Ad.N/BS correlated negatively with O.Th(p<0.01) and OS/BS(p=0.02). Positive and negative correlations were observed between insulin and metformin use, respectively, with all adipocyte parameters except Ad.N/BS(p<0.05). Structural parameters were negatively correlated with the BMA. BMD of the femoral neck(r = -549, p<0.01) and total femur(r=-0.502, p<0.01) were negatively correlated with Ad.V/Ma.V. CONCLUSION: Poor glycemic control is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of BMAs and with lower BVTV. Ad,N/BS, a new BMA parameter, is correlated with HbA1c and negatively with O.Th. The use of insulin seems to stimulate the expansion of BMA while that of metformin has the opposite effect. These findings suggest that the increase in BMA may play a role in the T2DM bone disease, on the other hand, good glycemic control might help prevent it.","Andrade, Vicente F C; Besen, Débora; Chula, Domingos C; Borba, Victória Z C; Dempster, David; Moreira, Carolina Aguiar",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,285

Lockdown could be a factor in the emergence or deterioration of psychological disorders; it can be even more fragilizing during the specific period of adolescence. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ (Teenagers' Houses) had to urgently adjust their practices to provide continuity of care for adolescents suffering from physical or mental disorders. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ are pluridisciplinary care centres for adolescents and their families that provide assessments and services for medical, psychological, socio-educational, educational and legal needs. How did care continue for adolescents during lockdown? What adjustments occurred in the « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ during the health crisis? METHODS: This article presents the case of an adolescent who suffered a significant deterioration of her anorexia nervosa during confinement. Through this case, we describe the reorganization of care within the different units (consultations - day hospital - hospitalization unit) of a Parisian « Maison des Adolescents ¼ during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In this service, the rapid implementation of the telemedicine system in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic made possible provision of continuity in care for vulnerable adolescents and families. Based on the existing literature, we discuss the advantages and limitations of telemedicine and the practical issues for the future organization of care for adolescents. PERSPECTIVES: In contrast to pediatric medicine or child psychiatry, there is no protocol describing the application of telemedicine in adolescent medicine and psychiatry. There is an urgent need for further evaluation of the use of telemedicine for this population. This kind of research will improve knowledge about the effectiveness, acceptability and limitations of using a teleconsultation device in adolescent psychiatry in a crisis context. Certain remote care modalities implemented during the sanitary crisis could thus be maintained over time and become routine in the field of adolescent medicine and psychiatry.","Carretier, E; Guessoum, S B; Radjack, R; Mao, S-F; Minassian, S; Blanchet, C; Moro, M R; Lachal, J",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,,285

The binding strength and the binding range increases with glycosylation. The interaction energy rises very quickly with pulling the proteins apart and only slowly drops at larger distances. We see a catch slip type behavior where interactions during pulling break and are taken over by new interactions forming. The dominant interaction mode are hydrogen bonds but Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions are relevant as well. Statement of SignificanceGlycosylation of the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the ACE2 receptor leads to stronger and longer ranged binding interactions between the proteins.

A doença tem alta transmissibilidade e ocasiona sintomas leves a graves, gerando elevada demanda por cuidados intensivos e milhares de óbitos. Em março de 2020, a COVID-19 foi caracterizada como pandemia e já soma mais de 5 milhões de casos e 300 mil óbitos pelo mundo. A história natural da doença ainda não é bem estabelecida, dificultando a elaboração de protocolos clínicos eficazes e medidas de prevenção. Apesar disso, pode-se afirmar que é uma doença de abordagem sistêmica, já que há evidências de complicações agudas e crônicas, além de efeitos catastróficos na saúde mental da população. Destaca-se então a necessidade de uma metodologia que capte de forma mais efetiva os efeitos da COVID-19, considerando aspectos como sua gravidade, duração e potencial de gerar complicações crônicas que aumentarão as demandas no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). Nesse sentido, é de extrema utilidade o indicador DALY, ou anos de vida perdidos por morte prematura ajustados por incapacidade (DALY), que agrega a (1) mortalidade - estimativa dos anos de vida perdidos (YLL) e (2) morbidade - estimativa dos anos vividos com incapacidade (YLD). Este artigo discute a relevância e as dificuldades de estudar a carga da COVID-19 e de suas complicações, no contexto brasileiro, ressaltando a importância de caracterizar a história natural da doença e estimar indicadores como o YLD, que considerem a alta carga de morbidade no planejamento de estratégias para lidar com as consequências da COVID-19 pós-pandemia. Discute-se também os desafios futuros para o enfrentamento da doença no SUS e reflexões sobre o cálculo do DALY.","Campos, Mônica Rodrigues; Schramm, Joyce Mendes de Andrade; Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Rodrigues, Jéssica Muzy; Avelar, Fernando Genovez de; Pimentel, Thiago Goes",Cad.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. PubMed and ResearchGate databases and WHO reports were used. RESULTS: Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.","Reka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Piecewicz-Szczesna, Halina",Przegl Epidemiol,,285

Teledentistry can offer an innovative solution to resume dental practice during this pandemic. In this review, we provide a brief overview of applications of teledentistry. METHODS: Articles on teledentistry, relevant to this review, were searched and consulted from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database. RESULTS: Teledentistry is the remote facilitating of dental treatment, guidance, and education via the use of information technology instead of direct face-to-face contact with patients. Teleconsultation, telediagnosis, teletriage, and telemonitoring are subunits of teledentistry that have important functions relevant to dental practice. There are many challenges for acceptance of teledentistry by the dentists as well as patients, which need to be addressed urgently. CONCLUSION: Teledentistry can offer a novel solution to resume dental practice during the current pandemic, hence, the need of the hour is to incorporate teledentistry into routine dental practice. If not fully replace, at least teledentistry can complement the existing compromised dental system during the current pandemic.","Ghai, Suhani",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,285
417440,Immune-related (IR)-pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: multidisciplinary recommendations for diagnosis and management,2020,"Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) raised many questions needing answers in order to overcome the disease burden globally. Uncertainty about COVID-19 contributes to the complexity of the burden on the health, social, economic, and cultural influences of COVID-19. In this context, all related disciplines are working together to mitigate the negative influences of the disease. In particular, health promotion, a discipline of public health, matters to the pandemic as it may address the threats at different levels. Health promotion strategies mostly use solution-oriented efforts with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches. Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 burden has many time-critical determinants, these approaches cannot be sufficient to overcome the problem. A transdisciplinary approach in its broader sense using almost all inputs to synthesize and produce an integrative solution may be extremely helpful. In this paper, the importance of transdisciplinary approaches in health promotion to combat COVID-19 has been discussed.","Aslan, Dilek",Glob Health Promot,,285

However, the cleavage sites of 3CLpro and their relevant nsps remain unclear, which is the subject of this perspective. Here, we address the subject from three standpoints. First, we explore the inconsistency in the cleavage sites and relevant nsps across CoVs, and investigate the function of nsp11. Second, we consider the nsp16 mRNA overlapping of the spike protein mRNA, and analyze the effect of this overlapping on mRNA vaccines. Finally, we study nsp12, whose existence depends on ribosomal frameshifting, and investigate whether 3CLpro requires a large number of inhibitors to achieve full inhibition. This perspective helps us to clarify viral replication and is useful for developing anti-CoV drugs with 3CLpro as a target in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Yan, Shaomin; Wu, Guang",FASEB J,,285

418754,Commentary: Pediatric cataract management during the COVID-19 era,2021,"Nucleic acid detection techniques are always critical to diagnosis, especially in the background of the present coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited by traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome this limitation, here we developed CRISPR-Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, a DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture single guide RNAs (sgRNAs; sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa, and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. Finally, the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. In particular, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples was successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 min at RT. This detection holds promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing.","Xu, Xinhui; Luo, Tao; Gao, Jinliang; Lin, Na; Li, Weiwei; Xia, Xinyi; Wang, Jinke",CRISPR J,,285

Using high-throughput methods, we assessed herein the serological response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus of 1847 participants working in three sites of an institution in Paris conurbation. In May-July 2020, 11% (95% CI: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, and 9.5% (CI:8.2-11.0) were neutralizer in pseudo-typed virus assays. The prevalence of seroconversion was 11.6% (CI:10.2-13.2) when considering positivity in at least one assays. In 5% of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may have reached 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and neutralization activity in pseudo-virus assay declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, resulting thus in half-life of respectively 35, 87 and 28 days. The population studied is representative of active workers in Paris. The short lifespan of the serological systemic responses suggests an underestimation of the true prevalence of infection.

420001,Implementing Physical Distancing in the Hospital: A Key Strategy to Prevent Nosocomial Transmission of COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions of people, resulting in a huge socioeconomic cost and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Though the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, data have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has implicated the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the central nervous system are not completely known. Here, we review the literature on possible neuropathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced cerebral damage. The results suggest that downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with increased activity of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may result in upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and reactive species that trigger neuroinflammatory response and blood brain barrier disruption. Furthermore, dysregulation of hormone and neurotransmitter signalling may constitute a fundamental mechanism involved in the neuropathogenic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral RNA or antigenic peptides also activate or interact with molecular signalling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), nuclear factor kappa B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, complement cascades, and cell suicide molecules. Potential molecular targets and therapeutics of SARS-CoV-2 induced neurologic damage are also discussed.","Welcome, Menizibeya O; Mastorakis, Nikos E",Inflammopharmacology,,285

The revolution of surgical and interventional therapy of structural heart disease has had 'profoundly positive effects on survival and quality of life over the decades. ( ) Small increments in clinical improvement will still be possible in the future, but for the most part, the potential for major advancement using these techniques has been exhausted' (Frank Hanley, MD; Stanford). Personalized medicine, rapid genetic diagnostics, RNA and extracellular vesicle biology, epigenetics, gene editing, gene and stem cell-derived therapy are exemplary areas where specialized training for paediatric/congenital cardiology physician scientists will be increasingly needed to further advance the field. About a decade ago, a series in Circulation discussed academic career models and highlighted the major challenges facing the cardiovascular 'clinician scientist' (syn. physician scientist), which have not abated since. To develop the skills and expertise in both clinical congenital cardiology and basic research, the training of fellows must be focused and integrated. The current pandemic COVID-19 puts additional pressure and hurdles on fellows-in-training (FIT) and early career investigators (ECI) who aim to establish, consolidate or expand their own research group.

However, the fragmentation regioselectivity cannot be switched and fragmentation at the less-substituted terminus is so far not possible. We report here that the reaction of ketone enolates with commercial alkyl nitrites provides a direct and regioselective way of fragmenting ketones into esters and oximes or &#969;-hydroxyimino esters, respectively. A comprehensive study of the scope of this reaction with respect to ketone classes and alkyl nitrites is presented. Control over the site of cleavage is gained through regioselective enolate formation by various bases. Oxidation of kinetic enolates of unsymmetrical ketones leads to the otherwise unavailable ""anti-Beckmann"" cleavage at the less-substituted side chain, while cleavage of thermodynamic enolates of the same ketones represents an alternative to the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or the Beckmann rearrangement under basic conditions. The method is suited for the transformation of natural products and enables access to orthogonally reactive dicarbonyl compounds.","Masek, Tomás; Jahn, Ullrich",J. org. chem,,285

This is one of the suggestive and effective ways to control the spreading of viruses. In the future, it is required to provide medicinal plant-based clinical products (Masks, sanitizers, soap, etc.,) with better techniques by clinicians to contend the scarcity and expose towards the nature-based medicine rather than chemical drugs. This may be a benchmark for the economical clinical trials of specific plant material to treat the viral diseases in the future.","Divya, Mani; Vijayakumar, Sekar; Chen, Jingdi; Vaseeharan, Baskaralingam; Durán-Lara, Esteban F",Microb Pathog,,285

422256,Mortality from COVID-19 against the backdrop of other twentieth century mortality bursts,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 cases resurged worldwide in the second half of 2020. Not much is known about the changes in public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare public responses to containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We curated all COVID-19-related posts from Sina Weibo (China's version of Twitter) during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in Beijing, China. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on 3 containment measures: lockdown, the test-trace-isolate strategy, and suspension of gatherings. The Baidu open-source sentiment analysis model and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, a widely used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess public engagement, sentiments, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. RESULTS: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were curated. In China, the containment measures evolved from a complete lockdown for the general population during the initial outbreak to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk populations during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, the average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for the lockdown, 56% to 51% for the test-trace-isolate strategy, and 55% to 48% for the suspension of gatherings. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measures, discussions on containment measures accounted for approximately 32% in both periods, but those on the second-most frequently discussed topic shifted from the expression of negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily life or work (26%). The public expressed a high level of panic (21%) during the initial outbreak but almost no panic (1%) during resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolate measure received the most support (60%) among all 3 containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its support rate approached 90% during resurgence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiments on containment measures and were more supportive toward containment measures during resurgence. Targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable to the public. Our results indicate that when COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk populations should be promoted to balance pandemic control and its impact on daily life and the economy.","Zhou, Xinyu; Song, Yi; Jiang, Hao; Wang, Qian; Qu, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Jit, Mark; Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,,285
422262,Incidence of delayed asymptomatic COVID-19 recurrences in a 6-month longitudinal study,2021,"Background: There is high prevalence of severe hypoxia, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and high mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonitis. Evidence prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that, compared with conventional ventilation strategies, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can improve oxygenation and reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to assess the association between APRV use and clinical outcomes among adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 and hypothesized that APRV use would be associated with improved survival compared with conventional ventilation. Methods: A total of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis was admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for invasive ventilation in Perth, Western Australia, between February and May 2020. Eleven of these patients received APRV. The primary outcome was survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free survival days to day 90, mechanical complications from ventilation, and number of days ventilated. Results: Patients who received APRV had a lower probability of survival than did those on other forms of ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.89; P=0.036). This finding was independent of indices of severity of illness to predict the use of APRV. Patients who received APRV also had fewer ventilator-free survival days up to 90 days after initiation of ventilation compared to patients who did not receive APRV, and survivors who received APRV had fewer ventilator-free days than survivors who received other forms of ventilation. There were no differences in mechanical complications according to mode of ventilation. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, we urge caution with the use of APRV in COVID-19.","Zorbas, John S; Ho, Kwok M; Litton, Edward; Wibrow, Bradley; Fysh, Edward; Anstey, Matthew H",,,285

Under non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. Introducing interventions to control spread, peak caseloads are reduced, but both cumulative infection rates and current infection rates are systematically higher for the poor than for non-poor, across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and longer durations of intervention are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor; and these are of particular concern for economically vulnerable populations in cities of the developing world. Addressing these challenges requires a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the relationships between structural poverty and epidemy, as well as effective utilization of extant community level infrastructure for primary care in developing cities.

425334,The role of additive manufacturing and antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presents unique challenges to the care of hospitalized older adults, including fractured lines of communication and uncertainty surrounding long term trajectories in cognition and function. Geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians bring specialized training in facilitating communication in the face of uncertainty. Insurance expansion of virtual visits enabled inpatient virtual consultation, which can preserve personal protective equipment and minimize exposure to clinicians. We examined changes in goals of care and code status following an inpatient virtual consultation with geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians. METHODS: This was an observational case series study performed at a large tertiary Academic Hospital. The study population included 78 patients aged 65 years and older, hospitalized with COVID-19 who had an inpatient consultation completed by geriatric medicine or palliative care clinicians between April 9, 2020 through May 9, 2020. The intervention was targeted, virtual geriatric medicine or palliative care consultation. All patients admitted to a medical floor with COVID-19 were screened four days a week and if a patient was over the age of 65, the medical team was offered a consultation by geriatric medicine (ages 80 and above) or palliative care (ages 65-79). Consultation included medical record review, telephone conversations with clinicians and nurses, telephone or video conversations with patients and/or surrogate decision-makers and collaborative case review on daily virtual huddles with an interprofessional team of geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians. Descriptive statistics were applied to categorize outcomes after chart abstraction. RESULTS: Following consultation, 24 patients (31%) patients changed their code status to less invasive interventions. Of patients who were FULL CODE at the time of consultation (n=42), 2 (4.8%) transitioned to DNR only and 16 (38.1%) transitioned to DNR/DNI after consultation. While 8 patients (10.3%) utilized intensive care unit (ICU) level of care prior to consultation, 6 (7.6%) patients utilized ICU after consultation. After consultation, 11 (14.1%) patients were referred to hospice. CONCLUSIONS: Given uncertain trajectories in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and variability in patient preferences, virtual goals of care geriatric medicine and palliative care consultations should be considered as a key component of COVID-19 hospital protocols.","Ouellet, Jennifer A; Prsic, Elizabeth H; Spear, Rebecca A; Blatt, Leslie; Kukulka, Shannon; Cronin-Ozyck, Rosemary; Kapo, Jennifer M; Lai, James M",Ann Palliat Med,,285
425388,Recent Updates on COVID-19 Vaccine Platforms and Its Immunological Aspects: A Review,2020,"End stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with a high mortality rate among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, there is limited data on the clinical features, ethnicity, inpatient glycaemic control and outcomes in patients with diabetes related ESRD in the literature. We report the clinical features and outcomes of 39 consecutive ESRD patients (28 on haemodialysis [HD] and 11 with renal transplant) secondary to diabetic kidney disease admitted to a university hospital with COVID-19. We observed a high prevalence of patients of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity hospitalized with COVID-19 with a 73% and 54% prevalence in renal transplant and HD groups respectively. The mortality rate of our cohort was 36%. Nearly a one-third of HD patients and one-fifth of transplant patients had hypoglycaemic events during COVID-19 hospitalization. Adjustment of diabetes treatment was frequently required. Our data highlight the importance of integrated multidisciplinary care of patients with diabetes related ESRD hospitalized with COVID-19.","Corcillo, Antonella; Cohen, Siew; Game, David; Karalliedde, Janaka",Nephrology (Carlton),,285

We evaluated Panbio and SD-Biosensor Ag-RDTs. We employed 186 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative samples to evaluate the specificity and 170 PCR positive samples to assess the sensitivity. We evaluated their sensitivity according to Cycle threshold (C t ) values and days post onset of symptoms (d.p.o.). Tests were compared using the McNemar's test. Agreement was evaluated using the kappa score. Specificity was 100% for Panbio and 97.3% for SD-Biosensor. Sensitivity for samples with C t &#8804; 20 was 100% for both assays and for samples with C t = 20-25 was 93.0% (Panbio) and 95.3% (SD-Biosensor) (p = 1.000).

426822,Epidemiological Data From the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain for the Promotion of Tobacco Smoking Cessation Policies,2020,"Introduction: The cytokine storm is a form of excessive systemic inflammatory reaction triggered by a myriad of factors that may lead to multi-organ failure, and finally to death. The cytokine storm can occur in a number of infectious and noninfectious diseases including COVID-19, sepsis, ebola, avian influenza, and graft versus host disease, or during the severe inflammatory response syndrome.Area covered: This review mainly focuses on the most common and well-known methods of protein studies (PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and high- performance liquid chromatography). It also discusses other modern technologies in proteomics like mass spectrometry, soft ionization techniques, cytometric bead assays, and the next generation of microarrays that have been used to get an in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms involved during the cytokine storm.Expert opinion: Overactivation of leukocytes drives the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines fueling the cytokine storm. These events lead to a systemic hyper-inflammation, circulatory collapse and shock, and finally to multiorgan failure. Therefore, monitoring the patient's systemic cytokine levels with proteomic technologies that are redundant, economical, and require minimal sample volume for real-time assessment might help in a better clinical evaluation and management of critically ill patients.","David, Paul; Hansen, Frederik J; Bhat, Adil; Weber, Georg F",Expert Rev Proteomics,,285
426926,Escalation and de-escalation of the radiology response to COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in South London: The King's College Hospital experience,2020,"Since December 2019, a viral pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from Wuhan, China, has swept the world. Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large and there is still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker that can effectively block the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and thus is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,285
427110,Anxiety and Gastrointestinal Symptoms Related to COVID-19 during Italian Lockdown,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Public transport accessible to older people may offer a transformative solution to achieving healthy ageing. However, the evidence to support such transport infrastructure modifications is unclear. Previous studies on public transport use and elderly health were mostly observational studies using cross-sectional data. Few studies have examined the before-and-after effects of a new metro, for example, to see if it leads to improved elderly health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a new metro line in Hong Kong as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the metro-led public transport intervention on elderly health. In Hong Kong, more than 90% of daily travels are made by public transport. The public transport modifications consist of the new metro line with eight stations and changes in the walking environment and bus services around the stations. We will look at the before-and-after differences in public transport use and health outcomes between elderly participants living in treatment neighbourhoods (400 m walking buffered areas of the new metro stations) and in control groups (living in comparable areas but unaffected by the new metro). Questionnaire-based baseline data were collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while some qualitative interviews are ongoing. Amid the pandemic, we conducted a quick telephone-based survey of COVID-19's potential impact on public transport use behaviours of our elderly cohort in September 2020. Note there is no lockdown in Hong Kong until the writing of the paper (January 2021). After the new metro opens, we will conduct a follow-up survey, tentatively in late 2022. We aim to investigate if the new metro and the associated changes in the built environment have any effects on public transport use behaviours, physical activity and wider health outcomes among the elderly (eg, social inclusion, quality of life, subjective well-being). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong reviewed and approved the study procedures and materials (reference number: EA1710040). Results will be communicated through scientific papers and research reports.","Sun, Guibo; Du, Yao; Ni, Michael Y; Zhao, Jianting; Webster, Chris",BMJ Open,,285

Little research understands the impact of an ASD upon families, how this may change over time and how COVID-19 has impacted these dynamics. AIMS: To explore the impact of an ASD on the lived experiences of parents and neurotypical adult siblings, including during the UK COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Eight parent-sibling dyads (16 individuals) completed semi-structured interviews discussing their family before, during and after receiving the ASD diagnosis, and in relation to the first UK lockdown. Interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS: Three super-ordinate themes were identified: Dominated by ASD; Family Cohesion; and the Need for Support. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggested a closeness within the families and an adoration towards the individual with ASD (IWA). Dyads were, to an extent, consumed by the diagnosis both presently and in the future, implicating the need for a stretch in services to support parents and neurotypical siblings. In terms of the first UK lockdown, the IWA added an extra layer of difficulty to the dyads work-life balance yet there was an essence of family cohesion. Future research should consider longitudinal methods and explore the impact of ASD co-morbidities upon family dynamics.","Critchley, Emma; Cuadros, Michelle; Harper, Ina; Smith-Howell, Harry; Rogish, Miles",Res Dev Disabil,,285
428104,Decreasing Older Adult COVID-19 Risk Factors Using Digital Technology to Implement a Plant-Based-Diet: An Opinion Paper,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Many studies have been published recently on the characteristics of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children. The quality scores of literature are different, and the incidence of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests results vary greatly. Therefore, a systematic retrospective meta-analysis is needed to determine the incidence of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from databases, such as PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Johns Hopkins University, and Chinese databases were analysed from January 31, 2020 to October 20, 2020. High-quality articles were selected for analysis based on a quality standard score. A meta-analysis of random effects was used to determine the prevalence of comorbidities and subgroup meta-analysis to examine the changes in the estimated prevalence in different subgroups. RESULTS: Seventy-one articles involving 11,671 children were included in the study. The incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, asymptomatic patients, nervous system symptoms, and chest tightness was 55.8%, 56.8%, 14.4%, 21.1%, 6.7%, and 6.1%, respectively. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome was 6.2%. Laboratory examination results showed that lymphocytes decreased in 12% and leukocytes decreased in 8.8% of patients, whereas white blood cells increased in 7.8% of patients. Imaging showed abnormalities in 66.5%, and ground-glass opacities were observed in 36.9% patients. Epidemiological history was present in 85.2% cases; severe disease rate was 3.33%. The mortality rate was 0.28%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in children are mild, and laboratory indicators and imaging manifestations are atypical. While screening children for COVID-19, in addition to assessing patients for symptoms as the first step of screening, the epidemiological history of patients should be obtained.","Wang, J-G; Zhong, Z-J; Mo, Y-F; Wang, L-C; Chen, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,285

While much of the existing work has studied compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study compliance as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social planner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their unobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the actions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking any treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation that may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel recommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of instrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the history -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby enabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and minimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the optimal treatment.","Ngo, Daniel; Stapleton, Logan; Syrgkanis, Vasilis; Wu, Zhiwei Steven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10093v2.pdf,285

Adolescent school children are exposed to a varying degree. OBJECTIVES: The study is aimed to determine the knowledge of the mode of spread and preventive practices among college adolescents attending six secondary schools in Enugu metropolis. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in 6 secondary schools among 500 college adolescents. A pretested, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents, 98.4% were aware of COVID-19. Although, a higher proportion of the respondents, 52.0% were aware COVID-19 could be transmitted through contact with infected persons, only a minor proportion of them, 42.4% had a good knowledge of the mode of spread of COVID-19. However, a high proportion of the respondents, 69.2% practiced good preventive measures against COVID-19. Also, respondents whose parents were self-employed were 1.4 times more likely to have good knowledge of the mode of spread of COVID-19 when compared with those whose parents were on paid employment [adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9-2.0]. The respondents whose fathers have attained tertiary education were 1.6 times more likely to have good preventive practices against COVID-19 when compared with those who had secondary school and below (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.04-2.5). CONCLUSION: Though college adolescents were aware of COVID-19, not a significant proportion practiced good preventive measures against COVID-19. Knowledge of mode of spread and preventive practices were significantly enhanced by fathers' educational status and being a female adolescent child.","Aronu, Ann E; Chinawa, Awoere T; Ossai, Edmund N; Onukwuli, Vivian O; Chinawa, Josephat M",J. trop. pedriatr,,285

Within our three-tiered framework-the prediction layer, the knowledge layer and the presentation layer-we describe multiple approaches in computing similarity ratios from the feature vectors, illustrated with an example of applying the framework in a typical medical clinic. Experimental evaluation shows that the word embedding model performs better than the adverse network model, with a F score of 0.75. The F score is a common metrics used for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms. Similarity to a drug the patient is allergic to or is taking are important considerations for the suitability of a drug for prescription.

Face shields are useful in stopping respiratory droplets from speading from the wearer to others. The droplets, which come into contact with the shield, are quickly spread over a large area, both transversely and vertically, over the shield, but with a shrinking concentration of droplets, as opposed to face masks, which appear to slide under the nose of the wearer or, worse, collapse entirely off the shield. Hence, a face- shield can be considered as personal protective equipment (PPE), which is a first line of resistance, utilized by the clinicians and forefront health workers for protection against the infectious body fluid and aerosols. Face-shields are mainly fabricated using polycarbonate material, because of their excellent optical transparency in UVA-visible-IR spectrum and mechanical properties. The goal of this article is to provide researchers working in the same area, as well as health and industrial staff, with a detailed analysis of the usage of face shields against bioaerosols and the need for personal security.

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. DEVELOPMENT: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. CONCLUSION: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, J; Gomez-Pinedo, U; Montero-Escribano, P; Gomez-Iglesias, P; Porta-Etessam, J; Matias-Guiu, J A",Neurologia,,285

Only four subjects were quarantined at home because of a positive COVID-19 swab. The mean total IES score was 21.1 ± 14.9 with 24.1% of subjects scoring over the cut-off score of 26 thereby suggesting a moderate-to-severe impact of the pandemic event. Mean BDI score was 8.6 ± 8.4. SF-12 total mean score was 96.1 ± 11.9 with a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of 42.8 ± 9.1. Access to endocrinological consultations for hormonal prescription via telemedicine services was associated with better IES total scores (P = .01). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results highlight the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of this particular population and how telemedicine services may serve to mitigate negative psychological effects. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Internet-based surveys may select a group of people not necessary representative of the whole population. The self-reporting bias should also be considered. Those who responded to our survey were mainly from northern Italy were COVID-19 has had a greater impact. CONCLUSION: Vulnerable groups such as the transgender population should receive more consideration also during pandemic events and their access to health services especially for endocrine and mental health care should be improved. A nationwide plan for the extended use of telemedicine should be established with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress. Gava G, Fisher AD, Alvisi S, et al.

431123,Adherence to ALARA principle in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Objectives of the study: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the media has often mentioned the presence of quinine in tonic water. Media accounts of quinine's antiviral effect in vitro, as well as press reports about quinine-based compounds, such as hydroxychloroquine, have sparked renewed public interest in drinking tonic water, which could perhaps result in an increase in allergic phenomena. On the 200th anniversary of the discovery of quinine, our main objective was to analyze hypersensitivity reactions, related to the consumption of beverages containing quinine, described in the literature. Patients and methods: We analyzed case reports indexed on Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A quinine causality score was calculated for each of the observations. A quinine assay was performed on several beverages for which the quinine content had not been published. Results: In parallel with related pharmacokinetic studies, these case reports consist of 26 observations. The case reports mainly related to young men, with symptoms of varying severity, mainly dermatological, with fixed drug eruption, generalized rashes, hives; hematological, with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy; more rarely ocular, cardiac or auditory. The level of causality of quinine is certain for three cases, probable for twenty-two, possible for two. The levels of quinine, all conforming to the standards, were lower in the spirits and the cooked wine than those of tonic water. Discussion: Possibly under-diagnosed, the main mechanism of these reactions is immuno-allergic, without any cross-reaction with other quinolines having been shown. In these patients and breastfeeding women of G6PD deficient newborns, any medicines, phytotherapy, homeopathy, or even cosmetics containing quinine, on the basis of a proposed list, should be avoided.","Lefrère, B; Barbaud, A; Bagot, M; Bourgogne, E",,,285

431708,Caring for Patients with Rectal Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite high level of health care need amongst people experiencing homelessness, poor access is a major concern. This is sometimes due to organisational and bureaucratic barriers, but also because they often feel stigmatised and treated badly when they do seek health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required social distancing measures have caused unprecedented disruption and change for the organisation of primary care, particularly for people experiencing homelessness. Against this backdrop there are many questions to address regarding whether the recent changes required to deliver services to people experiencing homelessness in the context of COVID-19 will help to address or compound problems in accessing care and inequalities in health outcomes. METHODS: An action led and participatory research methodology will be employed to address the study objectives. Interviews with people experiencing homelessness were will be conducted by a researcher with lived experience of homelessness. Researchers with lived experience are able to engage with vulnerable communities in an empathetic, non-judgemental way as their shared experience promotes a sense of trust and integrity, which in turn encourages participation in research and may help people speak more openly about their experience. The experiences of health professionals and stakeholders delivering and facilitating care for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic will also be explored. DISCUSSION: It is important to explore whether recent changes to the delivery of primary care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compromise the safety of people experiencing homelessness and exacerbate health inequalities. This could have implications for how primary healthcare is delivered to those experiencing homelessness not only for the duration of the pandemic but in the future.","Howells, Kelly; Burrows, Martin; Amp, Mat; Brennan, Rachel; Yeung, Wan-Ley; Jackson, Shaun; Dickinson, Joanne; Draper, Julie; Campbell, Stephen; Ashcroft, Darren; Blakeman, Tom; Sanders, Caroline",Int J Equity Health,,285

We assessed neuroimaging findings in 4 patients positive for COVID-19. All had abnormal mental status, deranged coagulation parameters, and markedly elevated D-dimer levels. CT/MR imaging showed a common pattern of multifocal subcortical/cortical petechial-type hemorrhages, while SWI showed more extensive multifocal abnormalities. The appearances are consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy and may be due to the heightened level of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19.","Nicholson, P; Alshafai, L; Krings, T",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,285

However, evidence for negative mental and physiological health consequences of such measures for students is increasing, highlighting the need for evidence-based recommendations on how to safely reopen schools. This study presents experiences when implementing opt-in, at-home SARS-CoV-2 screening using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to facilitate safe face-to-face-teaching during a pandemic. MethodsWe present data form a prospective study implementing an RDT-based screening program at a primary school in southwest Germany. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with participating children, parents, and school stakeholders to elicit implementation experiences and screening perception. ResultsThe screening intervention was highly accepted and appreciated among participants; no positive RDT was reported over the duration of the study. Self-testing at home before coming to school was feasible, but more positive consequences of screening participation (e.g., easing of mask mandates) besides a personal feeling of safety would be appreciated. Participants preferred home-based RDTs over some other measures, particularly mask mandates. Despite the RDTs being licensed as self-tests in Germany, additional training can help avoid mistakes, and ensuring intervention ownership and improving pre-implementation communication can facilitate buy-in. ConclusionsAg-RDT-based SARS-CoV-2 screening programs relying on self-testing at home proved feasible and accepted among primary school students, parents, and school staff who participated in this study.

436146,COVID-19: a test of evidence-based surgery,2021,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus was declared a pandemic on March 10, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has massively burdened healthcare systems with cases exponentially rising throughout the United States and the rest of the world Since implementing precautions to reduce the spread of this disease, emergency departments have seen a decrease in the number of traumas By evaluating the differences in the number of trauma admissions in different subgroups of patients, we can assess where to target messaging to increase compliance with these precautions In this study, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma admissions Methodology This was a retrospective review of the trauma database at our institution, a level 2 trauma center in Southern California, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of traumas The inclusion criteria were patients activated as traumas, regardless of age Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have complete information in the trauma database Data were stratified by date into two groups: (a) COVID period (January to April 2020) and (b) pre-COVID period (January to April 2019) The primary endpoint of this study was to determine whether there was a significant change in the number of patients presenting as trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic This difference was analyzed and divided into subgroups based on age and trauma type Results In our review, an average of 279 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April in 2019, and an average of 222 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April 2020 (p = 0 049) We found a significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with the chief complaint of fall and vehicular accident, but a nonsignificant difference in patients presenting as assaults or pedestrian accidents There was also a significant decrease in the number of traumas in the 18-39 and 65+ age groups and a nonsignificant decrease in the 40-64 age group It was also noted that the number of trauma admissions in May 2020 increased to 253 compared to 269 in 2019 This increase was most notable in the 18-39 and 40-64 age groups Discussion As seen in the data, the most notable year-over-year difference was seen in March and April In California specifically, a stay-at-home order was set in place in March, which was in conjunction with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic An interesting finding was the significant decrease in patients with traumas in the age groups of 18-39 and 65+ from 2019 to 2020 There was a smaller, nonsignificant decrease in patients aged 40-64 This would be a good group to target with future messaging to increase compliance with health advisories There was also a notable increase in the number of traumas in May 2020, signaling an end to the cooperation of the majority of people, also indicating that further measures needed to be enacted in all groups Conclusions COVID-19 has disrupted social structures worldwide As the pandemic continued, even the observers of stay-at-home and social distancing measures, the 18-39 age group, became fatigued with the guidelines and ventured out into the warming weather and summer activities This difference in trauma admission due to COVID-19 between subsequent years can highlight the behavioral changes in our patient population and can be further extrapolated to target additional messaging to help reduce the spread of COVID-19","Savla, P.; Wiginton, J. th Taka T.

Its primary objective is to provide situational awareness and inform decisions on control responses. In the event of large-scale sustained emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists need to constantly update their aims and analytics with respect to the rapidly evolving emergence of new questions, data and findings in order to synthesize real-time evidence for policy decisions. In this Perspective, we share our views on the functional aims, rationale, data requirements and challenges of nowcasting at different stages of an epidemic, drawing on the ongoing COVID-19 experience. We highlight how recent advances in the computational and laboratory sciences could be harnessed to complement traditional approaches to enhance the scope, timeliness, reliability and utility of epidemic nowcasting.","Wu, Joseph T; Leung, Kathy; Lam, Tommy T Y; Ni, Michael Y; Wong, Carlos K H; Peiris, J S Malik; Leung, Gabriel M",Nat Med,,285

Here we applied innovative metrics to a physical neurosurgery trainer to explore whether these metrics differentiate between different levels of experience across different tasks. METHODS: Twenty-four participants (9 experts, 15 novices) performed four tasks (dissection, spatial adaptation, depth adaptation, and the A-B-A task) using the PsT1 training system. Four performance metrics (collision, precision, dissected area, and time) and six kinematic metrics (dispersion, path length, depth perception, velocity, acceleration, and motion smoothness) were collected. RESULTS: For all tasks, the execution time (t) of the experts was significantly lower than that of novices (p<0.05). The experts performed significantly better in all but two of the other metrics, dispersion and sectional area, corresponding to the A-B-A task and dissection task, respectively, for which they showed a non-significant trend towards better performance (p = 0.052 and p = 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSION: It is possible to differentiate between the skill levels of novices and experts according to parameters derived from the PsT1 platform, paving the way for the quantitative assessment of training progress using this system. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical simulators that gather surgical performance metrics offer a solution to the educational needs of residents.","Espinoza, Daniel Lorias; Carranza, Vicente González; Escamirosa, Fernando Perez; Chico-Ponce de León, Fernando; Martinez, Arturo Minor; Gutiérrez-Gnecchi, Jose Antonio",World neurosurgery (Online),,285

Due to the rapid human to human transmission of Covid-19, we are in need to find a potent drug at the earliest by ruling-out the traditional time-consuming approach of drug development. This is only possible if we use reliable computational approaches for screening compounds from chemical space or by drug repurposing or by finding the phytochemicals and nutraceuticals from plants as they can be immediately used without the need for carrying out drug-trials to test safety and efficacy. A number of plant products were routinely suggested as drugs in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. Here using molecular docking approach, and combined molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA based free energy calculations approach, we study the potency of the four selected phytochemicals namely andrographolide (AGP1), 14-deoxy 11,12-didehydro andrographolide (AGP2), neoandrographolide (AGP3) and 14-deoxy andrographolide (AGP4) from A. paniculata plant against the four key targets including three non-structural proteins (3 L main protease (3CLpro), Papain-like proteinase (PLpro) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp)) and a structural protein (spike protein (S)) of the virus which are responsible for replication, transcription and host cell recognition. The therapeutic potential of the selected phytochemicals against Covid-19 were also evaluated in comparison with a few commercially available drugs.

We aimed to assess the consistency of national and international surgical society recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach; assess the quality of evidence of viral emission in surgical aerosol; and assess the quality of evidence comparing aerosol generation by different surgical energy devices. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was performed. Three search strategies were employed. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final analysis and quality appraised. Confidence in review findings was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) tool. RESULTS: Worldwide recommendations regarding open versus laparoscopic surgery are consistent, with a majority recommending that surgical approach is decided on a case-by-case, risk minimization approach. There is limited, low-quality evidence that viral particles can be emitted in surgical aerosol. There is a paucity of literature on the quantity of aerosol produced by different surgical energy devices, and no evidence to support the use of certain surgical instruments to minimize aerosol production. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable consistency among worldwide recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach, although the evidence base is lacking. To inform clinical recommendations, further research examining viral emission, transmission, infectivity and amount of surgical aerosol produced is required.","Jacob, Susan; Hameed, Ahmer; Lam, Vincent; Pang, Tony Cy",ANZ j.

440881,Interviewing children: the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on children's perceived psychological distress and changes in routine,2021,"AIM: To assess the prevalence of burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction and explore their impacts on self-reported hand hygiene among medical aid teams in the COVID-19 period in Wuhan, China. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHOD: A total of 1,734 healthcare workers from 17 medical aid teams were surveyed. The survey included burnout, secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction measured by the professional quality of life scale and self-reported hand hygiene. Data were collected between 5-7 March 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Burnout and secondary trauma stress were at low and average levels, and compassion satisfaction was at average and high levels. Burnout was negatively associated with hand hygiene, while compassion satisfaction was positively associated. Hospital administrators should pay attention to burnout and compassion satisfaction to improve infection control behaviours. Management of healthcare workers in our study may be constructive in emerging infectious diseases.","Zhou, Qian; Lai, Xiaoquan; Wan, Zhaoyang; Zhang, Xinping; Tan, Li",,,285

441014,The advantages of peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Ventilation plays an important role in prevention and control of COVID-19 in enclosed indoor environment and specially in high-occupant-density indoor environments (e.g., underground space buildings, conference room, etc.). Thus, higher ventilation rates are recommended to minimize the infection transmission probability, but this may result in higher energy consumption and cost. This paper proposes a smart low-cost ventilation control strategy based on occupant-density-detection algorithm with consideration of both infection prevention and energy efficiency. The ventilation rate can be automatically adjusted between the demand-controlled mode and anti-infection mode with a self-developed low-cost hardware prototype. YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm was applied for occupancy detection based on video frames from surveillance cameras. Case studies show that, compared with a traditional ventilation mode (with 15% fixed fresh air ratio), the proposed ventilation control strategy can achieve 11.7% energy saving while lowering the infection probability to 2%. The developed ventilation control strategy provides a feasible and promising solution to prevent transmission of infection diseases (e.g., COVID-19) in public and private buildings, and also help to achieve a healthy yet sustainable indoor environment.","Wang, Junqi; Huang, Jingjing; Feng, Zhuangbo; Cao, Shi-Jie; Haghighat, Fariborz",Energy Build,,285

441938,COVID-19 intubation teams-the Saskatoon experience,2021,"Septic shock is a clinical condition with high mortality (40%-70%) and morbidity. During septic shock, there is a significant release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that can cause damage to different organs, known as a ""cytokine storm."" The cytokine storm can cause hypotension, tissue damage, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. This clinical picture also seems to be confirmed in the context of Covid-19 patients. Hemoadsorption with CytoSorb represents an adjunctive therapy to attenuate the systemic inflammatory process and helps restore a balanced immune response. We present the clinical case of a 75-year-old man, admitted to our hospital with respiratory failure due to Sars-CoV-2 infection and secondary septic shock due to a sacral decubitus. On admission the patient presented with a clinical picture of mixed acidosis with high levels of lactate and inflammatory indexes. Simultaneously along with antibiotic therapy, we started hemoadsorption treatment with CytoSorb in combination with continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration. At the end of the treatment the patient had recovered his vital functions and the infection was successfully treated. Use of the CytoSorb device in a Covid-19 positive patient was safe and well-tolerated. Early treatment with CytoSorb decreased interleukin 6 plasma levels and inflammatory indexes, resulting in earlier stabilization of homeostasis. This case report suggests that the use of CytoSorb could be a possible adjuvant therapy in patients with septic shock even when affected by Covid-19.","Pancani, Flavia; Pavani, Raffaella; Quacquarelli, Antonio; Feri, Marco",Int J Artif Organs,,285

Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Methods: Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results: Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion: Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Bhattacharya, Saikat; Ray, Soumalya; Chakraborty, Arup",Indian J Public Health,,285

We use an age-structured transmission model fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admission data to assess the effects of school-based measures at different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Our analyses suggest that the impact of measures reducing school-based contacts depends on the remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce the effective reproduction number (Re) with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among older school children. As two examples, we demonstrate that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays in 2020, in the absence of other measures, would not have prevented the second pandemic wave in autumn 2020 but closing schools in November 2020 could have reduced Re below 1, with unchanged non-school-based contacts.","Rozhnova, Ganna; van Dorp, Christiaan H; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia; Bootsma, Martin C J; van de Wijgert, Janneke H H M; Bonten, Marc J M; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E",Nat Commun,,285

442363,Specific Susceptibility to COVID-19 in Adults with Down Syndrome,2021,"Currently, there are four seasonal coronaviruses associated with relatively mild respiratory tract disease in humans. However, there is also a plethora of animal coronaviruses which have the potential to cross the species border. This regularly results in the emergence of new viruses in humans. In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged and rapidly disappeared in May 2003. In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as a possible threat to humans, but its pandemic potential so far is minimal, as human-to-human transmission is ineffective. The end of 2019 brought us information about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emergence, and the virus rapidly spread in 2020, causing an unprecedented pandemic. At present, studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line. This model is convenient for diagnostics, but it has serious limitations and does not allow for understanding of the biology and evolution of the virus. Here, we show that fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures constitute an excellent model to study infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We observed efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with maximal replication at 2 days postinfection. The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged by the end of 2019 and rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the biology of the virus, rapidly assess the treatment potential of existing drugs, and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on SARS-CoV-2.","Milewska, Aleksandra; Kula-Pacurar, Anna; Wadas, Jakub; Suder, Agnieszka; Szczepanski, Artur; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Marcello, Alessandro; Ochman, Marek; Stacel, Tomasz; Rajfur, Zenon; Sanak, Marek; Labaj, Pawel; Branicki, Wojciech; Pyrc, Krzysztof",J. virol,,285

It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation at R0=1 when recovered individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for R0&lt;1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R0to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play the major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.","Kassa, Semu M.; Njagarah, John B.H.; Terefe, Yibeltal A.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,285

Alarming results from China and the UK confirm the vulnerability of HM patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-driven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that the immunoassay interference from the endogenous monoclonal immunoglobulin (M paraprotein) and treatment antibodies continually challenges the MM management, it is critical to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 serology tests for suspected interference/cross-reactivity. METHODS: We compared the degree of interference in three SARS-CoV-2 serology assay platforms in HM patients with and without COVID-19 and on various therapeutic monoclonal antibody (t-mAb) treatments. Further, we confirmed the cross-reactivity in pooled samples from normal and COVID-19 + samples spiked with respective antibodies in vitro. RESULTS: None of the 93 HM patient samples with or without t-MAbs showed cross-reactivity on any of the three serology platforms tested. CONCLUSIONS: The tested three serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 are specific and do not have cross-reactivity with M-components or t-MAbs indicating that they can be used safely in oncology practice and in research exploring the immunologic response to COVID-19 in patients with HM.","Mahimainathan, Lenin; Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Corchado, Rolando; Patel, Hetalkumari; Kansagra, Ankit; Devaraj, Sridevi; Geethakumari, Praveen Ramakrishnan; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",,,285
442996,COVID-19 and Adolescent Depression and Suicide Risk Screening Outcomes,2021,"Corporate influence is one of the most pressing issues in public health. It cuts across many of our most intractable problems-from obesity to the opioid epidemic. Companies develop close relationships with public health agencies, research universities, academic medical centers, professional societies, and patient advocacy organizations-often funding medical research and public health interventions intended to address the very challenges these corporations are creating or exacerbating. How we view relationships with industry, including how these relationships are framed in ethical discourse, shapes our legal and policy responses to them. In recent years, fueled in part by the opioid epidemic, the ethical framing of industry relationships has begun to evolve in significant ways. But legal and policy responses have not yet caught up. In this article, I develop a temporal account of corporate influence, and legal and policy responses to corporate influence. This account clarifies the limitations and adverse effects of conflicts of interest disclosure, especially when implemented as the sole legal or policy response. Disclosure can illuminate corporate influence-but policymakers cannot and should not rely on disclosure to eliminate corporate influence or its effects. Nor should we allow disclosure to crowd out structural and systemic responses to corporate influence-including sequestration of and separation from private-sector entities.","Marks, Jonathan H",Am J Law Med,,285

444413,The Role of Empathy in Full-Scale Battle of Medical and Paramedical Learners Against COVID-19,2020,"Mobility restrictions are among actions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been pointed as reasons for improving air quality, especially in large cities. However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, São Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the São Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubatão, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.","Rudke, A P; Martins, J A; de Almeida, D S; Martins, L D; Beal, A; Hallak, R; Freitas, E D; Andrade, M F; Foroutan, H; Baek, B H; de A Albuquerque, T T",Environ Res,,285

With the pandemic rapidly rising in sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya, there is need to provide evidence to guide the mental health response in the region. Objectives: The objective of this review is (1) to describe the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, guided by the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework (2) to offer context specific recommendations for improvement of the mental health response in Kenya. Such information could be useful in decision-making in Kenya as well as in the greater sub-Saharan Africa region. Methods: This narrative review is based on information obtained from official government documents released from 13th March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic in Kenya, up to 31st July 2020. Discussion: The COVID-19 response in Kenya has no formal mental health response plan. There is an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community. While guidelines for the management of mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been prepared, implementation remains a major challenge due to a poorly resourced mental health system. There is no mental health surveillance system in place limiting ability to design evidence-based interventions. Conclusion: We propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in order to mitigate the harmful impact of COVID-19 on public mental health in Kenya: (1) preparation of a formal mental health response plan specific to the COVID-19 pandemic with allocation of funding for the response (2) training of community health workers and community health volunteers on psychological first aid to enable access to support for those in need during the pandemic (3) scaling up of mobile health to increase access to care (4) conducting systematic and continuous text message surveys on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-making.","Jaguga, Florence; Kwobah, Edith",Int J Ment Health Syst,,285
445373,A neurosurgery resident's response to COVID-19: Anything but routine,2020,"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic digital contact tracing has been proposed as a tool to support the health authorities in their quest to determine who has been in close and sustained contact with a person infected by the coronavirus. In April 2020 Google and Apple released the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy friendly platform for contact tracing. The GAEN framework implements exposure notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the app(lication) layer. In this paper we study the consequences of this approach. We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing (even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in practice by health authorities, and how it introduces the risk of function creep.","Hoepman, Jaap-Henk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05097v1.pdf,285

446246,Optimization of Patient Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Chest CT Scan and PCR as Gatekeepers of the Radiation Therapy Workflow,2020,"Most COVID-19-associated hospitalizations occur in older adults, but severe disease that requires hospitalization occurs in all age groups, including adolescents aged 12-17 years (1). On May 10, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include persons aged 12-15 years, and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended it for this age group on May 12, 2021.* Before that time, COVID-19 vaccines had been available only to persons aged &#8805;16 years. Understanding and describing the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents and comparing it with adolescent hospitalizations associated with other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses, such as influenza, offers evidence of the benefits of expanding the recommended age range for vaccination and provides a baseline and context from which to assess vaccination impact. Using the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), CDC examined COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12-17 years, including demographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents admitted during January 1-March 31, 2021, and hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) among adolescents during March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021. Among 204 adolescents who were likely hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 during January 1-March 31, 2021, 31.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation; there were no associated deaths. During March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, weekly adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and then rose to 1.3 in April. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates during October 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, were 2.5-3.0 times higher than were influenza-associated hospitalization rates from three recent influenza seasons (2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20) obtained from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). Recent increased COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates in March and April 2021 and the potential for severe disease in adolescents reinforce the importance of continued COVID-19 prevention measures, including vaccination and correct and consistent wearing of masks by persons not yet fully vaccinated or when required by laws, rules, or regulations..","Havers, Fiona P; Whitaker, Michael; Self, Julie L; Chai, Shua J; Kirley, Pam Daily; Alden, Nisha B; Kawasaki, Breanna; Meek, James; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Anderson, Evan J; Openo, Kyle P; Weigel, Andrew; Teno, Kenzie; Monroe, Maya L; Ryan, Patricia A; Reeg, Libby; Kohrman, Alexander; Lynfield, Ruth; Como-Sabetti, Kathryn; Poblete, Mayvilynne; McMullen, Chelsea; Muse, Alison; Spina, Nancy; Bennett, Nancy M; Gaitán, Maria; Billing, Laurie M; Shiltz, Jess; Sutton, Melissa; Abdullah, Nasreen; Schaffner, William; Talbot, H Keipp; Crossland, Melanie; George, Andrea; Patel, Kadam; Pham, Huong; Milucky, Jennifer; Anglin, Onika; Ujamaa, Dawud; Hall, Aron J; Garg, Shikha; Taylor, Christopher A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,285

A Quantitative Analysis of CO2 Environmental Dispersion Using Different Devices,2021,"OBJECTIVES: At the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the United States, testing was limited to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-developed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The urgent and massive demand for testing prompted swift development of assays to detect SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of these newly developed tests. METHODS: The American Proficiency Institute sent 2 test samples to 346 clinical laboratories in order to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 assays. The positive sample, containing 5,175 viral copies/mL, was fully extractable with SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid protein and RNA. The negative sample, with 3,951 viral copies/mL, contained recombinant virus particles with sequences for targeting human RNAase P gene sequences. RESULTS: Of the laboratories submitting results, 97.4% (302/310) correctly detected the virus when present and 98.3% (296/301) correctly indicated when the virus was not present. Among incorrect results reported in this proficiency challenge, 76.9% (10/13) were likely related to clerical error. This accounts for 1.6% (10/611) of all reported results. CONCLUSIONS: Overall performance in this SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection challenge was excellent, providing confidence in the results of these new molecular tests and assurance for the clinical and public health decisions based on these test results.","Edson, Daniel C; Casey, Danielle L; Harmer, Susan E; Downes, Frances P",Am J Clin Pathol,,285

447547,COVID-19 vaccination rates of medical physicists throughout Europe,2021,"Severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is characterized by pulmonary hyper-inflammation and potentially life-threatening ""cytokine storms"". Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies. Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (""debris"")-induced ""eicosanoid storm"", including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins. Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution. SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive. SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm. Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection. Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation. While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on ""anti-viral"" and ""anti-inflammatory"" strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression. Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.","Panigrahy, Dipak; Gilligan, Molly M; Huang, Sui; Gartung, Allison; Cortés-Puch, Irene; Sime, Patricia J; Phipps, Richard P; Serhan, Charles N; Hammock, Bruce D",Cancer Metastasis Rev,,285

ACE2, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in the oral epithelium; however, it is unclear at what developmental stage ACE2 expression emerges and whether ACE2 is expressed in taste buds. To identify the specific developmental stage, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from embryonic and newborn mouse oral tissue. We found that robust ACE2 expression was observed in the newborn oral epithelium. In contrast, only extremely low levels, if any, of ACE2 transcripts in the embryonic stage oral tissue were found (E12.5 and E14.5). Analyses of three public scRNA-seq data sets of adult mouse tongue epithelial cells showed that receptors for various viruses were enriched in distinct clusters of tongue epithelial cells. ACE2 was enriched in a subpopulation of epithelial cells in the basal region of nongustatory filiform papillae but not in the taste papillae or taste buds. Expression of ACE2 was detected in a small proportion of type III taste cells. Our results indicate that when applied across species, nongustatory papilla epithelial cells are the prime targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tongue; thus, taste loss in COVID-19 patients is likely not caused by a direct infection of SARS-CoV-2 to taste bud cells. Additionally, fetuses at different stages of development may have distinct susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Zhonghou; Zhou, Jingqi; Marshall, Brett; Rekaya, Romdhane; Ye, Kaixiong; Liu, Hong-Xiang",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,,285

Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated Heparin and Enoxaparin are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Methods: We analyzed records of 1,113 patients in the Mayo Clinic Electronic Health Record (EHR) database who were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 between April 4, 2020 and August 31, 2020, including 19 different Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Among this patient population, we compared cohorts of patients who received different types of anticoagulants, including 441 patients who received unfractionated Heparin and 166 patients who received Enoxaparin. Clinical outcomes at 28 days were compared, and propensity score matching was used to control for potential confounding variables including: demographics, comorbidities, ICU status, chronic kidney disease stage, and oxygenation status. Patients with a history of acute kidney injury and patients who received multiple types of anticoagulants were excluded from the study. Findings: We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated Heparin but not Enoxaparin have higher rates of 28-day mortality (risk ratio: 4.3; 95% Confidence Interval [C.I.].: [1.8, 10.2]; p-value: 8.5e-4, Benjamini Hochberg [BH] adjusted p-value: 2.1e-3), after controlling for potential confounding factors.

450685,COVID-19 Second Wave: Challenges and Revival Measures (preprint),2021,"Currently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia has been widespread globally, and there is no specific medicine. In response to the emergency, we employed bioinformatics methods to investigate the virus's pathogenic mechanism, finding possible control methods. We speculated in previous studies that E protein was associated with viral infectivity. The present study adopted the domain search techniques to analyse the E protein. According to the results, the E protein could bind iron or haem. The iron and haem bound by the E protein came from the attacked haemoglobin and phagocytes. When E protein was attached to haem, it synthesised oxygen and water into superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. When the iron-bound E protein and the haem-bound E protein worked together, they converted superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. These were the ""ROS attack"" and ""ROS escape"" of the virus. ""ROS attack"" damaged the tissues or cells exposed on the surface of the virus, and ""ROS escape"" decomposed the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that attacked the virus. When NK cells were exposed to infected cells, viruses that had not shed from the infected cells' surface damaged them through ""ROS attack"". In addition, lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells, which could be close to the antigen of the virus surface, were also easily damaged or killed by the ""ROS attack"", generating a decrease in lymphocytes. When memory B cells were exposed to the virus's surface antigen, they were also damaged by ""ROS attack"", resulting in the patient's re-infection. The virus applied the ""ROS escape"" to decompose hydrogen peroxide released by phagocytes into oxygen and water. The surrounding cells were replenished with oxygen, and the patient was in a ""happy hypoxia"" state. When the phagocytes swallowed the virus, the E protein converted superoxide anions into oxygen and water. In this way, the virus parasitized in the vesicles of the phagocyte. While virus was in the lysosome, the E protein generated ROS to damage nearby hydrolases. In this way, the virus parasitized the lysosome. Excessive hydroxyl free radicals destroyed the membrane structure of the lysosome, causing the hydrolase release from lysosome, autophagy of phagocytic cells and subsequent cell death. As a result, the colonizing phagocytes of the virus was associated with asymptomatic infection or retest-positive. Briefly, the virus inhibited the immune system through ""ROS escape"", and damaged the immune system by ""ROS attack"". The destruction instigated a strong cytokine storm, leading to organ failure and complications.","Wenzhong, Liu; Hualan, Li",Autoimmunity,,285

In particular, we provide a simple and workable answer to the question of how to detect the gauge group in the bootstrap calculation. Our recipe is based on the notion of \emph{decoupling operator}, which has a simple (gauge) group theoretical origin, and is reminiscent of the null operator of $2d$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in higher dimensions. Using the decoupling operator we can efficiently detect the rank (i.e. color number) of gauge groups, e.g., by imposing gap conditions in the CFT spectrum. We also discuss the physics of the equation of motion, which has interesting consequences in the CFT spectrum as well. As an application of our recipes, we study a prototypical critical gauge theory, namely the scalar QED which has a $U(1)$ gauge field interacting with critical bosons. We show that the scalar QED can be solved by conformal bootstrap, namely we have obtained its kinks and islands in both $d=3$ and $d=2+\epsilon$ dimensions.","He, Yin-Chen; Rong, Junchen; Su, Ning",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07262v3.pdf,285

METHODS: We undertook a single centre, retrospective cohort study examining COVID-19 related mortality using Electronic Health Records, for older people (65 and over) with frailty, hospitalised with or without COVID-19 infection. Baseline covariates included demographics, Early Warning Scores, Charlson Comorbidity Indices and frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale, CFS), linked to COVID-19 status. FINDINGS: We analysed outcomes on 1,071 patients with COVID-19 test results; 285 (27%) were positive for COVID-19.)The mean age at ED arrival was 79.7 and 49.4% were female. All-cause mortality (by 30 days) rose from 9% (not frail) through to 33% (severely frail) in the COVID negative cohort but was around 60% for all frailty categories in the COVID positive cohort. In adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio for death in those with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19 was 7.3, 95% CI: 3.00, 18.0) with age, comorbidities and illness severity making small additional contributions. INTERPRETATION: In this study frailty, measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale, appeared to make little incremental contribution to the hazard of dying in older people hospitalised with COVID-19 infection; illness severity and comorbidity had a modest association with the overall adjusted hazard of death, whereas confirmed COVID-19 infection dominated, with a seven-fold hazard for death.","Owen, Rhiannon K; Conroy, Simon P; Taub, Nicholas; Jones, Will; Bryden, Daniele; Pareek, Manish; Faull, Christina; Abrams, Keith R; Davis, Daniel; Banerjee, Jay",Age ageing,,285
456391,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Oncology in Europe: Results of a European Survey,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), first broke out in Wuhan, China, in 2019. SARS-CoV-2 develops many types of mutations (such as B.1.1.7), making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Although we now have a preliminary understanding of COVID-19, including pathological changes, clinical manifestations, and treatment measures, we also face new difficulties. The biggest problem is that most COVID-19 patients might face sequelae (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, pulmonary fibrosis) during the recovery phase. We aimed to test six Chinese patent medicines to treat three major abnormal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the recovery phase, including cardiopulmonary function, sleep disturbance, and digestive function. We launched the ""three syndromes and six Chinese patent medicines"" randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial on April 10, 2020. The results showed that Jinshuibao tablets and Shengmaiyin oral liquid significantly improved the cardiopulmonary function of recovering COVID-19 patients. Shumian capsules, but not Xiaoyao capsules, significantly improved patients' sleep disorders. This might be because the indication of Xiaoyao capsules is liver qi stagnation rather than psychological or emotional problems. Xiangsha Liujun pills and Ludangshen oral liquid significantly improved digestive function. Our research provides a guideline for treating COVID-19 sequelae in patients during the recovery period based on high-quality evidence.","An, X.; Duan, L.; Zhang, Y. H.; Jin, Zhao S.; Zhou, R.

457085,Post-COVID-19 Syndrome in Egyptian Healthcare Staff: Highlighting the Carers Sufferings,2021,"The photo-Fenton process is an advanced oxidation process that uses the hydroxyl radical to disinfect and decontaminate water. Its non-selectivity makes it ideal for the removal of a range of microorganisms including those with antimicrobial resistance. Optimum parameters such as pH, temperature, hydrogen peroxide and iron concentrations and the intensity and wavelength of light irradiation are important to carry out an efficient photo-Fenton process. Traditionally photo-Fenton has been carried out at low acidic pH to obtain greater efficiency, but recent studies have been performed at near neutral. The current review examines the effectiveness of the photo-Fenton process at a near neutral pH for the disinfection of water. The optimal pH was seen to be at 2.8, with the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process decreasing as the pH rises. The optimal reagent concentrations showed considerable variation depending on the iron catalyst used and the iron to hydrogen peroxide concentration used. The effect of irradiance and temperature showed improved efficiency with higher levels. Different types of microorganisms such as E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella spp., total Coliforms, MRSA, MSSA, B. subtilis, Clostridium sp., Faecal Coliform, MS2 coliphage and Curvularia sp. are also examined and the effect the process will have on them. The design of reactors, such as compound parabolic reactors are also examined. The impact of light sources, including the recent reports on LEDs, on the production of hydrogen peroxide and thereby the improvement in the overall photo-Fenton disinfection is also discussed in detail. Finally, a techno-economic analysis to explain various costs associated with photo-Fenton process has also been carried out. It is concluded that the development of new heterogeneous supported immobilised catalysts that could work at the near neutral pH is an area, which requires considerable future research.","O039,; Dowd, Kris; Pillai, Suresh C.",J.

These outcomes were compared with non-RADSC staff. METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted between 12 March and 20 July 2020 in the largest public tertiary hospital receiving COVID-19 cases. Burnout and anxiety were assessed with the Physician Work-Life Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, respectively. Workplace factors were examined as potential risk and protective factors using multivariable ordinary least squares regression analyses, adjusting for pertinent demographic characteristics. RESULTS: RADSC staff (n = 180) and non-RADSC staff (n = 1458) demonstrated moderate-to-severe anxiety rates of 6.7 and 13.2 % and burnout rates of 17.8 and 23.9 %, respectively. RADSC staff reported significantly lower anxiety (mean ± SD: 4.0 ± 3.7 vs 4.9 ± 4.5; P-value < 0.05), burnout (mean ± SD: 1.9 ± 0.7 vs 2.1 ± 0.8; P-value < 0.01), increased teamwork (82.2% vs 74.1%; P-value < 0.05) and fewer night shifts (36.7% vs 41.1%; P-value < 0.01). Among RADSC staff, higher job dedication was associated with lower anxiety (b (95% CI) = -0.28 (-0.45, -0.11)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = -0.07 (-0.11,-0.04)), while longer than usual working hours was associated with increased anxiety (b (95% CI) = 1.42 (0.36, 2.45)) and burnout (b (95% CI) = 0.28 (0.09, 0.48)). CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of RADSC staff reported significant burnout and anxiety, although less compared to the larger hospital cohort. Measures to prevent longer than usual work hours and increase feelings of enthusiasm and pride in one's job may further reduce the prevalence of anxiety problems and burnout in radiology departments.","Huang, Hian Liang; Chen, Robert Chun; Teo, Irene; Chaudhry, Isha; Heng, Ai Ling; Zhuang, Kun Da; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Tan, Bien Soo",J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,,285

458559,Psychosocial response of infertile patients to COVID-19-related delays in care at the epicenter of the global pandemic,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.","La Rosa, Giuseppina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Suffredini, Elisabetta",Water Res,,285

The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor. These results suggest that higher compliance with PPE usage and personal hygiene has the potential to decrease the number of infections and shorten epidemic duration. Individually initiated social isolation was effective when initiated in response to a single infected contact. The combination of social isolation and PPE resulted in very low levels of infection. Our model suggests that widespread application of social distancing through government control can drastically reduce viral spread; even in the absence of widely adopted social distancing protocols, high use of PPE can also dramatically reduce the viral spread while short-duration quarantine following exposure to an infected individual was less effective.","Braun, Benjamin; Taraktacs, Bacsak; Beckage, Brian; Molofsky, Jane",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09751v1.pdf,285

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented ""infodemic""; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis-related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19-related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world's largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19-related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators' critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19-related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA's design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers' critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world's largest COVID-19-related data corpora for searches and curation.","Vaghela, Uddhav; Rabinowicz, Simon; Bratsos, Paris; Martin, Guy; Fritzilas, Epameinondas; Markar, Sheraz; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Stringer, Karl; Singh, Harshdeep; Llewellyn, Charlie; Dutta, Debabrata; Clarke, Jonathan M; Howard, Matthew; Serban, Ovidiu; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,,285

Vesiculovirus research is growing quickly following its adaptation to clinical gene and cell therapy and oncolytic virotherapy. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the versatility of VSV as a research tool and biological reagent, its use as a viral and vaccine vector delivering therapeutic and immunogenic transgenes and an oncolytic virus aiding cancer treatment. Challenges such as the immune response against such advanced therapeutic medicinal products and manufacturing constraints are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The field of in vivo gene and cell therapy is advancing rapidly with VSV used in many ways. Comparison of VSV's use as a versatile therapeutic reagent unveils further prospects and problems for each application. Overcoming immunological challenges to aid repeated administration of viral vectors and minimizing harmful host-vector interactions remains one of the major challenges. In the future, exploitation of reverse genetic tools may assist the creation of recombinant viral variants that have improved onco-selectivity and more efficient vaccine vector activity.

Perceptions (e.g. perception of disease threat) have profound consequences on behavior (e.g medication adherence). If adequately available, perception studies guide public awareness efforts or help in understanding behavior. In this study , repeated cross-sectional data were collected from 376 randomly selected globally located respondents over two periods. Participants perceived COVID-19 as severe as Tumor and AIDS (F (2,722) = 2.347; p = .096), and as more severe than other 14 illnesses; e.g. Diabetes and High blood pressure. Age-wise, participants above 50 age group perceived COVID-19 as more severe than the under 50 (F (1,240) = 10.378, p < .001). In addition, the magnitude of severity perception was found to be dependent on the different stages of the outbreak in the respondents' corresponding countries. In a gap of a month time, depression surpassed COVID-19 to be perceived as more severe. Majority of respondents attributed COVID-19 as a physical (vs mental) illness, thus considered it as more severe (vs less severe). Implications of this study could mean; (1) COVID-19 patients might be susceptible to social stigmatization as HIV patients, and (2) severity perception is shaping intervention friendly behaviors.","Menebo, Mesay Moges",Psychol Health Med,,285

The extent to which these interactions, as well as traditional face-to-face interactions, satisfied psychological needs and supported wellbeing during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be elucidated. In this study, university students' social interactions (both technology-based and face-to-face), psychological needs, and wellbeing were assessed at six time points across four months of government-enforced restrictions in Australia. DESIGN: Repeated survey assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Basic psychological need satisfaction; general wellbeing. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that, at the within-subjects level, relatedness satisfaction (feeling understood by, cared for, and connected to others) significantly mediated the relationship between technology-based interaction and wellbeing. Autonomy satisfaction (self-initiation and feeling ownership over decisions and behaviours) mediated the relationship between face-to-face interactions and wellbeing at the within-person level. CONCLUSION: Discussion is centred on the importance of technology-based interactions for needs satisfaction and wellbeing during periods of social isolation.","Dimmock, James; Krause, Amanda E; Rebar, Amanda; Jackson, Ben",Psychol Health,,285

In recent years, the overall detection rates have been low and have varied by region. HCoVs have not been considered as the major pathogens in pediatric acute gastroenteritis. HCoVs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children. Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases. Furthermore, pathologic features have not been clear. Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited. However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants.

462480,Breast Cancer Care in a COVID-19 Pandemic Epicenter,2020,"The incursion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached global scale in 2020, requiring a response from leaders worldwide. Although the virus is a ubiquitous problem, world leaders have varied appreciably in their responses resulting in substantially different outcomes in terms of virus mitigation, population health, and economic stability. One explanation for this inconsistency is that leaders have taken differential approaches to making sense of the crisis that, in turn, have driven their approaches to decision making and communication. The present article elaborates on the role of leaders as sensemakers and explains how a leader's sensemaking approach is a critical element in successful crisis management efforts. Through the charismatic, ideological, pragmatic (CIP) leadership model, a sensemaking-focused theory of leadership, it is explained how specific, relatively stable sensemaking approaches manifest and what actions leaders engaged in those styles are likely to take in times of crisis. These connections are then reinforced through case examples of 3 world leaders, framed through CIP, and demonstrate how their sensemaking approach has influenced their response to COVID-19. The article concludes with a discussion of the impacts that these differential approaches to COVID-19 may have on the global community, and recommendations for more explicit incorporation of sensemaking into our understanding of leadership.

463546,Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with COVID-19,2021,"Introduction In long-term induced general anesthesia cases such as those uniquely defined by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic context, the clearance of hypnotic and analgesic drugs from the body follows anomalous diffusion with afferent drug trapping and escape rates in heterogeneous tissues. Evidence exists that drug molecules have a preference to accumulate in slow acting compartments such as muscle and fat mass volumes. Currently used patient dependent pharmacokinetic models do not take into account anomalous diffusion resulted from heterogeneous drug distribution in the body with time varying clearance rates. Objectives This paper proposes a mathematical framework for drug trapping estimation in PK models for estimating optimal drug infusion rates to maintain long-term anesthesia in Covid-19 patients. We also propose a protocol for measuring and calibrating PK models, along with a methodology to minimize blood sample collection. Methods We propose a framework enabling calibration of the models during the follow up of Covid-19 patients undergoing anesthesia during their treatment and recovery period in ICU. The proposed model can be easily updated with incoming information from clinical protocols on blood plasma drug concentration profiles. Already available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models can be then calibrated based on blood plasma concentration measurements. Results The proposed calibration methodology allow to minimize risk for potential over-dosing as clearance rates are updated based on direct measurements from the patient. Conclusions The proposed methodology will reduce the adverse effects related to over-dosing, which allow further increase of the success rate during the recovery period.","Copot, Dana Ionescu Clara",Journal of Advanced Research,,285

To control its spread, the government has implemented several strategies, such as policies associated with large-scale social restrictions (Indonesian: Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar or PSBB). The purpose of this study is to determine the variables that influence attitudes toward PSBB policies in Indonesia. This is a cross-sectional study with data obtained from 856 respondents from all provinces in Indonesia using the partial least squares and structural equation model (PLS-SEM). A total of 23 indicators were used to examine these policies, which were grouped into five variables: benefits of the PSBB (5 indicators), positive perception (5 indicators), negative perception (3 indicators), threatened perceptions of COVID-19 (5 indicators), and attitude toward the PSBB policy (5 indicators). The model explains over 50% of attitudes exhibited toward PSBB policy implementation and how it is influenced by the perceived benefits, negative and positive perceptions as well as the threat associated with COVID-19. The policy of stay at home, physical distancing, and always using face masks needs to be continued for the public to have a supportive attitude of the PSBB policy in preventing the transmission of COVID-19.","Purnama, Sang Gede; Susanna, Dewi",Front Public Health,,285

With regard to oral cancer, there is a complete absence of literature regarding the long-term impact of pandemics on patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). The objective of this article is to put forth an institutional multidisciplinary approach for the evaluation and management of OPMDs. METHODS: A multidisciplinary approach was put formalized within our institution to risk stratify patients based on need for in-person assessment vs telehealth assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: With judicious risk stratification of patients based on clinical features of their OPMD and with consideration of ongoing mitigation efforts and regional pandemic impact, providers are able to safely care for their patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has required health care practitioners to make novel decisions that are new to us with development of creative pathways of care that focused on patient safety, mitigation efforts, and clinical management of disease processes. The care of patients with OPMDs requires special considerations especially as patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness are also higher risk for the development of OPMDs.","Shanti, Rabie M; Stoopler, Eric T; Weinstein, Gregory S; Newman, Jason G; Cannady, Steven B; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Tanaka, Takako I; O039,; Malley, Bert W; Le, Anh D; Sollecito, Thomas P",Head Neck,,285

Inspiratory and expiratory noncontrast along with contrast dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) scans of the chest were performed at baseline on the day of acute COVID-19 diagnosis (day 0), and across a 90-day period. Despite normal vital signs and pulmonary function tests on the day of diagnosis, the CT scans and corresponding quantification metrics detected abnormalities in parenchymal expansion based on image registration, ground-glass (GGO) texture (inflammation) as well as DECT-derived pulmonary blood volume (PBV). Follow-up scans on day 30 showed improvement in the lung parenchymal mechanics as well as reduced GGO and improved PBV distribution. Improvements in lung PBV continued until day 90. However, the heterogeneity of parenchymal mechanics and texture-derived GGO increased on days 60 and 90. We highlight that even asymptomatic COVID-19 infection with unremarkable vital signs and pulmonary function tests can have measurable effects on lung parenchymal mechanics and vascular pathophysiology, which may follow apparently different clinical courses. For this asymptomatic subject, post COVID-19 regional mechanics demonstrated persistent increased heterogeneity concomitant with return of elevated GGOs, despite early improvements in vascular derangement.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We characterized the temporal changes of lung parenchyma and microvascular pathophysiology from COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic young, healthy nonsmoking male using dual-energy CT.

465534,Induced abortion via telemedicine should become the norm: a commentary,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To examine and summarize the current literature on serologic methods for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A literature review was performed using searches in databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Thirty-two peer-reviewed papers and 23 preprints were examined. RESULTS: The studies included lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, and neutralizing antibody assays. The use of all major SARS-CoV-2 antigens was demonstrated to have diagnostic value. Assays measuring total antibody reactivity had the highest sensitivity. In addition, all the methods provided opportunities to characterize the humoral immune response by isotype. The combined use of IgM and IgG detection resulted in a higher sensitivity than that observed when detecting either isotype alone. Although IgA was rarely studied, it was also demonstrated to be a sensitive marker of infection, and levels correlated with disease severity and neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS: The use of serologic testing, in conjunction with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, was demonstrated to significantly increase the sensitivity of detection of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether antibody titers correlated with clinical severity. However, preliminary investigations indicated some immunoassays may be a surrogate for the prediction of neutralizing antibody titers and the selection of recovered patients for convalescent serum donation.","Espejo, Andrea P; Akgun, Yamac; Al Mana, Abdulaziz F; Tjendra, Youley; Millan, Nicolas C; Gomez-Fernandez, Carmen; Cray, Carolyn",Am J Clin Pathol,,285

467721,The Missing Pieces of the COVID-19 Puzzle,2020,"BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific acute phase reactant elevated in infection or inflammation. Higher levels indicate more severe infection and have been used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease severity. However, the evidence for CRP as a prognostic marker is yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to examine the CRP response in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to determine the utility of CRP on admission for predicting inpatient mortality. METHODS: Data were collected between 27 February and 10 June 2020, incorporating two cohorts: the COPE (COVID-19 in Older People) study of 1564 adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to 11 hospital sites (test cohort) and a later validation cohort of 271 patients. Admission CRP was investigated, and finite mixture models were fit to assess the likely underlying distribution. Further, different prognostic thresholds of CRP were analysed in a time-to-mortality Cox regression to determine a cut-off. Bootstrapping was used to compare model performance [Harrell's C statistic and Akaike information criterion (AIC)]. RESULTS: The test and validation cohort distribution of CRP was not affected by age, and mixture models indicated a bimodal distribution. A threshold cut-off of CRP &#8805;40 mg/L performed well to predict mortality (and performed similarly to treating CRP as a linear variable). CONCLUSIONS: The distributional characteristics of CRP indicated an optimal cut-off of &#8805;40 mg/L was associated with mortality. This threshold may assist clinicians in using CRP as an early trigger for enhanced observation, treatment decisions and advanced care planning.","Stringer, Dominic; Braude, Philip; Myint, Phyo K; Evans, Louis; Collins, Jemima T; Verduri, Alessia; Quinn, Terry J; Vilches-Moraga, Arturo; Stechman, Michael J; Pearce, Lyndsay; Moug, Susan; McCarthy, Kathryn; Hewitt, Jonathan; Carter, Ben",Int J Epidemiol,,285

467892,Running behavior and symptoms of respiratory tract infection during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large prospective Dutch cohort study,2020,"Corrosion detection on metal constructions is a major challenge in civil engineering for quick, safe and effective inspection. Existing image analysis approaches tend to place bounding boxes around the defected region which is not adequate both for structural analysis and pre-fabrication, an innovative construction concept which reduces maintenance cost, time and improves safety. In this paper, we apply three semantic segmentation-oriented deep learning models (FCN, U-Net and Mask R-CNN) for corrosion detection, which perform better in terms of accuracy and time and require a smaller number of annotated samples compared to other deep models, e.g. CNN. However, the final images derived are still not sufficiently accurate for structural analysis and pre-fabrication. Thus, we adopt a novel data projection scheme that fuses the results of color segmentation, yielding accurate but over-segmented contours of a region, with a processed area of the deep masks, resulting in high-confidence corroded pixels.","Katsamenis, Iason; Protopapadakis, Eftychios; Doulamis, Anastasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos; Voulodimos, Athanasios",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05204v1.pdf,285
468158,Autopsy methodology in the process of confronting COVID-19,2020,"Credit restrictions, such as those happening in the current context shaped by the crisis derived from COVID-19, make working capital management (WCM) a driving force behind SME performance. This paper analyses whether WCM policies affect the economic and financial profitability of Spanish companies in the fish canning industry. Spain leads the EU’s production of canned seafood and the seafood industry is a key sector for the Spanish economy. To assess the WCM-profitability relationship, we applied a dynamic panel data methodology in a sample consisting of 377 companies during the period 2010–2018. We can conclude that the economic profitability of fish canning companies is related to the collection period (Days Sales Outstanding or DSO) and the inventory conversion period (Days Inventory Outstanding or DIO). Moreover, empirical evidence reveals the existence of an optimal level of receivables that balances the benefits of increasing sales and the opportunity costs of customer funding. The findings also identify a convex relationship between investment in inventory and economic profitability.","Rey-Ares, Lucía Fernández-López Sara Rodeiro-Pazos David",Marine Policy,,285

469093,Nephrology and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the course of diseases that require emergency surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer disease stage. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis in the city of Rize, Turkey. METHODS: This was a comparative analysis on two groups of patients with various symptoms who underwent surgical colorectal cancer treatment. Group 1 comprised patients operated between March 11, 2019, and December 31, 2019; while group 2 comprised patients at the same time of the year during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 included 56 and 48 patients, respectively. The rate of presentation to the emergency service was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.02). The stage of the pathological lymph nodes and the rate of liver metastasis was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.004 and P < 0.041, respectively). The disease stage was found to be more advanced in Group 2 (P < 0.005). The rate of postoperative complications was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The presentation of patients with suspicious findings to the hospital was delayed, due both to the fear of catching COVID-19 and to the pandemic precautions that were proposed and implemented by healthcare authorities worldwide. Among the patients who presented to the hospital with emergency complaints and in whom colorectal cancer was detected, their disease was at a more advanced stage and thus a higher number of emergency oncological surgical procedures were performed on those patients.","Uyan, Mikail; Özdemir, Ali; Kalcan, Süleyman; Tomas, Kadir; Demiral, Gökhan; Pergel, Ahmet; Tarim, Ismail Alper",Sao Paulo med. j,,285

469938,Strategies for follow up after hernia surgery during COVID 19 Pandemia,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe temporal changes in treatment, care, and short-term mortality outcomes of geriatric patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 1785 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6744 hospitalized for non-COVID-19 causes at 7 geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 6 to July 31, 2020, were included. METHODS: Across admission month, patient vital signs and pharmacological treatment in relationship to risk for in-hospital death were analyzed using the Poisson regression model. Incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of death are presented. RESULTS: In patients with COVID-19, the IR of mortality were 27%, 17%, 10%, 8%, and 2% from March to July, respectively, after standardization for demographics and vital signs. Compared with patients admitted in March, the risk of in-hospital death decreased by 29% [IRR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.99] in April, 61% (0.39, 0.26-0.58) in May, 68% (0.32, 0.19-0.55) in June, and 86% (0.14, 0.03-0.58) in July. The proportion of patients admitted for geriatric care with oxygen saturation <90% decreased from 13% to 1%, which partly explains the improvement of COVID-19 patient survival. In non-COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, mortality rates remained relatively stable (IR 1.3%-2.3%). Compared with non-COVID-19 geriatric patients, the IRR of death declined from 11 times higher (IRR 11.7, 95% CI 6.11-22.3) to 1.6 times (2.61, 0.50-13.7) between March and July in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality risk in geriatric patients from the Stockholm region declined over time throughout the first pandemic wave of COVID-19. The improved survival rate over time was only partly related to improvement in saturation status at the admission of the patients hospitalized later throughout the pandemic. Lower incidence during the later months could have led to less severe hospitalized cases driving down mortality.","Xu, Hong; Garcia-Ptacek, Sara; Annetorp, Martin; Cederholm, Tommy; Engel, Georg; Engström, Malin; Erlandsson, Håkan; Julius, Charlotte; Kivipelto, Miia; Lundberg, Lars Göran; Metzner, Carina; Sandberg, Linda; Skogö Nyvang, Josefina; Sühl Öberg, Carina; Åkesson, Elisabet; Religa, Dorota; Eriksdotter, Maria",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,285

471402,Sex and age differences in COVID-19 mortality in Europe,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies are mainly based on social distancing measures and healthcare system reinforcement. However, many countries in Europe and elsewhere implemented strict, horizontal lockdowns because of extensive viral spread in the community which challenges the capacity of the healthcare systems. However, strict lockdowns have various untintended adverse social, economic and health effects, which have yet to be fully elucidated, and have not been considered in models examining the effects of various mitigation measures. Unlike commonly suggested, the dilemma is not about health vs wealth because the economic devastation of long-lasting lockdowns will definitely have adverse health effects in the population. Furthermore, they cannot provide a lasting solution in pandemic containment, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of consecutive lockdowns with in-between breaks. Hospital preparedness has been the main strategy used by governments. However, a major characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic is the rapid viral transmission in populations with no immunity. Thus, even the best hospital system could not cope with the demand. Primary, community and home care are the only viable strategies that could achieve the goal of pandemic mitigation. We present the case example of Greece, a country which followed a strategy focused on hospital preparedness but failed to reinforce primary and community care. This, along with strategic mistakes in epidemiological surveillance, resulted in Greece implementing a second strict, horizontal lockdown and having one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in Europe during the second wave. We provide recommendations for measures that will reinstate primary and community care at the forefront in managing the current public health crisis by protecting hospitals from unnecessary admissions, providing primary and secondary prevention services in relation to COVID-19 and maintaining population health through treatment of non-COVID-19 conditions. This, together with more selective social distancing measures (instead of horizontal lockdowns), represents the only viable and realistic long-term strategy for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Vantarakis, Apostolos; Leotsinidis, Michalis; Kouvelas, Dimitrios; Docea, Anca Oana; Kostoff, Ronald; Gerotziafas, Grigorios T; Antoniou, Michael N; Polosa, Riccardo; Barbouni, Anastastia; Yiakoumaki, Vassiliki; Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Bagos, Pantelis G; Lazopoulos, George; Izotov, Boris N; Tutelyan, Victor A; Aschner, Michael; Hartung, Thomas; Wallace, Heather M; Carvalho, Félix; Domingo, Jose L; Tsatsakis, Aristides",,,285

472141,A comparative analysis of world health systems and Covid-19,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are potential pandemic pathogens that can infect a variety of hosts and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases. Nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), an essential component of the replication/transcription complex, is one of the most important antiviral targets. Here, we report the first crystal structure of multiple functional domains from porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV) nsp3, including the macro domain (Macro), ubiquitin-like domain 2 (Ubl2) and papain-like protease (PLpro) catalytic domain. In the asymmetric unit, two of the subunits form the head-to-tail homodimer with an interaction interface between Macro and PLpro. However, PDCoV Macro-Ubl2-PLpro mainly exists as a monomer in solution. Then, we conducted fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based protease assays and found that PDCoV PLpro can cleave a peptide by mimicking the cognate nsp2/nsp3 cleavage site in peptide substrates and exhibits deubiquitinating and de-interferon stimulated gene(deISGylating) activities by hydrolysing ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) and ISG15-AMC substrates. Moreover, the deletion of Macro or Macro-Ubl2 decreased the enzyme activity of PLpro, indicating that Macro and Ubl2 play important roles in maintaining the stability of the PLpro domain. Two active sites of PLpro, Cys260 and His398, were determined; unexpectedly, the conserved site Asp412 was not the third active site. Furthermore, the motif ""NGYDT"" (amino acids 409-413) was important for stabilizing the enzyme activity of PLpro, and the N409A mutant significantly decreased the enzyme activity of PLpro. These results provide novel insights into the replication mechanism of CoV and new clues for future drug design.","Li, Mengxia; Ye, Gang; Si, Yu; Shen, Zhou; Liu, Zhu; Shi, Yuejun; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F; Peng, Guiqing",Emerg Microbes Infect,,285
472142,A comparative analysis of world health systems and Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: High prevalence rates have been reported for physical inactivity, mobility limitations, and falls in older adults. Home-based exercise might be an adequate means to increase physical activity by improving health- (i.e., muscle strength) and skill-related components of physical fitness (i.e., balance), particularly in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of home-based balance exercises conducted during daily tooth brushing on measures of balance and muscle strength in healthy older adults. METHODS: Fifty-one older adults were randomly assigned to a balance exercise group (n = 27; age: 65.1 ± 1.1 years) or a passive control group (n = 24; age: 66.2 ± 3.3 years). The intervention group conducted balance exercises over a period of eight weeks twice daily for three minutes each during their daily tooth brushing routine. Pre- and post-intervention, tests were included for the assessment of static steady-state balance (i.e., Romberg test), dynamic steady-state balance (i.e., 10-m single and dual-task walk test using a cognitive and motor interference task), proactive balance (i.e., Timed-Up-and-Go Test [TUG], Functional-Reach-Test [FRT]), and muscle strength (i.e., Chair-Rise-Test [CRT]). RESULTS: Irrespective of group, the statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for time (pre vs. post) for dual-task gait speed (p < .001, 1.12 &#8804; d &#8804; 2.65), TUG (p < .001, d = 1.17), FRT (p = .002, d = 0.92), and CRT (p = .002, d = 0.94) but not for single-task gait speed and for the Romberg-Test. No significant group × time interactions were found for any of the investigated variables. CONCLUSIONS: The applied lifestyle balance training program conducted twice daily during tooth brushing routines appears not to be sufficient in terms of exercise dosage and difficulty level to enhance balance and muscle strength in healthy adults aged 60-72 years. Consequently, structured balance training programs using higher exercise dosages and/or more difficult balance tasks are recommended for older adults to improve balance and muscle strength.","Granacher, Urs; Muehlbauer, Thomas; Göstemeyer, Gerd; Gruber, Stefanie; Gruber, Markus",BMC Geriatr,,285

473266,Intervention strategy aimed at the prevention and control of COVID-19 in Consolación del Sur,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an urgent global health threat and the world's deadliest infectious disease despite being largely curable. A critical challenge is to ensure that patients adhere to the full course of treatment to prevent the continued spread of the disease and development of drug-resistant disease. Mobile health interventions hold promise to provide the required adherence support to improve TB treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB treatment support tools (TB-TSTs) intervention on treatment outcomes (success and default) and to assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to TB-TSTs implementation. METHODS: The TB-TSTs study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups in which 400 adult patients newly diagnosed with TB will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus TB-TSTs. Participants will be recruited on a rolling basis from 4 clinical sites in Argentina. The intervention consists of a smartphone progressive web app, a treatment supporter (eg, TB nurse, physician, or social worker), and a direct adherence test strip engineered for home use. Intervention group participants will report treatment progress and interact with a treatment supporter using the app and metabolite urine test strip. The primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use, and usability. We will assess patients' and providers' perceptions of barriers to implementation and synthesize lessons learned. We hypothesize that the TB-TSTs intervention will be more effective because it allows patients and TB supporters to monitor and address issues in real time and provide tailored support. We will share the results with stakeholders and policy makers. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2020, with a delayed start due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and complete enrollment is expected by approximately July 2022. Data collection and follow-up are expected to be completed 6 months after the last patient is enrolled. Results from the analyses based on the primary end points are expected to be submitted for publication within a year of data collection completion. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be the first study to evaluate a patient-centered remote treatment support strategy using a mobile tool and a home-based direct drug metabolite test. The results will provide robust scientific evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and adoption of mobile health tools. The findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but also more generally for chronic disease management and will improve our understanding of how to support patients facing challenging treatment regimens.

473432,Silver Lining During COVID-19: Transformation in Neurosurgery Education,2020,"Targeted wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Wastewater Surveillance System as a complementary approach to clinical surveillance to detect the presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at high-density facilities and institutions such as university campuses, nursing homes, and correctional facilities. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of targeted wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA together with individual-level testing for outbreak mitigation on a university campus during Fall 2020 semester. Wastewater samples (n = 117) were collected weekly from manholes or sewer cleanouts that receive wastewater inputs from dormitories, community-use buildings, and a COVID-19 isolation dormitory. Quantitative RT-PCR N1 and N2 assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid genes in wastewater. Due to varying human waste input in different buildings, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) RNA was also measured in all samples and used to normalize SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 RNA wastewater concentrations. In this study, temporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples mirrored trends in COVID-19 cases detected on campus. Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations using human fecal indicator, PMMV enhanced the correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with COVID-19 cases. N1 and N2 genes were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases in dormitories, and the N2 gene was significantly correlated with the number of detected COVID-19 cases in dormitories. By implementing several public health surveillance programs include targeted wastewater surveillance, individual-level testing, contact tracing, and quarantine/isolation facilities, university health administrators could act decisively during an outbreak on campus, resulting in rapid decline of newly detected COVID-19 cases. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is a proactive outbreak monitoring tool for university campuses seeking to continue higher education practices in person during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scott, Laura C; Aubee, Alexandra; Babahaji, Layla; Vigil, Katie; Tims, Scott; Aw, Tiong Gim",Environ Res,,285
473564,COVID-19 among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States: An early look,2021,"PURPOSE: To evaluate imaging patterns of a COVID-19 infection of the lungs on chest radiographs and their value in discriminating this infection from other viral pneumonias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 321 patients who presented with respiratory impairment suspicious for COVID-19 infection between February 3 and May 8, 2020 and who received a chest radiograph were included in this analysis. Imaging findings were classified as typical for COVID-19 (bilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations), non-typical (findings consistent with lobar pneumonia), indeterminate (all other distribution patterns of opacifications/consolidations), or none (no opacifications/consolidations). The sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value for the diagnostic value of the category ""typical"" were determined. Chi² test was used to compare the pattern distribution between the different types of pneumonia. RESULTS: Imaging patterns defined as typical for COVID-19 infections were documented in 35/111 (31.5â%) patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection but only in 4/210 (2â%) patients with any other kind of pneumonia, resulting in a sensitivity of 31.5â%, a specificity of 98.1â%, and a positive and negative predictive value of 89.7â% or 73â%, respectively. The sensitivity could be increased to 45.9â% when defining also unilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations with no relevant pathology contralaterally as consistent with a COVID-19 infection, while the specificity decreases slightly to 93.3â%. The pattern distribution between COVID-19 patients and those with other types of pneumonia differed significantly (pâ<â0.0001). CONCLUSION: Although the moderate sensitivity does not allow the meaningful use of chest radiographs as part of primary screening, the specific pattern of findings in a relevant proportion of those affected should be communicated quickly as additional information and trigger appropriate protective measures.

One measure, arrival quarantine, has not been studied as a modern military disease prevention strategy. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 14-day arrival quarantine on symptomatic COVID-19 testing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study compared symptomatic COVID-19 testing among all trainees who entered Basic Military Training between March 17, 2020, and April 17, 2020, before the implementation of universal arrival COVID-19 testing, during their first 2 weeks in arrival quarantine compared to the rest of their training. Furthermore, symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the last 5 weeks of training in those who completed arrival quarantine was compared to testing in the last 5 weeks for trainees who arrived between February 16, 2020, and March 16, 2020, and did not undergo arrival quarantine. Nominal variables were compared by chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. This study was approved as a public health surveillance project by the 59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Five thousand five hundred and seventy-six trainees started training between February 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020, with 2,573 trainees undergoing an arrival quarantine compared to 3,003 trainees who did not. Trainees who underwent arrival quarantine had higher rates of COVID-19 testing while in arrival quarantine (10.5 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 2.3, P &#8804; .001) and higher rates of concomitant influenza testing (74% vs. 38%, P = .001) compared to after they completed quarantine. Trainees that completed quarantine had less symptomatic COVID-19 testing after day 14 of training (2.3 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 14.3, P &#8804; .001) and influenza testing (38% vs. 74%, P = .001) compared to trainees that did not undergo arrival quarantine. CONCLUSION: Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention associated with fewer symptomatic COVID-19 tests, especially after completion of quarantine.","Marcus, Joseph E; Frankel, Dianne N; Pawlak, Mary T; Casey, Theresa M; Enriquez, Erin; Yun, Heather C",Mil. med,,285

The use of appropriate experimental animal models remains central in the in vivo exploration of the physiopathology of infection and antiviral strategies. This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intranasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 p.f.u. SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactory bulb and/or medulla oblongata) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post-inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively. The virus became undetectable and pathology resolved within 14 days. The kinetics and levels of infection can be used in ferrets and hamsters as experimental models for understanding the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and testing the protective effect of drugs.","Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Lesellier, Sandrine; Wasniewski, Marine; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne; Richomme, Céline; Boué, Franck; Lacôte, Sandra; Murri, Séverine; Pulido, Coralie; Vulin, Johann; Salguero, Francisco J; Gouilh, Meriadeg Ar; Servat, Alexandre; Marianneau, Philippe",J. gen. virol,,285

Data collection for this study took place at five senior community centers in Seoul, South Korea, from August 2018 to March 2019. A total of 54 elderly with healthy voices were assigned to a therapeutic singing group, a general singing group, or a control group, using convenience sampling. The therapeutic singing intervention involved using the Alexander technique, performing oral motor and respiratory exercises, and singing participant-written songs, across 12 sessions. The general singing group sang popular and folk songs of their choice. The control group received no treatment. Using peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and Praat analysis, the participants' vocal functions were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Vocal function was compared among the groups pre- and post-test; the therapeutic singing group showed statistically significant improvement in all vocal parameters: PEF, maximum phonation time, voice intensity (intensity), fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The general singing group showed improvement only in F0, jitter, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The control group showed an overall reduction in all vocal functions, with a significant decrease in PEF and intensity, and a decrease in jitter and shimmer. Although singing is considered helpful for the voice health of the elderly, therapeutic singing, which involves posture correction and breathing exercises, is even more effective, thus proving to be a viable intervention for preventive voice care of the elderly.","Moon, Soyoung; Park, Jiwon; Yang, Sua",J. voice,,285

The origin reportedly from Wuhan, China, this pandemic is caused by COVID-19 which belongs to the family of Coronavirus. The increase of infection and mortality has shot up exponentially and has left mankind bewildered amongst the remains of the unseen disaster. During these times of hardship mankind has to face with a series of emotions. Analysis of all these emotions becomes a primary target for the well-being of an individual and mankind as a whole. The main motive of our study is to analyze these emotions correctly. Gathering these big chunks of data about this study from different social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. plays a major role. For this study we will be considering only the corona virus related tweets from Twitter. Analysis of all these tweets will give us a proper insight about the real emotions that the people has to face during these COVID-19 times. The main objective is to work with multinomial attributed to assess the sentiments more precisely. The next step is cleaning the data and labelling them for further processing. Hereafter a model is developed which is used to access the data and then predict the actual sentiment behind the tweet. The data is assessed using the binary-class and multi-class property with the cross-data evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to form the model. After tedious training of models, it is seen that the proposed model gives us a 96.58% accuracy with Support Vector Machine algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.","Banik, S.; Ghosh, A.; Mukherjee, A.","Int. Conf.

477298,Suggested precautions for those under COVID-19 home quarantine/lockdown,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 global pandemic is a public health emergency due to its high virulence and mortality. Many vaccine development studies at clinical trials are currently conducted to combat SARS-CoV-2. Plants are a rich source of phytochemicals with different biological activities, including antiviral activities, which are the focus of many studies. AREAS COVERED: This review shows compounds of traditional plants listed on RENISUS list have therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 targets. EXPERT OPINION: The rise of new variants, more pathogenic and virulent, impacts in the increase of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus, the control of the outbreaks of disease remains a global challenge. Other's drug and vaccines development is an essential element in controlling SARS-COV-2. Therefore, it is imperative that approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence-informed. It should be noticed that the immune system does play critical roles in fighting viruses. Studies show that T cells levels decreased continuously as the disease progressed. T cell-mediated cellular immune response, probably by immunological memory, is essential for direct virus eradication after infection whilst B cells functions in producing antibodies that neutralize virus.But, have distinct patterns of T cell response exist in different patients, suggesting the possibility of distinct clinical approaches. Efforts are concentrated to elucidate the underlying immunological mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression for better design of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies. We seek to identify biomolecules with the potential to act in biomarkers that predict how severe the disease can get. But it is important to warn that the plants that produce the compounds mentioned here should not be used without a physician prescription. Finally, we speculate that these compounds may eventually attract the attention of physicians and researchers to perform tests in specific contexts of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they show positive results, be tested in Clinical trials.","Marmitt, Diorge Jônatas; Goettert, Márcia Inês; Rempel, Claudete",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,,285

COVID-19 is affecting millions of patients, and the infected number keeps increasing. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, has a long incubation period, and causes a relatively high death rate, resulting in severe health problems all over the world. Currently there is no effective proven drug for the treatment of COVID-19; therefore, development of effective therapeutic drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed. In this review, we first summarize the structure and genome features of SARS-CoV-2 and introduce its infection and replication process. Then, we review the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options of COVID-19 patients. We further discuss the potential molecular targets and drug development strategies for treatment of the emerging COVID-19. Finally, we summarize clinical trials of some potential therapeutic drugs and the results of vaccine development. This review provides some insights for the treatment of COVID-19. With the global pandemic of COVID-19, the development of effective therapeutic drugs and options has become more urgent.

As the severity of the virus became known, the Chinese National Government mobilized resources, and their centralized management was critical to the containment of the epidemic. Healthcare agencies and providers were overwhelmed with patients, many of whom were critically ill and died. Nurses adapted to the work using personal protective equipment, but its initial scarcity contributed to stressful working conditions. Nurses in the United States can take several lessons from the experiences of their Chinese nurse colleagues, including the benefit of centralized management of the epidemic, the need for specialized treatment facilities, and the importance of a national stockpile of critical equipment and supplies. A fully funded United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Pandemics and Emerging Threats is necessary. A nursing department within the office and a national mobilization plan to send nurses to support local efforts during a pandemic or other threat are likewise essential.

The mechanism and regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, force-dependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase. Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the RNA substrate. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be activated >50-fold by piconewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, such as hepatitis C virus NS3, and instead draws stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases. Our findings suggest that mechanoregulation, which may be provided by a directly bound RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, enables on-demand helicase activity on the relevant polynucleotide substrate during viral replication.","Mickolajczyk, Keith J; Shelton, Patrick M M; Grasso, Michael; Cao, Xiaocong; Warrington, Sara E; Aher, Amol; Liu, Shixin; Kapoor, Tarun M",Biophys. j,,285

The COvid MEdicaTion (COMET) study is an observational, multinational study that focused on the clinical course of COVID-19 (i.e. hospital mortality and intensive care unit [ICU] admission), and included COVID-19 patients who were registered at the emergency department or admitted to clinical wards of 63 participating hospitals. Pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists or treating physicians collected data on medication prescribed prior to admission. The association between the medication and composite clinical endpoint, including mortality and ICU admission, was analysed by multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for potential confounders. A total of 4870 patients were enrolled. ACEi were used by 847 (17.4%) patients and ARB by 761 (15.6%) patients. No significant association was seen with ACEi and the composite endpoint (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.12), mortality (OR 1.03; 95%CI 0.84 to 1.27) or ICU admission (OR 0.96; 95%CI 0.78 to 1.19) after adjustment for covariates. Similarly, no association was observed between ARB and the composite endpoint (OR 1.09; 95%CI 0.90 to 1.30), mortality (OR 1.12; OR 0.90 to 1.39) or ICU admission (OR 1.21; 95%CI 0.98 to 1.49). In conclusion, we found no evidence of a harmful or beneficial effect of ACEi or ARB use prior to hospital admission on ICU admission or hospital mortality.","Sablerolles, Roos S G; Hogenhuis, Freija E F; Lafeber, Melvin; van de Loo, Bob P A; Borgsteede, Sander D; Boersma, Eric; Versmissen, Jorie; van der Kuy, Hugo",,,285

Few reports have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading in the United States as early as the end of January. In this study, we aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating in the Los Angeles (LA) area at a time when access to diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was severely limited. METHODS: We used a pooling strategy to look for SARS-CoV-2 in remnant respiratory samples submitted for regular respiratory pathogen testing from symptomatic patients from November 2019 to early March 2020. We then performed sequencing on the positive samples. RESULTS: We detected SARS-CoV-2 in 7 specimens from 6 patients, dating back to mid-January. The earliest positive patient, with a sample collected on January 13, 2020 had no relevant travel history but did have a sibling with similar symptoms. Sequencing of these SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that the virus was introduced into the LA area from both domestic and international sources as early as January. CONCLUSIONS: We present strong evidence of community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the LA area well before widespread diagnostic testing was being performed in early 2020. These genomic data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was being introduced into Los Angeles County from both international and domestic sources in January 2020.","Hilt, Evann E; Boocock, James; Trejo, Marisol; Le, Catherine Q; Guo, Longhua; Zhang, Yi; Sathe, Laila; Arboleda, Valerie A; Yin, Yi; Bloom, Joshua S; Wang, Pin-Chieh; Elmore, Joann G; Kruglyak, Leonid; Shrestha, Lasata; Bakhash, Shah A Mohamed; Lin, Michelle; Xie, Hong; Huang, Meei-Li; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Greninger, Alexander; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Yang, Shangxin; Garner, Omai B",Clin. infect. dis,,285

We investigated clinical presentation, imaging and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients of seven hospitals from Jan 20 to March 20, 2020. Multivariate analysis was used to analyse risk factors for progression of patients with COVID-19 combined with HBV infection. Compared with COVID-19 without HBV infection (WHI) group, patients with dual infection had a higher proportion of severe/critically ill disease (32.86% vs. 15.27%, P = .000), higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) [50(28-69)vs 21(14-30), P = .000; 40(25-54) vs 23(18-30), P = .000; 34.0(27.2-38.7) vs 37.2(31.1-41.4), P = .031].

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic.","Wuerzner, Grégoire; Waeber, Bernard",Praxis (Bern 1994),,285

BACKGROUND: Ambiguity in ever-evolving knowledge on how to provide care during COVID-19. Remaining safe has created a sense of urgency, which has in turn created the need for organizations to quickly alter their operational plans and protocols to support measures that increase capacity and establish a culture of safe care and clear communication. However, no known study has described communication in nursing practice during COVID-19. METHODS: Utilizing qualitative descriptive methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 100 nurse participants from May to September 2020 and recorded for thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ), a 32-item checklist, were used to ensure detailed and comprehensive reporting of this qualitative study protocol. FINDINGS: Study participants shared descriptions of how effective communication positively impacted patient care and nursing practice experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The thematic network analyses identified the importance of effective communication across three levels: (1) organizational leadership, (2) unit leadership and (3) nurse-to-nurse communication. Within this structure, three organizing themes, essential to effective communication, were described including (a) presence, (b) education and (c) emotional support. CONCLUSION: Examining existing crisis communication policies and procedures across healthcare organizations is imperative to maintain highly relevant, innovative, and data-driven policies and strategies that are fundamental to preserving quality patient care and supporting optimal nursing practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Effective communication is critical to support nurses through extended periods of crisis. COVID-19 represents a unique contemporary challenge to the nursing workforce given the high stress and prolonged strain it has created for both human and healthcare supply resources. There is value in nurses' presence at local, unit level and organizational leadership levels to convey critical information that directly informs leadership decision-making during unprecedented emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Simonovich, Shannon D; Spurlark, Roxanne S; Badowski, Donna; Krawczyk, Susan; Soco, Cheryl; Ponder, Tiffany N; Rhyner, Debi; Waid, Rachel; Aquino, Elizabeth; Lattner, Christina; Mueller Wiesemann, Lucy; Webber-Ritchey, Kashica; Li, Suling; Tariman, Joseph D",Int. nurs. rev,,285
484622,The Risk of COVID-19 Pandemic in Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Receiving Systemic Treatments,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 outbreak has had an unclear impact on the treatment and outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P<.001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P <.001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P=.017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients. The co-existence of STEMI and SARS-CoV-2 infection was relatively infrequent.","Rodriguez-Leor, Oriol; Cid-Álvarez, Belén; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Rossello, Xavier; Ojeda, Soledad; Serrador, Ana; López-Palop, Ramón; Martín-MoreiraS, Javier; Rumoroso, José Ramón; Cequier, Ángel; Ibáñez, Borja; Cruz-González, Ignacio; Romaguera, Rafael; Moreno, Raúl; Villa, Manuel; Ruíz-Salmerón, Rafael; Molano, Francisco; Sánchez, Carlos; Muñoz-García, Erika; Íñigo, Luís; Herrador, Juan; Gómez-Menchero, Antonio; Caballero, Juan; Cárdenas, Mérida; Gheorghe, Livia; Oneto, Jesús; Morales, Francisco; Valencia, Félix; Ruíz, José Ramón; Diarte, José Antonio; Avanzas, Pablo; Rondán, Juan; Peral, Vicente; Pernasetti, Lucía Vera; Hernández, Julio; Bosa, Francisco; Lorenzo, Pedro Luís Martín; Jiménez, Francisco; Hernández, José M de la Torre; Jiménez-Mazuecos, Jesús; Lozano, Fernando; Moreu, José; Novo, Enrique; Robles, Javier; Moreiras, Javier Martín; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe; Amat-Santos, Ignacio J; Gómez-Hospital, Joan Antoni",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

484832,Reducing the Risk of Diagnostic Error in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to human society: as of March 26, 2020, there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and 1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - which has infected more than 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries - a global pandemic. A growing number of areas reporting local sub-national community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work, we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named $\alpha$-Satellite}, as an initial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with or suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 were collected and tested at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France. Using the World Health Organisation-approved real-time-PCR assay developed by the Charité Institute of Virology as the reference, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 189 negative and 88 positive samples were analyzed. QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 had an NPA of 90.48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 85.37%, 94.26%) and a PPA of 94.32% (95% CI, 87.24%, 98.13%).

Despite the high number of patients treated worldwide, data on respiratory mechanics are currently scarce and the optimal setting of MV remains to be defined. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of available data about respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and MV settings in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, and to identify knowledge gaps. MAIN TEXT: PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to October 30, 2020 for studies providing at least one ventilatory parameter collected within 24 h from the ICU admission. The quality of the studies was independently assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies. A total of 26 studies were included for a total of 14,075 patients. At ICU admission, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) values ranged from 9 to 16.5 cm of water (cmH2O), suggesting that high levels of PEEP were commonly used for setting MV for these patients. Patients with COVID-19 are severely hypoxemic at ICU admission and show a median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ranging from 102 to 198 mmHg. Static respiratory system compliance (Crs) values at ICU admission were highly heterogenous, ranging between 24 and 49 ml/cmH2O. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking agents were widely used, ranging from 17 to 81 and 22 to 88%, respectively; both rates were higher than previously reported in patients with ""classical"" acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CONCLUSIONS: Available data show that, in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, respiratory mechanics and MV settings within 24 h from ICU admission are heterogeneous but similar to those reported for ""classical"" ARDS. However, to date, complete data regarding mechanical properties of respiratory system, optimal setting of MV and the role of rescue treatments for refractory hypoxemia are still lacking in the medical literature.","Grasselli, Giacomo; Cattaneo, Emanuele; Florio, Gaetano; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Zanella, Alberto; Cortegiani, Andrea; Huang, Jianbo; Pesenti, Antonio; Einav, Sharon",Crit Care,,285

However, known racial and socioeconomic disparities in internet access potentially translate into barriers for the use of telehealth, particularly video technology. The specific aim of this study was to determine if disparities in race or socioeconomic status exist among patients utilizing telehealth visits during COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients evaluated in hepatology clinics at Duke University Health System. Visit attempts from a pre-COVID baseline period (January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020; n = 3328) were compared to COVID period (April 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020; n = 3771). RESULTS: On multinomial regression modeling, increasing age was associated with higher odds of a phone or incomplete visit (canceled, no-show, or rescheduled after May 30,2020), and non-Hispanic Black race was associated with nearly twice the odds of completing a phone visit instead of video visit, compared to non-Hispanic White patients. Compared to private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare were associated with increased odds of completing a telephone visit, and Medicaid was associated with increased odds of incomplete visits. Being single or previously married (separated, divorced, widowed) was associated with increased odds of completing a phone compared to video visit compared to being married. CONCLUSIONS: Though liver telehealth has expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, disparities in overall use and suboptimal use (phone versus video) remain for vulnerable populations including those that are older, non-Hispanic Black, or have Medicare/Medicaid health insurance.","Wegermann, Kara; Wilder, Julius M; Parish, Alice; Niedzwiecki, Donna; Gellad, Ziad F; Muir, Andrew J; Patel, Yuval A",Dig. dis. sci,,285
489997,Is hospitalization a risk factor for cognitive decline in older age adults?,2020,"Objective: Occurrence of Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raised the concern about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggering thyroid autoimmunity. Uncertainties remain regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. We carried out a prospective study to characterize the evolution of thyroid function and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. Method: Consecutive adult patients, without known thyroid disorders, admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID-19 from 21 July to 21 September 2020 were included. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured on admission and at 3 months. Positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) was defined by &amp;gt;100 units. Results: Among 200 COVID-19 survivors, 122 had reassessment thyroid function tests (TFTs) (median age: 57.5 years;49.2% men). Baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not have reassessment were comparable. Among the 20 patients with baseline abnormal TFTs on admission, mostly low fT3, 15 recovered. Of the 102 patients with normal TFTs on admission, two (2.0%) had new onset abnormal TFTs, which may represent TFTs in different phases of thyroiditis (one had mildly elevated TSH 5.8 mIU/L, with normal fT4 [16 pmol/L] and fT3 [4.3 pmol/L], the other had mildly raised fT4 25 pmol/L with normal TSH [1.1 mIU/L] and fT3 [4.7 pmol/L]). Among 104 patients with anti-thyroid antibody titers reassessed, we observed increases in anti-TPO (baseline: 28.3 units [IQR 14.0-67.4] vs reassessment: 35.0 units [IQR: 18.8-99.0];p&amp;lt;0.001) and anti-Tg titers (baseline: 6.6 units [IQR 4.9-15.6] vs reassessment: 8.7 units [IQR: 6.6-15.4];p&amp;lt;0.001), but no change in anti-TSHR titer (baseline: 1.0 IU/L [IQR: 0.8-1.2] vs reassessment: 1.0 IU/L [IQR: 0.8-1.3];p=0.486). Of the 82 patients with negative anti-TPO at baseline, 16 had significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by &amp;gt;12 units (2×6 [precision of the anti-TPO assay in normal range being 6 units per SD]), of these, four became anti-TPO positive. Factors associated a significant increase in anti-TPO titer included worse baseline clinical severity (p=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (p=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (p=0.005). Conclusion: Majority of thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis could occur during convalescence, though uncommon. Importantly, we provided the novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19, suggesting the potential of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering thyroid autoimmunity, which warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","Lui, David T.

The present work aimed to analyze the differences in the scores of the Adolescents' Food Habits Checklist (AFHC) before and during the pandemic in the Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population. The PLACE-19 Study was conducted during the pandemic among a population of 2448 students recruited from secondary schools in all regions of Poland using a random quota sampling. The participants were required to complete an AFHC consisting of 23 items pertaining to food purchase, preparation, and consumption habits. Current habits (during the pandemic) and previous habits were assessed and scored separately. The total (p = 0.001), purchase (p < 0.001), and consumption scores (p = 0.014) indicated that the AFHC scores during the pandemic were higher than before. For questions on purchase habits, a lower number of respondents reported eating in a restaurant, eating takeaway meals, having lunch away from home, or buying pastries, cakes or crisps. For questions on preparation habits, an greater number of respondents reported that they usually avoided eating fried food and tried to keep their overall sugar intake down, but fewer respondents said they tried to have low-fat desserts. For questions on consumption habits, a lower number of respondents reported that they usually ate a dessert or pudding if one were available and a larger number said they made sure to eat at least one serving of vegetables or salad a day and at least three servings of fruit most days. Based on the obtained results, it may be stated that although there was an increase in the AFHC scores during the pandemic, a similar share of respondents showed improved or worsened food habits, and a similar share changed their food habits from healthy to unhealthy and from unhealthy to healthy. At the same time, a majority of changes were associated with purchase habits, which were probably forced by lockdowns and the resultant restrictions in eating out or grocery shopping.","Skolmowska, Dominika; Glabska, Dominika; Guzek, Dominika",Nutrients,,285

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-11.17) and 6.59 (3.25-13.35), respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is comparable to the general population. Outcomes of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients are worse in ulcerative colitis, those on steroids or 5-aminosalicylates but outcomes are better with biological agents.","Singh, Anupam Kumar; Jena, Anuraag; Kumar-M, Praveen; Sharma, Vishal; Sebastian, Shaji",United European Gastroenterol J,,285

Developing vaccines would need a good knowledge of genetic properties of SARS-CoV-2. The most fundamental approach is to look into the structures of its RNA, in particular, the nucleotides and amino acids. This motivates our research on this topic. We study the occurrence structures of nitrogenous bases and amino acids. To this aim, we devise a structural metric which could measure the structure differences for bases or amino acids. By analyzing various SARS-CoV-2 samples, we calculate the distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids. Based on the distance matrices, we find the average distance matrices for them, respectively. Then we identify the relations of all the minimal distances between bases and amino acids. The results also show that different substructures would yield much more diversified distances between amino acids. In the end, we also conduct the comparison of our structural metric with other frequently used metrics, in particular, Hausdorff metrics.","Chen, Ray-Ming",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,285
492280,Elevated Extracellular Volume Fraction and Reduced Global Longitudinal Strains in Participants Recovered from COVID-19 without Clinical Cardiac Findings,2021,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a complex genetic system that encodes proteins which predominantly regulate immune/inflammatory processes. It can be involved in a variety of immuno-inflammatory disorders ranging from infections to autoimmunity and cancers. The HLA system is also suggested to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, especially through microglia regulation and synaptic pruning. Consequently, this highly polymorphic gene region has recently emerged as a major player in the etiology of several major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder and with less evidence for major depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We thus review here the role of HLA genes in particular subgroups of psychiatric disorders and foresee their potential implication in future research. In particular, given the prominent role that the HLA system plays in the regulation of viral infection, this review is particularly timely in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Tamouza, Ryad; Krishnamoorthy, Rajagopal; Leboyer, Marion",Brain behav. immun,,285
492820,Accompanying Patients in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"AIMS: In the Danish population, we examined whether patients treated with thiopurines, methotrexate, systemic corticosteroids, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; agents, anti-interleukin therapeutic agents, selective immunosuppressive agents and cyclosporine/tacrolimus had an increased risk of hospitalization for COVID- 19, compared to the background population. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study including all people alive in Denmark on 1 March 2020. Exposed patients constituted those exposed to thiopurines (n = 5484), methotrexate (n = 17 977), systemic corticosteroids (n = 55 868), anti-TNF-&#945; agents (n = 17 857), anti-interleukin therapeutic agents (n = 3744), selective immunosuppressive agents (n = 3026) and cyclosporine/tacrolimus (n = 1143) in a period of 12 months prior to 1 March 2020 (estimated time of outbreak in Denmark). We estimated the adjusted risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 for patients treated with the above-mentioned categories of medications, compared to the rest of the population. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratios of hospitalization in patients treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine/tacrolimus were 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 2.00) and 4.75 (95% CI 1.96 to 11.49), respectively. The risks of hospitalization in patients treated with thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-TNF-&#945; agents, were 1.93 (95% CI 0.91 to 4.08), 0.74 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.28), 1.00 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.94), respectively. The number of outcomes in patients treated with anti-interleukin therapeutic agents and selective immunosuppressive agents was too small for analysis. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine/tacrolimus had a significantly increased risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Our study does not uncover whether the increased risk is related to the drug itself, the underlying condition for which the patient is treated or other factors.","Nørgård, Bente Mertz; Nielsen, Jan; Knudsen, Torben; Nielsen, Rasmus Gaardskaer; Larsen, Michael Due; Jølving, Line Riis; Kjeldsen, Jens",,,285

This review examines the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of STEMI admissions, and relationship between the pandemic and door-to-balloon time (D2B), all-cause mortality and other secondary STEMI outcomes. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to primarily compare D2B time and in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients who underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influence of geographical region and income status of a country on STEMI care. An online database search included studies comparing the aforementioned outcomes between STEMI patients during and before the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 32 articles were analyzed. Overall, 19,140 and 68,662 STEMI patients underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic respectively. Significant delay in D2B was observed during the pandemic (WMD=8.10mins; CI:3.90-12.30mins; p=0.0002, I2=90%). In-hospital mortality was higher during the pandemic (OR=1.27; CI:1.09-1.49; p=0.002, I2=36%), however this varied with factors such as geographical location and income status of a country. Subgroup analysis found that low-middle income countries observed a higher rate of mortality during the pandemic (OR=1.52; CI:1.13-2.05; p=0.006), with a similar but insignificant trend seen among the high income countries (OR=1.17; CI:0.95-1.44; p=0.13). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with worse STEMI performance metrics and clinical outcome, particularly in the Eastern low-middle income status countries. Better strategies are needed to address these global trends in STEMI care during the pandemic.","Chew, Nicholas Ws; Ow, Zachariah Gene Wing; Teo, Vanessa Xin Yi; Heng, Ryan Rui Yang; Ng, Cheng Han; Lee, Chi-Hang; Low, Adrian F; Chan, Mark Yan-Yee; Yeo, Tiong-Cheng; Tan, Huay-Cheem; Loh, Poay-Huan",Can. j. cardiol,,285

Its objective is the epidemiological monitoring of patients with end-stage chronic renal failure. This registry, backed by its expertise and its national network, has been able to very quickly set up epidemiological monitoring of chronic dialysis and/or transplant patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. The first results show a relatively low frequency of COVID-19 in dialysis patients (4.9%) contrary to what one might have feared. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant patients is 1.8% nationwide. All regions of France have not been affected in the same way. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients varied by region, reaching up to 10%. The probability of being affected was higher in men and diabetic patients. At October 19, among 3209 infected patients (dialysis and transplant), 573 died from a cause related to SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality in diagnosed cases was 18%.

498075,Increased Incidence of COVID-19 Infections Amongst Interpersonal Violence Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in prone position is challenging. Innovative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe to perform TTE for such patients has been described; but reproducibility and correlation of the TTE measurements by this technique with those obtained by the standard supine TTE study are still unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 30 non-COVID-19 individuals, with a mean (SD) age 35 (10.9) years and 11 females, to study the agreement between the transthoracic measurements of the left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), aortic dimensions, and ejection fraction (EF) obtained in prone position using an external TEE probe versus the standard supine position using the conventional TTE probe. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and aortic root dimensions in the prone versus the supine positions, while the mean EF (60.3% vs 63.1%, P = .014) and mean LA dimensions (1.8 vs 1.9 cm/m2 , P < .001) were significantly lower in the prone position. The mean time of scans was significantly longer in the prone as compared to the supine position (12.5 vs 4.5 minutes, P < .001). All supine studies had good quality while in the prone position four studies were of poor quality, and one was nondiagnostic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of cardiac dimensions and systolic function in the prone position using transthoracic TEE probe was feasible. LV and aortic dimensions agreed well with the standard TTE in supine position; however, LA dimensions and EF were lower in the prone position.","Taha, Hesham S; Mohamed, Ahmed M; Mahrous, Hossam A; Shaker, Mirna M; Alsayed, Osama S; Sayed, Hadeer G; Rizk, Hussien H; Abdelwahab, Mohamed A",Echocardiography,,285

METHODS: During a 10-week study period from March 16 to May 22, 2020, changes to educational block-weeks (BW) of first through fourth year residents (R1-4) were documented as disrupted in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first 5 weeks and the second 5 weeks were evaluated separately for temporal differences. Overall and mean disrupted BW per resident were documented. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess pairwise differences between classes with Bonferroni-adjusted P-values, as well as differences in the early versus later phase of the pandemic. RESULTS: Of 373 BW, 56.6% were assigned to virtual curriculum, 39.4% radiology clinical duties, 2.9% illness, and 1.1% reassignment. Scheduling intervention affected 6.2 ± 2.3 (range 1-10) mean BW per resident over the 10-week study period. The R3 class experienced the largest disruption, greater than the R2 classes, and statistically significantly more than the R1 and R4 classes (both P < 0.05). The second half of the pandemic caused statistically significantly more schedule disruptions than the first half (Pâ¯=â¯0.009). DISCUSSION: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic varied by residency class year, with the largest disruption of the R3 class and the least disruption of the R4 class. To optimize future educational opportunities, shifting to a competency-based education paradigm may help to achieve proficiency without extending the length of the training program.","Shi, Junzi; Miskin, Nityanand; Dabiri, Borna E; DeSimone, Ariadne K; Schaefer, Peter M; Bay, Camden; Guenette, Jeffrey P; Gaviola, Glenn C",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,,285

Assessing prevalence of mental disorders, as well as to find potential protective variables is very important in order to determine people's psychological suffering. It provides the basis for teaching possible coping styles in order to prevent a major breakdown on mental health. Prevalence on mental disorders was expected to increase during the pandemic, especially depression, (general-/and health-) anxiety, panic attacks- and disorder, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, potentially protective variables, such as resilience and coping, were included. METHODS: N = 949 subjects completed an online-survey that asked for symptoms regarding depression, (health) anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and lock-down related behavior-starting 14 days after lockdown in Germany. RESULTS: Prevalence of mental disorders in the current sample was much higher than usual prevalence of mental disorders, with 50.6% expressing at least one mental disorder. Resilience was associated with lower risks for any mental disorder (OR = 4.23, p < .0001, 95%CI = 3.21-5.57), as well as with any other measured mental illness (all ORs between = 2.82 for obsessive-compulsive disorder and OR = 41.44 for panic disorder, all p < .001). Similar results were obtained regarding coping (focus on positive). CONCLUSION: Results are highly relevant in order to provide a glance on what substantial influence the current pandemic- and lockdown situation has on mental health across the country, and possibly across the world. Possible ways in order to prevent deterioration and help coping with the current situation are being elaborated and discussed.","Munk, Aisha J L; Schmidt, Norina M; Alexander, Nina; Henkel, Katrina; Hennig, Juergen",PLoS One,,285
500267,Circulating cardiovascular microRNAs in critically ill COVID-19 patients,2021,"COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Thought to be of zoonotic origin, it has been named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and has spread rapidly. As of April 20, 2020, there have been >2.4 million cases recorded worldwide. The inflammatory process, cytokine storm, and lung injury that are associated with COVID-19 can put patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. The total incidence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients is currently uncertain. Those with more severe disease and with other risk factors, including increasing age, male sex, obesity, cancer, comorbidities, and intensive care unit admission, are at higher risk of these events. However, there is little international guidance on managing these risks in COVID-19 patients.

As treatment times for patients are uncertain, this remains a strongly NP-hard problem. Therefore, we introduce a complex flexible job shop scheduling model. In the process of physical examination for suspected patients, the physical examiner is considered a job, and the physical examination item and equipment correspond to an operation and a machine, respectively. We incorporate the processing time of the patient during the physical examination, the transportation time between equipment, and the setup time of the patient. A unique scheduling algorithm, called imperialist competition algorithm with global search strategy (ICA_GS) is developed for solving the physical examination scheduling problem. A local search strategy is embedded into ICA_GS for enhancing the searching behaviors, and a global search strategy is investigated to prevent falling into local optimality. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested by simulating the execution of the physical examination scheduling processes, which verify that the proposed algorithm can better solve the physical examination scheduling problem.","Yu, Hui Jun-qing Li Zhang Lijing Duan Peng",Applied Intelligence,,285

The aim of these systems is the description, analysis, and evaluation of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), the identification of the circulating viruses, and the trend. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV­2.Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEEDARE, and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population. In order to expand the systems to SARS-CoV­2, only a few adjustments were needed.As the case definitions for ARIs were preserved, historical baselines of the systems can still be used for comparison. All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates.This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required.The surveillance systems have proven to be feasible and efficient in the COVID-19 pandemic, even when compared internationally.","Goerlitz, Luise; Tolksdorf, Kristin; Buchholz, Udo; Prahm, Kerstin; Preuß, Ute; An der Heiden, Matthias; Wolff, Thorsten; Dürrwald, Ralf; Nitsche, Andreas; Michel, Janine; Haas, Walter; Buda, Silke",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,285

However, in the absence of signs of infection or at resolution thereof, inappropriately and persistently high PCT may suggest and reveal the presence of other pathologies. We report a patient with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia in whom persistence of initially elevated PCT during recovery prompted the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Case report: A 43- year-old man presented with a two-day history of fever, sneezing, sore throat and dry cough. Physical exam revealed decreased sounds and coarse crackles in both lung bases at auscultation. Medical history was positive for cognitive impairment since birth, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis. Initial studies included mild lymphocytopenia 650/µl (760 - 5000), D-Dimer 0.73 µg/ml (< 0.5), C reactive protein (CRP) of 62 mg/l (< 5) and PCT of 94 ng/ml (0.00 - 0.10). Positivity for SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected and chest computerized tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the basilar lung zones and hyperdense and irregular foci in the thoracic vertebral bodies. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started and was maintained for seven days but, despite clinical improvement and the normalization of CRP, serum PCT was persistently high (84 ng/ml). Serum calcitonin (CTN) was 2120 pg/ml (normal up to 12 pg/ml). Neck ultrasound revealed inhomogeneously echogenic lymph nodes with small punctate calcifications and a non-homogeneous thyroid with multiple nodules. Cytological examination by fine needle aspiration and CTN measurement on washing liquid confirmed the suspicion of MTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed MTC of right thyroid lobe and metastasis at lymph nodes of the central right midneck area. Blood tests performed 48 hours after surgery showed a lowering of CTN (986 pg/mL) and PCT (16 ng/mL). A 6-months follow up showed persistent increased CTN and PCT levels (921 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively) while a (18)F-fluorodihydro-xyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET did not reveal any suspicious fixations at thyroid lodge and cervical lymph node stations while multiple osteoblastic foci in the skeletal area were described. A close follow-up was planned with establishment of the results of RET gene analysis. Discussion: Although CTN is the gold standard biochemical parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC, PCT can be useful as a biochemical marker of MTC suspicion in patients with inflammatory conditions and persistently elevated PCT even after resolution. In the present CASE, high levels of PCT in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia without signs of bacterial infection, allowed to diagnose MCT. Conclusion: In the absence of any other signs of infection, a complete clinical assessment, including neck palpation, CTN measurement and thyroid ultrasound should be performed in the presence of persistently elevated PCT.","Laura, Gianotti; Salvatore, D039; Agnano,; Giorgio, Pettiti; Francesco, Tassone; Giorgio, Giraudo; Corrado, Lauro; Giuseppe, Lauria; Valerio, Del Bono; Giorgio, Borretta",,,285
502456,"Does COVID-19 cause an increase in spleen dimensions? Possible effects of immune activation, hematopoietic suppression and microthrombosis",2021,"Homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral- or vaccine-induced autoimmunity. Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of ""immune enhancement""). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MCH Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.","Lyons-Weiler, James",J Transl Autoimmun,,285
502613,Long Covid Implications for the workplace,2021,"Droplet generation and transport during coughing and sneezing has been studied for decades to characterize disease transmission by symptomatic individuals. Nevertheless, many reports document that asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of COVID-19, probably during conversations in social interactions. Researchers have shown that droplet emission occurs during speech, yet there are few quantitative studies of the flows that provide the transport mechanism; the relevant fluid dynamics is largely unstudied. This lack of quantitative characterization means that when virus is present there is little public health guidance for understanding risk and mitigation strategies, e.g. the""six-foot rule"". Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including linguistic features, using order-of-magnitudes estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We show how plosive sounds like `P' are associated with vortical structures, leading to rapid transport over half a meter in a split second. When produced individually, puffs decay over a meter, with the distance traveled in time $t$ scaling as $L\sim t^{1/4}$, and mix with the slower environmental circulation. In contrast, the transport of exhaled material over time scales longer than a few seconds, characteristic of speech, which is effectively a train of puffs, is a conical turbulent jet with a scaling law $L\sim t^{1/2}$. Typically, the exhaled air in front of a speaker extends 2 m after 30 seconds of normal speech. We believe this work will inform thinking about aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerolinguistics.","Abkarian, Manouk; Mendez, Simon; Xue, Nan; Yang, Fan; Stone, Howard A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10671v1.pdf,285

We focus on data collection and evaluation of algorithm performance in the context of estimating the density of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breast cancer. Methods: We digitized 64 glass slides of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained ductal carcinoma core biopsies prepared at a single clinical site. We created training materials and workflows to crowdsource pathologist image annotations on two modes: an optical microscope and two digital platforms. The workflows collect the ROI type, a decision on whether the ROI is appropriate for estimating the density of sTILs, and if appropriate, the sTIL density value for that ROI. Results: The pilot study yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration. Furthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and there is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to improve our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods to account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when validating an algorithm. Conclusion: We have built workflows for efficient data collection and tested them in a pilot study.

504513,ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Management of Cushing's syndrome,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is one of the most common surgical practices in Spain. However, this procedure currently has longest delay on surgical waiting lists (SWL). We have developed a special surgical program that aims to reduce this waiting list and to assess the economic and clinical repercussions in a high-volume bariatric surgery unit. METHODS: A three-month prospective study was carried out comparing outcomes, results and perioperative resources consumed for 45 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who underwent the standard procedure in the operating room, and patients treated in the special program. Epidemiological, healthcare and economic factors were taken into account. RESULTS: Two homogeneous groups of patients were operated on, successfully reducing the SWL. Morbidity was similar in both groups and the average cost of the surgeries performed was 5,331.40; in the standard group, the cost was 5,372.50±798.10, and the cost of the special program group was 5,290.30±685.10, with no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitals with a high volume of bariatric surgery, it is feasible to incorporate special surgical programs that are able to reduce surgical waiting lists, while maintaining quality criteria and without incurring a greater expense to the healthcare system.","Kraus-Fischer, Gabriel; Alfonso-Ballester, Raquel; Mora-Oliver, Isabel; Cassinello-Fernández, Norberto; Ortega-Serrano, Joaquín",Cir.

504540,Beyond Black and White: Mapping Misclassification of Medicare Beneficiaries Race and Ethnicity,2020,"This paper estimates the efficiency of operating intercity bus lines in Chungnam province over the period 2017–2020, and then empirically analyzes the determinants of the efficiency. In particular, it evaluates to what extent the efficiency in 2020 decreased due to COVID-19 and which characteristics of lines (length of a line, frequency of operation, whether a line operates via highways and includes the capital region or not) affected the efficiency during the pandemic through a tobit model. The empirical results show that the efficiency in the operation of intercity bus lines in Chungnam was higher in 2018 and 2019 compared to 2017, but dropped in 2020 by 15.8%. It appears that the efficiency is higher when a line operates more frequently and covers a longer distance, but the efficiency increases at a decreasing rate as the operating distance becomes longer. In addition, the difference in the efficiency according to operating distance due to COVID-19 seems to be statistically significant. Given that intercity bus lines are heavily dependent upon a (local) government’s financial support and the amount of this support needs to reflect the degree to which the efficiency has decreased due to COVID-19 as an external shock, it is important to precisely estimate the magnitude of the efficiency reduction from both a policy and academic standpoint.","Kim, Wonchul Hong Sung Hyo",Sustainability,,285

505802,The global impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgical services,2020,"Background: With the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc globally, the extremely vulnerable subset of cancer palliative care patients has to go through the worst nightmare. Difficulty in accessing medical care in the event of increased symptom burden, obstacles in reaching hospitals at time of emergencies or end of life, limited access to medication, social distancing causing isolation, leading to psychosocial burden, lack of bereavement support, are few of the issues we identified. Palliative home care is an important tool to allay the anxieties and address the fears of cancer patients and caregivers, by ensuring continuity of care and providing the much needed handholding in these difficult times. This article aims to highlight the home-based care strategy and experience of the Cipla Palliative Care and Training Center during the COVID-19 lockdown. Materials and Methods: We have utilized the data of documentation of the process of designing the protocol, the data entered by the team on unique data management software that is used at the palliative care center to record all palliative care interventions and reflections of the team on their experience of home visits during this period. Results: Continuity of care through home visits will ensure better management of patients in terms of physical symptoms, psychosocial support, allaying fears, and anxieties, as well as the ultimate goal of an improved quality of life. Physical symptoms (24%), morphine drop off (19%), psychosocial support (15%), end of life care (33%), and procedures (9%) were the major indications of visits. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for support, thus reiterating the importance of continuity of care. With abundant precautions and protocols in place, home care through visits is possible. With the lockdown and restrictions now entering their fourth phase, we need to be ready now more than ever to adapt to changing times and evolving definitions of the 'New Normal.'.","Page, Nivedita; Naik, Vinay; Singh, Priya; Fernandes, Prakash; Nirabhawane, Vivek; Chaudhari, Santosh",Indian J.

506685,"COVID-19: Complement, Coagulation, and Collateral Damage",2020,"This study focuses on the communication strategies employed by the Ugandan government in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used a mixed method approach, including interviews, questionnaires and content analysis. A sample size of 400 was drawn for the survey, five community leaders and health workers were interviewed and 270 COVID-19 media reports were used for the content analysis. The findings showed that the government of Uganda did not engage in dialogue at the grassroots level. Secondly, it was found that the media generally reported on the spread of the virus and the number of daily deaths. However, the findings also showed that the media largely supported and complemented the government’s efforts. Finally, little or no effort was made to engage with communities before major preventive and protective measures were announced and enforced by the government. It was suggested that grassroots dialogue and community engagement must be carried out before major decisions are made by the government if they are to be effective in the future. © 2021 by authors;licensee OJCMT.","Awobamise, A.

507535,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Timing of Childhood Cancer Diagnoses,2021,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) is an effective treatment for advanced motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, a connection between the limbic part of the STN and side effects of DBS-STN has been increasingly recognized. Animal studies have shown that DBS-STN influences behavior and provokes neurochemical changes in regions of the limbic system. Some of these regions, which are activated during DBS-STN, are involved in neuroimmunomodulation. The therapeutic effects of DBS-STN in PD treatment are clear, but the influence of DBS-STN on peripheral immunity has not been reported so far. In this study, we examined the effects of unilateral DBS-STN applied in male Wistar rats with 6-hydroxydopamine PD model (DBS-6OHDA) and rats without nigral dopamine depletion (DBS) on corticosterone (CORT) plasma concentration, blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC), leukocyte numbers, lymphocyte population and apoptosis numbers, plasma interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) concentration. The same peripheral immune parameters we measured also in non-stimulated rats with PD model (6OHDA). We observed peripheral immunity changes related to PD model. The NKCC and percentage of T cytotoxic lymphocytes were enhanced, while the level of lymphocyte apoptosis was down regulated in 6OHDA and DBS-6OHDA groups. After DBS-STN (DBS-6OHDA and DBS groups), the plasma CORT and TNF-&#945; were elevated, the number of NK cells and percentage of apoptosis were increased, while the number of B lymphocytes was decreased. We also found, changes in plasma IFN-Î³ and IL-6 levels in all the groups. These results suggest potential peripheral immunomodulative effects of DBS-STN in the rat model of PD. However, further studies are necessary to explain these findings and their clinical implication.

507709,The Other Side of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is a multi-system disease, with coagulation abnormalities. D-dimer levels are increased in this disease. We aimed to determine the association of D-dimer levels and mortality and to establish its optimal cut off values in predicting mortality. Association of D-dimer levels with diabetes mellitus has also been established. METHODS: Information on 483 patients with confirmed COVID-19 was retrospectively collected and analyzed. The optimal D-dimer cutoff point and C-statistic of routine tests both on admission and during hospital stay were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: D-dimer elevation (&#8805;0.50 µg/mL) was seen in 80.1% of the hospitalized patients. D-dimer level &#8805;2.01 µg/mL was a significant predictor of subsequent deaths (P < 0.01; HR, 3.165; 95% CI, 2.013-4.977). High D-dimer values (&#8805;0.50 µg/mL) were observed in 72 of the 75 (96%) cases with a fatal outcome. Median D-dimer value among non-survivors was 6.34 µg/mL and among survivors it was 0.94 µg/mL. A higher proportion of fatal outcomes occurred in patients with underlying disease (89.0%), most prominent of which was diabetes mellitus (66%). The median D-dimer value was found to be significantly high in diabetic patients (1.68 µg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Among the measured coagulation parameters, D-dimer during hospital stay had the highest C-index to predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. D-dimer value &#8805; 2.01 µg/mL can effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. A significant association of increased D-dimer level has been found with diabetes mellitus and elderly age.","Soni, Mamta; Gopalakrishnan, Ram; Vaishya, Raju; Prabu, P",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,285

RNA-Seq profiling detected and quantified 19,653 in the testis and 18,407 in the epididymis. Proteomic profiling resulted in the identification of a total of 11,024 and 10,386 proteins in the testis and epididymis, respectively, including 110 proteins that previously have been classified as MPs (missing proteins). Furthermore, Five MPs expressed in testis were validated by the MRM method. Subsequently, multi-omcis between testis and epididymis were performed, including biological functions and pathways of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) in each group, revealing that those differences were related to spermatogenesis, male gamete generation, as well as reproduction. In conclusion, this study can help us find the expression regularity of missing protein and help related scientists understand the physiological functions of testis and epididymis more deeply.","Zheng, Weimin; Zhang, Yang; Sun, Chuanyu; Ge, Shengyang; Tan, Yifan; Shen, Huali; Yang, Pengyuan",Molecules (Basel),,285

Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about 22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units.

AIM: This systematic review aims to provide an insightful understanding of traditional uses, chemical composition, pharmacological effect and clinical application of T. hemsleyanum, and lay a foundation for the further study and for the utilization of T. hemsleyanum resource. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A domestic and overseas literature search in known databases was conducted for published articles using the relevant keywords. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-two chemical constituents identified from T. hemsleyanum have been reported, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, polysaccharide, organic acids, fatty acids, terpenoids, steroids, amino acid and others. Among these components, flavonoids and polysaccharides were the representative active ingredients of T. hemsleyanum, which have been widely investigated. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that these components exhibited various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antivirus, antitumor, antipyretic, anti-hepatic injury, immunomodulatory, antibacterial etc. Moreover, different toxicological studies indicated that the clinical dosage of T. hemsleyanum was safe and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Modern pharmacological studies have well supported and clarified some traditional uses, and T. hemsleyanum has a good prospect for the development of new drugs due to these outstanding properties. However, the present findings did not provide an in-depth evaluation of bioactivity of the extracts, the composition of its active extracts was not clear.

On the basis of this issue, neurologists are very concerned about patients with neurological disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS), as consumers of immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs. Therefore, the administration of proper disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID-19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID-19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm.

Self-induced sputum in those with a productive cough and saliva in those without a productive cough have been proposed, but sensitivity remains uncertain. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 2 regional hospitals in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We prospectively examined 563 serial samples collected during the virus shedding periods of 50 patients: 150 deep throat saliva (DTS), 309 pooled-nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs, and 104 sputum. Deep throat saliva had the lowest overall reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive rate (68.7% vs 89.4% [sputum] and 80.9% [pooled NP and throat swabs]) and the lowest viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration (mean log copy/mL 3.54 vs 5.03 [sputum] and 4.63 [pooled NP and throat swabs]). Analyses with respect to time from symptom onset and severity also revealed similar results. Virus yields of DTS correlated with that of sputum (Pearson correlation index 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.86). We estimated that the overall false-negative rate of DTS could be as high as 31.3% and increased 2.7 times among patients without sputum.

Although most patients present a mild infection, effective strategies are required for patients who develop the severe disease. Anti-inflammatory treatment with JAK inhibitors has been considered in SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this study, we presented our experience in a group of severe SARS-CoV-2 Chilean patients. This prospective study was performed on consecutive patients presenting severe respiratory failure owing to COVID-19 or high-risk clinical condition associated with SARS-CoV-2, and who were treated with ruxolitinib for management of associated inflammation. Overall, 18 patients presenting SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced hyperinflammation were treated with ruxolitinib, with 16 patients previously treated with steroids, 4 with tocilizumab, and 3 with both treatments. RESULTS: Ten patients evolved with favorable response, including 7 patients admitted with severe respiratory failure (PaFi less than 200 mm Hg in high-flow nasal cannula), presenting complete regression of hyperinflammation, regression of the lung lesions, and subsequent discharge. In the remaining 8 patients, 25% showed reduced inflammation, but early discharge was not achieved owing to the slow evolution of respiratory failure. Unfortunately, 3 patients demonstrated a severe respiratory failure. The early initiation of ruxolitinib was found to be associated with better clinical evolution (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: In this study, ruxolitinib resolved hyperinflammatory state in 55% of the patients, regardless of the previous steroid or tocilizumab therapy. Unfortunately, few patients demonstrated severe evolution despite ruxolitinib therapy. Notably, the treatment starting time appears to play an important role in achieving good outcomes. Further validation in randomized controlled trials is crucial.","Sarmiento, Mauricio; Rojas, Patricio; Jerez, Joaquin; Bertín, Pablo; Campbell, James; García, Maria J; Pereira, Jaime; Triantafilo, Nicolas; Ocqueteau, Mauricio",Acta Haematol,,285
511939,COVID -19: A Scoping review,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a devastating global pandemic and continues to overwhelm the health-care facilities and shatter the economies of countries worldwide. Although it primarily affects the lungs, it shares a strong interplay with the cardiovascular system. The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose the patients to increased severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself leads to various cardiovascular complications, which increase its associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients. It is, therefore, prudent to review the rapidly evolving data in this field and understand the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular involvement of this lethal disease.","Mahajan, Kunal; Chandra, K.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of arterial and venous thromboembolic disease, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the authors designed a multicenter, observational cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,114 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed through our Mass General Brigham integrated health network. The total cohort was analyzed by site of care: intensive care (n = 170); hospitalized nonintensive care (n = 229); and outpatient (n = 715). The primary study outcome was a composite of adjudicated major arterial or venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were 22.3% Hispanic/Latinx and 44.2% non-White. Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension (35.8%), hyperlipidemia (28.6%), and diabetes (18.0%) were common. Prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 89.4% of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care cohort and 84.7% of those in the hospitalized nonintensive care setting. Frequencies of major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular adverse events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism were highest in the intensive care cohort (35.3%, 45.9%, and 27.0 %, respectively) followed by the hospitalized nonintensive care cohort (2.6%, 6.1%, and 2.2%, respectively) and the outpatient cohort (0% for all). CONCLUSIONS: Major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred with high frequency in patients with COVID-19, especially in the intensive care setting, despite a high utilization rate of thromboprophylaxis.","Piazza, Gregory; Campia, Umberto; Hurwitz, Shelley; Snyder, Julia E; Rizzo, Samantha M; Pfeferman, Mariana B; Morrison, Ruth B; Leiva, Orly; Fanikos, John; Nauffal, Victor; Almarzooq, Zaid; Goldhaber, Samuel Z",J Am Coll Cardiol,,285

Diagnostic reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG seroconversion studies have therefore been carried out. We present three cases of herpes virus infections in immunocompetent patients: one of the infections was herpes simplex 1 in a 40-year-old woman, and the other two were herpes varicella-zoster infections in a 62-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman. The patients were in the care of the southern health district of Seville of the SAS (Andalusian Health Service) during the Spanish state of alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in only one of the three cases. In this study, we briefly review the etiopathogenic role of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, whereby immunodeficiencies are generated that favour the appearance of other viral infections, such as herpes virus infections.","Maldonado, M D; Romero-Aibar, J; Pérez-San-Gregorio, M A",Epidemiol Infect,,285
515102,Hospital-based headache care during the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark and Norway,2020,"In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, which is responsible for a new human disease called COVID-19. Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.","Hureau, Maxence; Versyck, Maaike; Fontainre, Sylvie; Lambiotte, Fabien; El Beki, Nabil; Saint Leger, Piehr",Anaesthesiol.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the A. Manzoni Hospital (Lecco, Lombardy Region, Italy) and referred to the UCP-H between 11 March 2020 and 18 April 2020, the period of maximum spread of COVID-19 in this area. Data were collected on the type of hospitalisation, triage process, modality of palliative care and psychological support provided. RESULTS: 146 COVID-10 patients were referred to the UCP-H. Of these, 120 died during the observation time (82%) while 15 (10.2%) improved and were discharged from the UCP-H care. 93 had less favourable characteristics (rapid deterioration of respiratory function, old age, multiple comorbidities) and an intensive clinical approach was considered contraindicated, while 48 patients had more favourable presentations. Mean follow-up was 4.8 days. A mean of 4.3 assessments per patient were performed. As to respiratory support, 94 patients were treated with oxygen only (at different volumes) and 45 with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). CONCLUSION: The ongoing pandemic highlighted the need for dedicated palliative care teams and units for dying patients. This work highlights how palliative medicine specialist can make a fundamental contribution thanks to their ability and work experience in an organised multiprofessional context.","Riva, Luca; Caraceni, Augusto; Vigorita, Federico; Berti, Jacopo; Martinelli, Maria Pia; Crippa, Matteo; Pellegrini, Giacomo; Scaccabarozzi, Gianlorenzo",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,285

SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological mediator of coronavirus 2 (COVID-19), characterized by pneumonic contagion in human beings. In spite of forceful suppression, this virus has spread worldwide. No specific drugs have been approved by the FDA for treating COVID-19 patients. Objective: The study intended to examine the data from studies on clinical management of COVID-19. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. The sources of data included bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, Embase, PsychINFO, WanFang Data, and PubMed. The search terms were treatment of the novel coronavirus, management of nCoV-19, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. Setting: The study took place in the main library of the University of Sargodha in Sargodha, Pakistan. Results: The study identified 42 unique studies that had reported and confirmed over 1500 cases of nCoV-19 by April 21, 2020. The studies found that clinical management, for patients who presented with symptoms, included supportive care and control measures that comprised mechanical ventilator support and supplementary oxygen. Conclusions: There have been intensive attempts to explore drug therapy for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during this COVID-19 pandemic. Several drugs have been identified which including remdesivir, two antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and immunosuppressive agents. The effects of most drug interventions are currently highly uncertain and several drugs and vaccines are under trail for the effective treatment of COVID-19 virus, until an effective treatment will discover social distancing and physical hygiene should be practiced strictly.","Nazir, Saeed Ur Rashid; Nazir, Taha; Sultana, Misbah; Shamim, Rahat; Riaz, Humayun; Sultana Munir, Safia; Kayani, Ruqaiya Rasheed; Manzoor, Saba; Islam, Azharul",Altern. ther. health med,,285
517855,Can We Test Our Way Out of the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, as sample's viral load become low, rapid decrease in abundances of several amplicons were seen. In this report, we will show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR. Based on this, we propose 12 alternative primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network's original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set.","Itokawa, Kentaro; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Hashino, Masanori; Tanaka, Rina; Kuroda, Makoto",PLoS One,,285

Elevated MUC1 levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. Our screen identifies fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, fostamatinib reduces MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by the active metabolite R406 promotes MUC1 removal from the cell surface.

AIM OF THE WORK: This work aims at mapping priorities for post-COVID planning for better balance between distance learning and face to face learning. METHODS: This qualitative study aimed to develop a model for utilizing DL using The Polarity Approach for Continuity and Transformation (PACT)&#8482;. A virtual mapping session was held with 79 faculty from 19 countries. They worked in small groups to determine upsides and downsides of face-to-face and DL subsequently. An initial polarity map was generated identifying five tension areas; Faculty, Students, Curriculum, Social aspects and Logistics. A 63-item assessment tool was generated based on this map, piloted and then distributed as a self-administered assessment. The outcomes of this assessment were utilized for another mapping session to discuss warning signs and action steps to maintain upsides and avoid downsides of each pole. RESULTS: Participants agreed that face-to-face teaching allows them to inspire students and have meaningful connections with them. They also agreed that DL provides a good environment for most students. However, students with financial challenges and special needs may not have equal opportunities to access technology. As regards social issues, participants agreed that face-to-face learning provides a better chance for professionalism through enhanced team-work. Cognitive, communication and clinical skills are best achieved in face-to-face. Participants agreed that logistics for conducting DL are much more complicated when compared to face-to-face learning. Participants identified around 10 warning signs for each method that need to be continuously monitored in order to minimize the drawbacks of over focusing on one pole at the expense of the other. Action steps were determined to ensure optimized use of in either method. CONCLUSION: In order to plan for the future, we need to understand the dynamics of education within the context of polarities. Educators need to understand that the choice of DL, although was imposed as a no-alternative solution during the COVID era, yet it has always existed as a possible alternative and will continue to exist after this era. The value of polarity mapping and leveraging allows us to maximize the benefit of each method and guide educators' decisions to minimize the downsides for the good of the learning process.","Ahmed, Samar A; Hegazy, Nagwa N; Abdel Malak, Hany W; Cliff Kayser, W; Elrafie, Noha M; Hassanien, Mohammed; Al-Hayani, Abdulmonem A; El Saadany, Sherif A; Ai-Youbi, Abdulrahman O; Shehata, Mohamed H",BMC Med Educ,,285

Neurosurgical patients are often critically ill and at particularly high risk for COVID, and the pandemic has produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow their continued care. This study explores the psychologic impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. METHODS: Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30), two validated surveys, before and during the pandemic. PSS scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively among residents and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 prepandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 prepandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (P > 0.05).

Methods: Total of 110 patients were included in this cross-sectional case-control study. P-wave dispersion (PWD) was measured on a 12-lead ECG. Atrial electromechanical intervals (PA) were measured as the time interval between the onset of the P wave on the ECG and the beginning of the late diastolic A wave. Results: PWD was found to be 40.9±9.2 ms in the healthy control group, 45.6±8.2 ms in the mild COPD and 44.8±8.7 ms in the severe COPD group (p<0.05). Intra-right atrial EMD was found to be 10.7±5.8 ms in mild COPD, 11.0±7 ms in severe COPD, and it was 16.4±7.3 ms in healthy control group (p<0.001). Interatrial EMD was detected to be 29.5±9.1 ms in the control group, 24.1±9 ms in mild COPD group, and 23.9±11.1 ms in the severe COPD group (p<0.001). Conclusion: Both mild and severe COPD groups decreased PWD, increased tricuspid PA and significantly decreased interand right intra-AEMD times in comparison to the control group.","Celik, Yunus; Yildirim, Nesligül; Demir, Vahit; Alp, Caglar; Sahin, Omer; Dogru, Mehmet Tolga",Afr Health Sci,,285

Is access to hospice care for dementia patients impacted by Medicare's terminal prognosis requirement? Are dementia-specific advance directives warranted? How does state legislation affect dementia patients' EOL options? Should dementia patients' be able to refuse orally ingested food and fluids by advance directive? RECENT FINDINGS: The difficulty of predicting time to death in dementia inhibits access to Medicare hospice benefits. Efforts have been made to create dementia-specific advance directives. Advance refusal of artificial nutrition and hydration are common, but the issue of oral ingestion of food and fluids by dementia patients remains controversial. Medicare's hospice benefit should be made more accessible to dementia patients. State advance directive threshold definitions should be broadened to include dementia, and capacitated persons who refuse in advance orally ingested food and fluids should have their choices honored.","Allen, William",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,285

The aim of this work was to study the safety profile of combined ketamine and regional anesthesia in pediatric ocular surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This prospective study included pediatric patients undergoing ocular surgery under general anesthesia from April to October 2020. Children were premedicated with oral midazolam (0.25-0.50 mg/kg) or intramuscular ketamine (7-10 mg/kg), ondensetron (0.1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). Anesthesia was achieved with intravenous ketamine (4-5 mg/kg) and local anesthesia (peribulbar block or local infiltration). The patient's vital signs were monitored. Serious complications and postoperative adverse reactions related to anesthesia were documented. Results: A total of 55 children (62 eyes) were operated. Lid tear was the most common surgical procedure performed [n = 18 (32.7%)]. Dose of ketamine needed ranged from 30 to 120 mg (66.67 ± 30.45). No intubation or resuscitation was needed. Four children complained of nausea and two needed an additional dose of intravenous ondansetron due to vomiting in the post-operative period. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was not affected by age, duration of surgery or dose of ketamine used (P > 0.05). There was no correlation between increase in pulse and dose of ketamine. Conclusion: Combined ketamine and regional anesthesia is a safe and effective alternative to administer anesthesia in a child during ocular surgeries.","Rajput, Vimal K; Tuvar, Subhash; Bhalsing, Shweta; Bhalsing, Snehal",Indian J Ophthalmol,,285

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods study of telemedicine visits across pediatric endocrinology, nephrology, orthopedic surgery, and rheumatology at a large children’s hospital. We used deductive analysis to review observational data from 40 video visits. Providers and patients/caregivers were surveyed around areas of satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: We found adaptations of telemedicine including shared-screen use and provider-guided parent procedures among others. All providers felt that it was safest for their patients to conduct visits by video, and 72.7% reported completing some component of a clinical exam. Patients rated the areas of being respected by the clinical staff/provider and showing care and concern highly, and the mean overall satisfaction was 86.7 ± 19.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been used to deliver care to pediatric patients during the pandemic, and we found that patients were satisfied with the telemedicine visits during this stressful time and that providers were able to innovate during visits. Telemedicine is a tool that can be successfully adapted to patient and provider needs, but further studies are needed to fully explore its integration in pediatric subspecialty care. IMPACT: This study describes telemedicine use at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from both a provider and patient perspective, in four different pediatric subspecialties. Prior to COVID-19, pediatric telehealth landscape analysis suggested that many pediatric specialty practices had pilot telehealth programs, but there are few published studies evaluating telemedicine performance through the simultaneous patient and provider experience as part of standard care.

591199,Genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders and risk of COVID-19,2021-02-25,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are central building blocks in the intracellular signaling network, are often manipulated by viruses of diverse families to favor their replication. Among the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is known to be modulated during the infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); however, involvement of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) comprising p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether activation of p38 MAPK and JNK cascades is required for PEDV replication. Our results showed that PEDV activates p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 up to 24 h post-infection, whereas, thereafter their phosphorylation levels recede to baseline levels or even fall below them. Notably, UV-irradiated inactivated PEDV, which can enter cells but cannot replicate inside them, failed to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 suggesting that viral biosynthesis is essential for activation of these kinases. Treatment of cells with selective p38 or JNK inhibitors markedly impaired PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner and these antiviral effects were found to be maximal during the early times of the infection. Furthermore, direct pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK1/2 activation resulted in a significant reduction of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny release. However, independent treatments with either SAPK inhibitor did not inhibit PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death mediated by activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) suggesting that SAPKs are irrelevant to the apoptosis pathway during PEDV infection. In summary, our data demonstrated critical roles of the p38 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways in facilitating successful viral infection during the post-entry steps of the PEDV life cycle.","Lee, Changhee; Kim, Youngnam; Jeon, Ji Hyun",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215486/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216301514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216301514,285
591236,"Psychosocial risk factors, non-communicable diseases and animal models for COVID-19",2020-12-19,"BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19 has been clinically challenging. Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. METHODS: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 348 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using only clinical variables collected on or before a patient’s COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). RESULTS: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 70 to 85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables — including basic patient information, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type — suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.

The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. This study examines the association of parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the pandemic. Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0–12 years of age. Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Nearly 20% of parents had hit or spanked their child in the past two weeks alone. Parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents’ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in “lockdown.” Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.","Lee, Shawna J.; Ward, Kaitlin P.; Lee, Joyce Y.; Rodriguez, Christina M.",J Fam Violence,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00244-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462526/,285
591274,[The covid-19 emergency in the words of the nurses],2020,"BACKGROUND: Primary cardiac tumors are rare, and approximately 90% of them are benign. Myxoma is the most common type of these tumors occurring in the left atrium in 75–85% of cases. The tumor can cause the left atrio-ventricular valve obstruction and embolization phenomenon. Case presentation We reported a case of 54-year-old man with complaints of dyspenea and amnesia. In our patient, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass of 28*63 mm attached to the upper intra-atrial septum, which was prolapsing through the mitral valve into the left ventricle during diastole, being indicative of the left atrial myxoma. On examination, he was alert and conversant, and no pathological abnormality was observed in the examination of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, renal and nervous systems. After myxoma diagnosis, the tumor was removed under cardiac surgery and discharged under good conditions. In the telephone follow-up after discharge, the patient recovered and did not report the disease and surgery complications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiac myxoma are usually asymptomatic, but they may have manifestations related to the embolism phenomenon or intracardiac obstruction. Therefore, myxoma may represent an emergency. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible. If surgery is delayed, the patient may suffer from serious and irreversible complications, such as stroke and cardiac arrest.","Shabab, Sadegh; Erfanzadeh, Majid; Ahmadian, Shamsa; Mahmoudabady, Maryam; Mazloum, Naser",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-02036-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932989/,285
592101,Neurosurgical operative videos: an analysis of an increasingly popular educational resource,2020-09-02,"INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common worldwide. Recommendations to reduce discomfort often commence with increasing physical activity levels. In Saudi Arabia, levels of physical activity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were low. This cross-sectional study aims at estimating the prevalence of MSDs among Saudi physicians, as well as determining the pattern and level of physical activity post lockdown and examining their association. METHODS: Physical activity levels were assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and MSDs were assessed via the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Chi-squared tests with significance levels of <.05 were performed to explore bivariate associations. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were given by binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 3492 physicians participated in this study, and over half of them (63.55%) reported low physical activity. Risk of MSDs increased with aging and with increasing BMI (P for trend <.05). Females were more likely to report MSDs (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.07-1.86), as well as physicians with a chronic condition (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.24-1.37) and those who work in shifts (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03-1.37). Moderate activity conferred a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.79-1.13), whilst high physical activity had a non-significant increased risk of MSDs in this population. CONCLUSION: Physical activity in this population is astonishingly low, while prevalence of MSDs is relatively high. Significant factors include age, sex, shift work, and the presence of chronic conditions. Current results warrant the consideration of preventive measures for physicians.","AlOmar, Reem S.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409895/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211040359,285

593853,From SARS to COVID‐19: the Singapore journey,2020-05-31,"Patients with COVID-19 present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Thromboembolic events constitute a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Severe COVID-19 has been associated with hyperinflammation and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Platelets are important mediators and sensors of inflammation and are directly affected by cardiovascular stressors. In this report, we found that platelets from severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit higher basal levels of activation measured by P-selectin surface expression, and have a poor functional reserve upon in vitro stimulation. Correlating clinical features to the ability of plasma from COVID-19 patients to stimulate control platelets identified ferritin as a pivotal clinical marker associated with platelet hyperactivation. The COVID-19 plasma-mediated effect on control platelets was highest for patients that subsequently developed inpatient thrombotic events. Proteomic analysis of plasma from COVID-19 patients identified key mediators of inflammation and cardiovascular disease that positively correlated with in vitro platelet activation. Mechanistically, blocking the signaling of the FcγRIIa-Syk and C5a-C5aR pathways on platelets, using antibody-mediated neutralization, IgG depletion or the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, reversed this hyperactivity driven by COVID-19 plasma and prevented platelet aggregation in endothelial microfluidic chamber conditions, thus identifying these potentially actionable pathways as central for platelet activation and/or vascular complications in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, we reveal a key role of platelet-mediated immunothrombosis in COVID-19 and identify distinct, clinically relevant, targetable signaling pathways that mediate this effect. These studies have implications for the role of platelet hyperactivation in complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Sarkar, Amrita; Giannini, Heather M.; Goel, Rishi R.; Mathew, Divij; Suzuki, Aae; Baxter, Amy E.; Greenplate, Allison R.; Alanio, Cécile; Abdel-Hakeem, Mohamed; Oldridge, Derek A.; Giles, Josephine; Wu, Jennifer E.; Chen, Zeyu; Huang, Yinghui Jane; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Manne, Sasikanth; Kuthuru, Oliva; Dougherty, Jeanette; Weiderhold, Brittany; Weisman, Ariel R.; Ittner, Caroline A.

593985,Effect of COVID‐19 pandemic on stroke admission rates in a Norwegian population,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of COVID‐19 outbreak on congenital cardiac surgery practice in a single center. METHODS: The first case of COVID‐19 in our country was seen on March 11th, 2020. The patients operated between March 11th, 2019‐and March 10th, 2020 were taken as the pre‐COVID group, and those operated between March 11th and May 11th, 2020 were taken as the COVID group. The data was retrospectively collected, and the two periods were compared. RESULTS: Monthly average number of cases which was 52 patients/month (626 patients in 12 months) before COVID decreased to 35 patients/month (70 patients in 2 months) during COVID periods (P < .01). During the pre‐COVID period the median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR: 1‐5) days. During the COVID period, this decreased to 1 (IQR: 1‐3) day (P < .01). During the pre‐COVID period, the hospital expenses of 17% (8/47) of the foreign nationals were covered by their homeland. The remaining 83% (39/47) were paid from the asylum seekers’ fund. The proportion of foreign nationals operated significantly decreased during the COVID period ([7%; 47/632 vs 1%; 1/70]; P = .04). No significant difference was observed in terms of STAT mortality scores and categories and postoperative results of the operations performed between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital cardiac surgery practice can be safely maintained with restricted case volume during the pandemic period. It is alarming that patients in the deprived areas cannot access pediatric cardiac surgery and possibly other health services because of closure of the borders between countries.","Korun, Oktay; Yurdakök, Okan; Arslan, Akın; Çiçek, Murat; Selçuk, Arif; Kılıç, Yiğit; Altın, Fırat; Şaşmazel, Ahmet; Aydemir, Numan Ali",J Card Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789953/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14914,285

CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) to determine changes in the current (past 30-day) use of seven tobacco products among U.S. middle (grades 6-8) and high (grades 9-12) school students. In 2020, current use of any tobacco product was reported by 16.2% (4.47 million) of all students, including 23.6% (3.65 million) of high school and 6.7% (800,000) of middle school students. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among high school (19.6%; 3.02 million) and middle school (4.7%; 550,000) students. From 2019 to 2020, decreases in current use of any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product, multiple tobacco products, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco occurred among high school and middle school students; these declines resulted in an estimated 1.73 million fewer current youth tobacco product users in 2020 than in 2019 (6.20 million) (3). From 2019 to 2020, no significant change occurred in the use of cigarettes, hookahs, pipe tobacco, or heated tobacco products. The comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidence-based tobacco control strategies at the national, state, and local levels, combined with tobacco product regulation by FDA, is warranted to help sustain this progress and to prevent and reduce all forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths (1,2).","Gentzke, Andrea S.; Wang, Teresa W.; Jamal, Ahmed; Park-Lee, Eunice; Ren, Chunfeng; Cullen, Karen A.; Neff, Linda",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6950a1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332300/,285
597069,Pharmacologic Therapy for COVID-19 Infection,2020-04-20,"The severe forms and worsened outcomes of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) are closely associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells express Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the entrance door for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The hallmarks of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are increased levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy and microthrombi of alveolar capillaries. The endothelial glycocalyx, a proteoglycan- and glycoprotein-rich layer covering the luminal side of endothelial cells, contributes to vascular homeostasis. It regulates vascular tonus and permeability, prevents thrombosis, and modulates leukocyte adhesion and inflammatory response. We hypothesized that cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with COVID-19 leads to glycocalyx degradation. A cohort of 20 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Mechanisms associated with glycocalyx degradation in COVID-19 were investigated. Increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL1-β, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and glycocalyx components were detected in plasma from COVID-19 patients compared to plasma from healthy subjects. Plasma from COVID-19 patients induced glycocalyx shedding in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and disrupted redox balance. Treatment of HUVECs with low molecular weight heparin inhibited the glycocalyx perturbation. In conclusion, plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes glycocalyx shedding and redox imbalance in endothelial cells, and heparin treatment potentially inhibits glycocalyx disruption.","Potje, Simone R.; Costa, Tiago J.; Fraga-Silva, Thais F.C.; Martins, Ronaldo B.; Benatti, Maira N.; Almado, Carlos E.L.; de Sá, Keyla S.G.; Bonato, Vânia L.D.; Arruda, Eurico; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Oliveira, Rene D.R.; Zamboni, Dario S.; Becari, Christiane; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Tostes, Rita C.",Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119376; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320521003611?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781826/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320521003611,285

We also examine two important moderators: the influence of risk framing and willingness to risk infection. METHOD A 2 × 2 between-participants, randomized experiment (N = 476) varied infographics portraying low-risk behaviors, like going camping, versus high-risk behaviors, like attending a concert, followed by either moderation or abstinence guidelines. Participants in two additional control groups saw an infographic displaying either a full range of risk behaviors or behaviors that pose no risk, each followed by generic guidelines. RESULTS Regression analyses show moderation messages are less freedom-threatening only when presenting low-risk behaviors. Persons more willing to risk infection found all messages more freedom-threatening; however, for these individuals, moderation messages increased behavioral intentions when risks were presented as high. CONCLUSION This study suggests harm reduction may be applied effectively in a pandemic, where the behavior of risk-tolerant individuals, at a population level, could have suboptimal effects on curbing virus transmission.

Our aim was to compare the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 related peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications. We also investigated the amount of ongoing trials and systematic reviews. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study of publications covering the COVID-19 pandemic time frame, up to May 20, 2020 was conducted. PubMed with appropriate combinations of Medical Subject Headings and COVID-19 section of MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives were searched. We examined Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Register and 15 other trial registers as well as the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Characteristics of each publication source were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to analyze publication trends over the weeks and compare their relative proportions. We found 3635 peer-reviewed publications and 3805 pre-prints, of which 8.6% (n=329) were published in indexed journals. Peer-reviewed and pre-print publications amount both increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (peer-reviewed: 6% vs pre-prints: 0.9%, p<0.001) and letters (17.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of the peer-reviewed compared to pre-print publications. In turn, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63% p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) accounted for a significantly greater share of the pre-print publications. Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and EU register included 57.9%, 49.5 % and 98.9% trials mostly still 'recruiting'. PROSPERO amounted to 962 systematic review protocols. Conclusion Pre-prints were slightly more prevalent than peer-reviewed publications, yet both are growing. To fill the void given by the absence of published primary studies, immediate opinions (i.e., letters) has virulently been published in PubMed. However, preprints has been promoted as rapid responses to give direct and promptly access at scientific findings in this pandemic.","Gianola, Silvia; Jesus, Tiago S; Bargeri, Silvia; Castellini, Greta",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.14.20130823v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.20130823,285

These abnormalities increase the risk of developing several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, and cerebral palsy. Here, we discuss how astrocytes might contribute to postnatal brain dysfunction following maternal inflammation, focusing on the signaling mediated by two families of plasma membrane channels: hemi-channels and pannexons. [Ca(2+)](i) imbalance linked to the opening of astrocytic hemichannels and pannexons could disturb essential functions that sustain astrocytic survival and astrocyte-to-neuron support, including energy and redox homeostasis, uptake of K(+) and glutamate, and the delivery of neurotrophic factors and energy-rich metabolites. Both phenomena could make neurons more susceptible to the harmful effect of prenatal inflammation and the experience of a second immune challenge during adulthood. On the other hand, maternal inflammation could cause excitotoxicity by producing the release of high amounts of gliotransmitters via astrocytic hemichannels/pannexons, eliciting further neuronal damage. Understanding how hemichannels and pannexons participate in maternal inflammation-induced brain abnormalities could be critical for developing pharmacological therapies against neurological disorders observed in the offspring.","Prieto-Villalobos, Juan; Alvear, Tanhia F.; Liberona, Andrés; Lucero, Claudia M.; Martínez-Araya, Claudio J.; Balmazabal, Javiera; Inostroza, Carla A.; Ramírez, Gigliola; Gómez, Gonzalo I.; Orellana, Juan A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502412/,285

The disruption of sodium homeostasis, tends to be a common occurrence in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1,254 COVID-19 patients comprising 124 (9.9%) hyponatremic patients (under 135 mmol/L) and 30 (2.4%) hypernatremic patients (over 145 mmol/L) from three hospitals in Hubei, China, were enrolled in the study. The relationships between sodium balance disorders in COVID-19 patients, its clinical features, implications, and the underlying causes were presented. Hyponatremia patients were observed to be elderly, had more comorbidities, with severe pneumonic chest radiographic findings. They were also more likely to have a fever, nausea, higher leukocyte and neutrophils count, and a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP). Compared to normonatremia patients, renal insufficiency was common in both hyponatremia and hypernatremia patients. In addition, hyponatremia patients required extensive treatment with oxygen, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. The only significant differences between the hypernatremia and normonatremia patients were laboratory findings and clinical complications, and patients with hypernatremia were more likely to use traditional Chinese medicine for treatment compared to normonatremia patients. This study indicates that severity of the disease, the length of stay in the hospital of surviving patients, and mortality were higher among COVID-19 patients with sodium balance disorders. CONCLUSION: Sodium balance disorder, particularly hyponatremia, is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and it is associated with a higher risk of severe illness and increased in-hospital mortality.","Hu, Weihua; lv, Xinke; Li, Chang; Xu, Yang; Qi, Yiding; Zhang, Zhuheng; Li, Mingxuan; Cai, Feina; Liu, Dan; Yue, Jiang; Ye, Maoqing; Chen, Qijian; Shi, Kailei",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02515-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064253/,285

601577,Association of coagulation disturbances with severity of COVID-19: a longitudinal study.,2021-12-01,"BACKGROUND: New HIV infections in Indonesia continue to be concentrated among key populations, including female sex workers (FSWs). However, increasing HIV testing among this subpopulation remains a challenge, necessitating exploration into alternative testing modalities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether the addition of an oral fluid testing option in community settings would increase the rate of HIV case identification among FSWs. Because the study was implemented early in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Indonesia, a secondary objective is to assess approaches and tools for implementing both community outreach and community HIV screening for FSWs during pandemic conditions. METHODS: We undertook a community-based randomized trial in 23 national priority districts in which community outreach services were being provided. Community-based screening using an oral fluid-based rapid test was added to the community outreach standard of care in intervention districts with clients having the option of performing the test themselves or being assisted by outreach workers. A web-based system was created to screen for eligibility and collect participant data and test results, facilitating the process for both unassisted and assisted participants. Participants with reactive screening results were encouraged to undergo HIV testing at a health facility to confirm their diagnosis and initiate antiretroviral treatment as needed. Multiple means of recruitment were deployed including through outreach workers and social media campaigns. RESULTS: Of the 1907 FSWs who registered, met the eligibility criteria, and gave consent to participate, 1545 undertook community oral fluid test (OFT) screening. Most (1516/1545, 98.1%) opted for assisted screening. Recruitment via social media fell far short of expectations as many who registered independently for the OFT because of the social media campaign did not identify as FSWs. They were eventually not eligible to participate, but their interest points to the possibility of implementing HIV self-testing in the general population. The successful recruitment through outreach workers, facilitated by social media, indicates that their roles remain crucial in accessing FSW networks and improving HIV testing uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of HIV self-testing to the standard of care supported by a web-based data collection system was able to increase HIV case identification among FSWs in intervention districts. The high satisfaction of OFT users and the interest of the general population toward this alternative testing modality are promising for scaling up community HIV screening nationally.

601743,"COVID-19 what have we learned? The rise of social machines and connected devices in pandemic management following the concepts of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine",2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Bedside measurement of lung volume may provide guidance in the personalised setting of respiratory support, especially in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. We propose here a novel operator-independent technique, enabled by a fibre optic oxygen sensor, to quantify the lung volume available for gas exchange. We hypothesised that the continuous measurement of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) decline during a breath-holding manoeuvre could be used to estimate lung volume in a single-compartment physiological model of the respiratory system. METHODS: Thirteen pigs with a saline lavage lung injury model and six control pigs were studied under general anaesthesia during mechanical ventilation. Lung volumes were measured by simultaneous PaO(2) rate of decline (V(PaO2)) and whole-lung computed tomography scan (V(CT)) during apnoea at different positive end-expiratory and end-inspiratory pressures. RESULTS: A total of 146 volume measurements was completed (range 134 to 1869 mL). A linear correlation between V(CT) and V(PaO2) was found both in control (slope = 0.9, R(2) = 0.88) and in saline-lavaged pigs (slope = 0.64, R(2) = 0.70). The bias from Bland–Altman analysis for the agreement between the V(CT) and V(PaO2) was − 84 mL (limits of agreement ± 301 mL) in control and + 2 mL (LoA ± 406 mL) in saline-lavaged pigs. The concordance for changes in lung volume, quantified with polar plot analysis, was − 4º (LoA ± 19°) in control and − 9° (LoA ± 33°) in saline-lavaged pigs. CONCLUSION: Bedside measurement of PaO(2) rate of decline during apnoea is a potential approach for estimation of lung volume changes associated with different levels of airway pressure.","Tran, Minh C.; Crockett, Douglas C.; Cronin, John N.; Borges, João Batista; Hedenstierna, Göran; Larsson, Anders; Farmery, Andrew D.; Formenti, Federico",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-00364-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496887/,285

Data We selected studies written in English assessing or discussing the decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against SARS-CoV-2. Two independent researchers performed the search and study screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out considering the study design of the included studies. Sources PubMed, SCOPUS, and Preprint platforms (bioRxiv and medRxiv). Study selection We included 55 reports from PubMed and SCOPUS. Nine articles were letters to the editors, 21 were in vitro studies, 16 were literature reviews, and 9 were classified as other study designs. We included 37 preprints. Two articles were letters to the editors, 24 were in vitro studies, 3 were literature reviews, and 8 were classified as other study designs. In general, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited and most promising. However, there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of N95 respirator decontamination. Conclusion The evidence regarding decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against SARS-CoV-2 remains scarce. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation seem to be the current standard for N95 respirator decontamination. Clinical significance Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation appear to be the most promising methods for N95 respirator decontamination.","Sarkis-Onofre, Rafael; Borges, Rafaela do Carmo; Demarco, Giulia; Dotto, Lara; Schwendicke, Falk; Demarco, Flávio Fernando",J Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197526/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103534; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300571220302827; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571220302827?v=s5,285

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective case series of sequentially hospitalised patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, at Infanta Leonor University Hospital (ILUH) in Madrid, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: All patients attended at ILUH testing positive to reverse transcriptase-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and diagnosed with COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1549 COVID-19 cases were included (median age 69 years (IQR 55.0–81.0), 57.5% men). 78.2% had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most frequent was hypertension (55.8%). Most frequent symptoms at presentation were fever (75.3%), cough (65.7%) and dyspnoea (58.1%). 81 (5.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (median age 62 years (IQR 51–71); 74.1% men; median length of stay 9 days (IQR 5–19)) 82.7% of them needed invasive ventilation support. 1393 patients had an outcome at the end of the study period (case fatality ratio: 21.2% (296/1393)). The independent factors associated with fatality (OR; 95% CI): age (1.07; 1.06 to 1.09), male sex (2.86; 1.85 to 4.50), neurological disease (1.93; 1.19 to 3.13), chronic kidney disease (2.83; 1.40 to 5.71) and neoplasia (4.29; 2.40 to 7.67). The percentage of hospital beds occupied with COVID-19 almost doubled (702/361), with the number of patients in ICU quadrupling its capacity (32/8). Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 6–14).

603282,Impact of the First Wave of COVID-19 on the Number of General Anesthesia Cases in 34 Tertiary Hospitals in Japan: A Multicenter Retrospective Study,2021-08-27,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having a tremendous impact on the global economy, health care systems and the lives of almost all people in the world. The Central European country of Slovakia reached one of the highest daily mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants in the first 3 months of 2021, despite implementing strong prophylactic measures, lockdowns and repeated nationwide antigen testing. The present study reports a comparison of the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test (SD Biosensor) with three commercial RT-qPCR kits (vDetect COVID-19-MultiplexDX, gb SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex-GENERI BIOTECH Ltd. and Genvinset COVID-19 [E]-BDR Diagnostics) in the detection of infected individuals among employees of the Martin University Hospital in Slovakia. Health care providers, such as doctors and nurses, are classified as “critical infrastructure”, and there is no doubt about the huge impact that incorrect results could have on patients. Out of 1231 samples, 14 were evaluated as positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen presence, and all of them were confirmed by RT-qPCR kit 1 and kit 2. As another 26 samples had a signal in the E gene, these 40 samples were re-isolated and subsequently re-analysed using the three kits, which detected the virus in 22, 23 and 12 cases, respectively. The results point to a divergence not only between antigen and RT-qPCR tests, but also within the “gold standard” RT-qPCR testing. Performance analysis of the diagnostic antigen test showed the positive predictive value (PPV) to be 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) to be 98.10%, indicating that 1.90% of individuals with a negative result were, in fact, positive. If these data are extrapolated to the national level, where the mean daily number of antigen tests was 250,000 in April 2021, it points to over 4700 people per day being misinterpreted and posing a risk of virus shedding. While mean Ct values of the samples that were both antigen and RT-qPCR positive were about 20 (kit 1: 20.47 and 20.16 for Sarbeco E and RdRP, kit 2: 19.37 and 19.99 for Sarbeco E and RdRP and kit 3: 17.47 for ORF1b/RdRP), mean Ct values of the samples that were antigen-negative but RT-qPCR-positive were about 30 (kit 1: 30.67 and 30.00 for Sarbeco E and RdRP, kit 2: 29.86 and 31.01 for Sarbeco E and RdRP and kit 3: 27.47 for ORF1b/RdRP). It confirms the advantage of antigen test in detecting the most infectious individuals with a higher viral load. However, the reporting of Ct values is still a matter of ongoing debates and should not be conducted without normalisation to standardised controls of known concentration.","Dankova, Zuzana; Novakova, Elena; Skerenova, Maria; Holubekova, Veronika; Lucansky, Vincent; Dvorska, Dana; Brany, Dusan; Kolkova, Zuzana; Strnadel, Jan; Mersakova, Sandra; Janikova, Katarina; Samec, Marek; Pokusa, Michal; Petras, Martin; Sarlinova, Miroslava; Kasubova, Ivana; Loderer, Dusan; Sadlonova, Vladimira; Kompanikova, Jana; Kotlebova, Nina; Kompanikova, Adriana; Hrnciarova, Martina; Stanclova, Andrea; Antosova, Martina; Dzian, Anton; Nosal, Vladimir; Kocan, Ivan; Murgas, Dalibor; Krkoska, Dusan; Calkovska, Andrea; Halasova, Erika",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280974/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137037,285

First line treatment for ARF includes oxygen therapy,intially admininstered non invasively using nasal prongs, high flow nasal cannulae or masks. Invasive mechancial ventilation (IMV) is usually reserved for patients who are unable to maintain their airway, those with worsening hypoxemia, or those who develop respiratory muscle fatigue and consequent hypercapnia. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) gas is known to improve oxygenation in patients with ARF by manipulating ventilation-perfusion matching. Addition of iNO may potentially alleviate the need for IMV in selected patients. This article demonstrates the feasibility of this technique based on our experience of patients with hypoxemic ARF. This technique may also be considered for patients with hypoxic ARF in setting of COVID-19.","Shekar, K.; Varkey, S.; Cornmell, G.; Parsons, L.; Tol, M.; Siuba, M.; Ramanan, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.20082123; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20082123v1?rss=1,285
603419,Commentary: Can we do better during a potential second wave of COVID-19?,2020-11-02,"India imposed one of the world’s strictest population-wide lockdown on 25 March 2020 for COVID-19. We estimated epidemiological parameters, evaluated the effect of control measures on the epidemic in India and explored strategies to exit lockdown. We obtained patient-level data to estimate the delay from onset to confirmation and the asymptomatic proportion. We estimated the basic and time-varying reproduction number (R(0) and R(t))after adjusting for imported cases and delay to confirmation, using incidence data from 4 March to 25 April 2020. Using a SEIR-QDPA model, we simulated lockdown relaxation scenarios and increased testing to evaluate lockdown exit strategies. R(0) for India was estimated to be 2·08 while the R(t) decreased from 1·67 on 30 March to 1·16 on 22 April. We observed that the delay from date of lockdown relaxation to start of second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak— this delay is longer if lockdown is relaxed gradually. Aggressive measures like lockdowns may be inherently enough to suppress an outbreak, however other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Lower levels of social distancing when coupled with a testing ramp-up, could achieve similar outbreak control as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased.","Gupta, Mohak; Mohanta, Saptarshi Soham; Rao, Aditi; Parameswaran, Giridara Gopal; Agarwal, Mudit; Arora, Mehak; Mazumder, Archisman; Lohiya, Ayush; Behera, Priyamadhaba; Bansal, Agam; Kumar, Rohit; Meena, Ved Prakash; Tiwari, Pawan; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325224?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.206; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33279653/,285
603705,Secondary attack rates of COVID-19 in Norwegian families: a nation-wide register-based study,2021-05-25,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is one of multiple translational recoding processes that fundamentally alters triplet decoding of the messenger RNA by the elongating ribosome. The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the −1 direction (−1 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. −1 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide “slip site” over which the paused ribosome “backs up” by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem-loop. These two elements are separated by 6–8 nucleotides, a distance that places the 5′ edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The precise mechanism by which the downstream RNA stimulates −1 PRF by the translocating ribosome remains unclear. This review summarizes the recent structural and biophysical studies of RNA pseudoknots and places this work in the context of our evolving mechanistic understanding of translation elongation. Support for the hypothesis that the downstream stimulatory element provides a kinetic barrier to the ribosome mediated unfolding is discussed.","Giedroc, David P.; Cornish, Peter V.",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208002323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208002323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.06.008; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2670756?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18621088/,285
603991,Characterizing the COVID-19 illness experience to inform the study of post-acute sequalae and recovery: a qualitative study,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an instructional strategy that embraces the concept of a flipped classroom. At our institution, the Clerkship in Pediatrics utilizes TBL sessions to deliver curricular content rather than lecture format. In 2016, matriculating medical students were given iPads for the purpose of transitioning to electronic delivery of curricular materials in the pre-clinical phase of their study. In 2017, the Clerkship in Pediatrics was tasked with investigating methods to integrate iPad use into clinical education. ACTIVITY: We employed the web-based platform Examplify to deliver test questions for TBL sessions over the span of 1 academic year (2018-2019). Curricular content was converted to Examplify for half of the TBL sessions and team performance for the sessions was compared to those administered traditionally. Students participating in the course were surveyed regarding their satisfaction with the 2 formats using a 15-item survey with a 4-point rating scale and open-ended questions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Integration of technology into TBL sessions was met with mixed results. Performance on the eTBL sessions was significantly higher for 2 of the 6 sessions: the Abdominal Pain (90.2% vs 84.1%, P = .04) and the Toxicology (85.6% vs 79.4%, P = .03) sessions. A majority of students felt that the eTBL sessions facilitated multiple learning styles, promoted discussions, and nurtured different learning styles. However, students also felt that the electronic sessions were more cumbersome and difficult to navigate. Future research comparing the 2 modalities using a more comprehensive integration of media content, such as video and audio files, will further inform the success of this endeavor.","Chitkara, Maribeth B; Pongvitayapanu, Richard; Lu, Wei-Hsin",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520957645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964126/,285

These practices were representative of English primary care across urban and non-urban practices. Participants The ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, and 13,938,390 patient years of observation (final date of follow-up 27th September 2020). The mean (SD) age was 38 (24) years, 49.4% were male and the majority were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown ethnicity]) Exposure The primary exposure was the first national lockdown in the UK, starting on 23rd March 2020. Main outcome measures Records of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and International Normalised Ratio (INR) measurement derived from coded entries in the primary care electronic health record. Results Rates of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording dropped by 23-87% in the week following the first UK national lockdown, compared with the previous week. The largest decline was seen in cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81). Following the immediate drop, rates of recorded tests increased on average by 5-9% per week until 27th September 2020. However, the number of recorded measures remained below that expected for the time of year, reaching 51.8% (95% CI 51.8 to 51.9%) for blood pressure, 63.7%, (95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%) for cholesterol measurement and 70.3% (95% CI 70.2% to 70.4%) for HbA1c. Rates of INR recording declined throughout the previous two years, a trend that continued after lockdown. There were no differences in the times series trends based on sex, age, ethnicity or deprivation. Conclusions Cardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care declined substantially from the time of the first UK lockdown.

Understanding whether such symptoms are distinct among those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or simply a nonspecific reflection of elevated stress, could help target interventions. METHOD: We analyzed data from multiple waves of a 50-state survey that included questions about COVID-19 infection as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire examining depressive and anxious symptoms. We utilized multiple logistic regression to examine whether sociodemographic features associated with depression liability differed for those with or without prior COVID-19, and then whether depressive symptoms differed among those with or without prior COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 91,791 respondents, in regression models, age, gender, race, education, and income all exhibited an interaction with prior COVID-19 in risk for moderate or greater depressive symptoms (p<0.0001 in all cases), indicating differential risk in the two subgroups. Among those with such symptoms, levels of motoric symptoms and suicidality were significantly greater among those with prior COVID-19 illness. Depression risk increased with greater interval following acute infection.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where people may have limited access to affordable quality care, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to have a particularly adverse impact on the health and healthcare of individuals with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). A World Health Organization survey found that disruption of delivery of healthcare for NCDs was more significant in LMICs than in high-income countries. However, the study did not elicit insights into the day-to-day impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare by front-line healthcare workers (FLHCWs). AIM: To gain insights directly from FLHCWs working in countries with a high NCD burden, and thereby identify opportunities to improve the provision of healthcare during the current pandemic and in future healthcare emergencies. METHODS: We recruited selected frontline healthcare workers (general practitioners, pharmacists, and other medical specialists) from nine countries to complete an online survey (n = 1347). Survey questions focused on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and NCDs; barriers to clinical care during the pandemic; and innovative responses to the many challenges presented by the pandemic. FINDINGS: The majority of FLHCWs responding to our survey reported that their care of patients had been impacted both adversely and positively by the public health measures imposed. Most FLHCs (95%) reported a deterioration in the mental health of their patients. CONCLUSIONS: Continuity of care for NCDs as part of pandemic preparedness is needed so that chronic conditions are not exacerbated by public health measures and the direct impacts of the pandemic.","Bullen, Chris; McCormack, Jessica; Calder, Amanda; Parag, Varsha; Subramaniam, Kannan; Majumdar, Anurita; Huang, Pai-Hui; Devi, Ratna; El Bizri, Luna; Goodyear-Smith, Felicity",Prim Health Care Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1017/s146342362100030x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120672/,285
606429,Turning Adversity and Deprivation into Improvements in Medicine – The COVID Opportunity,2020-04-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced societies across the world to resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the USA and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until at least summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","Perkins, T.

Although an infectious agent in one animal can alter its host range with relative ease, no example of a plant virus changing its host organism to an animal has been documented. One prevalent pathway for the transmission of infectious agents between hosts involves ingestion of the flesh of one organism by another. In this article we document numerous examples of viral and prion diseases transmitted by eating animals. We suggest that the occurrence of cross-species viral epidemics can be substantially reduced by shifting to a more vegetarian diet and enforcing stricter laws that ban the slaughter and trade of wild and endangered species.","Reddy, Bhaskara L.; Saier, Milton H., Jr.",Microb Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957108/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000511192,285

As demonstrated by an incredible number of COVID-19-related publications, the research science community responded rapidly. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the growing contribution of the Arab world to global research on COVID-19. METHODS: For the period between December 2019 and March 2021, the search for publications was conducted via the Scopus database using terms linked to COVID-19. VOSviewer 1.6.16 software was applied to generate a network map to assess hot topics in this area and determine the collaboration patterns between different countries. Furthermore, the research output of Arab countries was adjusted in relation to population size and gross domestic product (GDP). RESULTS: A total of 143,975 publications reflecting the global overall COVID-19 research output were retrieved. By restricting analysis to the publications published by the Arab countries, the research production was 6131 documents, representing 4.26% of the global research output regarding COVID-19. Of all these publications, 3990 (65.08%) were original journal articles, 980 (15.98%) were review articles, 514 (8.38%) were letters and 647 (10.55%) were others, such as editorials or notes. The highest number of COVID-19 publications was published by Saudi Arabia (n = 2186, 35.65%), followed by Egypt (n = 1281, 20.78%) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), (n = 719, 11.73%). After standardization by population size and GDP, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon had the highest publication productivity. The collaborations were mostly with researchers from the United States (n = 968), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 661). The main research lines identified in COVID-19 from the Arab world are related to: public health and epidemiology; immunological and pharmaceutical research; signs, symptoms and clinical diagnosis; and virus detection. CONCLUSIONS: A novel analysis of the latest Arab COVID-19-related studies is discussed in the current study and how these findings are connected to global production. Continuing and improving future collaboration between developing and developed countries will also help to facilitate the sharing of responsibilities for COVID-19 in research results and the implementation of policies for COVID-19.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33766073/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00690-8,285
608485,Teledermatology Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A Mobile Application-Based Retrospective Study,2021-08-27,"Background Effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed. CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations. Methods This Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study (NCT04537208) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and [≥]50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 g) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples. Findings The interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03- versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata. Interpretation The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.

Here, we utilized an integrative approach combining epidemiology, virus genome sequencing, clinical phenotyping, and experimental validation to locate mutations of clinical importance. We identified 35 recurrent variants, some of which are associated with clinical phenotypes related to severity. One variant, containing a deletion in the Nsp1-coding region (Δ500-532), was found in more than 20% of our sequenced samples and associates with higher RT-PCR cycle thresholds and lower serum IFN-β levels of infected patients. Deletion variants in this locus were found in 37 countries worldwide, and viruses isolated from clinical samples or engineered by reverse genetics with related deletions in Nsp1 also induce lower IFN-β responses in infected Calu-3 cells. Taken together, our virologic surveillance characterizes recurrent genetic diversity and identified mutations in Nsp1 of biological and clinical importance, which collectively may aid molecular diagnostics and drug design.","Lin, Jing-wen; Tang, Chao; Wei, Han-cheng; Du, Baowen; Chen, Chuan; Wang, Minjin; Zhou, Yongzhao; Yu, Ming-xia; Cheng, Lu; Kuivanen, Suvi; Ogando, Natacha S.; Levanov, Lev; Zhao, Yuancun; Li, Chang-ling; Zhou, Ran; Li, Zhidan; Zhang, Yiming; Sun, Ke; Wang, Chengdi; Chen, Li; Xiao, Xia; Zheng, Xiuran; Chen, Sha-sha; Zhou, Zhen; Yang, Ruirui; Zhang, Dan; Xu, Mengying; Song, Junwei; Wang, Danrui; Li, Yupeng; Lei, ShiKun; Zeng, Wanqin; Yang, Qingxin; He, Ping; Zhang, Yaoyao; Zhou, Lifang; Cao, Ling; Luo, Feng; Liu, Huayi; Wang, Liping; Ye, Fei; Zhang, Ming; Li, Mengjiao; Fan, Wei; Li, Xinqiong; Li, Kaiju; Ke, Bowen; Xu, Jiannan; Yang, Huiping; He, Shusen; Pan, Ming; Yan, Yichen; Zha, Yi; Jiang, Lingyu; Yu, Changxiu; Liu, Yingfen; Xu, Zhiyong; Li, Qingfeng; Jiang, Yongmei; Sun, Jiufeng; Hong, Wei; Wei, Hongping; Lu, Guangwen; Vapalahti, Olli; Luo, Yunzi; Wei, Yuquan; Connor, Thomas; Tan, Wenjie; Snijder, Eric J.; Smura, Teemu; Li, Weimin; Geng, Jia; Ying, Binwu; Chen, Lu",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000457?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33548198/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.01.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312821000457,285

A rare but potentially severe manifestation of this virus is transverse myelitis. Herein, we report on two patients who developed paraparesis, sensory deficit, and autonomic changes on the tenth day after infection by COVID-19. A 27-year-old man, previously healthy, had symptoms of COVID-19 confirmed by oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab tests. On the tenth day of symptoms, the patient started to experience acute paraparesis, urinary retention, constipation, and hypoesthesia up to the T4 level. The second patient is a 50-year-old man, previously healthy, who had symptoms of the flu-like syndrome. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was confirmed by oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab tests. On the tenth day of symptoms, the patient started to experience paraparesis, urinary incontinence, and hypoesthesia up to the T6 level. The neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of both patients confirmed acute transverse myelitis after COVID-19 infection. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was started, and both patients showed rapid recovery from their deficits. Although rare, post-infectious transverse myelitis may be related to SARS-COV-2 infection and should be quickly recognized. Although controlled studies are needed, treatment with corticosteroid therapy in high doses was effective in these patients.","Vasconcelos, Thaís de Maria Frota; Oliveira, Danilo Nunes; Ferreira, Glauber de Menezes; Torres, Fabrícia Carneiro; Castro, José Daniel Vieira de; Braga-Neto, Pedro; Sobreira-Neto, Manoel Alves",J Neurovirol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449062/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-021-01010-x,285

609429,Domestic Violence and Safe Storage of Firearms in the COVID-19 Era,2020-05-20,"A growing body of evidence suggests that opioid use may affect consumer’s offspring by second-hand passive smoke exposure, as well as by transgenerational impacts mediated by genetic and epigenetic alterations of paternal gametes. In human studies, these effects are limited to investigating the neural, behavioral and cognitive characteristics of offspring. Only animal studies have investigated the metabolic parameters influenced by passive opium smoke exposure. Here, we conducted population-based analyses aimed to estimate the association of paternal opioid consumption, started before or after child birth, with BMI status and plasma lipid profile of young adult offspring. The present study includes 840 parents-offspring trios (offspring aged 15–35, parents aged 35–70) who participated in the prospective Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS)—a city in the south-east of Iran—as one of the district areas of the PERSIAN cohort (Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN). All procedures for interviews, anthropometric measurements and physical examinations, biological sample collection and laboratory tests for blood biochemical parameters were conducted according to the PERSIAN cohort protocol, and in the well-established RCS setting. Crude and adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to assess the relationship of paternal regular opioid use with offspring’s BMI status, and plasma lipid factors. The prevalence of fathers who use opioids regularly among the studied trios was 42.8% (360/840). Our regression analyses demonstrated that paternal opioid use started pre-fatherhood is associated with 76% higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) of overweight/obesity in young offspring (adjusted OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.15–2.71)), adjusting for sex, age, parental BMIs, paternal smoking status and socioeconomic status index (WSI). This relationship persisted when fathers who used opioid by routes other than inhaling (oral) were excluded from logistic analysis (adjusted OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.12–2.68)). Interestingly, sex stratified analysis displayed a 201% increased odds ratio of overweight/obesity in sons of fathers who use opioid regularly, started after child birth (Adjusted OR 3.01 (95% CI 1.68–5.39), while no significant association was found in daughters (adjusted OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.35–1.54)). Additionally, increasing exposure–response relationships were observed between odds ratios of overweight/obesity and the number of years of paternal opioid use after birth (p-trend = 0.0008). Paternal regular opioid use started pre-fatherhood was associated with 54% lowered risk of underweight [adjusted OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.24–0.86)]. Finally, paternal opioid consumption started either before or after child birth did not show a significant association with the high level of the three parameters of plasma lipid factors (triglyceride, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol) in offspring. Our results suggest that the environmental impacts of paternal regular opioid use may be sufficient to make an effect on male offspring metabolism independent of genetic and epigenetic impact on gametes.","Jalali, Zahra; Bahrampour, Saeed; Khalili, Parvin; Khademalhosseini, Morteza; Esmaeili Nadimi, Ali",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88781-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947903/,285

This paper documents my story in response to some of the stories of my patients’ experience of the impact of the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While there have been pandemics before, this pandemic is arguable unique because of social media and the number of people across the world who can share their experience.

We modeled such media impacts using a piecewise smooth function depending on both the case number and its rate of change. The proposed model was then converted into a switching system, with the switching surface determined by a functional relationship between susceptible populations and different subgroups of infectives. By parameterizing the proposed model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the Shaanxi province of China, we observed that media impact switched off almost as the epidemic peaked. Our analysis implies that media coverage significantly delayed the epidemic's peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, media impacts are not always effective in lowering the disease transmission during the entire outbreak, but switch on and off in a highly nonlinear fashion with the greatest effect during the early stage of the outbreak. The finding draws the attention to the important role of informing the public about ‘the rate of change of case numbers' rather than ‘the absolute number of cases' to alter behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact switching on and off, for better control of disease transmission.","Xiao, Yanni; Tang, Sanyi; Wu, Jianhong",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592757/,285

Neurosurgery in the storm of COVID-19: suggestions from the Lombardy region, Italy (ex malo bonum)",2020-04-10,"OBJECTIVE: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on healthcare utilisation. The aim of this retrospective review was to quantify how utilisation of non-COVID care changed during this time so as to gain insight and inform planning of future services during potential second and subsequent waves. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A longitudinal design was used to analyse anonymous private UK health insurer datasets covering the period of January 2018 to August 2020. Taken as a measure of healthcare utilisation in the UK, incidence rates of claims broken down by service area and condition were calculated alongside overall monthly totals and costs. Pre-COVID-19 years were compared with the current year. RESULTS: Healthcare utilisation during the first wave of COVID-19 decreased by as much as 70% immediately after lockdown measures were implemented. After 2 months, the trend reversed and claims steadily began to increase, but did not reach rates seen from previous years by the end of August 2020. Assessment by service and diagnostic category showed that most areas, especially those highly reliant on in-person treatment, reflected the same pattern (ie, rapid drop followed by a steady recovery). The provision of mental health services differed from this observed trend, where utilisation increased by 20% during the first wave of COVID-19, in comparison to pre-COVID-19 years. The utilisation of maternity services and the treatment of existing cancers also stayed stable, or increased slightly, during this time. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare utilisation in a UK-based privately insured population decreased dramatically during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, being over 70% lower at its height. However, mental health services remained resilient during this time, possibly due to greater virtualisation of diagnostics and care.","Howarth, Ana; Munro, Morag; Theodorou, Alf; Mills, Peter R",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330859/,285
613383,Regarding “The orthopaedic and traumatology scenario during Covid-19 outbreak in Italy: chronicles of a silent war” a Mexican perspective,2020-07-31,"Recent studies have provided insights into the autoinflammation triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, which is associated with high mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Striking similarities has been noted between COVID-19 and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibody (Ab)-related dermatomyositis (DM), implying a shared autoinflammatory aberrance. However, it is unclear whether anti-MDA5 Ab is present in COVID-19 and correlates with the severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19 patients. Here, we found that the positive rate of anti-MDA5 Ab in patients with COVID-19 was 48.2% and the anti-MDA5 Ab positive patients tended to develop severe disease (88.6% vs 66.9%, P<0.0001). In particular, the titer of anti-MDA5 Ab was increased in the non-survivals (5.95{+/-}5.16 vs 8.22{+/-}6.64, P=0.030) and the positive rate was also higher than that in the survivals (23.5% vs 12.0%, P=0.012). Regarding to severe COVID-19 patients, we found that high titer of anti-MDA5 Ab ([≥]10.0 U/mL) was more prevalent in the non-survivals (31.2% vs 14.0%, P=0.006). Moreover, early profiling of anti-MDA5 Ab could distinguish severe patients from those with non-severe ones. Overall, our data reveal that anti-MDA5 Ab is prevalent in the COVID-19 patients and high titer of this antibody is correlated with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes.","Liu, C.; Wang, Q.; Wang, Y.; Wang, G.; Wang, L.; Chen, H.; Jiao, T.; Hu, C.; Lei, X.; Guo, L.; Ren, L.; Li, M.; Zeng, X.; Zhang, D.; Cao, B.; Wang, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164780; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.29.20164780v1?rss=1,285
613592,"Recognising the value of ""shared pain""-mandatory covid-19 vaccination should include all NHS workers",2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 is a persistent and ongoing global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Non-anthropogenic factors, such as weather conditions and air quality are possible predictors of respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19. Weather conditions may also be a direct cause of biological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans and vary widely between regions. The course of an epidemic is determined by several factors, including demographic and environmental parameters, many of which have an unknown correlation with COVID-19. The goal of this study is to access the influence of ground surface particulate matter and weather parameters on the dissemination of COVID-19 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. METHODS: Data on average, minimum and maximum daily temperature, relative humidity; precipitation; sun duration in hours; and daily particle matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was obtained from the Slovenian Environmental Agency. The dataset on the number of daily COVID-19 cases in Ljubljana was obtained from the National Institute of Public Health. Data was divided into three groups: entire dataset; partial lifting of measures (from 1st of June to 30th of September); and less stringent containment measures (from 1st of July to 30th of September). Spearman rank correlation was used to investigate the association between new daily COVID-19 cases and weather data. RESULTS: The weather data and the daily new COVID -19 cases did not show any significant correlation during the entire period under investigation, except for PM 10 (0.30). With the beginning of the less stringent containment measures, five of the six weather parameters correlated significantly with the daily cases of COVID-19. Relative humidity showed the highest correlation coefficient (0.48). CONCLUSIONS: The correlations observed are highly dependent on the local policies that were in force during the period under study. The interaction between weather conditions and human behaviour may also be an important factor in understanding the relationship between weather and the spread of COVID -19.

This study protocol describes an approach designed to provide an in-depth understanding of how companies and their employees in Germany deal with their working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also interested in how and why the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could vary across different professional activities, company sites and regions with different epidemiological activity or infection control measures in Germany. We expect the results of this study to contribute to the development of working conditions protecting the health of employees during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An explorative multimodal mixed methods approach will be applied. Module 1 comprises a document analysis of prevailing federal and regional laws and regulations at the respective location of the participating company. Module 2 includes qualitative interviews with key actors at different companies. Module 3 is a repeated standardised employee survey designed to capture potential changes in the participants’ experiences and attitudes towards working conditions, occupational safety regulations/measures, and infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Module 4 comprises SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence testing. This is carried out by the medical service of the participating company sites as a voluntary offer for employees. Qualitative data will be analysed through document and content analysis. The complexity of the quantitative analysis depends on the response rates of modules 3 and 4. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of the study design was received in June 2020 from the responsible local ethical committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Tübingen and University Hospital Tübingen (No. 423/2020BO). The results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.","Rind, Esther; Kimpel, Klaus; Preiser, Christine; Papenfuss, Falko; Wagner, Anke; Alsyte, Karina; Siegel, Achim; Klink, Antje; Steinhilber, Benjamin; Kauderer, Johanna; Rieger, Monika A",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208339/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043908,285

The formula can be used as a powerful forecasting tool. The parameters of the theory are the transmission rate, reflecting the viral fitness and ""normal"" frequency of contacts in the infected areas, and the intensity of prevention measures. The duration of the period of intensive growth is essentially inversely proportional to the square root of the intensity of hard measures. A more precise formula is based on Bessel functions.

As more information is gathered about this new disease, it becomes clear that it affects not only respiratory, but also cardiovascular system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this review is to analyse the information about myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 and overview treatment options for these patients in publications which were published in the last 5 years. The data for this overview were collected in the PubMed database. Full-text articles were used for analysis when their title, summary, or keywords matched the purpose of the review. Only publications published in English that appeared in the last 5 years were analysed. For the analysis 14 publications were selected and analysed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection could mimic ST-elevation myocardial infarction and it is crucial to differentiate the main cause and choose the appropriate treatment. Cardiovascular complications are related with poorer prognosis and higher mortality. This should be thoroughly considered by the healthcare specialists in order to choose appropriate treatment strategy. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to plaque rupture should receive dual antiplatelet therapy and full-dose anticoagulation if it is not contraindicated. Therefore, priority should be given to the acute coronary syndrome given the low evidence of new antiviral treatment effectiveness. Number of agents which are under investigation for COVID-19 may have interactions with oral antiplatelet drugs. Selected patients could receive immunosuppressive treatment as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to recovery.","Alonderytė, Audrė; Navickas, Giedrius; Samalavičius, Robertas Stasys; Šerpytis, Pranas",Acta Med Litu,https://doi.org/10.15388/amed.2021.28.1.12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393626/,285

The aim of this project was to elaborate EULAR Points to consider (PtCs) on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: PtCs were developed in accordance with EULAR standard operating procedures for endorsed recommendations, led by an international multidisciplinary Task Force, including rheumatologists, translational immunologists, haematologists, paediatricians, patients and health professionals, based on a systemic literature review up to 15 December 2020. Overarching principles (OPs) and PtCs were formulated and consolidated by formal voting. RESULTS: Two OPs and fourteen PtCs were developed. OPs highlight the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need of a multifaceted approach to target the different pathophysiological mechanisms. PtCs 1–6 encompass the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 including immune response, endothelial dysfunction and biomarkers. PtCs 7–14 focus on the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection with immunomodulators. There was evidence supporting the use of glucocorticoids, especially dexamethasone, in COVID-19 cases requiring oxygen therapy. No other immunomodulator demonstrated efficacy on mortality to date, with however inconsistent results for tocilizumab. Immunomodulatory therapy was not associated with higher infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune abnormalities, play a key role in COVID-19. The efficacy of glucocorticoids in cases requiring oxygen therapy suggests that immunomodulatory treatment might be effective in COVID-19 subsets. Involvement of rheumatologists, as systemic inflammatory diseases experts, should continue in ongoing clinical trials delineating optimal immunomodulatory therapy utilisation in COVID-19.","Alunno, Alessia; Najm, Aurélie; Machado, Pedro M; Bertheussen, Heidi; Burmester, Gerd R; Carubbi, Francesco; De Marco, Gabriele; Giacomelli, Roberto; Hermine, Olivier; Isaacs, John D; Koné-Paut, Isabelle; Magro-Checa, César; McInnes, Iain; Meroni, Pier Luigi; Quartuccio, Luca; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Ramos-Casals, Manuel; Rodríguez Carrio, Javier; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Stamm, Tanja A; Tas, Sander W; Terrier, Benjamin; McGonagle, Dennis G; Mariette, Xavier",Ann Rheum Dis,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-219724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547062/,285

616476,Retrospect: The Outbreak Evaluation of COVID-19 in Wuhan District of China,2021-01-08,"PURPOSE: Prone positioning of non-intubated patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and hypoxemic respiratory failure may prevent intubation and improve outcomes. Nevertheless, there are limited data on its feasibility, safety, and physiologic effects. The objective of our study was to assess the tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: This historical cohort study was performed across four hospitals in Calgary, Canada. Included patients had suspected COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation, and underwent awake prone positioning. The duration, frequency, tolerability, and adverse events from prone positioning were recorded. Respiratory parameters were assessed before, during, and after prone positioning. The primary outcome was the tolerability and safety of prone positioning. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (n = 12 ICU, n = 5 hospital ward) were included between April and May 2020. The median (range) number of prone positioning days was 1 (1–7) and the median number of sessions was 2 (1–6) per day. The duration of prone positioning was 75 (30–480) min, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 91% (84–95) supine and 98% (92–100) prone. Limitations to prone position duration were pain/general discomfort (47%) and delirium (6%); 47% of patients had no limitations. Seven patients (41%) required intubation and two patients (12%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, prone positioning non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia was safe; however, many patients did not tolerate prolonged durations. Although patients had improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in the prone position, many still required intubation. Future studies are required to determine methods to improve the tolerability of awake prone positioning and whether there is an impact on clinical outcomes.","Solverson, Kevin; Weatherald, Jason; Parhar, Ken Kuljit S.",Can J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803468/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01787-1,285

Methods A pre-validated questionnaire was administered from January 2021 to February 2021 to assess the public attitude and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses were run to identify factors associated with the acceptance among the population. Results A total of 936 responses were elicited, where 15% perceived their risk of being infected at 20-30% with an overall 70% agreeing to be vaccinated if recommended. Multivariate analysis identified higher acceptance in the male gender, healthcare workers, and students. Of all, 66% respondents chose healthcare workers and public officials, whereas 15.6% chose scientific literature, and 12.9% chose social media as the most reliable source of COVID-19 information.

The incidence of breast cancer has been growing among Asian American women. Mammography is a screening procedure that provides early diagnosis for the timely treatment to reduce premature mortality due to breast cancer. However, there are no national data available that summarize the rates of mammography screening among Asian American women. Some small-scale studies have reported low rates of mammography uptake among Asian American women. This cross-sectional study utilized the fourth-generation, multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change to explain the correlates of mammography screening among Asian American women between the ages of 45–54 years. A 44-item instrument was evaluated for face, content, and construct validity (using structural equation modeling) and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) and administered electronically to a nationally representative sample of Asian American women (n = 374). The study found that Asian American women who have had received mammograms in the past 12 months as per recommendations, all three constructs of MTM, namely, participatory dialogue (β = 0.156, p < 0.05), behavioral confidence (β = 0.236, p < 0.001), and changes in the physical environment (β = 0.426, p < 0.001) were statistically significant and crucial in their decision to initiate getting a mammogram, accounting for a substantial 49.9% of the variance in the decision to seek mammography. The study also found that the MTM constructs of emotional transformation (β = 0.437, p < 0.001) and practice for change (β = 0.303, p < 0.001) were significant for maintaining the repeated behavior of getting annual mammograms and were responsible for 53.9% of the variance. This evidence-based study validates the use of MTM in designing and evaluating mammography screening promotion programs among Asian American women aged 45–54 years.","Sharma, Manoj; Dai, Chia-Liang; Batra, Kavita; Chen, Ching-Chen; Pharr, Jennifer R.; Coughenour, Courtney; Awan, Asma; Catalano, Hannah",Pharmacy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287360/,285

To confirm the evolutionary complexity of the cryptocurrency market, three general complexity analyses based on nonlinear measures were used: approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ). We analyzed the market complexity/unpredictability for 43 cryptocurrency prices that have been trading until recently. In addition, three non-parametric tests suitable for non-normal distribution comparison were used to cross-check quantitatively. Finally, using the sliding time window analysis, we observed the change in the complexity of the cryptocurrency market according to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. This study is the first to confirm the complexity/unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market from the bull market to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We find that ApEn, SampEn, and LZ complexity metrics of all markets could not generalize the COVID-19 effect of the complexity due to different patterns. However, market unpredictability is increasing by the ongoing health crisis.","Kim, Kyungwon; Lee, Minhyuk",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573859/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e23091234,285

METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients in the Vizient Clinical Data Base® with IS as a discharge diagnosis. The study outcomes were in-hospital death and favorable discharge (home or acute rehabilitation). In the primary analysis, we compared IS patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (IS-COVID) discharged April 1-July 31, 2020 to pre-COVID IS patients discharged in 2019 (IS controls). In a secondary analysis, we compared a matched cohort of IS-COVID patients to patients within the IS controls who had pneumonia (IS-PNA), created with inverse-probability-weighting (IPW). RESULTS: In the primary analysis, we included 166,586 IS controls and 2086 IS-COVID from 312 hospitals in 46 states. Compared to IS controls, IS-COVID were less likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or be smokers, but more likely to be male, younger, have diabetes, obesity, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, intubation, and comorbid intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (all p<0.05). Black and Hispanic patients accounted for 21.7% and 7.4% of IS controls, respectively, but 33.7% and 18.5% of IS-COVID (p<0.001). IS-COVID, versus IS controls, were less likely to receive alteplase (1.8% vs 5.6%, p<0.001), mechanical thrombectomy (4.4% vs. 6.7%, p<0.001), to have favorable discharge (33.9% vs. 66.4%, p<0.001), but more likely to die (30.4% vs. 6.5%, p<0.001). In the matched cohort of patients with IS-COVID and IS-PNA, IS-COVID had a higher risk of death (IPW-weighted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.33-1.82) and lower odds of favorable discharge (IPW-weighted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.73).

618857,COVID-19 Control Strategies and Intervention Effects in Resource Limited Settings: A Modeling Study,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Holding conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been associated with reductions in both actions to prevent the spread of the infection (eg, mask wearing) and intentions to accept a vaccine when one becomes available. Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased, or had no additional effect on that person’s COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs over a 4-month period. OBJECTIVE: We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the United States, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of COVID-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions. METHODS: A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics. Change across the two waves was analyzed using path analytic techniques. RESULTS: We found that conservative media use predicted an increase in conspiracy beliefs (β=.17, 99% CI .10-.25) and that reliance on mainstream print predicted a decrease in their belief (β=–.08, 99% CI –.14 to –.02). Although many social media platforms reported downgrading or removing false or misleading content, ongoing use of such platforms by respondents predicted growth in conspiracy beliefs as well (β=.072, 99% CI .018-.123). Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July. Unlike other media, use of mainstream broadcast television predicted greater mask wearing (β=.17, 99% CI .09-.26) and vaccination intention (β=.08, 95% CI .02-.14), independent of conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for greater efforts on the part of commentators, reporters, and guests on conservative media to report verifiable information about the pandemic. The results also suggest that social media platforms need to be more aggressive in downgrading, blocking, and counteracting claims about COVID-19 vaccines, claims about mask wearing, and conspiracy beliefs that have been judged problematic by public health authorities.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857008/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25215,285

619650,"Prevalence of severe adverse events in health professionals after receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination in Togo, March 2021",2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health problem that has already caused more than 662,000 deaths worldwide. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients present other severe damage such as cardiovascular, renal and liver injury or/and multiple organ failure, suggesting a spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in blood. Recent ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology now allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids in plasma. We herein intended to use the droplet-based digital PCR technology to obtain sensitive detection and precise quantification of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral load (SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 8 to 12 days after onset of symptoms and 12 healthy controls were analyzed. Disease severity was categorized as mild-to-moderate in 17 patients, severe in 16 patients and critical in 26 patients. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was quantified by droplet digital Crystal Digital PCR™ next-generation technology (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif, France). RESULTS: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was detected in 43 (74.1%) patients. Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia correlated with disease severity, ranging from 53% in mild-to-moderate patients to 88% in critically ill patients (p=0.036). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia were associated with severity (p=0.035). Among nine patients who experienced clinical deterioration during follow-up, eight had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at baseline while only one critical patient with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at the time of analysis died at day 27.

It was observed that; SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused a hyperinflammation and hyperimmune state and these conditions can result in a hypercoagulation and eventually thrombotic events might occur. METHODS: Here we presented two covid-19 positive patients with rare aortic thrombotic events. RESULTS: Two patients underwent emergent diagnostic tests including computerized tomographic angiography. Total aortic thrombosis just below the renal arising point was evaluated in one patient, and aortic floating thrombus was evaluated in other patient. But despite initial medical therapies, the clinical conditions of the cases worsened and both patients died while on medical therapy before planned surgical intervention applied.

Although an autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed, the genes, pathways and cell types causal to this new disease remain unknown. Here we perform RNA sequencing of blood from patients with MIS-C and controls to find disease-associated genes clustered in a co-expression module annotated to CD56(dim)CD57(+) natural killer (NK) cells and exhausted CD8(+) T cells. A similar transcriptome signature is replicated in an independent cohort of Kawasaki disease (KD), the related condition after which MIS-C was initially named. Probing a probabilistic causal network previously constructed from over 1,000 blood transcriptomes both validates the structure of this module and reveals nine key regulators, including TBX21, a central coordinator of exhausted CD8(+) T cell differentiation. Together, this unbiased, transcriptome-wide survey implicates downregulation of NK cells and cytotoxic T cell exhaustion in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.","Beckmann, Noam D.; Comella, Phillip H.; Cheng, Esther; Lepow, Lauren; Beckmann, Aviva G.; Tyler, Scott R.; Mouskas, Konstantinos; Simons, Nicole W.; Hoffman, Gabriel E.; Francoeur, Nancy J.; Del Valle, Diane Marie; Kang, Gurpawan; Do, Anh; Moya, Emily; Wilkins, Lillian; Le Berichel, Jessica; Chang, Christie; Marvin, Robert; Calorossi, Sharlene; Lansky, Alona; Walker, Laura; Yi, Nancy; Yu, Alex; Chung, Jonathan; Hartnett, Matthew; Eaton, Melody; Hatem, Sandra; Jamal, Hajra; Akyatan, Alara; Tabachnikova, Alexandra; Liharska, Lora E.; Cotter, Liam; Fennessy, Brian; Vaid, Akhil; Barturen, Guillermo; Shah, Hardik; Wang, Ying-chih; Sridhar, Shwetha Hara; Soto, Juan; Bose, Swaroop; Madrid, Kent; Ellis, Ethan; Merzier, Elyze; Vlachos, Konstantinos; Fishman, Nataly; Tin, Manying; Smith, Melissa; Xie, Hui; Patel, Manishkumar; Nie, Kai; Argueta, Kimberly; Harris, Jocelyn; Karekar, Neha; Batchelor, Craig; Lacunza, Jose; Yishak, Mahlet; Tuballes, Kevin; Scott, Ieisha; Kumar, Arvind; Jaladanki, Suraj; Agashe, Charuta; Thompson, Ryan; Clark, Evan; Losic, Bojan; Peters, Lauren; Roussos, Panagiotis; Zhu, Jun; Wang, Wenhui; Kasarskis, Andrew; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.; Nadkarni, Girish; Bogunovic, Dusan; Elaiho, Cordelia; Gangadharan, Sandeep; Ofori-Amanfo, George; Alesso-Carra, Kasey; Onel, Kenan; Wilson, Karen M.; Argmann, Carmen; Bunyavanich, Supinda; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta E.; Marron, Thomas U.; Rahman, Adeeb; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Gnjatic, Sacha; Gelb, Bruce D.; Merad, Miriam; Sebra, Robert; Schadt, Eric E.; Charney, Alexander W.",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24981-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381049/,285

Trait self-control (b = 0.27, p = .015), desire for self-control (Study 1: b = 0.28, p = .001; Study 2: b = 0.27, p = .005), and cognitive uncertainty (b = 0.73, p < .001) predicted more CDC adherence. State self-control (Study 1: b = −0.15, p = .012; Study 2: b = −0.26, p < .001) predicted less stockpiling, whereas emotional uncertainty (b = 0.56, p < .001) and cognitive uncertainty (b = 0.61, p < .001) predicted more stockpiling. State self-control (b = −0.18, p = .003) predicted less hedonic behavior, whereas desire for self-control (b = 0.42, p < .001) and emotional uncertainty (b = 0.26, p = .018) predicted more hedonic behavior. Study 2 (pre-registered) also found that emotional uncertainty predicted more stockpiling and hedonic behavior for participants low in state self-control (stockpiling: b = −0.31, p < .001; hedonic behavior: b = 0.28, p = .025), but not for participants high in state self-control (stockpiling: b = 0.03, p = .795; hedonic behavior: b = −0.24, p = .066).

621305,Self-reported neurocognitive symptoms during COVID-19 lockdown and its associated factors in a sample of psychiatric patients. Results from the BRIS-MHC study,2021,"Data sources CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Study selection Controlled studies (randomised or non-randomised) that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE on healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to highly infectious diseases, assessed which method of donning and doffing PPE was associated with reduced risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increased compliance with PPE protocols. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for inclusion of studies. Full text articles were subsequently assessed for eligibility and disagreements were resolved through consensus. Using criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each randomised study and rated each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear. ROBINS-I tool was used for the assessment of risk of bias in non-randomised intervention studies. Where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses were conducted. Results A total of 24 studies (randomised controlled trials [RCT] [n = 14]; Quasi-RCT [n = 1] and non-randomised design [n=9]) with 2278 participants were included. Included studies compared types of PPE (n = 8), evaluated modified PPE (n = 6), procedures for donning and doffing PPE (n = 8), and types of training (n = 3). Twenty-two studies were simulation studies, of which 18 simulated exposure of HCW to contaminated body fluids using fluorescent markers or harmless microbes and measured contamination outcomes, and four studies provided modified PPE or procedures and measured compliance with donning and doffing procedures. Types of PPE Powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio [RR] 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). Gowns compared to aprons may protect better against contamination (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). Breathable types of PPE are more comfortable and may increase user satisfaction, however with little impact on contamination. Modified PPE versus standard PPE Appropriate modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE. For example, contamination can be reduced using a sealed gown and glove combination so that they can be removed together and cover the wrist area (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), tight fitting gown around the neck, wrist area and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) and added tabs to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95%nCI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Guidance on PPE use: following the guidance and recommendations from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention for doffing PPE compared to no guidance may reduce self-contamination (MD −5.44, 95% CI −7.43 to −3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown compared to separate removal (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77), double gloving compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) and sanitising gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach (but not alcohol-based hand rub) may decrease contamination. Additional verbal instructions may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −0.9, 95% CI −1.4 to −0.4). User training To a vast extent, face-to-face training may reduce non-compliance with doffing guidance (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) compared to solely providing folders or videos. In addition, computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −1.2, 95% CI −1.6 to −0.7) and video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) compared to traditional lectures. Conclusions The more body parts are covered with PPE the better protection it offers. However, this is also associated and increased difficulty in donning and doffing PPE, and the PPE is less comfortable. Coveralls are the most difficult PPE to remove but may offer the best protection, followed by long gowns, gowns and aprons. The included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias, indirectness of evidence in simulation studies and small participant numbers. This increases the uncertainty about the estimates of effects, and it is likely that the true effects may be substantially different from the ones reported in this review.","Hegde, Shalika",Evid Based Dent,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41432-020-0097-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591668/,285

We quantified the relative risk for TKA in the Swedish population for different BMI categories and age groups to investigate whether the continued increase in TKA is attributable to increased prevalence of obesity and elderly people in the population, and to put forward model predictions for coming needs for TKA. Patients and methods — We used the Swedish Nationwide Health Survey (SNHS) and the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) 2009–2015 to calculate the relative risk (RR) of TKA by age (middle-aged 45–64 years and elderly 65–84 years) and BMI (BMI 18.5–24.9 normal weight; BMI 25.0–29.9 overweight; BMI > 30 obese). The RR for TKA was applied to the demographic forecasts for the Swedish population as a forecasting model. Results — Population size increased 5.2% from 2009 to 2015 to 40,000 middle-aged and 250,000 elderly, and the prevalence of obesity increased from 16% to 18% in these 2 age categories. Compared with those of normal weight, the RR for TKA was 2.7 (95% CI 2.5–3.0) higher for the overweight and 7.3 (6.7–8.0) higher for the obese, aged 45–64. The corresponding figures for individuals aged 65–84 were 2.1 (2.0–2.2) and 4.0 (3.8–4.3) higher, respectively. The changes in the prevalence of obesity and an increase in the elderly population accounted for an estimated increase of 1,700 TKAs over the 7 years. Interpretation — The increase in obesity frequency and the rise in the population of middle-aged and elderly may, to some extent, explain the rise in TKA utilization in Sweden.","Overgaard, Anders; Frederiksen, Peder; Kristensen, Lars Erik; Robertsson, Otto; W-Dahl, Annette",Acta orthopaedica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895012/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2020.1816268,285

This study compared results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in timine and adenine homopolymeric regions than R9, at expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than RBK, and provided longer reads than RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99% vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK used on a R9 flow cell could maximize the yield and accuracy of the consensus sequence when used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.

621855,COVID-19 and neurocognitive disorders,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The rehabilitation process following cochlear implant (CI) surgery is carried out in a multimodal therapy according to German national guidelines and includes technical and medical aftercare. In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.

Because childhood obesity is a sensitive topic, many healthcare professionals find it difficult to discuss children's excess weight with parents. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in childhood obesity-related communication, as perceived by healthcare professionals in Romania. As part of the STOP project, healthcare professionals (family physicians, pediatricians, and dieticians) who treat children with excess weight were invited to a telephone interview. The semi-structured questions were translated from a questionnaire previously used at the Swedish study site of the STOP project. Interviews were transcribed and then used for thematic analysis. Fifteen doctors and three dieticians (16 females and 2 males), with average 18.2 ± 10.1 years of experience, were interviewed. Four main themes were identified. Professionals reported that when children began experiencing obesity-related stigma or comorbidities, this became the tipping point of weight excess, where parents felt motivated to begin treatment. Barriers in communication were part of several layers of distrust, recognized as tension between professionals and caregivers due to conflicting beliefs about excess weight, as well as lack of trust in medical studies. Most respondents felt confident using models of good practice, consisting of a gentle approach and patient-centered care. Nonetheless, professionals noted systemic barriers due to a referral system and allocation of clinical time that hinder obesity treatment. They suggested that lack of specialized centers and inadequate education of healthcare professional conveys the system does not prioritize obesity treatment and prevention. The interviewed Romanian doctors and dieticians identified patient-centered care as key to treating children with obesity and building trust with their caregivers. However their efforts are hindered by healthcare system barriers, including the lack of specialized centers, training, and a referral system. The findings therefore suggest that, to improve childhood obesity prevention and treatment, systemic barriers should be addressed.

However, only a minority of young ventures actively engage in LD, and research rather focuses on large corporations and SMEs, which do not share the typical startup characteristics such as a rather young workforce, flat hierarchies, resource scarcity, and high time pressure. To overcome this practical and theoretical lack of knowledge, we engage in foresight and explore which leadership development techniques will be most relevant for startups within the next five to ten years. To formulate the most probable scenario, we conduct an international, two-stage Delphi study with 27 projections among industry experts. According to the expert panel, the majority of startups will engage in leadership development over the next decade. Most startups will aim to develop the leadership capabilities of their workforce as a whole and use external support. The most prominent prospective LD measures in startups include experiential learning methods, such as action learning, developmental job assignments, multi-rater feedback, as well as digital experiential learning programs, and developmental relationships such as coaching in digital one-to-one sessions.

Participants/Methods The survey was sent to 82 pregnant women who had Type 1, Type 2 Diabetes, or Gestational Diabetes and attended the Diabetes in Pregnancy Clinic in Wellington, New Zealand in May 2020, while the most restrictive COVID-19 lockdown measures were in place. All women received standard pregnancy nutrition advice provided by a dietitian, were monitoring blood glucose levels with nursing support, and seeing specialist endocrinologists and obstetricians for their pregnancy care. Results Fifty women (61%) responded to the survey. There was no evidence of differences in dietary intake during the restrictions, compared to before, for most food items. During the restriction’s women consumed more bread (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.39 (0.18 to 0.83) p = 0.02); less battered fish: 3.11 (1.20 to 8.05) p = 0.02; and less hot chips/fries: 6.32 (2.67 to 14.93) p <0.0001.

Conclusions The nutrition of pregnant women with diabetes was not compromised during a brief COVID-19 lockdown restriction. This finding is reassuring, with countries worldwide adopting brief intermittent lockdown periods to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 virus.","Amataiti, Tutangi.A.; Hood, Fiona.; Krebs, Jeremy.D.; Weatherall, Mark.; Hall, Rosemary.M.",Clin Nutr ESPEN,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240545772100262X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240545772100262X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620347/,285

While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity may drive the emergence of these novel variants, studies documenting a critical a role for interferon responses in the early control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses, suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the potency of 17 different human interferons against 5 viral lineages sampled during the course of the global outbreak that included ancestral and emerging variants. Our data revealed increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating that evasion of innate immunity is a significant driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution. These findings have implications for the increased lethality of emerging variants and highlight the interferon subtypes that may be most successful in the treatment of early infections.","Guo, Kejun; Barrett, Bradley S.; Mickens, Kaylee L.; Hasenkrug, Kim J.; Santiago, Mario L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.20.436257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758840/,285

Quinze pour cent ont été infectés avec un taux de mortalité de 19 % en France. Le retentissement de la pandémie sur le parcours patients des patients hémodialysés incidents (PPHI) est moins décrit. Description Dans notre hôpital, nous avons un suivi du PPHI depuis plusieurs années. Nous avons comparé différents marqueurs de la prise en charge des patients en 2017–2019 et en 2020 afin d’explorer si la pandémie avait des effets sur le PPHI qui sont associés dans la littérature à la morbidité et à la mortalité des patients. Méthodes Nous avons comparé les données démographiques des patients, leurs comorbidités, l’accès vasculaire au démarrage, le pourcentage de démarrage en urgence, le recours à la consultation infirmière d’annonce (CsIDE) et l’inscription sur liste d’attente de greffe rénale avant le démarrage de la dialyse (ITR) sur la période préalable à la pandémie (2017–2019) par rapport à celle de 2020. Résultats Entre 2017–2019, 366 patients ont initié l’hémodialyse contre 98 en 2020. Il n’y avait pas de différence entre les 2 groupes pour l’âge, le pourcentage de patients diabétiques, hypertendus, le pourcentage de patients suivis et la durée de suivi. On observe par contre un pourcentage plus élevé de démarrage sur cathéter en 2020 (60 %) vs (46 %) en 2017–2019, p =0,04. Il y avait également plus de démarrage en urgence (24 % vs 14 %, p =0,03), un pourcentage plus faible de CsIDE (37 % vs 51 %, p =0,03) et d’ ITR (17 % vs 28 %, p =0,05) en 2020 vs 2017–2019. Conclusion La pandémie de COVID19 est associée à une dégradation de différents marqueurs du PPHI des patients de notre centre. Les explications sont multiples : moindre accès au bloc opératoire, crainte d’être infecté responsable d’un retard de prise en charge, diminution de l’offre de soin (CsIDE et consultation médicale).","Azria, S.; El Badaoui, S.; Fessi, H.; Lammouchi, M.

METHODS: The study was conducted as a parallel-group, randomised controlled design. The sample of the study consisted of 77 parents who were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups (control group n = 40; intervention group n = 37). One session of online SFSP was applied to the intervention group each week and 4 sessions were applied in total. No intervention was applied to the control group. The data were collected using introductory information form and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) programme and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) 23 application were used in the analysis of the data. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to examine a hypothesised model that SFSP has both direct and indirect effects on the anxiety levels of parents. RESULTS: The state and trait anxiety mean scores of the intervention group decreased compared with the pre-intervention mean scores after the implemented programme. While this difference between state anxiety scores was statistically significant (P ≤ .001), the difference between trait anxiety scores was not statistically significant (P > .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test STAI total scores of the control group.

Coronavirus infection has spread globally and swiftly with major impacts on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. Fast and reliable detection of COVID-19 is a very significant issue for the effective treatment of this bad illness. For this aim, first, an Epoxy functional group-substituted thiophene monomer was synthesized and electrodeposited on a single-use indium tin oxide (ITO) platform in the presence of acetylene black by employing a cyclic voltammetry technique; thus, a conducting nanocomposite (C-NC) layer with high conductivity was obtained. This composite was electrodeposited for the first time on the ITO surface to generate a facile and cost-effective impedimetric biosensor. In addition, this composite provided proper attachment points for antibody binding and also supported the biosensor construction. The immuno-specific biointeractions between anti-RBD and RBD proteins hampered the electron transfer between the ITO substrate surface and electrolyte, and this reaction caused variations in impedance signals, and these signals were proportional to the immobilized RBD antigen amounts. The as-prepared immunosensor showed a wide linear dynamic range (0.0012-120 pg/mL), an ultra-low detection limit of 0.58 fg/mL with added superiorities of great selectivity, suitable repeatability, multiple reusability, and excellent reproducibility.","Aydin, Elif Burcu; Aydin, Muhammet; Sezgintürk, Mustafa Kemal",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c00580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292712/,285

Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This indicates that these patients seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility to and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage.

Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and chi-square tests were performed. Four thousand five hundred surveys were analyzed. The overall vaccination acceptance was 91.7%. The age group ≤20 years showed the lowest vaccination acceptance. Factors associated with vaccination hesitancy were lack of trust in authorities and pharmaceutical companies. Attitudes among acquaintances were associated with vaccination hesitancy too. Participants with vaccination hesitancy more often obtained information about COVID-19 vaccines via messenger services or online video platforms and underperformed in the knowledge test. We found high acceptance amongst German HCWs. Several factors associated with vaccination hesitancy were identified which could be targeted in HCW vaccination campaigns.","Holzmann-Littig, Christopher; Braunisch, Matthias Christoph; Kranke, Peter; Popp, Maria; Seeber, Christian; Fichtner, Falk; Littig, Bianca; Carbajo-Lozoya, Javier; Allwang, Christine; Frank, Tamara; Meerpohl, Joerg Johannes; Haller, Bernhard; Schmaderer, Christoph",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358193/,285

Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off > 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population. They should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage.","Meyer, B.; Torriani, G.; Yerly, S.; Mazza, L.; Calame, A.; Arm-Vernez, I.; Zimmer, G.; Agoritsas, T.; Stirnemann, J.; Spechbach, H.; Guessous, I.; Stringhini, S.; Pugin, J.; Roux-Lombard, P.; Fontao, L.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Eckerle, I.; Vuilleumier, N.; Kaiser, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20080879; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20080879v1?rss=1,285
626186,A more secure and effective method for throat swab collection: The importance of adequate exposure of oral cavity in COVID-19 specimen collection,2021-01-04,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Given that this novel virus most notably affects the human respiratory system, early detection may help prevent severe lung damage, save lives, and help prevent further disease spread. Given the constraints on the healthcare facilities and staff, the role of artificial intelligence for automatic diagnosis is critical. The automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 based on medical images is, however, not straightforward. Due to the novelty of the disease, available X-ray datasets are very limited. Furthermore, there is a significant similarity between COVID-19 X-rays and other lung infections. In this paper, these challenges are addressed by proposing an approach consisting of a bag of visual words and a neural network classifier. The proposed method can classify X-ray chest images into non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 with high performance. Three public datasets are used to evaluate the proposed approach. Our best accuracy on the first, second, and third datasets is 96.1, 99.84, and 98 percent. Since detection of COVID-19 is important, sensitivity is used as a criterion. The proposed method’s best sensitivities are 90.32, 99.65, and 91 percent on these datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that extracting features with the bag of visual words results in better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art techniques.","Nabizadeh-Shahre-Babak, Zahra; Karimi, Nader; Khadivi, Pejman; Roshandel, Roshanak; Emami, Ali; Samavi, Shadrokh",Biomed Signal Process Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007303/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421003475?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1746809421003475,285

Conventionally, antigens are conjugated to scaffolds through genetic fusion or chemical conjugation, which may result in impaired assembly or heterogeneous binding and orientation of the antigens. By combining two emerging technologies—i.e., self-assembling multimeric protein scaffold particles (MPSPs) and bacterial superglue—these shortcomings can be overcome and antigens can be bound on particles in their native conformation. In the present work, we assessed whether this technology could improve the immunogenicity of a candidate subunit vaccine against the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). For this, the head domain of glycoprotein Gn, a known target of neutralizing antibodies, was coupled on various MPSPs to further assess immunogenicity and efficacy in vivo. The results showed that the Gn head domain, when bound to the lumazine synthase-based MPSP, reduced mortality in a lethal mouse model and protected lambs, the most susceptible RVFV target animals, from viremia and clinical signs after immunization. Furthermore, the same subunit coupled to two other MPSPs (Geobacillus stearothermophilus E2 or a modified KDPG Aldolase) provided full protection in lambs as well.","Wichgers Schreur, Paul J.; Tacken, Mirriam; Gutjahr, Benjamin; Keller, Markus; van Keulen, Lucien; Kant, Jet; van de Water, Sandra; Lin, Yanyin; Eiden, Martin; Rissmann, Melanie; von Arnim, Felicitas; König, Rebecca; Brix, Alexander; Charreyre, Catherine; Audonnet, Jean-Christophe; Groschup, Martin H.; Kortekaas, Jeroen",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806789/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030301,285

With the advent of the more recent pandemics, the urgency to expand the range has become even more evident. However, the potential limited availability and affordability of vaccines to resource low- and middle-income countries has created a need for solutions that will ensure cost-effective vaccine production methods for these countries. Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) (also known as Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most promising candidates for expression of heterologous proteins in vaccines development. It combines the speed and ease of highly efficient prokaryotic platforms with some key capabilities of mammalian systems, potentially reducing manufacturing costs.

The aim of this study was to assess the psychological status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has compounded Libya's existing civil war-related problems. Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. Results The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Our study presents important findings regarding depressive, anxiety symptoms, and abuse among physicians providing care during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya.

627231,Re: Lasting lessons learnt in the radiology department from the battle with COVID-19,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: Despite the necessity, there is no reliable biomarker to predict disease severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The currently published prediction models are not fully applicable to clinical use. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and to justify their threshold values for the stratification of the risk of deterioration that would require transferring to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The study cohort (560 subjects) included all consecutive patients admitted to Dubai Mediclinic Parkview Hospital from February to May 2020 with COVID-19 confirmed by the PCR. The challenge of finding the cut-off thresholds was the unbalanced dataset (eg, the disproportion in the number of 72 patients admitted to ICU vs 488 non-severe cases). Therefore, we customised supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm in terms of threshold value used to predict worsening. RESULTS: With the default thresholds returned by the ML estimator, the performance of the models was low. It was improved by setting the cut-off level to the 25th percentile for lymphocyte count and the 75th percentile for other features. The study justified the following threshold values of the laboratory tests done on admission: lymphocyte count <2.59×10(9)/L, and the upper levels for total bilirubin 11.9 μmol/L, alanine aminotransferase 43 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 32 U/L, D-dimer 0.7 mg/L, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 39.9 s, creatine kinase 247 U/L, C reactive protein (CRP) 14.3 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase 246 U/L, troponin 0.037 ng/mL, ferritin 498 ng/mL and fibrinogen 446 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: The performance of the neural network trained with top valuable tests (aPTT, CRP and fibrinogen) is admissible (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86; 95% CI 0.486 to 0.884; p<0.001) and comparable with the model trained with all the tests (AUC 0.90; 95% CI 0.812 to 0.902; p<0.001).

METHODS: A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020. Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts. RESULTS: Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p < 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. KEY POINTS: • CT can play an early warning role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the case of no epidemic exposure. • CT could be used for the differential diagnosis of influenza and COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy. • COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities with peripheral distribution and balanced lobe predomination.","Wang, Hao; Wei, Ran; Rao, Guihua; Zhu, Jie; Song, Bin",Eur Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323011/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06880-z,285

Its effect on providing in-hospital lactation support has not been well described. RESEARCH AIM: To describe the experiences of healthcare workers as they provided in-hospital lactation support during the pandemic. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, online survey evaluated healthcare providers working with postpartum women and newborns affected by COVID-19 at an academic center during March-June 2020. Providers were queried regarding the influence of COVID-19 and COVID-19-specific policies on providing lactation support. Questions assessed guidance received, perceived stress, difficulty providing care, and solicited qualitative responses. The constant comparative method was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: Of 108 providers, 70 (65%) completed the survey. Of 57 providing direct lactation support to women affected by COVID-19, most (n = 39, 67%) reported increased stress. Participants reported lower stress scores when receiving guidance through shift meetings or email compared to those not receiving this guidance [stress score with shift meeting guidance (M [SD]): 3.10 (0.88); score without guidance: 3.83 (0.66); n = 39, p = .009; score with email guidance: 3.79 (0.58); score without guidance: 4.50 (0.58); n = 18, p = .045). Qualitative responses (n = 67; 96%) identified three themes: visitor restrictions allowed less distraction during lactation support; physical separation disrupted maternal/infant bonding; workflow challenges resulted from policy changes and supply access. CONCLUSIONS: Most participating staff providing lactation support to women affected by COVID-19 reported increased stress. Ensuring written or verbal guidance may reduce staff's experiences of stress. Efforts to optimize lactation support during COVID-19 should consider reducing distractions, physical separation, and logistic challenges.","Hoying, Rachel; Badreldin, Nevert; Shah, Malika D; Bolden, Janelle R; Cummings, Peter; Robinson, Daniel T",J Hum Lact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581635/; https://doi.org/10.1177/08903344211047843,285

OBJECTIVE: (i) To test whether patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs) thought that a novel patient isolation hood was safe and comfortable, and (ii) to obtain hospital HCW COVID-19 infections. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 20 patients, entailing HCWSS/patient questionnaires, and safety aspects of prototype isolation hoods. Prospective collection of HCW COVID-19 data. Assessment of the hood’s safety and practicality, and adverse event reporting. OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires’ responses, adverse events reporting, rates of HCW infections during study period (20/6/2020 - 21/7/2020). HCW COVID-19 infections reported until last recorded HCW COVID-19 diagnosis (20/6/2020 - 27/9/2020). RESULTS: Of the 60/64 eligible individual HCW surveys, all 60 surveys were overall favourable (>75% questions answered in favour of the isolation hood). HCWs were unanimous in: perceiving the hood as safe (60/60), preferring its use (56/56), and understanding its potential COVID-19 cross-contamination minimisation (60/60). All eight patients who completed the questionnaire thought the isolation hood helped prevent COVID-19 cross-infection, was safe, and comfortable. There were no reported patient safety adverse events. The COVID-19 attack rate from 20/6/2020-27/9/2020 among registered nurses was: ICUs 2.2% (3/138), Geriatric wards 13.2% (26/197), and COVID-19 Wards 18.3% (32/175). The COVID-19 attack rate among medical staff was: junior staff 2.1% (24/932), senior staff 0.7% (4/607), aged care/rehabilitation 6.7% (2/30), and ICU all medical staff 8.6% (3/35). CONCLUSIONS: The isolation hood was preferred to standard care by HCWs, and well tolerated by patients, and post-study became part of standard ICU therapy. There was an association between being an ICU nurse and a low COVID-19 infection rate (no causality implied).

We intend to evaluate attitudes toward each intervention, safety culture, subjective workload for each case, effectiveness of each intervention (including through direct observation of a sample of surgeries in each observational phase), operating room duration, length of stay, and patient safety incident reports. Analytic methods will include statistical data analysis, point process analysis, and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018 and approved by the institutional review board of each institution in May and June of 2019 (CSMC and MDRH: Pro00056245; VCMC: STUDY 270; MUSC: Pro00088741). After refining the 3 interventions in phase 1, data collection for phase 2 (baseline data) began in November 2019 and was scheduled to continue through June 2020. However, data collection was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 65 observations across the 4 sites before the pandemic. Data collection for phase 2 was resumed in October 2020 at 2 of the 4 sites. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the largest direct observational study of surgery ever conducted with data collected on 680 robotic surgery procedures at 4 different institutions. The proposed interventions will be evaluated using individual-level (workload and attitude), process-level (perioperative duration and flow disruption), and organizational-level (safety culture and complications) measures. An implementation science framework is also used to investigate the causes of success or failure of each intervention at each site and understand the potential spread of the interventions.

The sample period covers the first and second devasting waves of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and ranges from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The dynamic return and volatility connectedness measures are estimated using the time varying parameter-VAR approach. Our return connectedness analysis shows that the media coverage index (only before the first wave) and the cryptocurrencies are the net transmitters of shocks while the fiat currencies are the net receivers of shocks. Similar results are obtained in terms of volatility, except for the euro, which shows a clear net receiver profile in January and February. This fiat currency (the euro) became a net transmitter in March and during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, which possibly shows the virulence of the pandemic on the European continent. Moreover, the most relevant differences between the net dynamic (return and volatility) connectedness of these two groups of currencies are focused on the beginning of the sample period, just before the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis, although some differences are observed during the first and second waves of the coronavirus outbreak.","Umar, Zaghum; Jareño, Francisco; González, María de la O",Technol Forecast Soc Change,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162521004571; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521004571; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121025,285

Although upper respiratory tract infection is the cause of fever in most episodes of FS, studies to identify respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) test have rarely been performed for children with FS. Medical records of children presenting with FS between January 2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Respiratory viruses identified by a rapid influenza detection test and mPCR test were investigated, and their seasonal distribution and the association between viral identification and seizure characteristics were determined. A total of 607 episodes of FS were analyzed: 81.1% of cases were generalized tonic–clonic seizures, 81.5% occurred within 24 h after fever onset, and 87.3% continued for ≤5 min. Complex FS occurred in 17.5% of FS episodes, and epilepsy was diagnosed in 2.5% of tracked cases. Of the 138 mPCR tests performed in 235 hospitalized episodes of FS, 112 (81.2%) tested positive for respiratory viruses: rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus were most frequently identified. The identified respiratory viruses showed similar seasonal distributions as were observed in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The identification of a specific respiratory virus was not significantly associated with seizure characteristics or the development of complex FS. In conclusion, respiratory viruses, showing similar seasonal distributions with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and no significant association with the severity and outcomes of FS, should not be rigorously tested for in children with FS.","Han, Ji Yoon; Han, Seung Beom",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212914/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children7110234,285
633054,Risk of New Hospitalization Post-COVID-19 Infection for Non-COVID-19 Conditions,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has catalyzed the development of online educational resources. Webinars provide opportunities for convenient distance-learning and provision of expert lectures, while reducing the financial and practical costs of attending conferences. This cross-sectional survey aims to collect subjective opinion on the usefulness of webinars as an educational platform compared to face-to-face interactions, and whether surgeons and surgeons-in-training want webinars to remain a permanent platform for training and development in the future. METHODS: A free-to-attend online series of international expert lectures on a range of plastic surgery topics was delivered. Attendees were invited to anonymously complete a survey on attitudes towards webinars as an educational platform over a 2-week period. RESULTS: A total of 883 complete responses were collected. Overall webinar attendance increased following the pandemic, with 97.4% of respondents reporting they view webinars for at least 1 h per week following implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. 90.4% respondents indicated that they intend to continue utilizing webinars even once COVID-19 restrictions are eased, and 77.8% stated they learn as much from online webinars as in-person lectures. However, irrespective of training grade, a significant proportion of respondents believe webinars should not replace face-to-face meetings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that, while face-to-face meetings remain a valued component of education in Plastic Surgery, webinars are a useful adjunct to conventional methods, and may feature more prominently in the educational landscape of the future. Level of evidence: Not gradable.","Gowda, Siri; Simmons, Jonathan; Gokani, Vimal J.",Eur J Plast Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00238-021-01849-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366569/,285

METHODS: In total, 97 and 118 medical students completed patient safety courses at Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2019, the course was conducted using traditional learning in the classroom, whereas, in 2020, most of the classes were conducted using non-face-to-face learning methods. RESULTS: In 2019 and 2020, 49 and 53 students responded to the APSQ. Only one item “Patients are not really aware of how safe their care is” had a lower score in 2020 than in 2019.

RDNI has been recommended for treating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ""New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan"". AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate and verify the underlying mechanisms of RDNI for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: This study firstly performed anti-SARS-CoV-2 experiments in Vero E6 cells. Then, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was adopted to explore the potential mechanisms of RDNI in the treatment for COVID-19. After that, western blot and a cytokine chip were used to validate the predictive results. RESULTS: We concluded that half toxic concentration of drug CC50 (dilution ratio) =1:1280, CC50=2.031 mg crude drugs/mL (0.047 mg solid content/mL) and half effective concentration of drug (EC50) (diluted multiples) =1:25140.3, EC50=103.420μg crude drugs/mL (2.405μg solid content/mL). We found that RDNI can mainly regulate targets like carbonic anhydrases (CAs), matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and pathways like PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Forkhead box O s and T cell receptor signaling pathways to reduce lung damage. We verified that RDNI could effectively inhibit the overexpression of MAPKs, PKC and p65 nuclear factor-κB. The injection could also affect cytokine levels, reduce inflammation and display antipyretic activity. CONCLUSION: RDNI can regulate ACE2, Mpro and PLP in COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of RDNI in the treatment for COVID-19 may be related to the modulation of the cytokine levels and inflammation and its antipyretic activity by regulating the expression of MAPKs, PKC and p65 nuclear factor NF-κB.","Jia, Shanshan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Xinkui; Fan, Xiaotian; Huang, Zhihong; Lu, Shan; Shen, Liangliang; Guo, Siyu; Liu, Yingying; Wang, Zhenzhong; Cao, Liang; Cao, Zeyu; Zhang, Xinzhuang; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Jingyuan; Li, Jialin; Wu, Jiarui; Xiao, Wei",J Ethnopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33485971/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874121000970?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.113871; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874121000970,285

Because the impact of immunogenicity can be quite severe, regulatory agencies are developing risk-based guidelines for immunogenicity screening. T cell epitopes are at the root of the immunogenicity issue. Through their presentation to T cells, they activate the process of anti-drug antibody development. Preclinical screening for T cell epitopes can be performed in silico, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation. Importantly, screening for immunogenicity is complicated by the discovery of regulatory T cell epitopes, which suggests that immunogenicity testing must now take regulatory T cells into consideration. In this review, we address the application of computational tools for preclinical immunogenicity assessment, the implication of the discovery of regulatory T cell epitopes, and experimental validation of those assessments.","Weber, Constanze A.; Mehta, Preema J.; Ardito, Matt; Moise, Lenny; Martin, Bill; De Groot, Anne S.",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X09002208; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X09002208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619593/,285
635536,Flight Crash During COVID-19: Lessons Learnt,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children. The most common human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been detected in middle ear effusions (MEE), but there is only limited data available about the closely related human enteroviruses (HEVs). The newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV) has not, however, been identified in MEE of OME children. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the presence of HBoV and HRV/HEV and the rate of coinfection in a set of MEE samples collected from OME children. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-five MEE samples from 54 children with no acute respiratory symptoms were studied with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HRV/HEV and quantitative PCR for detection of HBoV. RESULTS: Twenty-six (35%) of 75 MEE samples were positive for viral nucleic acid, 22 (29%) for HEV, 10 (13%) for HRV and 2 (3%) for HBoV. There was no statistically significant difference between mucoid and serous effusions in the rate of virus detection. Forty-three percent of bilateral cases showed a contra-lateral difference in viral finding. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these common respiratory viruses can be associated with OME in children. Whether these viruses are causative etiologic factors of MEE persistence or merely remnants of previous infections is not known.","Rezes, Szilárd; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria; Roivainen, Merja; Kemppainen, Kaisa; Szabó, Zsolt; Sziklai, István; Pitkäranta, Anne",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209003862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19736042/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209003862; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.08.010,285

This work describes the development of a synthetic oligo-cassette for positive controls for accurate and highly sensitive diagnosis of several mutations relevant to influenza virus drug resistance. RESULTS: Using influenza antiviral drug resistance mutations as an example by employing the utility of synthetic paired long oligonucleotides containing complementary sequences at their 3' ends and utilizing the formation of oligonucleotide dimers and DNA polymerization, we generated ~170bp dsDNA containing several known specific neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance mutations. These templates were further cloned and successfully applied as positive controls in downstream assays. CONCLUSION: This approach significantly improved the development of diagnosis of resistance mutations in terms of time, accuracy, efficiency and sensitivity, which are paramount to monitoring the emergence and spread of antiviral drug resistant influenza strains. Thus, this may have a significantly broader application in molecular diagnostics along with its application in rapid molecular testing of all relevant mutations in an event of pandemic.","Wang, Bin; Steain, Megan C; Dwyer, Dominic E; Cunningham, Anthony L; Saksena, Nitin K",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843374/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-405,285

This mutation in F confers an advantage over wild-type virus in the CNS, contributing to disease in these patients. Using murine ex vivo organotypic brain cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids, we show that CNS adaptive mutations in F enhance the spread of virus ex vivo. The spread of virus in human brain organoids is blocked by an inhibitory peptide that targets F, confirming that dissemination in the brain tissue is attributable to F. A single mutation in MeV F thus alters the fusion complex to render MeV more neuropathogenic.","Mathieu, Cyrille; Bovier, Francesca T.; Ferren, Marion; Lieberman, Nicole A.

Subsequent rounds of iterative chemical derivitization and rescreening are conducted to enhance the potency, selectivity, and pharmacological properties of hit compounds. Although computational docking of ligands to targets has been used to augment the empirical discovery process, its historical effectiveness has been limited because of the poor correlation of ligand dock scores and experimentally determined binding constants. Recent progress in super-computing, coupled to theoretical insights, allows the calculation of the Gibbs free energy, and therefore accurate binding constants, for usually large ligand–receptor systems.

One important pollutant in this context is NO2. Sudden change in NO2 emissions related to reduction of urban traffic due to infection protection measures can be detected in Düsseldorf, Germany with continuous measurements of down-welling light with a RoX automated field-spectrometer. In comparison to a nearby reference instrument, a waveband around 590 nm was identified as significant for the retrieval in the VIS-NIR spectral range. A decision tree based on principal components which were decomposed from down-welling radiance spectra has been the most robust approach to retrieved NO2 values. Better differentiation of the NO2 value-range is achieved with a partial least square regression model. The results suggest that traffic-related changes of NOx pollution in urban air can be detected through continuous down-welling radiance measurements with inexpensive automated field-spectrometer systems.","Naethe, Paul; Delaney, Michael; Julitta, Tommaso",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141286; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720348154; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348154?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814287/,285

After bibliometric analysis of 999 scientific references, a survey of 16 clinical trials and analysis of 84 patents, it was possible to identify the dominant algae, molecules and viruses that have been shaping and driving this promising field of research. A description of the most promising discoveries is presented according to molecule class. We observed a diverse range of algae and respective molecules displaying significant antiviral effects against an equally diverse range of viruses. Some natural algae molecules, like carrageenan, cyanovirin or griffithsin, are now considered prime reference molecules for their outstanding antiviral capacity.

However, T‐cell function in vivo is generally analyzed indirectly, or is extrapolated from in vitro studies under nonphysiologic oxygen tensions. In this study, we delineate the role of physiologic and pathologic oxygen tension in vitro during reactivation and differentiation of tumor‐specific CD8(+) T cells. Using CD8(+) T cells from pmel‐1 mice, we observed that the generation of CTLs under 5% O(2), which corresponds to physioxia in lymph nodes, gave rise to a higher effector signature than those generated under atmospheric oxygen fractions (21% O(2)). Hypoxia (1% O(2)) did not modify cytotoxicity, but decreasing O(2) tensions during CTL and CD8(+) tumor‐infiltrating lymphocyte reactivation dose‐dependently decreased proliferation, induced secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL‐10, and upregulated the expression of CD137 (4‐1BB) and CD25. Overall, our data indicate that oxygen tension is a key regulator of CD8(+) T‐cell function and fate and suggest that IL‐10 release may be an unanticipated component of CD8(+) T cell‐mediated immune responses in most in vivo microenvironments.","Vuillefroy de Silly, Romain; Ducimetière, Laura; Yacoub Maroun, Céline; Dietrich, Pierre‐Yves; Derouazi, Madiha; Walker, Paul R.",Eur J Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201445284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929785/,285

The Chinese government took strong national intervention measures on January 23 to control the spread of the epidemic. We are trying to show the impact of these controls on the spread of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.

638811,Management of Canadian Pediatric Patients With Glomerular Diseases During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From the Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists COVID-19 Rapid Response Team,2020-11-13,"Background This paper describes the construction of a model used to estimate the number of excess deaths that could be expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Methods A series of compartmental models was used to estimate the number of deaths under different combinations of care required (ICU or ward), and care received (ICU, ward or no care) in England up to the end of April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information, organisations collating COVID-19 data and calculations using existing parameters. A compartmental sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent the increase in mortality that would be expected from a lack of provision of an ICU or general ward bed when one is required. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, 'Optimistic', 'Middling' and 'Pessimistic', are described showing how the model can be used to estimate mortality rates under different scenarios of capacity. Results The key output of our collaboration was the model itself rather than the results of any of the scenarios. The model allows a user to understand the excess mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of capacity being breached under various scenarios or forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios described in this paper are illustrative and are not forecasts. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in any of the 'Optimistic' scenario applications in sensitivity analysis. Several of the 'Middling' scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction comparted to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase). All the 'Pessimistic' scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the best-estimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below the best-estimate. The emergence of a new, more transmissible variant (VOC 202012/01) increases the likelihood of real-world outcomes at, or beyond, those modelled in our 'Pessimistic' scenario. The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be high and even possibly breached, there remains sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do not receive it. Conclusions No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the unadjusted 'Optimistic' assumptions of demand. The 'Middling' scenario could result in some excess deaths from breaching capacity, though these would be small (0.7% increase) relative to the total number of deaths in that scenario. The 'Pessimistic' scenario would certainly result in significant excess deaths from breaching capacity. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,219 (19.4% increase) and 103,845 (40.9% increase) excess deaths. Without the new variant, exceeding capacity for hospital and ICU beds was not the most likely outcome but given the new variant it now appears more plausible and, if so, would result in a substantial increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19.","McDonald, S.; Martin, C.

638974,Depressive and anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-related factors among men and women in Nigeria,2021-08-26,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) shown high morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases. Some of these patients are under oral anticoagulation (OAC) at admission but to date, there are no data on the clinical profile, prognosis, and risk factors of such patients during hospitalization for COVID‐19. DESIGN: Sub‐analysis of the international ‘real‐world’ HOPE COVID‐19 registry. All patients with prior OAC at hospital admission for COVID‐19 were suitable for the study. All‐cause mortality was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: From 1002 patients included, 110 were on OAC (60.9% male, median age of 81.5 [IQR 75‐87] years, median Short‐Form Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] of 1 [IQR 1‐3]) at admission, mainly for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. After propensity score matching, 67.9% of these patients died during hospitalization, which translated into a significantly higher mortality risk compared to patients without prior OAC (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.08‐2.16). After multivariate Cox regression analysis, respiratory insufficiency during hospitalization (HR 6.02, 95% CI 2.18‐16.62), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) during hospitalization (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.34‐3.91), and the short‐form CCI (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03‐1.49) were the main risk factors for mortality in patients on prior OAC. CONCLUSION: Compared to patients without prior OAC, COVID‐19 patients on OAC therapy at hospital admission showed lower survival and higher mortality risk. In these patients on OAC therapy, the prevalence of several comorbidities is high. Respiratory insufficiency and SIRS during hospitalization, as well as higher comorbidity, pointed‐out those anticoagulated patients with increased mortality risk.","Rivera‐Caravaca, José Miguel; Núñez‐Gil, Iván J.; Vivas, David; Viana‐Llamas, María C.; Uribarri, Aitor; Becerra‐Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Trabattoni, Daniela; Fernández Rozas, Inmaculada; Feltes, Gisela; López‐Pais, Javier; El‐Battrawy, Ibrahim; Macaya, Carlos; Fernandez‐Ortiz, Antonio; Estrada, Vicente; Marín, Francisco",Eur J Clin Invest,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080051/,285

A striking feature of these unique membrane structures is the induction of 70–100 nm vesicles (either free within the cytoplasm, associated with other induced vesicles or bound within a surrounding membrane) harbouring the viral replication complex (RC). Although similar in appearance, the cellular composition of these vesicles appears to vary for different viruses, implying different organelle origins for the intracellular sites of viral RNA replication. Genetic analysis has revealed that induction of these membrane structures can be attributed to a particular viral gene product, usually a non‐structural protein. This review will highlight our current knowledge of the formation and composition of virus RCs and describe some of the similarities and differences in RNA‐membrane interactions observed between the virus families Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae.","Mackenzie, Jason",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16190978/,285

A consequence of the delay in coronary revascularization has been the resurgence of structural complications of myocardial infarctions. Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) complicating late presenting acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high mortality despite advances in both surgical repair and perioperative management. Current data suggests a declining mortality with delay in VSR repair; however, these patients may develop cardiogenic shock while waiting for surgery. Available options are limited for patients with VSR who develop right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. The survival rate is very low in patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing surgical or percutaneous VSR repair. In this study we present two late presenting ST elevation MI patients who were complicated by rapidly declining hemodynamics and impending organ failure. Both patients were bridged with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to cardiac transplant.","Bakhshi, Hooman; Gattani, Raghav; Ekanem, Emmanuel; Singh, Ramesh; Desai, Mehul; Speir, Alan M.; Sinha, Shashank S.; Sherwood, Matthew W.; Tehrani, Behnam; Batchelor, Wayne",Heart Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387761/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956320304763?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.12.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956320304763,285

DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID‐19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi‐structured interviews were carried out either via face‐to‐face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7‐step method of Colaizzi. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID‐19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID‐19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID‐19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.","Chegini, Zahra; Arab‐Zozani, Morteza; Rajabi, Mohammad Reza; Kakemam, Edris",Nurs Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895986/; https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12583,285
639750,COVID-19 in Immunosuppressed Children,2021-04-29,"Background: There is a need for prospective studies investigating substance use variations in mild COVID-19 patients. These individuals represent the majority of patients affected by the disease and are routinely treated at home, facing periods of quarantine. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. All people who tested positive for COVID-19 and classified as mild cases (i.e., no alarm sign/symptom, no need for in-person consultation) during the treatment in the public health system of a Brazilian city with around 160,000 inhabitants were monitored by phone for all the COVID-19 symptoms listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the active phase of the disease (i.e., no longer experiencing symptoms, up to 14 days in mild cases). After this phase (median = 108 days after intake, IQR = 76–137), we asked these patients who were classified as experiencing mild COVID-19 (n = 993) about last-month substance use in three time-points: pre-COVID, just after COVID-19 acute phase (post-COVID acute phase) and in the period before survey (post-COVID follow-up phase). Results: The number of COVID-19 symptoms was not associated with pre- or post-infection substance use. Pre-COVID alcohol and non-medical benzodiazepine use were associated with specific COVID-19 symptoms. However, sensitivity analyses showed that such associations could be explained by previous psychiatric and medical profiles. Alcohol and tobacco use decreased and non-medical analgesics increased in the post-COVID acute phase. However, just alcohol use remained lower in the post-COVID follow-up period. Higher pre-COVID levels of tobacco and alcohol were associated with post-COVID follow-up cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Non-medical benzodiazepine use had positive and negative bi-directional associations with cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Conclusion: We were not able to find specific associations between substance use and COVID-19 symptomatology in the present study. Patients with mild COVID-19 should be monitored for substance use in the post-COVID-19 period, and preventive interventions for non-medical analgesic use should be implemented. Focused preventive interventions increasing the perceived risks of cannabis and non-medical benzodiazepine and analgesic use among people experiencing mild COVID-19 that reported previous substance use could be useful.","Ismael, Flavia; Zaramella, Beatriz; Battagin, Tatiane; Bizario, João C.

However, most early warning systems are centralized and isolated, thus there are potential risks of single evidence bias and decision-making errors. In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organinzations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality, and also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases.","Ouyang, Liwei; Yuan, Yong; Cao, Yumeng; Wang, Fei-Yue",Inf Sci (N Y),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002002552100342X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846657/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002002552100342X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2021.04.021,285

This study examines factors that influence perceived workforce preparedness at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during a pandemic. METHODS: The VA Preparedness Survey was a random, anonymous, web-based survey fielded nationwide October to December 2018. Multivariate statistical analyses examined the effects of study relevant factors (sociodemographic, work-related, general health, and household-related characteristics of VA employees) on perceptions of workforce preparedness, including institutional readiness and understanding of individual roles during a pandemic. RESULTS: Four thousand and twenty-six VA employees responded. Overall, 55% were confident in their VA medical facility’s ability to respond; 49% understood their role; and 68% reported their role to be important during a pandemic. After controlling for study-relevant factors, household preparedness, having plans that address the health care needs of family members, and higher self-reported health status were associated with all 3 workforce preparedness variables. Clinical staff (compared to non-clinical staff) were less likely (OR:0.80, 95% CI:0.68-0.94, P < .01) to have confidence in their medical facility’s ability to respond but more likely (OR:1.77, 95% CI:1.49-2.10, P < .001) to believe their role was important. Employees who have been at the VA longer (OR:1.07, 95% CI:1.01-1.14, P < .05) or have experienced a disaster while working at the VA (OR:1.29, 95% CI:1.04-1.59, P < .05) were more likely to understand their role during a pandemic. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest the need for identifying ways to increase VA employees’ confidence in their medical facility’s ability to respond to a pandemic; develop trainings to improve understanding of their different yet critical roles, for both clinical and non-clinical staff, during a pandemic; create different workforce trainings for newly hired employees; and identify ways to improve household preparedness for a pandemic outbreak.","Balut, Michelle D.; Der-Martirosian, Claudia; Dobalian, Aram",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759623/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211004738,285

In this study, we used iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC‐MS/MS for quantitative identification of differentially expressed proteins in BTV‐infected sheep testicular (ST) cells. Relative quantitative data were obtained for 4455 proteins in BTV‐ and mock‐infected ST cells, among which 101 and 479 proteins were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h post‐infection, respectively, indicating further proteomic changes during the later stages of infection. Ten corresponding genes of differentially expressed proteins were validated via real‐time RT‐PCR. Expression levels of three representative proteins, eIF4a1, STAT1 and HSP27, were further confirmed via western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in biological processes related to innate immune response, signal transduction, nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription and apoptosis. Several upregulated proteins were associated with the RIG‐I‐like receptor signaling pathway and endocytosis. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate proteome‐wide dysregulation in BTV‐infected cells with the aid of quantitative proteomics.

Hong Kong is characterized by high population density, and is susceptible to large-scale natural disasters and health crises such as typhoons, fires and infectious disease outbreaks. This research paper investigates the rates and predictors of urban community disaster risk perception, awareness and preparedness, at individual and household levels. Methods: A randomized cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were reported. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent associations between risk perceptions, socioeconomic factors, household characteristics, and personal background. Findings: Final study sample comprised of 1002 respondents with a 63% response rate. The majority of respondents (82.3%) did not perceive Hong Kong as a disaster-susceptible city. Half (54.6%) reported beliefs that the local population had lower disaster awareness than other global cities. Infectious disease outbreak (72.4%), typhoon (12.6%), and fire (7.1%) were ranked as the most-likely-to-occur population-based disasters. Although over 77% believed that basic first aid training was necessary for improving individual disaster preparedness, only a quarter (26.1%) of respondents reported participation in training. Conclusion: Despite Hong Kong’s high level of risk, general public perceptions of disaster in Hong Kong were low, and little preparedness has occurred at the individual or household levels.

A study protocol.,2020-07-18,"BACKGROUND: Community clinics (CCs) staffed by community health workers (CHWs) represent an effort of the Government of Bangladesh to strengthen the grassroots provision of primary health care services and to accelerate progress in achieving universal health coverage. The Improving Community Health Workers (ICHWs) Project of Save the Children piloted a CC-centered health service (CCHS) model that strengthened community and local government engagement, harmonized the work of different CHW cadres who were working in the same catchment area of each CC, and improved the accountability of CHWs and the CC to the local community. METHODS: We describe the process for developing and implementing the CCHS model in 6 unions in Barishal District where the model was piloted and provide some early qualitative and quantitative findings pertaining to the model's effectiveness. Data were collected from CCs in the 6 pilot unions and 6 other unions that served as a control. Qualitative data were collected from the intervention area during the pre-pilot (October 2017–September 2018) and pilot phase (October 2018–September 2019). Document review, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were also conducted. Maternal and child health service utilization data were extracted from the government health information system in both the intervention and control areas. RESULTS: Community group meetings ensured engagement with local government authorities and supported resource mobilization. There was greater coordination of work among CHWs and increased motivation of CHWs to better serve their clients. The analysis showed that the increase in maternal health consultations was substantially greater in the intervention area than in the control area, as was the number of referrals for higher-level care. CONCLUSION: The CCHS model as applied in this pilot project is effective in engaging local key stakeholders, increasing CHW capacity, and improving client satisfaction. The model demonstrated that a community health system can be strengthened by a comprehensive approach that engages communities and local government officials and that harmonizes the work of CHWs.","Uddin, Md.

Ibrutinib is a bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor in innate immune cells such as the neutrophils that diminishes their activation and influx to the site of injury. The present study evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib administration in the acute phase of SCI on neural tissue preservation and locomotor recovery. Ibrutinib was delivered intravenously at 3.125 mg/kg either immediately, 12 hours after, or both immediately and 12 hours after SCI induction in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Neutrophil influx into the lesion area was evaluated 24 hours following SCI using light microscopy and immunohistochemistry methods. Animals’ body weight changes were recorded, and their functional motor recovery was assessed based on the Basso mouse scale during 28 days after treatment. Finally, spinal cord lesion volume was estimated by an unbiased stereological method. While animals’ weight in the control group started to increase one week after injury, it stayed unchanged in treatment groups. However, the double injection of ibrutinib led to a significantly lower body weight compared to the control group at 4 weeks post-injury. Mean neutrophil counts per visual field and the lesion volume were significantly decreased in all ibrutinib-treated groups. In addition, ibrutinib significantly improved locomotor functional recovery in all treated groups, especially in immediate and double-injection groups. Neural tissue protection and locomotor functional recovery suggest ibrutinib treatment as a potent immunotherapeutic intervention for traumatic SCI that warrants clinical testing.","Torabi, Somayyeh; Anjamrooz, Seyed Hadi; Zeraatpisheh, Zahra; Aligholi, Hadi; Azari, Hassan",Anat Cell Biol,https://doi.org/10.5115/acb.20.299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031271/,285

This study examines the making of new regionalism in South China, using the case of Hong Kong–Shenzhen region.

Hong Kong’s internal economic, political and societal difficulties and external changing conditions are conducive to Hong Kong government’s re-regulation toward a more positive stance on cross-boundary regionalization. Although intense economic and social interactions exist between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a cross-boundary regional community has not emerged yet. The slow development of cross-boundary regional community is different from European case. The active participation of the governments aims to facilitate cross-boundary economic and infrastructure development and planning.

It increases mortality and morbidity and strains healthcare systems. Health care professionals can counter the rising AMR by promoting antibiotic stewardship and facilitating new drug development. Even with the economic and scientific challenges, it is reassuring that new agents continue to be developed. METHODS: This review addresses new antibiotics in the pipeline. We conducted a review of the literature including Medline, Clinicaltrials.org, and relevant pharmaceutical companies for approved and in pipeline antibiotics in phase 3 or new drug application (NDA). RESULTS: We found a number of new antibiotics and reviewed their current development status, mode of action, spectra of activity, and indications for which they have been approved. The included studies from phase 3 clinical trials were mainly utilized for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and pneumonia acquired in the healthcare settings. The number of these agents is limited against high priority organisms. The identified antibiotics were based mainly on previously known molecules or pre-existing antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: There are a limited number of antibiotics against high priority organisms such as multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. New antimicrobial agents directed against the top priority organisms as classified by the World Health Organization are urgently needed.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Momattin, Hisham; Al-Ali, Anfal Y.; Eljaaly, Khalid; Tirupathi, Raghavendra; Haradwala, Mohamed Bilal; Areti, Swetha; Alhumaid, Saad; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al Mutair, Abbas; Schlagenhauf, Patricia",Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01709-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606056/,285

643885,Inpatient Hyperglycemia Management and COVID-19,2020-12-05,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in patients experiencing symptoms that include neurological dysfunction. As many viral infections are associated with neuropathy, the aim of the study is to characterize the incidence and severity of neuropathic pain in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort study will be conducted in adult (≥18 years) patients who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Participants who are deceased, with incomplete test results, or who cannot be contacted will be excluded. Approximately 1320 participants will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio of those with a positive-to-negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. Each participant will be invited to complete a survey to assess their symptoms related to neuropathy, 30 to 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 test. Survey responses, demographics, and clinical data from the electronic health record will be used for analysis. The primary outcome is the incidence of new symptoms of neuropathic pain. The self-reported DN4 and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory questionnaires (Appendix 1, http://links.lww.com/PR9/A103) will be used for neuropathic pain screening and severity assessment, respectively. Exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate other potential clinical endpoints and trends. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Similar to previous coronavirus infections, an increased incidence of new-onset neuropathic pain after COVID-19 disease is expected, along with an increase in the severity experienced by patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing chronic pain. Comprehensive understanding of how COVID-19 affects the nervous system can provide a better framework for managing pain in this disease.","Odozor, Chioma U.; Roles, Kristen; Burk, Carrie; Kannampallil, Thomas; Clifford, David B.; Piccirillo, Jay F.; Haroutounian, Simon",Pain Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981939/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pr9.0000000000000925,285

Building on recently drawn analogies between the two epidemics, we argue that new normative injunctions to 'flatten the curve' and 'stay at home' individualise responses to COVID that make memory of the first decade of HIV vital in recent viral times. Individualistic responses, including those that bind individuals to social identity groups, obscure the ways in which effective care for others and the self requires a recognition of the partiality of community, the inevitability of vulnerability, and a complex interpretation of scientific evidence and human ontology. We draw on Eve Sedgwick's thinking about ignorance and power to critique how political leadership in 2020, particularly in the USA, created chaos that suggested that an individualist masculine response to the epidemic was the only thing that could save us.","Hegarty, Peter; Rollins, Joe","Culture, health & sexuality",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511039/; https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2021.1974560,285

Airborne aerosol and droplet transmission through human respiratory processes is modeled as an instance of a multiuser molecular communication scenario employing respiratory-event-driven molecular variable-concentration shift keying. Modeling is aided by experiments that are motivated by a macroscopic air-based molecular communication testbed. In artificially induced coughs, a saturated aqueous solution containing a fluorescent dye mixed with saliva is released by an adult test person. The emitted particles are made visible by means of optical detection exploiting the fluorescent dye. The number of particles recorded is significantly higher in test series without mouth and nose protection than in those with a wellfitting medical mask. A simulation tool for macroscopic molecular communication processes is extended and used for estimating the transmission of infectious aerosols in different environments. Towards this goal, parameters obtained through self experiments are taken. The work is inspired by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.","Schurwanz, Max; Hoeher, Peter Adam; Bhattacharjee, Sunasheer; Damrath, Martin; Stratmann, Lukas; Dressler, Falko",Ieee Transactions on Molecular Biological and Multi-Scale Communications,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04966v3.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1109/tmbmc.2021.3071747,285

However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.","Wibowo, Marsha C.; Yang, Zhen; Borry, Maxime; Hübner, Alexander; Huang, Kun D.; Tierney, Braden T.; Zimmerman, Samuel; Barajas-Olmos, Francisco; Contreras-Cubas, Cecilia; García-Ortiz, Humberto; Martínez-Hernández, Angélica; Luber, Jacob M.; Kirstahler, Philipp; Blohm, Tre; Smiley, Francis E.; Arnold, Richard; Ballal, Sonia A.; Pamp, Sünje Johanna; Russ, Julia; Maixner, Frank; Rota-Stabelli, Omar; Segata, Nicola; Reinhard, Karl; Orozco, Lorena; Warinner, Christina; Snow, Meradeth; LeBlanc, Steven; Kostic, Aleksandar D.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981035/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03532-0,285

We intent to analyze the chronological outline of these chemosensory disturbances in term of onset, progression and resolution in ENT doctors with COVID-19. In six symptomatic otolaryngologists who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, detailed symptomatology of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was collected prospectively on regular basis till a period of at least three months. Due to their awareness, sensitivity and reliability, even mild and transient relevant symptomatology could be recorded accurately. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was universally present in all the six otolaryngologists. The onset of the symptoms was in first week and resolved completely within 4 weeks in four of them. In two doctors the recovery of olfactory dysfunction to near normal level was delayed and prolonged over 2 and 3 months. The pattern of involvement of basic tastes like sweet, salt, sour and bitter as well as food temperature and texture etc. pointed towards involvement of the gustatory mucosa with non-uniform involvement of the papilla and taste receptors. One of the doctors also experienced reappearance of parosmia and phantosmia in the 3rd month following complete disease resolution. Due to their expertise in the field of Otolaryngology, the recruited doctors represented the precise pattern of progression and resolution of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19.

The most common cause of olfactory disorders are sinonasal disorders, which are defined as secondary smell disorders caused by diseases/pathologies in the nose/paranasal sinuses. According to the literature, sinonasal disorders represent—depending on the examined population—up to 72% of all olfactory disorders. In general, noninflammatory and inflammatory disorders are differentiated. Inflammatory disorders can be further classified into infectious or noninfectious disorders, both forms in which olfactory disorders can be present. For the clinician examining patients, the exact classification of the olfactory disorder is mandatory in order to choose appropriate treatment and counseling. Among the most common inflammatory disorders are acute rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, post‐upper respiratory tract infection and chronic rhinosinusitis, which are discussed in detail.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on patients with positive and negative COVID-19 statuses admitted to Lille University Hospital over 1 month. Pharmaceutical analysis instigated interventions to rectify drug-related errors. For each pharmaceutical intervention (PI), the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification of the drug and the outcome of such an intervention were specified. RESULTS: The study included 438 patients. Prescription analysis led to 188 PIs performed on 118 patients (64 COVID-19-positive patients and 54 COVID-19-negative patients). Most drug-related problems were incorrect dosage representing 36.7% (69/188) of all interventions: 27.9% (29/104) for the COVID-19-positive group and 47.6% (40/84) for the COVID-19-negative group. The most frequent PI in 34% (64/188) of cases was terminating a drug: 27.9% (29/104) for the COVID-19-positive group and 47.6% (40/84) for the COVID-19-negative group. The main drug classes involved were antithrombotic agents (20.7%, 39/188), antibacterials for systemic use (13.8%, 26/188) and drugs for gastric acid-related disorders (6.4%, 12/188). Study population was limited to a single centre over 1 month. CONCLUSION: No difference in PI was noted between the two groups.

Despite considerable effort and ample experimental data, the role of neuroinflammation related to systemic inflammation is still unsettled. While the implication of microglia is well recognized, the exact contribution of peripheral monocytes/macrophages is still largely unknown, especially concerning their role in the various stages of AD. OBJECTIVES: AD develops over decades and its clinical manifestation is preceded by subjective memory complaints (SMC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); thus, the question arises how the peripheral innate immune response changes with the progression of the disease. Therefore, to further investigate the roles of monocytes/macrophages in the progression of AD we assessed their phenotypes and functions in patients at SMC, MCI and AD stages and compared them with cognitively healthy controls. We also conceptualised an idealised mathematical model to explain the functionality of monocytes/macrophages along the progression of the disease. RESULTS: We show that there are distinct phenotypic and functional changes in monocyte and macrophage populations as the disease progresses. Higher free radical production upon stimulation could already be observed for the monocytes of SMC patients. The most striking results show that activation of peripheral monocytes (hyperactivation) is the strongest in the MCI group, at the prodromal stage of the disease. Monocytes exhibit significantly increased chemotaxis, free radical production, and cytokine production in response to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the peripheral innate immune system is activated during the progression from SMC through MCI to AD, with the highest levels of activation being in MCI subjects and the lowest in AD patients. Some of these parameters may be used as biomarkers, but more holistic immune studies are needed to find the best period of the disease for clinical intervention.

648283,The importance of anaesthetists in restarting elective surgery,2020-06-07,"INTRODUCTION: A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine. Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4–7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5±1 day, 10±1 day, 15±2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested. The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data.

Because viruses frequently mutate to escape direct inhibition of viral proteins, there is interest in targeting the host proteins that the virus must co-opt to complete its replication cycle. However, a detailed understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is necessary in order to facilitate development of host-directed therapeutics. As a first step, we performed a genome-wide loss of function screen using the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E to better define the interactions between coronaviruses and host factors. We report the identification and validation of an ER-resident host protein, TMEM41B, as an essential host factor for not only HCoV-229E but also genetically distinct coronaviruses including the pandemic betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We show that the protein is required at an early, but post-receptor engagement, stage of the viral lifecycle. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that although the protein was not enriched at replication complexes, it likely contributes to viral replication complex formation via mobilization of cholesterol and other lipids to facilitate host membrane expansion and curvature. Continued study of TMEM41B and the development of approaches to prevent its function may lead to broad spectrum anti-coronavirus therapeutics.","Trimarco, Joseph D.; Heaton, Brook E.; Chaparian, Ryan R.; Burke, Kaitlyn N.; Binder, Raquel A.; Gray, Gregory C.; Smith, Clare M.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Heaton, Nicholas S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043740/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009599,285

648873,Cancer care in the time of COVID-19—a perspective from Pakistan,2020-04-20,"The COVID-19 pandemic has now affected around 190 million people worldwide, accounting for more than 4 million confirmed deaths. Besides ongoing global vaccination, finding protective and therapeutic strategies is an urgent clinical need. SARS-CoV-2 mostly infects the host organism via the respiratory system, requiring angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter target cells. Therefore, these surface proteins are considered potential druggable targets. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a gasotransmitter produced by several cell types and is also part of natural compounds, such as sulfurous waters that are often inhaled as low-intensity therapy and prevention in different respiratory conditions. H(2)S is a potent biological mediator, with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and, as more recently shown, also anti-viral activities. Considering that respiratory epithelial cells can be directly exposed to H(2)S by inhalation, here we tested the in vitro effects of H(2)S-donors on TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human upper and lower airway epithelial cells. We showed that H(2)S significantly reduces the expression of TMPRSS2 without modifying ACE2 expression both in respiratory cell lines and primary human upper and lower airway epithelial cells. Results suggest that inhalational exposure of respiratory epithelial cells to natural H(2)S sources may hinder SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells and, consequently, potentially prevent the virus from spreading into the lower respiratory tract and the lung.","Pozzi, Giulia; Masselli, Elena; Gobbi, Giuliana; Mirandola, Prisco; Taborda-Barata, Luis; Ampollini, Luca; Carbognani, Paolo; Micheloni, Cristina; Corazza, Francesco; Galli, Daniela; Carubbi, Cecilia; Vitale, Marco",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572459/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9091273,285

To confirm this observation this paper proposes to evaluate the impact of COVID-19, and more generally of crises that lead to a sharp drop in traffic, on the pilot/controller system, especially during the critical approach and landing phases. To study the influence of this type of crisis on flight operations at Charles De Gaulle airport, an existing energy atypicality metric is applied on a reference period before COVID-19 and compared to the COVID-19 period. Whereas the traffic at Charles De Gaulle airport has decreased by around 90% on April 2020, the obtained statistics underlined an increase in the atypical flight ratio of around 50%. This trend can be explained in part by the appearance of glide interceptions from above as a result of trajectory shortenings, and an increase in the proportion of high speed approaches","Jarry, Gabriel; Delahaye, Daniel; Feron, Eric",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623897/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100327; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221000348; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221000348?v=s5,285

A total of 122 respondents (response rate 30.6%) from 60 transplant centers in 32 US states completed the survey. The majority of respondents (76%) recommend that HCT recipients should consider remote or hybrid school option at this time, if possible. If not possible, physicians recommended return to in-person school as long as they are at least 12 months post-transplant or off immune suppression while taking school safety measures and local COVID-19 cases into account.

Screening and treatment for cognitive problems are recommended, however these are not routinely delivered in UK clinics. We collected and synthesised stakeholder perspectives to develop a care pathway for cognitive problems in MS and produce a logic model, illustrating how this pathway might operate. Methods: Forty-nine stakeholders, including people with MS and care providers, participated in semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Participants viewed information that illustrated how the pathway might work and provided feedback. Data, transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework Analysis, were mapped onto a preliminary logic model and accompanying thematic framework. Results: The proposed pathway was perceived as helpful in providing standardised support for a neglected MS symptom. Training packages, online cognitive screening, and triaging decisions were viewed as crucial activities. Shared responsibility, a person-centred approach, and addressing the complexity of cognitive problems were important engagement mechanisms. Allocating time during clinic appointments and within staff workloads were essential resources for implementation. Conclusion: Our co-constructed MS cognitive screening and management pathway will be evaluated for clinical and cost-effectiveness in a trial. However, in the interim, clinicians can adapt and implement this pathway in their own services and evaluate it locally.","Smith, L.; Elwick, H.; Mhizha-Murira, J.R.; Topcu, G.; Bale, C.; Evangelou, N.; Timmons, S.; Leighton, P.; das Nair, R.",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820306374?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677366/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102563; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820306374,285

650366,Unexpected high mortality in COVID-19 and diabetic ketoacidosis()(),2020-06-24,"Background: The COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic has seen much research scrutinising the impact of C-19 on cancer patients, focusing on understanding the impact of a cancer diagnosis and anti-cancer treatments on mortality. Yet there is paucity of work regarding the end-of-life care (EOLC) for cancer patients dying with C-19. Methods: Retrospective record review of all non-ventilated patients who died in a tertiary referral UK cancer centre with known or suspected C-19 across the 2 peak pandemic waves from 25/03/20 – 01/05/20 and 05/12/20 – 01/03/21. Demographics and risk factors for severe C-19 were described. EOLC assessment considered palliative care (PC) needs, medications prescribed and advance care plans including Treatment Escalation Plans (TEP) and Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders. Results: 34 patients were included. Most patients were female (18) and White British (19), mean age was 69 (45-82). 8 patients had recognised cardiovascular risk factors;11 patients had no comorbidities additional to cancer. 26 patient had metastatic disease, 30 were receiving palliative treatment. Most patients were referred to PC for symptom control (20), 8 were referred for EOLC. All patients had DNAR orders and TEPs. The median number of PC reviews was 5 (range 1-24). Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) (a holistic assessment tool used in clinical care) scores on first assessment (n=24) recorded the main symptoms as weakness, lacking peace and anxiety. Family anxiety was the highest scoring aspect. Medical management at the end-of-life was, however, generally uncomplicated;total opioid (oral morphine equivalent) and benzodiazepine doses administered in last 24 hours before death were relatively low, median dose (range) 30mg (5-180 mg) and 10mg (0-30mg) respectively. Conclusions: With prompt recognition and access to standard EOLC, the symptom management of cancer patients dying from C-19 is relatively uncomplicated. As a transmissible disease, associated with social anxiety and restrictions, death from C-19 is, however, undeniably complicated. Timely acknowledgment of the vulnerability of patients with advanced cancer and C-19 is essential to facilitate early communication about patients’ priorities and wishes, and enhance family support.

650593,Precautions in postmortem examinations in Covid-19 - Related deaths: Recommendations from Germany,2020-06-12,"INTRODUCTION: Much of the science behind dietary guidelines for risk reduction and chronic disease management is equivocal, and there are well-accepted uncertainties and complexities relating to diet in everyday life, as well as physiological processes. Guidelines have therefore stopped short of aligning with one particular approach, instead highlighting several evidence-based options. However, reduced carbohydrate, or ‘low-carb’, diets have increasing traction in the media and with patients, practitioners and the general public. This qualitative study examines healthcare practitioner (HCP) experiences of implementing a reduced carbohydrate diet. METHODS: Semistructured, qualitative interviews were conducted with 19 HCPs in the UK family practice (including general practitioners, practice nurses and non-medical practitioners), recruited through a special interest forum, and social media. Data analysis employed social science theory and methods to produce key themes. RESULTS: All participants self-identified as ‘low-carb practitioners’ who, over time, had introduced a specific focus around carbohydrate reduction into their work. They reported transformations in patients’ metabolic markers, patient enthusiasm for the approach and renewed job satisfaction. Key themes highlight experiences of: (1) discovering low-carb as a new ‘tool-in-the-box’; (2) promoting and supporting incremental low-carb experimentation; and (3) diverging from established dietary guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important experience-based evidence on a topical dietary intervention. Participants strongly advocated for the use of low-carb diets. The successes described draw attention to the need for pragmatic, formative evaluation of low-carb advice and support as a ‘complex intervention’ (alongside physiological research), to justify, challenge and/or shape low-carb intervention in clinical practice. The findings raise important questions about the contribution of particular care practices to the apparent success of low-carb. Social science analyses can elucidate how dietary intervention is carried out across different healthcare settings (eg, dietetics, endocrinology) and patient groups, how healthcare practices intersect with people’s everyday self-management and how different forms of evidence are invoked and prioritised.","Cupit, Caroline; Redman, Emma",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34308130/,285

To date, there is a paucity of patient selection criteria and prognosticators to facilitate decision making and enhance precious ICU capacity. METHODS: Prospective study of COVID‐19 patients undergoing tracheotomy (n = 12) over a 4‐week period (March‐April 2020). Association between preoperative and postoperative ventilation requirements and outcomes (ICU stay, time to decannulation, and death) were examined. RESULTS: Patients who sustained FiO(2) ≤ 50% and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H(2)O in the 24 hours pretracheotomy exhibited a favorable outcome. Those whose requirements remained below these thresholds post‐tracheotomy could be safely stepped down after 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Sustained FiO(2) ≤ 50% and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H(2)O in the 48 hours post‐tracheotomy are strong predictive factors for a good outcome, raising the potential for these patients to be stepped down early, thus increasing ICU capacity.","Stubington, Thomas J.; Mallick, Ali S.; Garas, Georgios; Stubington, Emma; Reddy, Chetan; Mansuri, Mohammed S.",Head Neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441351/,285
650821,Spreading of COVID-19 in a Common Place: Medical Architecture Analysis,2020-04-23,"[Image: see text] Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type 1 uses a −1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) event to translate its enzymes from the same transcript used to encode the virus’ structural proteins. The frequency of this event is highly regulated, and significant deviation from the normal 5–10% frequency has been demonstrated to decrease viral infectivity. Frameshifting is primarily regulated by the Frameshift Stimulatory Signal RNA (FSS-RNA), a thermodynamically stable, highly conserved stem loop that has been proposed as a therapeutic target. We describe the design, synthesis, and testing of a series of N-methyl peptides able to bind the HIV-1 FSS RNA stem loop with low nanomolar affinity and high selectivity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data indicates increased affinity is a reflection of a substantially enhanced on rate. Compounds readily penetrate cell membranes and inhibit HIV infectivity in a pseudotyped virus assay. Viral infectivity inhibition correlates with compound-dependent changes in the ratios of Gag and Gag-Pol in virus particles. As the first compounds with both single digit nanomolar affinities for the FSS RNA and an ability to inhibit HIV in cells, these studies support the use of N-methylation for enhancing the affinity, selectivity, and bioactivity of RNA-binding peptides.","Hilimire, Thomas A.; Bennett, Ryan P.; Stewart, Ryan A.; Garcia-Miranda, Pablo; Blume, Alex; Becker, Jordan; Sherer, Nathan; Helms, Eric D.; Butcher, Samuel E.; Smith, Harold C.; Miller, Benjamin L.",ACS Chem Biol,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.5b00682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26496521/,285

It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19-related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes, several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19 manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations (copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues.

METHODS: Air samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly admitted patient in the room were sequenced. FINDINGS: Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID(50) units/L of air. INTERPRETATION: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.

In addition, agricultural (olive leaf) and food industry (eggshell and eggshell membrane) waste can together be valorized to produce value-added functional products. This study’s objective was to evaluate the eggshell membrane’s loading capacity for bioactive compounds obtained from olive leaf extract (OLE) in order to prepare functional biomaterial. In this study, waste eggshell membranes were used to adsorb the phenolic compounds from olive leaf extract to design functional biomaterials. Using the foam separation method, both separation of the eggshell membrane and adsorption of bioactive compounds to the eggshell membrane were achieved simultaneously. The characterization studies showed that OLE was successfully adsorbed to the eggshell membrane. Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial studies showed that prepared OLE-loaded membranes were functional materials with bioactive properties. In conclusion, ESM was determined as a promising protein in the production of functional antioxidative and antimicrobial food or dietary supplement after the adsorption of bioactive olive leaf polyphenols.","Bayraktar, Oguz; Galanakis, Charis M.; Aldawoud, Turki M.

It can be prevented through effective plaque control measures that require mechanical instrumentation with various surgical or non-surgical periodontal therapies as well as daily oral hygiene measures. Dental professionals must be competent enough to promote good oral health by educating patients with daily oral hygiene practice measures. In this regard, the study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice behaviour for using as well as prescribing dental floss among the dental interns of Nepal. METHODS: An online questionnaire consisting of two sections; the first comprised of the sociodemographic and professional aspects and the second consisted of questions related to knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the use of dental floss, and its prescription was prepared using Google forms and the link was shared. The data were analysed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software. RESULTS: In this study, the participants were familiar with the dental floss, but many lacked awareness regarding its proper use. Ninety-nine (64.3%) of the participants personally used dental floss. Only six (3.9%) never prescribed it to their patients. Among those who prescribed, only 37 (25%) always demonstrated the techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that many participants used dental floss, however, educating and recommending the patient about it was comparatively low.

A register-based study.,2021-03-24,"Picornavirus replication is critically dependent on the correct processing of a polyprotein precursor by 3C protease(s) (3C(pro)) at multiple specific sites with related but non-identical sequences. To investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity, we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non-covalent complexes of a picornavirus 3C(pro) with peptide substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro), mutated to replace the catalytic Cys by Ala and bound to a peptide (APAKQ|LLNFD) corresponding to the P5–P5′ region of the VP1-2A cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein, was determined up to 2.5 Å resolution. Comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in 3C(pro) on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the P4–P2′ positions of the peptide. Strikingly, the deep S1′ specificity pocket needed to accommodate P1′-Leu only forms when the peptide binds. Substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the P5–P4′ region of synthetic substrates. The structure of the enzyme–peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular P4, P2 and P1 residue types, as well as the relative promiscuity at P3 and on the P′ side of the scissile bond. Furthermore, crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified VP1-2A peptide (APAKE|LLNFD) containing a Gln-to-Glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro) to cleave sequences containing either P1-Gln or P1-Glu. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the S1′ specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by Asp84 of the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity. Our results provide a new level of detail in our understanding of the structural basis of polyprotein cleavage by 3C(pro).","Zunszain, Patricia A.; Knox, Stephen R.; Sweeney, Trevor R.; Yang, Jingjie; Roqué-Rosell, Núria; Belsham, Graham J.; Leatherbarrow, Robin J.; Curry, Stephen",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883658/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609012972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.10.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609012972,285

Alcohol use, especially drinking to cope with stress, is a concern, as an increase in its sales has been reported in some countries during the quarantine. This study aims to provide a better understanding of what to expect in terms of alcohol consumption, risk factors for excessive use, and its potential consequences during this pandemic based on previous experiences. We investigated how traumatic events related to alcohol consumption. Studies on mass traumatic events (i.e., terrorism as 9/11), epidemic outbreaks (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003), economic crises (such as 2008's Great Recession), and COVID-19 were selected. The main keywords used to select the studies were alcohol use, drinking patterns, alcohol use disorders, and alcohol-related consequences. Previous studies reported increases in alcohol use associated with those events mediated, at least partially, by anxiety and depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Being male, young, and single also seems to be associated with a higher vulnerability to develop risky drinking behavior after those tragic events. The discussion of previous risk and protective factors can contribute to elaborate more specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic on people's mental health, especially alcohol-related problems.","Gonçalves, Priscila Dib; Moura, Helena Ferreira; do Amaral, Ricardo Abrantes; Castaldelli-Maia, João Maurício; Malbergier, André",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.581113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391048/,285
658055,Comparison of Multimorbidity in COVID-19 infected and general population in Portugal,2020-07-03,"BACKGROUND: The world is facing an unprecedented outbreak affecting all aspects of human lives which is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the virus novelty, healthcare systems are challenged by a high rate of patients and the shortage of medical products. To address an increased need for essential medical products, national authorities, worldwide, made various legislative concessions. This has led to essential medical products being produced by automotive, textile and other companies from various industries and approved under the emergency use authorizations or legal concessions of national regulatory bodies. This paper presents a narrative commentary of the available documentation on emergency use authorizations and legal concessions for medical products during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The basis for narrative commentary includes scientific articles published in Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Embase databases, official publications of international organizations: Food and Drug Agency (FDA), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank and United Nations (UN), and national regulatory agency reports in native languages (English, German, Bosnian, and Croatian) published from November 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. This paper focuses on three types of essential medical products: mechanical ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and diagnostic tests. Evidence-informed commentary of available data and potential identified risks of emergency use authorizations and legal concessions is presented. DISCUSSION: It is recognized that now more than ever, raising global awareness and knowledge about the importance of respecting the essential requirements is needed to guarantee the appropriate quality, performance and safety of medical products, especially during outbreak situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency use authorizations for production, import and approval of medical products should be strictly specified and clearly targeted from case to case and should not be general or universal for all medical products, because all of them are associated with different risk level. CONCLUSION: Presented considerations and experiences should be taken as a guide for all possible future outbreak situations to prevent improvised reactions of national regulatory bodies.","Badnjević, Almir; Pokvić, Lejla Gurbeta; Džemić, Zijad; Bečić, Fahir",Biomed Eng Online,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008462/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-00820-0,285

We divide the regions into different risk categories and discuss anomalies. The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins. This suggests a change of strategy in order to reduce such number maybe moving the weaker population (and negative to the virus test) to beach resorts, which should be empty presently. The ratio deceased/positives on April 4, 2020 is 5.4% worldwide, 12.3% in Italy, 1.4% in Germany, 2.7% in the USA, 10.3% in the UK and 4.1% in China.

It has been assumed that the pandemic has brought with it a surge in elder abuse due to individuals ordered to stay at home combined with increased interpersonal stressors. However, empirical evidence is lacking. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of, and risk and resilience factors of elder abuse during the pandemic. METHODS: The survey was conducted via two online platforms during April 23 and May 5, 2020, when all states had stay-at-home orders. The final cohort consisted of a sociodemographically diverse sample of 897 older persons in the United States. The prevalence of elder abuse was evaluated by a validated measure previously used in a population-based study of elder abuse. Pandemic-related factors were examined at the community, relational, and individual contexts. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine determinants of elder abuse. RESULTS: One in five older persons in the study sample (n = 191; 21.3%) reported elder abuse, an increase of 83.6% from prevalence estimates before the pandemic. In the final models, sense of community emerged as a persistent protective factor for elder abuse (odds ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85–0.93). At the relational level, physical distancing was associated with reduced risk of elder abuse (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90–0.98). At the individual level, financial strain was associated with increased risk of abuse (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02–1.14). CONCLUSION: Health care professionals and policy makers must be prepared to address the increase in elder abuse associated with the evolving pandemic.","Chang, E-Shien; Levy, Becca R.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106474812100018X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S106474812100018X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518464/,285

Materials and Methods: We created 210 pools out of 245 samples, varying from 4 to 10 samples per pool, each containing a positive sample. We conducted detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp/E target sites. Results: Pooling of three samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection might be an efficient strategy to perform without losing RT-PCR sensitivity. Conclusions: Considering the positivity rate in Dominican Republic and that larger sample pools have higher probabilities of obtaining false negative results, the optimal sample size to perform a pooling strategy shall be three samples.","Ramírez, Monica Tejeda; Rosario, Camila Del; Contreras, Elisa; Cabrera, Jhasmel; Degaudenzi, Alejandro Vallejo; Ramírez, Robert Paulino",Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X2100224X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2021.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X2100224X,285
659433,Remote cardiac rehabilitation is a good alternative of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in the COVID-19 era,2020-09-05,"Hypercoagulability has emerged as a prominent consequence of COVID-19. This presents challenges not only in the clinic, but also in thrombosis research. Health and safety considerations, the status of the blood and plasma supply, the infection status of individual donors, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 activates coagulation are all of concern. In this review, we discuss these topics from the basic research perspective. As in other respiratory illnesses, blood and plasma from COVID-19 positive patients carries minimal to no risk of infection to practitioners or researchers. There are currently no special regulatory mandates directing individual donors (for research purposes), blood centers/services or vendors (for blood products for research) to test blood/plasma for SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies. We discuss current theories about how SARS-CoV-2 leads to hyper-coagulant state in severe cases of COVID-19. Our current understanding of the mechanisms behind COVID-19 associated thromboembolic events have centered around three different pathways: (1) direct activation of platelets, enhancing coagulation; (2) direct infection and indirect activation (e.g. cytokine storm) of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2, shifting endothelium from an anti-thrombotic to a pro-thrombotic state; and (3) direct activation of complement pathways, promoting thrombin generation. Further investigation on how SARS-CoV-2 affects thrombosis in COVID-19 patients may bring novel anti-thrombotic therapies to combat the disease.","Steadman, Elisabeth; Fandaros, Marina; Yin, Wei",Cell Mol Bioeng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221178/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12195-021-00685-w,285

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a two domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUb(Lys48) products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 Å crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb(Lys48) activity-based probe. SARS PLpro binds diUb(Lys48) in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUb(Lys48) chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1–S1′ preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site. Determinants revealed for polyUb(Lys48) specificity should prove useful in understanding PLpro deubiquitinating activities in coronavirus infections.","Békés, Miklós; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Ekkebus, Reggy; Ovaa, Huib; Huang, Tony T.; Lima, Christopher D.",Molecular Cell,http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276516300910/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1097276516300910; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516300910; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27203180/,285

661149,Using EM data to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: There are concerns internationally that lockdown measures taken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could lead to a rise in loneliness. As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? METHODS: This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n = 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, n = 60,341). RESULTS: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18–30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620302742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768621/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620302742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.036,285

Previous studies have found that BCG vaccination can provide extensive protection against respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS: Herein, we obtained the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of August 12, 2020, and determined the relationship between three parameters (including the BCG vaccination coverage, human development index (HDI), and transmission classifications) and the incidence rate and mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: The results showed that the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in countries with BCG vaccination recommendation were significantly lower than these in countries without BCG vaccination recommendation, and countries with lower HDI ​​have lower morbidity and mortality. In addition, we also found that the mode of virus transmission is also related to the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data supports the hypothesis that BCG vaccination is beneficial in reducing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, the data supporting this result may be inaccurate due to many confounders such as PCR testing rate, population characteristics, and protection strategies, the reliability of this result still needs to be verified by clinical trials.","Gong, Wenping; Wu, Xueqiong",Indian J Tuberc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019570720302092; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019570720302092?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099209/,285

Adult stem cells were cultured to 80% confluency in vitro and then exposed to BPA (1 and 10 µM), 17β-estradiol (E2; 10 µM), BPS (1 and 10 µM), BPAF (3 × 10(−3)–30 µM), TMBPF (0.01–50 µM), or control media alone (with 0.01% ethanol) for varying time intervals from 20 min to 5 hrs. Using several cellular assays, the levels of cell death, apoptosis, caspase-6 activation, and potencies were compared across chemical treatments and vehicle-treated controls. There was significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in rat and human stem cells treated with each BPA analog, as early as 20 min of exposure, and at low doses. With higher magnification, higher resolution imaging it was evident that in many of the BPA analog-treated cells, the Apopxin Deep Red dye indicative of apoptosis was localized to the cytoplasmic compartments of cells, while the nuclear green DCS1 dye indicative of late-stage apoptosis and necrosis was localized to the nuclei of cells. Notably, BPAF and TMBPF showed cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner (BPAF LC(50) = 0.014 µM (rASCs) and 0.009 µM (hASCs); TMBPF LC(50) = 0.88 µM (rASCs) and 0.06 µM (hASCs); lethal concentration with 50% survival). The rank order of potency was BPAF>TMBPF>BPA>BPS. The majority of cell death was due to apoptosis as indicated by high levels of activated caspase-6 in the cytoplasm of almost 100% of cells treated with the BPA analogs. This data allows for further confirmation of caspase-6-mediated apoptosis using higher magnification imaging that definitively demonstrate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of these BPA analogs.

661712,Addressing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic – A site and investigator perspective,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Recent work has highlighted the tremendous potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in advancing global oncology education, research and care. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the development of effective approaches for online education even more crucial. Here we assessed the readiness, interest and potential models for effective implementation of ICT-powered oncology education in Africa. METHODS: Building on previous work by the African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer (AORTIC), a survey was conducted to assess the electronic learning (e-Learning) readiness of oncology health professionals using an online self-assessment tool. Components of e-Learning readiness assessed include access to computers, Internet, appropriate bandwidth and interest. As a practical test model, an ICT resource-intensive radiation oncology training programme was implemented via the Global Oncology University (GO-U) collaborative education platform. An analysis of results, challenges and opportunities resulting from these is discussed for advancing online oncology education in Africa. RESULTS: The survey showed over 92% of health professionals have access to computers, laptops or other technology that can allow them to participate in online education. Over 45% of oncology health professionals have already participated in some form of online education. Interest in online education was over 93%. Models for effective online learning in oncology include synchronous and asynchronous short-term courses for continuous education and long-term degree and residency programmes. There was a significant increase in skills level following the collaborative radiation oncology training model used by the GO-U platform. CONCLUSION: Africa has the capacity to implement successful e-Learning in oncology, which is consistent with findings in previous work such as the AORTIC. Greater investment by institutions and governments is needed in terms of resources and policy changes to facilitate the implementation of effective online oncology training. Purposeful engagement of diaspora oncology health professionals with relevant cultural backgrounds as with some current collaborative efforts is highly recommended in helping turn brain drain into brain circulation.","Asana, Lydia; Irabor, Credit; Seppo, Samuel; Jean, Chrystelle; Ngoma, Twalib; Elzawawy, Ahmed; Ngwa, Wilfred",Ecancermedicalscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912236/; https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1211,285

Rural community pharmacists are well placed to provide improved ear health care to people who are unable to easily access a general practitioner (GP). The purpose of this study is to apply an ear health intervention to the rural community-pharmacy setting in Queensland, Australia, to improve the management of ear disease. The aims are the following: (1) to evaluate the feasibility, potential effectiveness and acceptability of a community pharmacy-based intervention for ear health, (2) to evaluate the use of otoscopy and tympanometry by pharmacists in managing ear complaints in community pharmacy and (3) to evaluate the extended role of rural pharmacists in managing ear complaints, with the potential to expand nationally to improve minor ailment management in rural communities. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a longitudinal pre- and post-test study of a community-pharmacy-based intervention with a single cohort of up to 200 patients from two rural community pharmacies. Usual care practices pertaining to the management of ear complaints will be recorded prior to the intervention for 8 weeks. The intervention will then be piloted for 6 weeks, followed by a 12 month impact study. Patients aged > 13 years presenting to the pharmacies with an ear complaint will be invited to participate. Trained pharmacists will conduct an examination including a brief history, hearing screening, otoscopy and tympanometry assessments. Patients will be referred to a general practitioner (GP) if required, according to the study protocol. Patients will complete a satisfaction survey and receive a follow-up phone call at 7 days to explore outcomes including prescribed medications and referrals. Pharmacists and GPs will complete pre- and post- intervention interviews. Patient, pharmacist and GP data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis for the qualitative data. DISCUSSION: This study will demonstrate the implementation of a screening and referring ear health intervention in rural community pharmacy. Feasibility, potential effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention will be assessed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry Number: ACTRN12620001297910.

662449,The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with lysosomal storage disorders in Israel,2021-09-08,"Background: Sports university students are usually expected to lead an active life and have a lower risk of depression. Therefore, there are few studies on depression and its risk factors among this population. This study aimed to investigate depression and its association with sedentary behavior and physical activity in sports university students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduates majoring in physical education in a sports university in Beijing in March 2021. Students were asked about sociodemographic information, domain-specific sedentary behavior, physical activity, and depression (using a nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Chi-squared test and logistic regression were carried out to analyze the data. Results: Among a total of 584 participants, the detection rate of depression was 49.1%. The median of total sedentary time was 7.29 h per day. After adjusting for covariates, recreational screen time (OR = 1.540, p = 0.035), sedentary time spent completing schoolwork (OR = 0.658, p = 0.038), and participation in vigorous physical activity everyday (OR = 0.415, p = 0.001) and a few times per week (OR = 0.423, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusions: Sports university students are not immune to depression and inactive lifestyles. Excessive recreational screen time may have an adverse effect on depression, which is somewhat independent of physical activity.","Zhou, Huixuan; Dai, Xiaotong; Lou, Litian; Zhou, Chan; Zhang, Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574804/,285

Aerosol deposition in lungs of different age groups based on Lagrangian particle tracking in turbulent flow,2021-03-19,"Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations. In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics.","Shlomai, A.; Leshno, A.; Sklan, E.

This may especially threaten the health of the population when a highly contagious infection strikes. This study aims to compare COVID-19-related perspectives and behaviours between hospitalised black patients who trust versus distrust doctors and healthcare systems. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study at a tertiary care academic hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Hospitalised adult black patients without a history of COVID-19 infection were surveyed between November 2020 and March 2021 using an instrument that assessed COVID-19-related matters. Analyses compared those who trusted versus mistrusted doctors and healthcare systems. RESULTS: 37 distrusting hospitalised black patients were compared with 103 black patients who trusted doctors and healthcare systems. Groups had similar sociodemographics (all p>0.05). Distrustful patients were less likely to think that they were at high risk of contracting COVID-19 (54.0% vs 75.7%; p=0.05), less likely to believe that people with underlying medical conditions were at higher risk of dying from the virus (86.4% vs 98.0%; p=0.01) and less likely to be willing to accept COVID-19 vaccination (when available) (51.3% vs 77.6%; p<0.01) compared with those who were trusting. CONCLUSION: Healthcare distrustful hospitalised black patients were doubtful of COVID-19 risk and hesitant about vaccination. Hospitalisations are concentrated exposures to the people and processes within healthcare systems; at these times, seizing the opportunity to establish meaningful relationships with patients may serve to gain their trust.","Nguyen, Thang Cong; Gathecha, Evelyn; Kauffman, Regina; Wright, Scott; Harris, Ché Matthew",Postgrad Med J,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-140824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34588293/,285

The recent increase in H7N9 infections during the fifth outbreak in China has caused concerns of a possible pandemic. In this study, we describe a previously characterized human monoclonal antibody, HNIgGA6, obtained by isolating rearranged heavy-chain and light-chain genes from patients who had recovered from H7N9 infections. HNIgGA6 recognized multiple HAs and neutralized the infectivity of 11 out of the 12 H7N9 strains tested, as well as three emerging HPAI H7N9 isolates. The only resistant strain was A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9-SH1), which carries the avian receptor alleles 186V and 226Q in the sialic acid-binding pocket. The mAb broadly neutralized divergent H7N9 strains from 2013 to 2017 and represents a potential alternative treatment for H7N9 interventions.","Chen, Cong; Liu, Zuliang; Liu, Liguo; Xiao, Yan; Wang, Jianmin; Jin, Qi",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425238/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0182-2,285

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 μM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 μM) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.","Pruijssers, Andrea J.; George, Amelia S.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Leist, Sarah R.; Gralinksi, Lisa E.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Yount, Boyd L.; Agostini, Maria L.; Stevens, Laura J.; Chappell, James D.; Lu, Xiaotao; Hughes, Tia M.; Gully, Kendra; Martinez, David R.; Brown, Ariane J.; Graham, Rachel L.; Perry, Jason K.; Du Pont, Venice; Pitts, Jared; Ma, Bin; Babusis, Darius; Murakami, Eisuke; Feng, Joy Y.; Bilello, John P.; Porter, Danielle P.; Cihlar, Tomas; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.; Sheahan, Timothy P.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511392/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.064279,285

663859,Cerebrovascular Accident Manifesting as Altered Mental Status During a Telehealth Visit: Preoperative Evaluation in the COVID-19 Era,2021-03-10,"Differences in pancreatic anatomy, size, and function exist in men and women. The anatomical differences could contribute to the increase in complications associated with pancreatic surgery in women. Although diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis are the same in men and women, major sex differences in etiology are reported. Alcohol and tobacco predominate in men, whereas idiopathic and obstructive etiologies predominate in women. Circulating levels of estrogens, progesterone, and androgens contribute significantly to overall health outcomes; premenopausal women have lower prevalence of cardiovascular and pancreatic diseases suggesting protective effects of estrogens, whereas androgens promote growth of normal and cancerous cells. Sex chromosomes and gonadal and nongonadal hormones together determine an individual’s sex, which is distinct from gender or gender identity. Human pancreatic disease etiology, outcomes, and sex-specific mechanisms are largely unknown. In rodents of both sexes, glucocorticoids and estrogens from the adrenal glands influence pancreatic secretion and acinar cell zymogen granule numbers. Lack of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 function, a G protein–coupled receptor whose expression is regulated by both estrogens and glucocorticoids, causes sex-specific changes in pancreatic histopathology, zymogen granule numbers, and endoplasmic reticulum ultrastructure changes in acute pancreatitis model. Here, we review existing literature on sex differences in the normal exocrine pancreas and mechanisms that operate at homeostasis and diseased states in both sexes. Finally, we review pregnancy-related pancreatic diseases and discuss the effects of sex differences on proposed treatments in pancreatic disease.","Wang, Melinda; Gorelick, Fred; Bhargava, Aditi",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895424/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.04.005,285
664054,Inspired by COVID-19 isolation: Evolving educational techniques in dermatology residency programs,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19. METHODS: We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses. RESULTS: The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe. This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J.; Hoogeveen, Ellen K.",One Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100277; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771421000677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124333/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000677?v=s5,285

This study utilizes big data techniques to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the user behaviors and environmental benefits of bike sharing. In this study, a novel method is proposed to calculate the trip distances and trajectories via a python package OSMnx so as to accurately estimate the environmental benefits of bike sharing. In addition, we employ the topological indices arising from complex network theory to quantitatively analyze the transformation of user behavior pattern of bike sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that this pandemic has impacted the user behaviors and environmental benefits of bike sharing in Beijing significantly. During the pandemic, the estimated reductions of energy consumption and emissions on 6(th) Feb decreased to approximately 1 in 17 of those on a normal day, and the environmental benefits at most recovered to 70% of those in normal days. The impacts of COVID-19 on the environmental benefits in different districts are different. Furthermore, the decline of average strength and strength distribution obeying exponential distribution but with different slope rates suggests that people are less likely to take bike sharing to the places where were popular before. The pandemic has also increased the average trip time of bike sharing.

COVID-19 is spread through aerosol making the emergent tracheostomy a high-risk procedure for surgeons. The surgical establishment of the air conduit in emergency scenarios must be adjusted for safety reasons. METHODS: To establish the Slovenian National Guidelines for airway management in cannot intubate—cannot ventilate situations in COVID-19 positive patients. RESULTS: Good communication and coordination between surgeon and anaesthesiologist is absolutely necessary. Deep general anaesthesia, full muscle relaxation and adequate preoxygenation without intubation are initial steps. The surgical cricothyrotomy is performed quickly, the thin orotracheal tube is inserted, the cuff is inflated and ventilation begins. Following patient stabilisation, the conversion to the tracheostomy is undertaken with the following features: skin infiltration with vasoconstrictor, a vertical incision, avoidance of electrical devices in favour of classical manners of haemostasis, the advancement of the tube towards the carina, performing the tracheal window in complete apnoea following adequate oxygenation, the insertion of non-fenestrated canulla attached to a heat and moisture exchanger, the fixation of canulla with stitches and tapes, and the cricothyrotomy entrance closure. Appropriate safety equipment is equally important. CONCLUSION: The goal of the guidelines is to make the procedure safer for medical teams, without harming the patients. Further improvements of the guidelines will surely appear as COVID-19 is a new entity and there is not yet much experience in handling it.","Šifrer, Robert; Urbančič, Jure; Piazza, Cesare; van Weert, Stijn; García-Purriños, Francisco; Benedik, Janez; Tancer, Ivana; Aničin, Aleksandar",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06318-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889621/,285

Here, we speculate that the robust disease resistance of most individuals is due to a swift production of type I interferon (IFNα/β), presumably sufficient to lower the viremia. A minority of infected individuals with a preexisting chronic inflammatory state fail to mount this early efficient response, leading to a delayed harmful inflammatory response. To improve the epidemiological scenario, we propose combining: i) the development of efficient antivirals administered early enough to assist in the production of endogenous IFNα/β; ii) potentiating early IFN responses; iii) administering anti-inflammatory treatments when needed, but not too early to interfere with endogenous antiviral responses.","Feuillet, Vincent; Canard, Bruno; Trautmann, Alain",Trends Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471490620302611; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471490620302611?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281063/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.11.003,285

Major barriers to help-seeking behaviors are the refusal to seek treatment due to fear of incurring negative views from supervising faculty, time constraints, and the cost of counseling services. Those who do use telemental health resources have positive views and believe that it is an effective tool.

Considering effective doctor-patient communication is important for good health outcomes. This study helps to determine the level of acceptance of telemedicine in general public and factors associated with it. Methods: This survey with cross-sectional analysis comprised a brief survey with 15 questions. The survey was distributed in public places to determine the opinions of the general public. Results Randomly selected 125 participants completed the questionnaire. Synchronous telemedicine was favored by young people (82% in the 18-34 age group vs 37.5% of participants aged >55 years; p<0.01), those with a higher education level (46.7% of non-college-educated persons vs 80.6% of college-educated persons; p<0.01), and frequent computer users (67% who used a computer for less than two hours a month vs 86.5% of those who used a computer more than hours a month; p=0.03). Asynchronous communication, like sending health information to doctors via a safe portal was acknowledged mostly by people who had used patient portals in the past (84.1% vs 65.4%; p=0.02). Use of patient portals was less among older users and senior citizens (20.8% use in the age group >55 vs. 51.3% in the age group 35-53 years vs. 71% in age group 18-34 years). Receiving video education for specific health concerns was favored by those who used a computer frequently (94.6% who used a computer more than two hours a month vs 77% who used a computer less than two hours a month; p =0.02). Conclusion Telemedicine is generally favored, but physicians should be mindful about older people as they may not feel comfortable. Step by step guidance should be provided especially to senior citizens for telemedicine and portal use.","Akbar, Aelia; Iqbal, Aqsa; Gaziano, Dominic; Gasior, Filip; Zaidi, Ayesha J; Iqbal, Anum; Silva, Abigail",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953359/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10402,285

We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. METHODS: Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. RESULTS: The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus is a novel reassortant derived from A/Guangdong/1/2013 virus.

Methods The study employed a longitudinal design. Participants were recruited for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. Descriptive statistics and the CATMOD program were used for data analysis. Findings Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 for the final survey. There were 5 waves of interviews. The prevalence of participants perceiving a personal risk of contracting COVID-19, and severe consequences of the disease, was 18.6% and 25.5%, respectively. Their prevalence had declined to 4.9% and 17.6%, respectively, by the last observation point. The 5 selected EPBs also manifested a decreasing trend. Belief in COVID-19 prevention myths trended upwards. Perceived risk was positively associated with each EPB, and perceived severity with disinfection of clothes and hoarding of products. Myth adherence was positively associated with disinfection of clothes and both hand washing and sanitization. Conclusion This study yielded new information about EPB among the public during the COVID-19 epidemic.

This study is particularly interested in analyzing the role of attitudes, descriptive norms, protective behaviors toward COVID-19, travel frequency before the pandemic, and spatial and individual characteristics on activity-travel behavior changes in relation to information and communication technology (ICT) use. Data were obtained from 1062 respondents using a web-based questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the complex relationships among variables. This study found that descriptive norms positively affected the frequency of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teleworking and e-learning and attitudes toward COVID-19 directly affected activity-travel behavior changes. On the contrary, teleshopping did not contribute to reducing out-of-home activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experience of ICT influenced a decline in travel frequency and ride-hailing use. Furthermore, although personal attributes insignificantly influenced activity-travel behavior change, these attributes directly affected ICT use. Meanwhile, people living outside of Java Island had a higher travel frequency during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic than their counterparts. Based on our findings, this study recommends that the very initial step in an emergency caused by a disaster be to massively socialize or educate people about the risk of the pandemic and to continue with a policy to minimize travel by encouraging teleworking and e-learning.

Children experience largely asymptomatic disease, with rare reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Identifying immune mechanisms that result in these disparate clinical phenotypes in children could provide critical insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Using systems serology, in this study we observed in 25 children with acute mild COVID-19 a functional phagocyte and complement-activating IgG response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the acute responses generated in adults with mild disease. Conversely, IgA and neutrophil responses were significantly expanded in adults with severe disease. Moreover, weeks after the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children who develop MIS-C maintained highly inflammatory monocyte-activating SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, distinguishable from acute disease in children but with antibody levels similar to those in convalescent adults. Collectively, these data provide unique insights into the potential mechanisms of IgG and IgA that might underlie differential disease severity as well as unexpected complications in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Bartsch, Yannic C; Wang, Chuangqi; Zohar, Tomer; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Burke, John S; Kang, Jaewon; Edlow, Andrea G; Fasano, Alessio; Baden, Lindsey R; Nilles, Eric J; Woolley, Ann E; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Hopke, Alex R; Irimia, Daniel; Fischer, Eric S; Ryan, Edward T; Charles, Richelle C; Julg, Boris D; Lauffenburger, Douglas A; Yonker, Lael M; Alter, Galit",Nat Med,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01263-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33589825/,285
666844,Delphi consensus recommendations on how to provide cardiovascular rehabilitation in the COVID-19 era,2020-11-05,"OBJECTIVES: Older adults living with cancer have been described as more susceptible to COVID-19 and in need of special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. For cancer survivors, the first-year post-treatment is a critical time as many individuals transition back to their primary care provider and adjust to physical/psychosocial changes which occurred during their cancer treatment. In this longitudinal qualitative study, we followed a cohort of older adult cancer survivors through the first three waves of the pandemic to describe their experiences as a means for providing recommendations for how oncology nurses can tailor supports to this unique population. DATA SOURCES: We conducted individual, semi-structured qualitative interviews with 24 older adults at three time points during the pandemic. Data were analyzed drawing from interpretive descriptive methodologies. CONCLUSION: Older adult cancer survivors’ needs shifted during the pandemic from feeling confident and self-assured during the early days of COVID-19, to growing uncertainty and unease about their health and wellbeing. The main survivorship concerns included a preference for in-person appointments (as opposed to virtual), barriers to caregiver attendance at appointments, and diminished access to healthcare services. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses play a critical role providing care to older adult cancer survivors and are most familiar with unique patient needs and the gaps in services they face. We provide recommendations for oncology nursing practice which consider the shifting needs of older adult cancer survivors during COVID-19 and beyond.","Kilgour, Heather M.; Galica, Jacqueline; Oliffe, John L.; Haase, Kristen R.",Semin Oncol Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749208121001443?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749208121001443,285
666916,"Negative Pressure Assisted Micro-Environment Surgical Hood (NEPA-MESH): A novel cost-effective device to minimize aerosol contamination during neurosurgical procedures, in times of COVID-19",2021-03-19,"Background: The recent outbreak of COVID19 has raised concerns in the rheumatology community about the management of immunosuppressive patients diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. It is not clear whether the use of biologic agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARSCoV2 infection however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID19 occur as result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of IL6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID19 disease and more recently JAK1/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARSCoV2. Objectives: To estimate COVID19 infection rate in patients treated with biologic agents for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, determine the influence of biologic agents treatment as a risk or protective factor and studying the prognosis of rheumatic patients receiving biologic agents compared to general population in a third level Hospital setting in Leon, Spain. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at Rheumatology department who received biological therapy for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and June 1st 2020 and analysed COVID19 infection rate. All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biologic agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biologic agent and need for hospitalization. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. Results: There was a total of 3711 patients with COVID19 requiring hospitalization. 30 patients out of a total of 820 patients (3.6%) receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID19 and four required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 2.75%, and it was 0.48% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. A total of 423 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biologic agents. Patients who tested positive for COVID19 were older (female: median age 61.8 IQR 46.5 to 75; male: median age 68 IQR 48.5 to 72) than those who were negative for COVID19 (female: median age 58.4 IQR 48 to 69; male: median age 55.9 IQR 46 to 66) and more likely to have cardiovascular disease (27 % vs 10%, OR 3. 41 (CI 1.47 to 7.94), p 0.004), be active smokers (13% vs 5%, OR 3.14 (CI 1.04 to 9.47), p 0.04) and receiving treatment with IL-12/23 inhibitors (6.7% vs 1.4%, OR 5.06 (CI 1.07 to 23.91) and rituximab (13% vs 2%, 2.66 (CI 1.03 to 7.27), p 0.04) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL6 inhibitors (0% vs 14%, CI (0.006 to 0.97, p <0.05). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bsDMARD proportions. IL1 inhibitors, IL6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID19 among adult rheumatic patients. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID19 and patients who tested negative were found. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of biological therapy does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID19, and it is likely to have a protective effect against them when compared to the general population.","Santos, Cristiana Sieiro; Fernandez, Xenia Casas; Morales, Clara Moriano; Diez, Elvira Alvarez; Castro, Carolina Alvarez; Robles, Alejandra Lopez; Sandoval, Trinidad Perez",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20184333; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.01.20184333v1?rss=1,285

Multiple transport pathways including bulk autophagy (microautophagy and macroautophagy) and chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA) have been identified to efficiently facilitate this transit of macromolecules from the cytoplasm to acidic vacuolar organelles. While autophagy plays a role in the general housekeeping of cells, it also functions in more specialized processes such as development and differentiation, responses to physiological stress and immunity. The presentation of both exogenous and endogenous antigens (Ag) by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules to CD4(+) T lymphocytes is critical for the induction of tolerance to self Ag as well as the development of immunity against intracellular pathogens and tumors. Here, we discuss the class II‐mediated presentation of several endogenous Ag, dependent on either macroautophagy or CMA for their transport from the cytosol to endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Thus, the various pathways of autophagy as routes of cytoplasmic Ag delivery to lysosomes have significant implications for the MHC class II‐mediated immune response to intracellular pathogens and cancer.","Crotzer, Victoria L.; Blum, Janice S.",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916226/,285

Clinicopathological abnormalities included nonregenerative anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, increased globulin concentration, and mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities. Abdominal fluid was viscous and had a total protein of 5.3 g dL(−1) with 316 cells µL(−1), consistent with a modified transudate. Cytology of the abdominal fluid revealed 86% nondegenerate neutrophils, 13% macrophages, and 1% small lymphocytes.

This review focused on testing in the United States as this testing is evolving whereas in China and other countries such as South Korea testing is widely available and includes both molecular testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 as well as serological testing using both ELISA methodology and lateral flow immunoassay methodology. Although commercial testing systems are becoming available, there will likely be insufficient numbers of such tests due to high demand.

A successful viral infection requires fusion between virus and host cells carried out by the surface spike glycoprotein or S protein of CoV. Current models propose that the S2 subunit of S protein assembled into a hexameric helical bundle exposing hydrophobic fusogenic peptides or fusion peptides (FPs) for membrane insertion. The N-terminus of S2 subunit of SARS-CoV reported to be active in cell fusion whereby FPs have been identified. Atomic-resolution structure of FPs derived either in model membranes or in membrane mimic environment would glean insights toward viral cell fusion mechanism. Here, we have solved 3D structure, dynamics and micelle localization of a 64-residue long fusion peptide or LFP in DPC detergent micelles by NMR methods. Micelle bound structure of LFP is elucidated by the presence of discretely folded helical and intervening loops. The C-terminus region, residues F42-Y62, displays a long hydrophobic helix, whereas the N-terminus is defined by a short amphipathic helix, residues R4-Q12. The intervening residues of LFP assume stretches of loops and helical turns. The N-terminal helix is sustained by close aromatic and aliphatic sidechain packing interactions at the non-polar face. (15)N{(1)H}NOE studies indicated dynamical motion, at ps-ns timescale, of the helices of LFP in DPC micelles. PRE NMR showed that insertion of several regions of LFP into DPC micelle core.

Data were extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository regarding the polio immunization coverage estimates and correlated to the overall morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 among different countries. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.0.2. Mean and standard deviation were used to represent continuous variables while we used frequencies and percentages to represent categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for continuous variables since they were not normally distributed. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine the relationship between different variables. There was a significantly positive correlation between the vaccine coverage (%) and both of total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.37; p-value < 0.001) and deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.30; p-value < 0.001).

671916,Delayed Comprehensive Stroke Unit Care Attributable to the Evolution of Infection Protection Measures across Two Consecutive Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-07-19,"Summary Paragraph We identify the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) inhibitor halofuginone1, a compound in clinical trials for anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory applications2, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) promotes viral entry3. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry and is 1,000-fold more potent than Remdesivir4. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on specific inhibition of PRS, possibly due to translational suppression of proline-rich proteins. We find that pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are proline-rich, which may make them particularly vulnerable to halofuginone’s translational suppression. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable, has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in humans and distributes to SARS-CoV-2 target organs, including the lung, making it a near-term clinical trial candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sandoval, Daniel R.; Clausen, Thomas Mandel; Nora, Chelsea; Cribbs, Adam P.; Denardo, Andrea; Clark, Alex E.; Garretson, Aaron F.; Coker, Joanna K.C.; Narayanan, Anoop; Majowicz, Sydney A.; Philpott, Martin; Johansson, Catrine; Dunford, James E.; Spliid, Charlotte B.; Golden, Gregory J.; Payne, N.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rapidly spread to cause the worst pandemic since 1918. Recent clinical reports highlight an atypical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients characterized by severe hypoxemia, an imbalance of the renin–angiotensin system, an increase in thrombogenic processes, and a cytokine release storm. These processes not only exacerbate lung injury but can also promote pulmonary vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction, which are hallmarks of pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is a complication of ARDS that has received little attention; thus, we hypothesize that PH in COVID-19-induced ARDS represents an important target for disease amelioration. The mechanisms that can promote PH following SARS-CoV-2 infection are described. In this review article, we outline emerging mechanisms of pulmonary vascular dysfunction and outline potential treatment options that have been clinically tested.","Karmouty-Quintana, Harry; Thandavarayan, Rajarajan A.; Keller, Steven P.; Sahay, Sandeep; Pandit, Lavannya M.; Akkanti, Bindu",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138181/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218081,285

Usually, large numbers of camels and other domestic animals from many different herds/flocks congregate at watering sites, and this may create a perfect condition for disease transmission and spread among animals. The same water sources are also shared by multitudes of wild animals. Camel herd sizes per household range from few heads (five to ten) to several hundreds. Female camels account for more than 75% of the herd. Male camels are usually sold early as pack animals or for slaughter. Female camels may remain fertile up to 25 years, during which time they produce eight to ten calves. Camels are herded during daytime on communal rangelands. During night, they are kept in traditional kraals around homesteads. Breeding time is short and seasonal and is affected by rainfall patterns and feed availability. Usually, only men milk camels. Milking frequency ranges from two to five times per day. Washing of hands, milking vessels, the udder and teats is not practised by many prior to milking the camels. Besides, the milking area is generally full of dust and dung and without shade. This affects the quality and safety of the produced milk. Pathogens and diseases of camelids are less well known; however, they are suspected as zoonotic sources for the human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. There is an increasing need to determine whether camels are clinically susceptible, act as potential reservoirs and maintenance or bridge hosts, to viral pathogens.","Mirkena, Tadele; Walelign, Elias; Tewolde, Nega; Gari, Getachew; Abebe, Getachew; Newman, Scott",Pastoralism,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13570-018-0135-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226597/,285

PARTICIPANTS: All adult participants over the age of 18 years were eligible for enrolment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was incident SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed via PCR or antigen testing. RESULTS: 28 575 unique participants contributed 2 479 149 participant-days of data across 99 different countries. Of these participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of enrolment, 112 developed an incident infection. Pooled logistic regression models showed that increased age was associated with lower risk (OR 0.98 per year, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.00, p=0.019), whereas increased number of non-household contacts (OR 1.10 per 10 contacts, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20, p=0.024), attending events of at least 10 people (OR 1.26 per 10 events, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50, p=0.007) and restaurant visits (OR 1.95 per 10 visits, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.68, p<0.001) were associated with significantly higher risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified three modifiable health behaviours, namely the number of non-household contacts, attending large gatherings and restaurant visits, which may meaningfully influence individual-level risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.","Lin, Anthony; Vittinghoff, Eric; Olgin, Jeffrey; Peyser, Noah; Aung, Sidney; Joyce, Sean; Yang, Vivian; Hwang, Janet; Avram, Robert; Nah, Gregory; Tison, Geoffrey H; Beatty, Alexis; Runge, Ryan; Wen, David; Butcher, Xochitl; Horner, Cathy; Eitel, Helena; Pletcher, Mark; Marcus, Gregory M",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548363/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052025,285

One of the potential treatments in newly found infectious disease is plasma exchange (PE) with convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT). This case series aimed to evaluate the primary PE and CPT in five Iranian COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Five patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had acute respiratory distress syndrome and were supported by mechanical ventilation were treated with two consecutive PE containing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) of healthy donors and 0.9 % saline solution containing 5 % human albumin. Thereafter, CPT was performed just like PE, except that the FFP in this step was substituted with convalescent ABO-matched plasma. Clinical and laboratory factors were evaluated before and after treatments. RESULTS: Three to Four patients showed lower body temperature and improved oxygen saturation as well as reduced laboratory factors such as c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase (total and myocardial isoform), aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, bilirubin (total and direct), D-dimer, interleukin-6, and CD4+/CD8 + T cells ratio initially after PE and continued to improve so that they were discharged. One patient due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and extensive lung fungal infection was expired. DISCUSSION: Overall, the PE followed by CPT was beneficial in reducing acute inflammation led to a considerable improvement in patients’ clinical features. It seems that PE along with CPT could provide clearance of pro-inflammatory mediators as well as the positive effects of CPT. Controlled studies are required to confirm the effect of PE/CPT compared with other therapeutic approaches.","Roshandel, Elham; Sankanian, Ghazaleh; Salimi, Maryam; Jalili, Arsalan; Salari, Sina; Sadeghi, Amir; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammadreza; Moshari, Mohammad Reza; Pirsalehi, Ali; Hajifathali, Abbas",Transfus Apher Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050221001075; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2021.103141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050221001075?v=s5,285

In preclinical studies, activated protein C (APC) provides negative feedback downregulation of excessive inflammation and thrombin generation, attenuates damage caused by ischemia‐reperfusion in many organs including lungs, and reduces death caused by bacterial pneumonia. APC exerts both anticoagulant activities and direct cell‐signaling activities. Preclinical studies show that its direct cell‐signaling actions mediate anti‐inflammatory and anti‐apoptotic actions, mortality reduction for pneumonia, and beneficial actions for ischemia‐reperfusion injury. The APC mutant 3K3A‐APC, which was engineered to have diminished anticoagulant activity while retaining cell‐signaling actions, was safe in phase 1 and phase 2 human trials. Because of its broad spectrum of homeostatic effects in preclinical studies, we speculate that 3K3A‐APC merits consideration for clinical trial studies in appropriately chosen, seriously ill patients with COVID‐19.","Griffin, John H.; Lyden, Patrick",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32548551/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12362,285

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An expert panel consisting of 15 members was assembled. A literature review was undertaken prior to the study and evidence was summarised for the panellists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The panel undertook a process of ranking and classifying appropriateness of different investigations and treatment options for new onset loss of sense of smell during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Using a 9‐point Likert scale, panellists scored whether a treatment was: Not recommended, optional, or recommended. Consensus was achieved when more than 70% of responses fell into the category defined by the mean. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on the majority of statements after 2 rounds of ranking. Disagreement meant no recommendation was made regarding one treatment, using Vitamin A Drops. Alpha lipoic acid was not recommended, olfactory training was recommended for all patients with persistent loss of sense of smell of more than 2 weeks duration, and oral steroids, steroid rinses and omega 3 supplements may be considered on an individual basis.

This study aims to examine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, sleep problems, and psychological distress among COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers in Taiwan. Hence, a total of 500 frontline healthcare workers were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study. They responded to measures on fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, PTSD, perceived stigma, and self-stigma. The results indicated a prevalence rate of 15.4% for PTSD symptoms, 44.6% for insomnia, 25.6% for depressive symptoms, 30.6% for anxiety symptoms, and 23.4% for stress among the participants. There were significantly positive interrelationships between all these variables. Anxiety symptoms and fear of COVID-19 predicted PTSD whereas symptoms of anxiety, fear of COVID-19, and stress predicted insomnia. The prevalence rates of the psychological problems reveal a worrying view of mental health challenges among Taiwanese frontline healthcare workers. Anxiety symptoms and fear of COVID-19 are the common predictive factors of PTSD and sleep problems suggesting that mental healthcare services for them may help prevent future occurrence of psychological problems by allaying fears of healthcare workers. Therefore, there should be mental healthcare services for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lu, Mei-Yun; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Kukreti, Shikha; Strong, Carol; Lin, Yi-Hsuan; Kuo, Yi-Jie; Chen, Yu-Pin; Lin, Chung-Ying; Chen, Po-Lin; Ko, Nai-Ying; Ko, Wen-Chien",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322044/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.705657,285

A potential clinical use requires well-defined systems and for several applications, a long circulation time is desirable. Therefore, we aimed the development of long circulating liposomes with intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity. Hence, PS- and PG-enriched liposomes were produced, whilst phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes served as control. Liposomes were either formulated as conventional or PEGylated formulations. They had diameters below 150 nm, narrow size distributions and composition-dependent surface charges. Pharmacokinetics were assessed non-invasively via in vivo fluorescence imaging (FI) and ex vivo in excised organs over 2 days. PC liposomes, conventionally formulated, were rapidly cleared from the circulation, while PEGylation resulted in prolongation of liposome circulation robustly distributing among most organs. In contrast, PS and PG liposomes, both as conventional or PEGylated formulations, were rapidly cleared. Non-PEGylated PS and PG liposomes did accumulate almost exclusively in the liver. In contrast, PEGylated PS and PG liposomes were observed mainly in liver and spleen. In summary, PEGylation of PS and PG liposomes was not effective to prolong the circulation time but caused a higher uptake in the spleen.","Klein, Miriam E.; Rieckmann, Max; Sedding, Daniel; Hause, Gerd; Meister, Annette; Mäder, Karsten; Lucas, Henrike",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669803/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13020282,285

We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus to estimate the magnitude reduction in transmission due to weather-related disruptions. Changes in contact rates and care-seeking were informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital visits. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16 to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3 to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in an early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak. For SARS-CoV-2, this suggests that, even when SARS-CoV-2 spread is out of control, implementing short-term disruptions can prevent COVID-19 deaths.

DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval –10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19.

Although adolescents express the desire and ability to share their values, beliefs and preferences for treatment, there is a lack of structured multicomponent interventions to improve parent-adolescent communication on different ACP themes including those not limited to end-of-life care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation, context and mechanisms of impact of a novel ACP program in paediatric oncology. METHODS: We will conduct a multi-centre parallel-group randomised controlled superiority trial with embedded mixed-methods process evaluation in Flanders, Belgium. Adolescents aged 10–18 who have cancer, and their parent(s) will be recruited via all four university hospitals in Flanders, Belgium, and support groups. Families will be randomised to receive care as usual or the multicomponent BOOST pACP program, consisting of three conversation sessions between an external facilitator and the adolescent and parent(s). The primary endpoint is improved parent-adolescent communication from the perspective of the adolescent. Secondary endpoints are adolescents’ and parents’ attitudes, self-efficacy, intention and behaviour regarding talking about ACP themes with each other, parents’ perspective of shared decision making in the last clinical encounter, and the paediatric oncologist’s intention and behaviour regarding talking about ACP themes with the family. Measurements will be performed at baseline, at 3 months and at 7 months using structured self-reported questionnaires. We will perform a process evaluation in the intervention group, with measurement throughout and post-intervention, using structured diaries filled out by the facilitators, interviews with facilitators, interviews with involved paediatric oncology teams, and audio-recordings of the BOOST pACP conversations. DISCUSSION: The BOOST pACP program has been developed to stimulate conversations on ACP themes between parent(s) and the adolescents, simultaneously lowering the threshold to discuss similar themes with healthcare professionals, initiating a process of normalization and integration of ACP in standard care. This combined outcome and process evaluation aims to contribute to building the necessary evidence to improve ACP in paediatric oncology.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) shows diverse endotypes and is aggravated by viral infection. Whether viral stimulation and CRS endotype influence ACE2 expression remains unclear. We investigated the expression of ACE2 and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and assessed polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C])-induced changes based on CRS endotype. METHODOLOGY: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was evaluated based on CRS phenotype, endotype, and tissue type. Correlations between ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and inflammatory mediators in nasal polyps (NP) were examined. Air-liquid interface culture experiments were performed to assess the effects of major cytokines or poly(I:C) stimulation on ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in primary epithelial cells from healthy nasal mucosa, eosinophilic NP (ENP), and non-eosinophilic NP (NENP). RESULTS: In primary nasal epithelial cells, interleukin (IL)-13 decreased ACE2 expression but increased TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic CRS showed lower ACE2 expression than non-eosinophilic CRS, regardless of CRS phenotype. CRS endotype was an independent factor associated with ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in NP. Serum and tissue eosinophilic marker levels were inversely correlated with ACE2 expression, whereas tissue neutrophilic marker levels and ACE2 expression were positively correlated in NP. ACE2 expression was suppressed in ENP tissues; however, a combination of poly(I:C) and IL-13 induced ACE2/TMPRSS2 upregulation in ENP. CONCLUSIONS: ENP tissues have lower ACE2 expression than NENP; however, viral stimulation promotes ACE2/TMPRSS2 upregulation in ENP.","Hong, S-N; Kim, J K; Kim, J-A; Cha, H; Kim, J Y; Lim, H-S; Eun, K M; Kim, D W",Rhinology (Leiden),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282808/; https://doi.org/10.4193/rhin21.001,285

Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by 19 bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions, and back to the Tropics again. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia, and later return to areas of Southeastern Asia, in a manner similar to that of influenza strains (H3N2). Our approach may therefore be of value for the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an optimistic scenario of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks, like other viral respiratory diseases.

The risk outweighs the benefits in these unprecedented times if proper screening and inactivation of blood products are not performed. Pathogen reduction technologies incorporate various modalities for the inactivation of blood products mainly related to blood transfusion. Oral surgical procedures and periodontal surgeries use platelet-rich fibrin for various regenerative procedures that amplify the prognosis positively. The use of blood products for various treatments could result in contamination, a factor which should be significant attention. The objective of this study was to review the role of pathogen reduction technology in inactivating pathogens in blood products and its use in oral and periodontal surgical procedures.

681035,Health Protection of CT Radiographers During the Outbreak of COVID-19: Application of Automatic Positioning Technology for Relocatable CT in the Fang Cang Hospital,2021-06-04,"Acute viral pneumonia is an important cause of acute lung injury (ALI), although not enough is known about the exact incidence of viral infection in ALI. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury. Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined. The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury. The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway. The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI. There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful. Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage.","Hendrickson, Carolyn M.; Matthay, Michael A.",Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4045622?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1351122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934716/,285
681687,"A Snapshot of Elective Oncological Surgery in Italy During COVID-19 Emergency: Pearls, Pitfalls, and Perspectives",2020-05-21,"Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims. COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued.","Ebrahim, Shahul H.; Memish, Ziad A.",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165283/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101617; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920300855; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920300855,285

Public engagement with this public health tool has been low, limiting the effectiveness of the intervention. This study examines physician knowledge of the app and practice patterns in relation to the app. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional self-administered online English language survey of physicians and medical students in Alberta, Canada. The survey link was sent to all registered members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and was distributed by other provincial physician organizations and health zone leaders. RESULTS: The survey received 317 responses. 96% of participants were aware of the app but only 27% had recommended the app to patients. The most common reason provided for not downloading or recommending the app was that participants had security concerns about the app. 23% of participants indicated they did not believe they had a responsibility to recommend the app to others. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insights into participants’ knowledge and beliefs about the ABTraceTogether app. This information may be valuable to public health officials who wish to engage physicians in future public health campaigns.","Jerome, D; Pietrosanu, M; Dhillon, K",J Public Health (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140080/,285

Organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been previously isolated. We present a case of a COVID-19 patient treated with baricitinib and dexamethasone who later developed Klebsiella pneumoniae-carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Candida dubliniensis bloodstream infections, treated with meropenem/vaborbactam and micafungin, respectively. These infections are exceedingly rare and are mostly reported in immunosuppressed patients. The finding of these bloodstream infections raises concerns on the cause of immunosuppression in this patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated with baricitinib and dexamethasone.

Among them is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged as a deadly pandemic, calling for intense research efforts on its pathogenicity mechanism and development of therapeutic strategies. In the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm, systemic inflammation has been associated with severe illness and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated special pro-resolving lipids mediators (SPMs) lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins as potential therapeutic options for abnormal viral-triggered inflammation. Pro-resolving lipids mediators have shown great promise for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus. Based on this, studies are being conducted on their therapeutic effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we discussed SPMs and reviewed evidence from recent studies on SPMs as therapeutic options for viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Based on our analysis of the previous study, we argue that SPMs are a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral infections. We expect further research on how SPMs modulate viral-triggered inflammation through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and chemical stability and druggability of SPMs.","Lee, Chang Hoon",Arch Pharm Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12272-020-01299-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398691/,285

DATA SOURCES: We did a comprehensive literature review with the keywords “zika” and/or “microcephaly” from inception to May 27, 2016, with PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included and analyzed if they met all of the following criteria: “probable or confirmed infant microcephaly” and “probable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants”. RESULTS: We emphasize the diagnosis of ZIKV infection, including maternal clinical manifestations, maternal and fetal laboratory confirmation, and possible autopsy if need. Other confounders that may lead to microcephaly should be excluded from the study. We presented the results from clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection, testing methods evolving but the mechanism of microcephaly uncertain, flexible definition challenging the diagnosis of microcephaly, and limited causal reference on pregnant women. We made analog comparison of severe acute respiratory syndrome and chikungunya virus in terms of DNA mutation and global movement to provide further research recommendation. The chance of catch-up growth may decrease the number of pervious “diagnosed” microcephaly.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study in Korean military hospitals was conducted between January 2012 and December 2018. Patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia with risk factors for respiratory failure were included and divided into early (within 7 days from symptom onset) and delayed (after 7 days from symptom onset) treatment groups. The primary outcome was respiratory failure development within 21 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia were enrolled in the cohort; they included 62 early and 27 delayed treatment patients. All patients were males in their early 20s. Significantly fewer patients in the early treatment group progressed to respiratory failure (8/62, 12.9%), compared to the delayed group (18/27, 66.7%, p < 0.001). Early treatment was associated with a lower 21-day probability of respiratory failure by the Kaplan–Meier method (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, monocyte count, hypoxaemia, confusion, whole lung involvement, and early cidofovir treatment within 7 days from symptom onset were included, and monocyte count (HR 0.995, 95%CI 0.991–1.000, p 0.042), confusion (HR 4.964, 95%CI 1.189–20.721, p = 0.028), and early cidofovir treatment (HR 0.319, 95%CI 0.115–0.883, p = 0.028) were significantly associated with respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of cidofovir was associated with a lower hazard for respiratory failure development. It is suggested that cidofovir be administered within 7 days from symptom onset to prevent respiratory failure in patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia.","Ko, J.-H.; Lim, J.U.; Choi, J.Y.; Oh, H.S.; Yoo, H.; Jhun, B.W.; Huh, K.; Peck, K.R.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X19305452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X19305452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648000/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2019.10.012,285

Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262–0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088–2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the “Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia” (EudraCT Number: 2020–001110–38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

683981,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children <5 Years of Age With Tracheostomy and Home Ventilator Dependence,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, which has brought a huge negative impact on the world since the end of 2019, is reported to invade cells using the spike (S) protein to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors on human cells while the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is the key protease that activates the S protein, which greatly facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells. In our previous study, it was observed that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in saliva was higher in male and the elderly COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the susceptibility of oral tissues to SARS-CoV-2 may be related to gender and age. This research aimed to further investigate the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in oral tissues and influencing factors from the perspective of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which were two proteins closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Immunofluorescence was used to find the localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in oral mucosal tissues. Transcriptomic sequencing data of several datasets were then collected to analysis the relationship between the expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with the age and gender of patients. Furthermore, oral tissues from patients with different ages and genders were collected. Immunohistochemistry staining, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to explore the relationship between expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and patient age as well as gender. RESULTS: The results showed that the two proteins were able to be co-expressed in the epithelial cells of oral tissues, and their expression levels were higher in the relatively elderly group than those in relatively younger group. Male oral epithelial cells exhibited higher level of TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings comprehensively confirmed the existence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in oral tissues and clarify the relationship between the expression levels with human age and gender for the first time, providing evidence for possible entry routes of SARS-CoV-2 and the influencing factors of SARS-CoV-2 colonization in oral cavity. Thus, the oral mucosa might be at potential risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, especially in male or elderly patients. Using saliva to detect the nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 may be more accurate for elder male COVID-19 patients.

In China, a major reason for the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 in early stage of the outbreak is the huge numbers of passengers boarding their “last train home” to meet family members during the Spring Festival. Most of these travelers were internal migrant workers. In order to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission, public transportation networks were suspended, and many migrant workers who returned to their hometowns needed to be quarantined for 2 weeks, which led to the delay of returning back to cities to work. Many businesses have temporarily closed because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission, leading to unemployment of many workers. Sudden loss of income and further quarantine enforcement in cities can exacerbate existing mental health problems or trigger new mental disorders among affected migrant workers. However, to date no specific guidelines or strategies about mental health services of migrant workers have been released.

Patients with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable risk population for worsening of their condition and relapse of symptoms. This study investigates the pandemic-related course of psychosocial burden in patients with pre-existing mental disorders. With the newly developed Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) psychosocial burden has been traced retrospectively (1) before the pandemic (beginning of 2020), (2) at its beginning under maximum lockdown conditions (March 2020), and (3) for the current state after maximum lockdown conditions (April/May 2020). The Goe-BSI also integrates the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM-20), assesses general psychiatric symptoms, and resilience. A total of 213 patients covering all major psychiatric disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed once in the time range from April, 24th until May 11th, 2020. Across all diagnoses patients exhibited a distinct pattern with an initial rise followed by a decline of psychosocial burden (p < 0.001, partial η(2) = 0.09; Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons between all three time-points: p < 0.05 to 0.001). Female gender and high ADNM-20 scores were identified as risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden over time. Most psychiatric symptoms remained unchanged. Trajectories of psychosocial burden vary in parallel to local lockdown restrictions and seem to reflect an adaptive stress response. For female patients with pre-existing mental disorders and patients with high-stress responses, timely and specific treatment should be scheduled. With the continuation of the pandemic, monitoring of long-term effects is of major importance, especially when long incubation times for the development of mental health issues are considered.

However, findings from prior reviews and recent longitudinal studies investigating the association between types of ACEs and persistent pain have yielded inconsistent findings in the strength and direction of associations. The purpose of this review is to appraise and summarize evidence on the relationship between ACEs and persistent pain and disability outcomes in adulthood. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether there is a relationship between exposure to ACE and persistent pain and disability in adults and (2) to determine whether unique and cumulative ACEs exposures (number and type) increase the risk of developing persistent pain and disability in adulthood. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies will be conducted. Our eligibility criteria are defined following a PECOS approach: population, adults with persistent (≥ 3 months) musculoskeletal and somatoform painful disorders exposed to single or cumulative direct ACEs alone (i.e., physical, sexual, emotional abuse or neglect) or in combination to indirect types of ACE (e.g., parental death, exposure to domestic violence) in the first 18 years of life; comparators, unexposed individuals; outcomes, measurements for persistent pain (≥ 3 months) and disability using discrete and/or continuous measures; and settings, general population, primary care. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (Ovid) and nine other pertinent databases was conducted from inception to 29 August 2019 using a combination of key words and MeSh terms (the search will be updated prior to conducting the analyses). Pairs of reviewers will independently screen records and full text articles, and a third reviewer will be consulted in cases of disagreement.

The purpose of this study is to understand medical students' perceptions of radiology and how they change based on medical education and exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-institution mixed-methods study included four groups of medical students with different levels of radiology exposure. All participants completed a 16-item survey regarding demographics, opinions of radiology, and perception of radiology stereotypes. Ten focus groups were administered to probe perceptions of radiology. Focus groups were coded to identify specific themes in conjunction with the survey results. RESULTS: Forty-nine participants were included. Forty-two percent of participants had positive opinions of radiology. Multiple radiology stereotypes were identified, and false stereotypes were diminished with increased radiology exposure. Opinions of the impact of artificial intelligence on radiology closely aligned with positive or negative views of the field overall. Multiple barriers to applying for a radiology residency position were identified including board scores and lack of mentorship. COVID-19 did not affect perceptions of radiology. There was broad agreement that students do not enter medical school with many preconceived notions of radiology, but that subsequent exposure was generally positive. Exposure both solidified and eliminated various stereotypes. Finally, there was general agreement that radiology is integral to the health system with broad exposure on all services. CONCLUSION: Medical student perceptions of radiology are notably influenced by exposure and radiology programs should take active steps to engage in medical student education.","Grimm, Lars J; Fish, Laura J; Carrico, Caroline Wt; Martin, Jonathan G; Nwankwo, Vesta C; Farley, Samantha; Meltzer, Carolyn C; Maxfield, Charles M",Acad. radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563441/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.08.020,285

687346,A multi‐centre insight into general surgical care during the coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom,2020-08-05,"Ebola viruses (EBOVs) have been identified as an emerging threat in recent year as it causes severe haemorrhagic fever in human. Epitope‐based vaccine design for EBOVs remains a top priority because a mere progress has been made in this regard. Another reason is the lack of antiviral drug and licensed vaccine although there is a severe outbreak in Central Africa. In this study, we aimed to design an epitope‐based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell‐mediated immunity by T cell and B cell was checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 42 to 50 and the sequence TLASIGTAF were found as the most potential B and T cell epitopes, respectively. This peptide could interact with 12 HLAs and showed high population coverage up to 80.99%. Using molecular docking, the epitope was further appraised for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post‐therapeutic strategy, docking study of predicted 3D structure identified suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein. However, this computational epitope‐based peptide vaccine designing and target site prediction against EBOVs open up a new horizon which may be the prospective way in Ebola viruses research; the results require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.","Khan, M.

A cadaveric study,2021-10-31,"As epitope mimics, mimotopes have been widely utilized in the study of epitope prediction and the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Screening the random peptide libraries constructed with phage display or any other surface display technologies provides an efficient and convenient approach to acquire mimotopes. However, target-unrelated peptides creep into mimotopes from time to time through binding to contaminants or other components of the screening system. In this study, we present SAROTUP, a free web tool for scanning, reporting and excluding possible target-unrelated peptides from real mimotopes. Preliminary tests show that SAROTUP is efficient and capable of improving the accuracy of mimotope-based epitope mapping. It is also helpful for the development of mimotope-based diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","Huang, Jian; Ru, Beibei; Li, Shiyong; Lin, Hao; Guo, Feng-Biao",J Biomed Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20339521/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/101932,285

689577,Evaluation of the ESGE recommendations for COVID-19 pre-endoscopy risk-stratification in a high-volume center in Germany,2021-09-16,"Summary: In the throes of the current COVID-19 pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","Libby, Peter",JACC Basic Transl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X20301546?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292847/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452302X20301546,285
689705,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Student and Resident Teaching and Training in Surgical Oncology,2020-10-26,"Rapid development of COVID-19 has resulted in a massive shift from traditional to online teaching. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of distance learning on anatomy and surgical training. This systematic review was conducted in line with the PRISMA statement and current methodological literature. The databases CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE and Pubmed were searched using the search terms “Distant learning” OR “Distance learning” AND “Anatomy OR Surgery”. 182 non-duplicate studies were identified. 20 studies were included for qualitative analysis. 10 studies evaluated students' performance with distance learning. 3 studies suggested that students’ learning motivation improved with distance learning pedagogy. 5 studies found improved student performance with distance learning (performance or task completion time) when compared to conventional physical method. While 2 other studies found non-inferior student performance. 10 studies evaluated students’ feedback on distance learning. Most feedbacks were positive, with flexibility, efficiency, increased motivation and better viewing angles as the most-liked features of distance teaching. 4 studies pointed out some limitations of distance learning, including the lack of personal contact with tutor, poor network and reduced student concentration. 7 studies evaluated tutors’ feedback on distance learning. Tutors generally liked online platforms for the ease of tracking silent students, monitoring performance and updating fast-changing knowledge. Yet the lack of hands-on experience for students, technical issues and high costs are the main concerns for tutors. In conclusion, distance learning is a feasible alternative for anatomy and surgical teaching.","Co, Michael; Cheung, Kwong Yee Chloe; Cheung, Wan Suen; Fok, Ho Man; Fong, Ka Hey; Kwok, Oi Yan; Leung, Tsz Wai Kelvin; Ma, Hei Chun Justin; Ngai, Pui Ting Isabelle; Tsang, Man Kit; Wong, Cheuk Yin Matthew; Chu, Kent-Man",Surgeon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X21001335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2021.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483055/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X21001335,285
689736,The use of biological agents in pregnant women affected by autoimmune disorders: Why we need more research of this neglected area,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and caused a pandemic. To monitor the global transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2, it is required to constantly update the phylogenetic tree of genomic sequences with 29.9 kb, which may be time consuming. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may be accelerated by making a multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences using the CPA (combining pairwise alignments) method, in which a pairwise alignment is made for a reference and each of other sequences, and the pairwise alignments are combined into a multiple alignment. Here it is shown from the analysis of 3729 genomic sequences for SARS-CoV-2 and outgroup strains that the CPA method can produce a multiple alignment with an elevated or a reduced number of variable sites depending on the reference compared to the OMA (ordinary multiple alignment) method, which was considered to be the most reliable. In particular, the topology of the phylogenetic tree constructed from the multiple alignment made using the CPA method adopting the outgroup sequence as the reference was considerably different from that using the OMA method, suggesting that the outgroup sequence may not be suitable as the reference in the CPA method.","Suzuki, Yoshiyuki",Meta Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835005/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mgene.2020.100785; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214540020301407?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214540020301407,285
