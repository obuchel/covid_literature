3123,"Risk factors for hematemesis in Hoima and Buliisa Districts, Western Uganda, September-October 2015",2017-11-08,"INTRODUCTION: On 17 September 2015, Buliisa District Health Office reported multiple deaths due to haemorrhage to the Uganda Ministry of Health. We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed case-patients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (± 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = ∞; 95%CI = 3.7-∞); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Health education should be conducted on the danger of NSAIDs misuse, especially in persons with pre-disposing conditions.","Kabwama, Steven Ndugwa; Mafigiri, Richardson; Balinandi, Stephen; Kagirita, Atek; Riolexus, Alex Ario; Zhu, Bao-Ping",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878846/,390

No evidence of outbreak or positive viral infection of influenza A virus was found in this study. We however recommend the implementation of long-term surveillance in seabird populations of polar ecosystems to detect the potential introduction of exotic strains and potential existence of a local epidemiological cycle for avian influenza viruses.","Chang, Chung-Ming; Lebarbenchon, Camille; Gauthier-Clerc, Michel; Le Bohec, Céline; Beaune, David; Le Maho, Yvon; van der Werf, Sylvie",Polar Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087602/,390
5083,Mechanisms of nasal hyper-reactivity,1995,"Cells infiltrating the nonsensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ of virus-antibody-free rats exhibited surface immunoreactivity for β (2)-microglobulin and immunoglobulin (Ig) E. They were further characterized by using immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies to cell-specific markers or histochemical techniques for immunocytes with surface receptors for IgE. Localization of intracellular granules immunoreactive for lactoferrin and CD18, a leukocyte adhesion molecule, unequivocally identified these cells as neutrophils. The low number of IgA-and IgG-immunoreactive B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and accessory immunocytes in the vomeronasal organ as well as the rest of the nasal cavity confirmed the absence of infection. We hypothesize that the operation of the vomeronasal pump induces repeated episodes of transient focal ischemia followed by reperfusion, which results in release of neutrophil chemoattractants and modulation of adhesion factors that regulate the extravasation and migration of neutrophils into the nonsensory epithelium. The distribution of immunoreactivity for interleukin 8 suggests that it is not the primary neutrophil chemoattractant in this system while that of CD18 suggests its active involvement in neutrophil extravasation. In addition to their role in immune surveillance, neutrophils may stimulate ion/water secretion into the vomeronasal lumen, affecting the perireceptor processes regulating stimulus access and clearance from the sensory epithelium.","Getchell, Marilyn L.; Kulkarni, Anjali P.",Cell Tissue Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087650/,390

11367,Comparative Effectiveness of Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Positive Behavior Support (PBS) in a Randomized Controlled Trial,2018-01-30,"PURPOSE: Cigarettes have been demonstrated to be toxic to the pulmonary connective tissue by impairing the lung’s ability to clear debris, resulting in infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Approximately 8% of adolescents are smokers. We hypothesized that adolescent trauma patients who smoke have a higher rate of ARDS and pneumonia when compared to non-smokers. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2014–2016) was queried for adolescent trauma patients aged 13–17 years. Adolescent smokers were 1:2 propensity-score-matched to non-smokers based on age, comorbidities, and injury type. Data were analyzed using chi square for categorical data and Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data. RESULTS: From 32,610 adolescent patients, 997 (3.1%) were smokers. After matching, 459 smokers were compared to 918 non-smokers. There were no differences in matched characteristics. Compared to non-smokers, smokers had an increased rate of pneumonia (3.1% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.01) but not ARDS (0.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.16). Compared to the non-smoking group, the smokers had a longer median total hospital length-of-stay (3 vs. 2 days, p = 0.01) and no difference in overall mortality (1.5% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.29). CONCLUSION: Smoking is associated with an increased rate of pneumonia in adolescent trauma patients. Future research should target smoking cessation and/or interventions to mitigate the deleterious effects of smoking in this population.","Kojayan, Greg Garo; Grigorian, Areg; Schubl, Sebastian D.; Kuza, Catherine M.; Dolich, Matthew; Bashir, Rame; Nahmias, Jeffry",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223784/,390

12547,Damage-associated molecular patterns in trauma,2019-10-14,"Thiopaq biotechnology for partial sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur is an efficient way to remove H(2)S from biogases. However, its application for high-pressure natural gas desulfurization needs upgrading. Particularly, an increase in alkalinity of the scrubbing liquid is required. Therefore, the feasibility of sulfide oxidation into elemental sulfur under oxygen limitation was tested at extremely haloalkaline conditions in lab-scale bioreactors using mix sediments from hypersaline soda lakes as inoculum. The microbiological analysis, both culture dependent and independent, of the successfully operating bioreactors revealed a domination of obligately chemolithoautotrophic and extremely haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Two subgroups were recognized among the isolates. The subgroup enriched from the reactors operating at pH 10 clustered with Thioalkalivibrio jannaschii–Thioalkalivibrio versutus core group of the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Another subgroup, obtained mostly with sulfide as substrate and at lower pH, belonged to the cluster of facultatively alkaliphilic Thioalkalivibrio halophilus. Overall, the results clearly indicate a large potential of the genus Thiolalkalivibrio to efficiently oxidize sulfide at extremely haloalkaline conditions, which makes it suitable for application in the natural gas desulfurization.

13353,Effects of walkability on physical activity and obesity: a prospective observational study protocol,2020-10-10,"Towards the goal of developing scalable, economical and effective antimicrobial textiles to reduce infection transmission, here we prepared color-variable photodynamic materials comprised of photosensitizer (PS)-loaded wool/acrylic (W/A) blends. Wool fibers in the W/A blended fabrics were loaded with the photosensitizer rose bengal (RB), and the acrylic fibers were dyed with a variety of traditional cationic dyes (cationic yellow, cationic blue and cationic red) to broaden their color range. Investigations on the colorimetric and photodynamic properties of a series of these materials were implemented through CIELab evaluation, as well as photooxidation and antibacterial studies. Generally, the photodynamic efficacy of these dual-dyed fabrics was impacted by both the choice, and how much of the traditional cationic dye was employed in the dyeing of the W/A fabrics. When compared with the PS-only singly-dyed material, RB-W/A, that showed a 99.97% (3.5 log units; p = 0.02) reduction of Staphylococcus aureus under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm, 60 min), the addition of cationic dyes led to a slight decrease in the photoinactivation ability of the dual-dyed fabrics, but was still able to achieve a 99.3% inactivation of S. aureus. Overall, our findings demonstrate the feasibility and potential applications of low cost and color variable RB-loaded W/A blended fabrics as effective self-disinfecting textiles against pathogen transmission.","Wang, Tingting; Chen, Wangbingfei; Dong, Tingting; Lv, Zihao; Zheng, Siming; Cao, Xiuming; Wei, Qufu; Ghiladi, Reza A.; Wang, Qingqing",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7560281/,390
15132,Clinico-pathological assessment of surgically removed abdominal wall endometriomas following cesarean section,2021-01-21,"There are strong biologic and preclinical rationales for the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines; however, the clinical translation of this treatment strategy has been challenging. It is now understood that many previous clinical trials of cancer vaccines used target antigens or vaccine designs that inherently lacked sufficient immunogenicity to induce clinical responses. Despite the historical track record, breakthrough advances in cancer immunobiology and vaccine technologies have supported continued interest in therapeutic cancer vaccinations, with the hope that next-generation vaccine strategies will enable patients with cancer to develop long-lasting anti-tumor immunity. There has been substantial progress identifying antigens and vaccine vectors that lead to strong and broad T cell responses, tailoring vaccine designs to achieve optimal antigen presentation, and finding combination partners employing complementary mechanisms of action (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) to overcome the diverse methods cancer cells use to evade and suppress the immune system. Results from randomized, phase 3 studies testing therapeutic cancer vaccines based on these advances are eagerly awaited. Here, we summarize the successes and failures in the clinical development of cancer vaccines, address how this historical experience and advances in science and technology have shaped efforts to improve vaccines, and offer a clinical perspective on the future role of vaccine therapies for cancer.","Morse, Michael A.; Gwin, William R.; Mitchell, Duane A.",Target Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845582/,390

AECOPD treatment remains limited. High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) is a glycosaminoglycan sugar, which is a physiological constituent of the lung extracellular matrix and has notable anti-inflammatory and hydrating properties. RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized that inhaled HMW-HA will improve outcomes in AECOPD. METHODS: We conducted a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to investigate the effect of inhaled HMW-HA in patients with severe AECOPD necessitating non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Primary endpoint was time until liberation from NIPPV. RESULTS: Out of 44 screened patients, 41 were included in the study (21 for placebo and 20 for HMW-HA). Patients treated with HMW-HA had significantly shorter duration of NIPPV. HMW-HA treated patients also had lower measured peak airway pressures on the ventilator and lower systemic inflammation markers after liberation from NIPPV. In vitro testing showed that HMW-HA significantly improved mucociliary transport in air–liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial cells from COPD patients and healthy primary cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract. INTERPRETATION: Inhaled HMW-HA shortens the duration of respiratory failure and need for non-invasive ventilation in patients with AECOPD. Beneficial effects of HMW-HA on mucociliary clearance and inflammation may account for some of the effects (NCT02674880, www.clinicaltrials.gov).","Galdi, Flavia; Pedone, Claudio; McGee, Christopher A.; George, Margaret; Rice, Annette B.; Hussain, Shah S.; Vijaykumar, Kadambari; Boitet, Evan R.; Tearney, Guillermo J.; McGrath, John A.; Brown, Audrey R.; Rowe, Steven M.; Incalzi, Raffaele A.; Garantziotis, Stavros",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847749/,390

17651,Inflamação pós-Infarto Agudo do Miocárdio: “Médico ou Monstro”,2020-12-01,"Relapse prevention remains a major challenge in psychiatry, thus indicating that the established treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions are not entirely effective. In recent years, several intervention strategies have been devised that are aimed at improving psychiatric treatment by providing a complementary set of add-on tools that can be used by clinicians to improve current patient assessment. Among these, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have been indexed as valuable biomarkers of the pathophysiological mechanisms of various mental illnesses. However, despite decades of research, their clinical utility is still controversial and a matter of debate. In this opinion review, I present the main arguments supporting the use of cognitive ERPs in the management of psychiatric disorders, stressing why it is currently still not the case despite the vast number of ERP studies to date. I also propose a clinically-oriented suitable way in which this technique could — in my opinion — be effectively incorporated into individual patient care by promotion of the use of individual ERP test-retest sessions and the use of a multi-component approach.","Campanella, Salvatore",World J Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8134870/,390
17766,High mortality rate of obstetric critically ill women in Rwanda and its predictability,2021-05-25,"Lymphedema (LE) affects millions of people worldwide. It is a chronic progressive disease with massive development of fibrosclerosis when untreated. There is no pharmacological treatment of lymphedema. The disease is associated with swelling of the interstitium of the affected organ, mostly arm or leg, impressive development of adipose tissue, fibrosis and sclerosis with accumulation of huge amounts of collagen, and Papillomatosis cutis. Malnutrition and reduced oxygenation of the affected tissues is a hallmark of lymphedema. Here, we investigated if the hypoxia of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) might contribute to fibrosis. We applied RNASeq and qPCR to study the concordant changes of the exome of three human foreskin-derived LEC isolates after 4 days of hypoxia (1% O(2)) vs. normoxia (21% O(2)). Of the approximately 16,000 genes expressed in LECs, 162 (1%) were up- or down-regulated by hypoxia. Of these, 21 genes have important functions in the production or modification of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to the down-regulation of elastin, we found up-regulation of druggable enzymes and regulators such as the long non-coding RNA H19, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain family member 5 (ITIH5), lysyl-oxidase (LOX), prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1), procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2), and others that are discussed in the paper. Initial lymphatics do not produce a continuous basement membrane; however, our study shows that hypoxic LECs have an unexpectedly high ability to alter the ECM.","Becker, Jürgen; Schwoch, Sonja; Zelent, Christina; Sitte, Maren; Salinas, Gabriela; Wilting, Jörg",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145299/,390

The most common location of myoepithelioma in the oral cavity is the parotid gland and it is seldom encountered in the palate. The diagnosis of this entity is challenging since its clinical presentation may resemble those of more common neoplasms, rendering a complex histopathological diagnosis. The aim of the present case report is to describe an unusual case of myoepithelioma of the soft palate in a male patient, which developed as an asymptomatic, slowly growing mass. The tumour was assessed with histopathological examination and the diagnosis was verified via immunohistochemistry. Finally, the treatment included surgical resection of the tumour and no signs of recurrence were noted 2.5 years after the surgical procedure.

19628,Customized mask for patients during facial procedures to maximize the work field,2020-06-15,"Birdwatching is one of the most sustainable types of nature-based tourism and, at the same time, a form of recreation that is developing very dynamically. Birdwatching is attracting more and more people, not only professionals, but also amateurs from many countries. Birdwatching research is still relatively embryonic, especially when compared to nature tourism or wildlife tourism. Our main aim was to determine preferences and opinions of birdwatchers visiting the largest national park in Poland, in relation to their different levels of involvement. The data were collected in 2018 from a survey of a sample of 357 Polish and foreign birdwatchers. Results showed that birdwatcher respondents were predominantly male, middle-aged, and living in a large city. An important tool described in this article is a new scale that assesses the level of involvement of individual people engaged in birdwatching activity. This scale corresponds well with the individual characteristics of birdwatchers. Most birdwatchers defined their birdwatching activity as a permanent rather than a temporary hobby and therefore considered it to be more of a lifestyle than a hobby. Engagement in birdwatching activity increased with age and frequency of trips. The two most important reasons for birding were ‘to be close to nature’ and ‘fascination with birds’. It has been proven that the development of birdwatching in the future will require a developed infrastructure enabling interaction with the objects of observation.","Janeczko, Emilia; Łukowski, Adrian; Bielinis, Ernest; Woźnicka, Małgorzata; Janeczko, Krzysztof; Korcz, Natalia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323953/,390
19900,MDR and XDR typhoid fever-a threat for the current decade?,2021-04-27,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a novel anti-HIF-1α intrabody to decrease gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer patients. METHODS: Surface plasmon resonance and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays were conducted to identify the binding affinity and specificity of anti-HIF-1α VHH212 [a single-domain antibody (nanobody)]. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to determine the protein-protein interactions between hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and VHH212. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses were performed to identify the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF-A in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines. The efficiency of the VHH212 nanobody in inhibiting the HIF-1 signaling pathway was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, a PANC-1 xenograft model was developed to evaluate the anti-tumor efficiency of combined treatment. Immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted to detect the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF-A in tumor tissues. RESULTS: VHH212 was stably expressed in tumor cells with low cytotoxicity, high affinity, specific subcellular localization, and neutralization of HIF-1α in the cytoplasm or nucleus. The binding affinity between VHH212 and the HIF-1α PAS-B domain was 42.7 nM. Intrabody competitive inhibition of the HIF-1α heterodimer with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator was used to inhibit the HIF-1/VEGF pathway in vitro. Compared with single agent gemcitabine, co-treatment with gemcitabine and a VHH212-encoding adenovirus significantly suppressed tumor growth in the xenograft model with 80.44% tumor inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an anti-HIF-1α nanobody and showed the function of VHH212 in a preclinical murine model of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer. The combination of VHH212 and gemcitabine significantly inhibited tumor development. These results suggested that combined use of anti-HIF-1α nanobodies with first-line treatment may in the future be an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer.","Kang, Guangbo; Hu, Min; Ren, He; Wang, Jiewen; Cheng, Xin; Li, Ruowei; Yuan, Bo; Balan, Yasmine; Bai, Zixuan; Huang, He",Cancer Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330535/,390
20047,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and sepsis: state of the art, certainties and missing evidence",2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Globally, 3.7 million people die of sudden cardiac death annually. Following the World Health Organization endorsement of the Kids Save Lives statements, initiatives to train school-age children in basic life support (BLS) have been widespread. Mobile phone apps, combined with gamification, represent an opportunity for including mobile learning (m-learning) in teaching schoolchildren BLS as an additional teaching method; however, the quality of these apps is questionable. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically evaluate the quality, usability, evidence-based content, and gamification features (GFs) of commercially available m-learning apps for teaching guideline-directed BLS knowledge and skills to school-aged children. METHODS: We searched the Google Play Store and Apple iOS App Store using multiple terms (eg, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] or BLS). Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated by 15 emergency health care professionals using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale. We modified a five-finger mnemonic for teaching schoolchildren BLS and reviewed the apps’ BLS content using standardized criteria based on three CPR guidelines. GFs in the apps were evaluated using a gamification taxonomy. RESULTS: Of the 1207 potentially relevant apps, only 6 (0.49%) met the inclusion criteria. Most apps were excluded because the content was not related to teaching schoolchildren BLS. The mean total scores for the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale score were 3.2/5 points (95% CI 3.0-3.4) and 47.1/100 points (95% CI 42.1-52.1), respectively. Half of the apps taught hands-only CPR, whereas the other half also included ventilation. All the apps indicated when to start chest compressions, and only 1 app taught BLS using an automated external defibrillator. Gamification was well integrated into the m-learning apps for teaching schoolchildren BLS, whereas the personal and fictional, educational, and performance gamification groups represented most GFs. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the quality and usability of BLS content in apps and combining them with GFs can offer educators novel m-learning tools to teach schoolchildren BLS skills.","Fijačko, Nino; Masterson Creber, Ruth; Gosak, Lucija; Štiglic, Gregor; Egan, Dominic; Chaka, Brian; Debeljak, Nika; Strnad, Matej; Skok, Pavel",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335615/,390
20830,Research Needed on Microlearning as a Training Strategy for CNAs in Skilled Nursing Facilities,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND: The majority of global population suffer from various functional gastrointestinal disorders. Pugionium cornutum (L.) Gaertn. (PCG) is used to relieve indigestive symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine. However, little is known about the effects of bioactive components from PCG extracts on gastrointestinal motility. METHODS: Crude ethanol extract of PCG (EEP) was prepared from Pugionium cornutum (L.) Gaertn. Different solvents were used to prepare fine extracts from EEP, including water extract of PCG (WEP), petroleum ether extract of PCG (PEEP), dichloromethane extract of PCG (DEP) and ethyl acetate extract of PCG (EAEP). Smooth muscle cell model and colonic smooth muscle stripe model were used to test the bioactive effects and mechanisms of different PCG extracts on contraction and relaxation. Diverse chromatographic methods were used to identify bioactive substances from PCG extracts. RESULTS: EEP was found to promote the relaxation of gastric smooth muscle cell and inhibit the contraction of colonic smooth muscle strip. Among the fractions of EEP, EAEP mainly mediated the relaxation effect by stimulating intracellular calcium influx. Further evidences revealed that EAEP was antagonistic to acetylcholine. In addition, COX and NO-GC-PKC pathways may be also involved in EAEP-mediated relaxation effect. Quercetin was identified as a bioactive compound from PCG extract for the relaxation effect. CONCLUSION: Our research supports the notion that PCG extracts promote relaxation and inhibits contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle at least partially through the effect from quercetin.","Su, Chencan; Li, Haoyu; Chen, Bang; Li, Cong; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xu, Long; Lan, Mei; Shen, Yehua",BMC Complement Med Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417984/,390

24664,Hemorrhage and Transfusions in the Surgical Patient,2012-10-30,"Document ranking is an important process in information retrieval (IR). It presents retrieved documents in an order of their estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document ranking methods are mostly based on the similarity computations between documents and query. In this paper we argue that the similarity-based document ranking is insufficient in some cases. There are two reasons. Firstly it is about the increased information variety. There are far too many different types documents available now for user to search. The second is about the users variety. In many cases user may want to retrieve documents that are not only similar but also general or broad regarding a certain topic. This is particularly the case in some domains such as bio-medical IR. In this paper we propose a novel approach to re-rank the retrieved documents by incorporating the similarity with their generality.

24985,Abdominal Pain,2016-02-22,"We propose a new methodology for the modeling and real time prediction of the course of unfolding epidemic outbreaks. The method posits a class of standard epidemic models and explores uncertainty in empirical data to set up a family of possible outbreak trajectories that span the probability distribution of models parameters and initial conditions. A genetic algorithm is used to estimate likely trajectories consistent with the data and reconstruct the probability distribution of model parameters. In this way the ensemble of trajectories allows for temporal extrapolation to produce estimates of future cases and deaths, with quantified levels of uncertainty. We apply this methodology to an outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola during 2005 in order to estimate disease epidemiological parameters and assess the effects of interventions. Data for cases and deaths was compiled from World Health Organization as the epidemic unfolded. We describe the outbreak through a standard epidemic model used in the past for Ebola, a closely related viral pathogen. The application of our method allows us to make quantitative prognostics as the outbreak unfolds for the expected time to the end of the epidemic and final numbers of cases and fatalities, which were eventually confirmed. We provided a real time analysis of the effects of intervention and possible under reporting and place bounds on population movements necessary to guarantee that the epidemic did not regain momentum.","Bettencourt, Luís M.

25263,Pathophysiology of Acute Illness and Injury,2018-06-14,"Public health as a segment of healthcare naturally is healthcare in the public domain, as distinct from healthcare outside of society’s purview; and the care naturally is paramedical care together with medical care – hence the term ‘health,’ rather than ‘medicine,’ in ‘public health.’ Medicine encompasses community medicine in addition to clinical medicine. This segment of medicine inherently is public-health medicine, whereas clinical medicine falls under public health only to the extent that national health insurance has been introduced. Community medicine used to be focused on epidemics of communicable diseases; and a natural term for this segment of medicine thus was epidemiology. As the concerns in community medicine were extended to encompass endemic occurrence of communicable – and also of non-communicable – illnesses, ‘endemology’ could have been introduced as a term for this extension; but instead, the concept of epidemiology was expanded to community medicine in the thus-expanded meaning of it. Epidemiological research naturally is research to advance (the practice of) community medicine – of epidemiology, that is. This research includes ‘bench’ or ‘basic’ research aimed at the development of vaccines, for example; and it falls under various medical sciences instead of constituting a science unto itself. All of this presumably is natural and quite obviously true in the judgements of beginning students of epidemiological research, but it is here said for the troubling reason that concepts of epidemiology and epidemiological research different from these are endemic in today’s epidemiologic academia. The purpose of this chapter is to help the beginning student to find proper orientation in this academia.","Miettinen, O.

27135,TOC,2004-06-16,"Previous studies have shown that octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) plays a significant role in early embryonic development of mammalian animals, and different Oct4 expression levels induce multi-lineage differentiation which are regulated by DNA methylation. To explore the relationship between the methylation pattern of Oct4 gene exon 1 and embryonic development, in this work, five different tissues (heart, liver, lung, cerebrum and cerebellum) from three germ layers were chosen from low age (50–60 d) and advanced age (60–70 d) of fetal cattle and the differences between tissues or ages were analyzed, respectively. The result showed that the DNA methylation level of Oct4 gene exon 1 was significant different (P<0.01) between any two of three germ layers in low age (<60 d), but kept steady of advanced age (P>0.05) (>60 d), suggesting that 60-d post coital was an important boundary for embryonic development. In addition, in ectoderm (cerebrum and cerebellum), there was no significant methylation difference of Oct4 gene exon 1 between low age and advanced age (P>0.05), but the result of endoderm (liver and lung) and mesoderm (heart) were on the contrary (P<0.01), which indicated the development of ectoderm was earlier than endoderm and mesoderm. The methylation differences from the 3rd, 5th and 9th CpG-dinucleotide loci of Oct4 gene exon 1 were significantly different between each two of three germ layers (P<0.05), indicating that these three loci may have important influence on bovine embryonic development. This study showed that bovine germ layers differentiation was significantly related to the DNA methylation status of Oct4 gene exon 1. This work firstly identified the DNA methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene exon 1 and its association with germ layers development in fetus and adult of cattle. Moreover, the work also provided epigenetic information for further studying bovine embryonic development and cellular reprogramming.","ZHOU, Xin-yu; LIU, Liang-liang; JIA, Wen-chao; PAN, Chuan-ying",J Integr Agric,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128269/,390

34493,Recent Developments in Infectious Disease Chemotherapy: Review for Emergency Department Practitioners 2020,2020-06-16,"The appeal for more solidarity is a recurring pattern in political discussions of how to cope with the crises the European Union (EU) confronts. This became most palpable in two major challenges—the Eurozone crisis and the refugee and migrant crisis. However, there is a yawning gap between the rhetorical commitment to solidarity and member states’ practices of solidarity: Even though the EU and its members regularly refer to solidarity as one of their fundamental values, the concept regularly fails to translate into concrete and common action. This lack of solidarity when it comes to problem resolution not only renders solidarity a weak principle within the EU’s political framework; it also precludes more effective crisis management. Drawing on the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein as well as (neo)pragmatism, this paper argues that a language- and practice-based reading can offer a new perspective on solidarity as one of the EU’s fundamental values. It can also explain why solidarity does not play a more vital role in the EU today, especially in times of crisis, when it is most needed.","Grimmel, Andreas",Acta Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291181/,390

HyperQPTL is an extension of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) with explicit trace and propositional quantification and therefore truly combines trace relations and [Formula: see text]-regularity. As such, HyperQPTL can express promptness, which states that there is a common bound on the number of steps up to which an event must have happened. We demonstrate how the HyperQPTL formulation of promptness differs from the type of promptness expressible in the logic Prompt-LTL. Furthermore, we study the realizability problem of HyperQPTL by identifying decidable fragments, where one decidable fragment contains formulas for promptness. We show that, in contrast to the satisfiability problem of HyperQPTL, propositional quantification has an immediate impact on the decidability of the realizability problem. We present a reduction to the realizability problem of HyperLTL, which immediately yields a bounded synthesis procedure. We implemented the synthesis procedure for HyperQPTL in the bounded synthesis tool BoSy. Our experimental results show that a range of arbiter satisfying promptness can be synthesized.","Finkbeiner, Bernd; Hahn, Christopher; Hofmann, Jana; Tentrup, Leander",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363225/,390

Comment on Br J Anaesth 2020; 125: e81–7,2020-08-28,"Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease. Although the number of lung transplants has increased over the years, the number of available donor lungs has not increased at the same rate, leading to the death of transplant candidates on waiting lists. In this paper, we presented our initial experience with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to lung transplantation. Between December 2016 and August 2018, we retrospectively reviewed the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation. Thirteen patients underwent preparative ECMO for bridging to lung transplantation, and seven patients successfully underwent bridging to lung transplantation. The average age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 19–62 years). The ECMO support period lasted 3–55 days (mean, 18.7 days; median, 13 days). In seven patients, bridging to lung transplantation was performed successfully. The mean age of patients was 49.8 years (range 42–62). Bridging time was 3–55 days (mean, 19 days; median, 13 days). Two patients died in the early postoperative period. Five patients survived until discharge from the hospital. One-year survival was achieved in four patients. ECMO can be used safely for a long time to meet the physiological needs of critically ill patients. The use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation is an acceptable treatment option to reduce the number of deaths on the waiting list. Despite the successful results achieved, this approach still involves risks and complications.","Vayvada, Mustafa; Uygun, Yesim; Cıtak, Sevinc; Sarıbas, Ertan; Erkılıc, Atakan; Tasci, Erdal",J Artif Organs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7450232/,390

Based on a comprehensive strategy of analysis and prediction, data were processed to notice the impact of the pandemic on trade sales. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model was implemented to assess and determine the total imports and exports value of New Zealand. The efficacy of the results was tested by employing standard error analytical techniques. Analysis of the results demonstrated that the trade economy of New Zealand shows plunge with the rise of pandemic and is likely to decline in future. On the basis, it is recommended that allowing trade for essential goods as a key factor in balancing the economy of trade in New Zealand. Future scope of the research is focused to identify other factors that could stimulate the economy of New Zealand during the pandemic.","Tyagi, Aayush; Shah, Urmi",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888692/,390

56468,Antigen-Specific Treg Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes – Challenges and Opportunities,2021-07-22,"Programmable nucleases—ZFNs, TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9—have equipped scientists with an unprecedented ability to modify cells and organisms almost at will, with great implications across life sciences: biology, agriculture, ecology and medicine. Nucleases-based genome editing (aka gene editing) depends on cellular responses to a targeted double-strand break (DSB). The first truly targetable reagents were zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) showing that arbitrary DNA sequences within a mammalian genome, could be addressed by protein engineering, ushering in the era of genome editing. ZFNs that are fusions of zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and FokI cleavage domain, resulted from the basic research on Type IIs FokI restriction enzyme, which showed a bipartite structure with a separable DNA-binding domain and a non-specific cleavage domain. Studies on 3-finger ZFNs established that the preferred substrates were paired binding sites, which doubled the size of the target recognition sequence from 9 to 18 bp that is large enough to specify a unique genomic locus in plant and mammalian cells, including human cells. Subsequently, a ZFN-induced DSB was shown to stimulate homologous recombination in frog eggs. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that are based on bacterial TALEs fused to FokI cleavage domain expanded the capability. ZFNs and TALENs have been successfully used to modify a multitude of recalcitrant organisms and cell types that were unapproachable previously attesting to the success of protein engineering, long before the arrival of CRISPR. The recent technique to deliver a targeted DSB to cellular genomes are RNA-guided nucleases as exemplified by the Type II prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs that use protein motifs for DNA sequence recognition, CRISPR-Cas9 depends on RNA-DNA recognition. The advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which include ease of RNA design for new targets and dependence on a single constant Cas9 protein, have led to its wide adoption by research labs around the world. The 2020 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanualle Charpentier for harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 system to provide a simplified technique for genome editing. The programmable nucleases have also been shown to cut at off-target sites with mutagenic consequences, which is a serious concern for human therapeutic applications. Therefore, applications of genome editing technologies to human therapeutics will ultimately depend on risk versus benefit analysis and informed consent","Singh, Alok Kumar; Ramalingam, Sivaprakash; Rao, Desirazu N.; Chandrasegaran, Srinivasan",Reson,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325037/,390

This article reports on an experiment where treatments differ in the parameterization of growth: Exponential growth is communicated to one group in terms of growth rates, and in terms of doubling times to the other. Exponential growth bias is much smaller when doubling times are employed. Considering that in many applications, individuals face a choice between different growth rates, rather than between exponential growth and zero growth, we ask a question where growth is reduced from high to low. Subjects vastly underestimate the effect of this reduction, though less so in the parameterization using doubling times. The answers to this question are more severely biased than one would expect from the answers to the exponential growth questions. These biases emerge despite the sample being highly educated and exhibiting awareness of exponential growth bias. Implications for teaching, the usefulness of heuristics, and policy are discussed.","Schonger, Martin; Sele, Daniela",Math Semesterber,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8386158/,390

Oral janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) represent a novel therapeutic class of targeted therapy to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: To review the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of oral JAKi in the treatment of AD. Methods: A PRISMA systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE (Ovid), and PubMed databases for studies assessing the efficacy, safety, and/or pharmacokinetic properties of oral forms of JAKi in the treatment of AD in pediatric or adult populations from inception to June 2021. Results: 496 papers were reviewed. Of 28 articles that underwent full text screening, 11 met our inclusion criteria for final qualitative review. Four studies examined abrocitinib; three studies examined baricitinib; three examined upadacitinib and one examined gusacitinib (ASN002). Significant clinical efficacy and a reassuring safety profile was reported for all JAKi agents reviewed. Rapid symptom control was reported for abrocitinib, baricitinib and upadacitinib. Limitations: Given the relatively limited evidence for each JAKi and the differences in patient eligibility criteria between studies, the data was not deemed suitable for a meta-analysis at this time. Conclusion: Given their ability to achieve rapid symptom control with a reassuring safety profile, we recommend considering the use of JAKi as a reliable systemic treatment option for adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD, who are unresponsive to topical or skin directed treatments.","Le, Michelle; Berman-Rosa, Melissa; Ghazawi, Feras M.; Bourcier, Marc; Fiorillo, Loretta; Gooderham, Melinda; Guenther, Lyn; Hanna, Sameh; Hong, H.

METHODS 108-Sprague Dawle male rats were randomly allocated into 6 equal groups differently receiving aqueous or methanolic fruit and seed extracts. Assay of serum creatinine, BUN and TNF-α, morphological examination of the left kidney, markers of the redox state (MDA, CAT, and GSH), the expression of TNFα and Nrf2 genes at the level of mRNA, the expression of caspase-3 and TGF-β proteins by immunohistochemistry were performed. RESULTS 45-min renal I/R caused significant deterioration of kidney functions (increase in serum creatinine and BUN) and morphology (P < 0.001) and significant reduction in CAT activity and GSH levels with significant increase in serum TNF-α and MDA concentration and the expression of Nrf2, caspase-3, TNF-α, and TGF-β in kidney tissues. Pre-treatment with either date palm fruit or seed extracts significantly improved kidney functions and morphology (P ≤ 0.001) with a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 and CAT activity, and GSH concentration and a reduction in serum TNF-α and expression of caspase-3, TNF-α, and TGF-β (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Administration of date palm extracts exhibited a renoprotective effect against renal I/R injury.This renoprotective action might be due to their antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions. Moreover, aqueous fruit extracts offered powerful renoprotective effect than aqueous seed extracts, and aqueous fruit and seed extracts were generally more effective than methanolic extracts.","Alghamdi, Mansour A; Hussein, Abdelaziz M; Al-Eitan, Laith N; Elnashar, Eman; Elgendy, Ahmed; Abdalla, Asim M; Ahmed, Seham; Khalil, Wael A",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763814/,390

To date, little is known about the role of CD59 in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. In this study, we discovered that CD59 was downregulated in IBV-infected cells and was associated with IBV virions. This association protected IBV particles from antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis. IBV titres in the supernatant were significantly increased when CD59 proteins were overexpressed in cells followed by IBV infection, and this observation was further supported by knockdown or cleavage of CD59. Because no considerable change in IBV N protein and viral RNA levels was detected in total cell lysates prepared from the overexpression, knockdown or cleavage of CD59 groups, our data indicated that CD59 was involved in IBV particle release and that IBV had evolved a mechanism to utilize CD59 to evade complement-mediated destruction.","Wei, Yanquan; Ji, Yanhong; Guo, Huichen; Zhi, Xiaoying; Han, Shichong; Zhang, Yun; Gao, Yuan; Chang, Yanyan; Yan, Dan; Li, Kangyu; Liu, Ding Xiang; Sun, Shiqi",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068273/,390

The combination of these two points led WHO to forecast a high expected mortality rate of approximately 2% of the population. The phenomenon of Simpson's paradox teaches us that we should be careful when we combine two variables together. Indeed, despite the high mortality rate in several places, this forecast seems to have collapsed. We believe one of the reasons for the erroneous forecasts is that combining the above points ignored a confounding variable - many of the virus carriers are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed.","Shaki, Yair Y",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211009673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884941/,390
62263,Glycemic Treatment: Further Concepts.,2021-02-11,"PURPOSE To review the safety of hepatic radioembolization (RE) in patients with high (≥ 10%) hepatopulmonary shunt fraction (HPSF) using various prophylactic techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review was conducted of 409 patients who underwent technetium 99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin scintigraphy before planned RE. Estimated pulmonary absorbed radiation doses based on scintigraphy and hepatic administered activity were calculated. Outcomes from dose reductions and adjunctive catheter-based prophylactic techniques used to reduce lung exposure were assessed. RESULTS There were 80 patients with HPSF ≥ 10% who received RE treatment (41 resin microspheres for metastases, 39 glass microspheres for hepatocellular carcinoma). Resin microspheres were used in 17 patients according to consensus guideline-recommended dose reduction; 38 patients received no dose reduction because the expected lung dose was < 30 Gy. Prophylactic techniques were used in 25 patients (with expected lung dose ≤ 74 Gy), including hepatic vein balloon occlusion, variceal embolization, or bland arterial embolization before, during, or after RE delivery. Repeated scintigraphy after prophylactic techniques to reduce HPSF in seven patients demonstrated a median change of -40% (range, +32 to -69%). Delayed pneumonitis developed in two patients, possibly related to radiation recall after chemoembolization. Response was lower in patients treated with resin spheres with dose reduction, with an objective response rate of 13% and disease control rate of 47% compared with 56% and 94%, respectively, without dose reduction (P = .023, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS Dose reduction recommendations for HPSF may compromise efficacy. Excessive shunting can be reduced by prophylactic catheter-based techniques, which may improve the safety of performing RE in patients with high HPSF.","Ward, Thomas J; Tamrazi, Anobel; Lam, Marnix G E H; Louie, John D; Kao, Peter N; Shah, Rajesh P; Kadoch, Michael A; Sze, Daniel Y",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2015.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525118/,390
62360,Taking Time With the RP Interval in Narrow Complex Tachycardia.,2021-05-24,"Monitoring Zn2+ in living cells is critical for fully elucidating the biological process of apoptosis. However, the quantitative intracellular sensing of Zn2+ using DNAzyme remains challenging because of issues related to penetration of the signal through tissue, targeted cellular uptake and activation, and susceptibility toward enzymatic degradation. In this study, we developed a novel phosphate ion-activated DNAzyme-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanoprobe for two-photon imaging of Zn2+ in living cells and tissues. The design of this nanoprobe involved the loading of a Zn2+-specific, RNA-cleaving DNAzyme onto the MOFs through strong coordination between the phosphonate O atoms of the DNAzyme backbone and Zr atoms in the MOFs. This coordination restrained the extracellular activity of DNAzyme, however, after cell entry, the DNAzyme was released from the MOFs through competitive bind by the phosphate ions present at a high intracellular concentration. Following their release, the two-photon (TP) fluorophore-labeled substrate strands of DNAzyme was cleaved with the aid of Zn2+, which resulted in a strong fluorescent signal. The incorporation of a TP fluor-ophore into the nanoprobe facilitated near-infrared (NIR) excitation, which allowed the highly sensitive and specific im-aging of Zn2+ in living cells and tissues at greater depths than possible previously. The TP-DNAzyme-MOFs nanoprobe achieved a low detection limit of 3.53 nM, extraordinary selectivity toward Zn2+, and tissue signal penetration of 120 m. More importantly, this nanoprobe was successfully used to monitor cell apoptosis, and this application of the DNAzyme-MOFs probe holds great potential for future use in biological studies and medical diagnostics.","Shi, Xinxin; Meng, Hong-Min; Geng, Xin; Qu, Ling-Bo; Li, Zhaohui",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962339/,390
62882,Adapting a community health nursing course to an online format.,2021-01-31,"Elevated intraocular pressure is the only treatable risk factor for glaucoma, an eye disease that is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. We have identified cromakalim prodrug 1 (CKLP1), a novel water-soluble ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, as a new ocular hypotensive agent. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of CKLP1 and its parent compound levcromakalim, Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits were treated intravenously (0.25 mg/kg) or topically (10 mM; 4.1 mg/ml) with CKLP1. Body fluids (blood, aqueous and vitreous humor) were collected at multiple time points and evaluated for the presence of CKLP1 and levcromakalim using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based assay. Histology of tissues isolated from Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits treated once daily for 90 days was evaluated in a masked manner by a certified veterinary pathologist. The estimated plasma parameters following intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg of CKLP1 showed CKLP1 had a terminal half-life of 61.8 ± 55.2 min, Tmax of 19.8 ± 23.0 min and Cmax of 1968.5 ± 831.0 ng/ml. Levcromakalim had a plasma terminal half-life of 85.0 ± 37.0 min, Tmax of 61.0 ± 32.0 min and Cmax of 10.6 ± 1.2 ng/ml. Topical CKLP1 treatment in the eye showed low levels (<0.3 ng/mL) of levcromakalim in aqueous and vitreous humor, and trace amounts of CKLP1 and levcromakalim in the plasma. No observable histological changes were noted in selected tissues that were examined following topical application of CKLP1 for 90 consecutive days. These results suggest that CKPL1 is converted to levcromakalim in the eye and likely to some extent in the systemic circulation.","Roy Chowdhury, Uttio; Kudgus, Rachel A; Rinkoski, Tommy A; Holman, Bradley H; Bahler, Cindy K; Hann, Cheryl R; Reid, Joel M; Dosa, Peter I; Fautsch, Michael P",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298376/,390

65502,Response to: Is newly diagnosed diabetes a stronger risk factor than pre-existing diabetes for COVID-19 severity?,2020-10-30,"BACKGROUND Early post-operative pain after laparoscopic groin hernia repair may, as in other laparoscopic operations, have its own individual pain pattern and patient-related predictors of early pain. The purpose of this review was to characterise pain within the first post-operative week after transabdominal pre-peritoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP), and to identify patient-related predictors of early pain. METHODS A qualitative systematic review was conducted. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane database were searched for studies on early pain (first week) after TAPP or TEP. RESULTS We included 71 eligible studies with 14,023 patients. Post-operative pain is most severe on day 0 and mainly on a level of 13-58 mm on a visual analogue scale and decreases to low levels on day 3. There seems to be no difference in pain intensity and duration when TEP and TAPP are compared. Deep abdominal pain (i.e. groin pain/visceral pain) dominates over superficial pain (i.e. somatic pain) and shoulder pain (i.e. referred pain) after TAPP. Predictors of early pain are young age and pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation. Furthermore, evidence supported early pain intensity as a predictive risk factor of chronic pain after laparoscopic groin hernia repair. CONCLUSION Early pain within the first week after TAPP and TEP is most severe on the first post-operative day, and the pain pattern is dominated by deep abdominal pain. Early post-operative pain is most intense in younger patients and can be predicted by pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation.","Tolver, M A; Rosenberg, J; Bisgaard, T",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02633.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22260427/,390
65649,The Impact of Physical Activity on Glycemic Variability Assessed by Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,2020,"Prior research documents intergenerational (IG) continuity in marijuana use, with most work adopting a life course perspective. Incorporating a methodology that allows for the measurement of ""patterns of behavior"" instead of singular aspects of parent marijuana use (e.g., age of onset or frequency at any one age or ages), we investigated the simultaneous effects of parental age of onset, frequency, and duration of marijuana use across 3 periods of the life course (i.e., adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood) on the timing of first marijuana use among offspring. Using prospective data from 2 companion studies, the Rochester Youth Development Study and the Rochester Intergenerational Study, we used group-based trajectory models to estimate trajectories (or patterns) of parental marijuana use spanning ages 14 to 31 among a birth cohort of 462 parents. We then examined the relationship between parental trajectories of marijuana use and the timing of the onset of marijuana use through age 25 among firstborn offspring. Both late-onset persistent use by parents and increasing chronic use spanning adolescence to adulthood by parents were associated with an increased likelihood of onset of marijuana use among offspring. The results underscore the importance of patterns of marijuana use for IG continuity in contrast to singular measures (e.g., age of onset among parents), which can obfuscate important IG patterns of continuity. Prevention and intervention programs should consider the entire history of parent use to better identify children most at risk for the onset of marijuana use in adolescence and emerging adulthood.

They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach. This work aims to be not only a reference paper for promotion of strategies able to increase waste management safety, but also an example showing that circular economy principles should be pursued also if boundary conditions can change.","Ducoli, S; Zacco, A; Bontempi, E",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.111966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454533/,390

We document an overview of methodologies developed and deployed in the Myanmar Snakebite Project, a foreign aid project largely funded by the Australian Government, with the core aim to ""improve outcomes for snakebite patients"". A multidisciplinary team of experts was assembled that worked in a collaborative manner with colleagues in Myanmar, first to identify problems related to managing snakebite and then develop interventions aimed to improve selected problem areas. A broad approach was adopted, covering antivenom production, antivenom distribution and health system management of snakebite. Problems identified in antivenom production included poor snake husbandry resulting in poor survival of captive specimens, lack of geographical diversity; poor horse husbandry, resulting in high mortality, inadequate stock acquisition protocols and data collection, and inappropriate immunisation and bleeding techniques; and inadequate production capacity for freeze dried antivenoms and quality control systems. These problems were addressed in various ways, resulting in some substantial improvements. Antivenom distribution is being reorganised to achieve better availability and utilisation of stock. Health system management of snakebite was assessed across all levels within the area selected for the study, in Mandalay region. A comprehensive community survey indicated that hospital statistics substantially underestimated the snakebite burden, and that access to care by local villagers was delayed by transport and cost issues compounded by lack of antivenom at the most peripheral level of the health service. A health system survey confirmed under-resourcing at the local village level. Prospective case data collection initiated at tertiary hospitals indicated the extent of the snakebite burden on health resources. Interventions initiated or planned include training of health staff, development of a core of senior trainers who can ""train the trainers"" nationwide in a sustainable way, development and deployment of management guidelines and algorithms for snakebite and a distribution of solar powered fridges to remote health facilities to allow storage of antivenom and prompt treatment of snakebite cases before transfer to major hospitals, thereby reducing the ""bite to needle"" time.","White, Julian; Mahmood, Mohammad Afzal; Alfred, Sam; Thwin, Khin Thida; Kyaw, Khin Maung; Zaw, Aung; Warrell, David; Cumming, Robert; Moody, John; Eagles, Debbie; Ragas, Keiran; Dunstan, Nathan; Bacon, David; Hurtado, Plinio; Peh, Chen Au",Toxicon: X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxcx.2018.100001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831344/,390

However, no systematic reviews of risk factors for T. cruzi vertical transmission have been performed. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, LILACS, and Embase databases, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were not excluded based on language, country of origin, or date of publication. RESULTS Our literature review yielded 27 relevant studies examining a wide variety of risk factors, including maternal age, parasitic load, immunologic factors, vector exposure, and more. Several studies suggested that mothers with higher parasitic loads may have a greater risk of vertical transmission, and a meta-analysis of two studies found a significantly higher parasitic load among transmitting than non-transmitting mothers with T. cruzi infection. A second meta-analysis of ten studies demonstrated that maternal age was not significantly associated with vertical transmission risk. CONCLUSIONS The current literature suggests that high maternal parasitic load may be a risk factor for congenital Chagas disease among infants of T. cruzi seropositive mothers. Given the considerable heterogeneity and risk of bias among current literature, additional studies are warranted to assess potential risk factors for vertical transmission of T. cruzi infection.","Klein, Melissa D; Proaño, Alvaro; Noazin, Sassan; Sciaudone, Michael; Gilman, Robert H; Bowman, Natalie M",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618005/,390

Perioperative protocols are needed to streamline care for these patients notwithstanding capacity and resource constraints. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel was assembled at the University of California, San Francisco, with 26 leaders across 10 academic departments, including 7 department chairpersons, the chief medical officer, the chief operating officer, infection control officers, nursing leaders, and resident house staff champions. An epidemiologist, an ethicist, and a statistician were also consulted. A modified two-round, blinded Delphi method based on 18 agree/disagree statements was used to build consensus. Significant disagreement for each statement was tested using a one-sided exact binomial test against an expected outcome of 95% consensus using a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Final triage protocols were developed with unblinded group-level discussion. RESULTS Overall, 15 of 18 statements achieved consensus in the first round of the Delphi method; the 3 statements with significant disagreement (p < 0.01) were modified and iteratively resubmitted to the expert panel to achieve consensus. Consensus-based protocols were developed using unblinded multidisciplinary panel discussions. The final algorithms 1) quantified outbreak level, 2) triaged patients based on acuity, 3) provided a checklist for urgent/emergent invasive procedures, and 4) created a novel scoring system for the allocation of personal protective equipment. In particular, the authors modified the American College of Surgeons three-tiered triage system to incorporate more urgent cases, as are often encountered in neurosurgery and spine surgery. CONCLUSIONS Urgent and emergent invasive procedures need to be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Being eukaryotes, these cells have been used as a model for studying and understanding complex cellular processes in humans like cell motility, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that infects multiple organs has emerged as a challenge to unravel its mode of infection and the pathogenicity resulting in eukaryotic cell death. Working with these single-celled eukaryotic microbes provided us the opportunity to plan bioinformatic approaches to look into the likelihood of studying the known and alternative mode of infection of the SARS-CoV-2 in eukaryotic cells. Genome databases of N. fowleri, B. mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba spp. were used to explore the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), androgen-regulated serine protease precursor (TMPRSS2), CD4, CD147, and furin that are known to be cardinal for SARS-CoV-2 in recognition and binding to human cells. It was hypothesized that if a receptor-dependent or phagocytosis-assisted SARS-CoV-2 uptake does occur in free-living amoebae (FLA), this model can provide an alternative to human cells to study cellular recognition and binding of SARS-CoV-2 that can help design drugs and treatment modalities in COVID-19. We show that, of the FLA, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed in Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris, but primitive forms of these cell recognition proteins were seen to be encoded in N. fowleri. Acanthamoeba spp. and N. fowleri encode for human-like furin which is a known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein involved in host cell recognition and binding.","Baig, Abdul Mannan",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119251/,390

Cellular immunotherapy strategies exploit the patient's immune system to kill cancer cells. The successful use of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in treating B-cell malignancies is the paradigm of this revolution, and numerous ongoing studies are investigating and extending this approach to other malignancies. However, resistance to CAR-T-cell therapy and non-durable efficacy have prevented CAR-T-cells from becoming the ultimate therapy. Because natural killer (NK) cells play an essential role in antitumor immunity, adoptively transferred allogeneic NK and CAR-modified NK cell therapy has been attempted in certain disease subgroups. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the oldest form of cellular immunotherapy and the only curative option for hematologic malignancies. Historically, the breadth of application of allo-HSCT has been limited by a lack of identical sibling donors (ISDs). However, great strides have recently been made in the success of haploidentical allografts worldwide, which enable everyone to have a donor. Haploidentical donors can achieve comparable outcomes to those of ISDs and even better outcomes in certain circumstances because of a stronger graft vs. tumor effect. Currently, novel strategies such as CAR-T or NK-based immunotherapy can be applied as a complement to allo-HSCT for curative effects, particularly in refractory cases. Here, we introduce the developments in cellular immunotherapy in hematology.","Xu, Zhengli; Huang, Xiaojun",Cancer biology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2020.0801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351724/,390

In mice, protocols typically specify pairing recipient females with vasectomized males to induce a receptive uterine environment for embryo implantation. However, this induced receptive state is not always maintained until implantation occurs. The use of a well-characterized correlation between oestrous state and exfoliative vaginal cytology was therefore evaluated to assess uterine receptivity immediately before embryo transfer. Eight- to 12-week-old virgin female CD1 mice (n = 22) were paired overnight with vasectomized males and successfully mated, indicated by the presence of a vaginal plug. These dams underwent embryo transfer 3 days later with embryos obtained from superovulated 4-week-old F1 (C57BL/6 × CBA) females. Non-invasive vaginal lavage was conducted immediately before transfer. Dams were killed 6 days after transfer and the uterus collected for histological analysis. Embryo implantation rate in mice was 96% when cytological analysis of the lavage samples signified dioestrus (n = 6), whereas the implantation rate was <15% (n = 16) when cytology signified other stages of oestrous. This simple, quick, non-invasive measure of receptivity was accurate and easily adopted and, when applied prospectively, will avoid unnecessary surgery and subsequent culling of non-suitable recipients, while maximizing the implantation potential of each recipient female.","Mamrot, Jared; Pangestu, Mulyoto; Walker, David; Gardner, David K; Dickinson, Hayley",Reproductive biomedicine online,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2015.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26276041/,390

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who underwent percutaneous computed tomography- and ultrasound-guided RF ablation for histologically proven RCC from 2004 to 2011 were evaluated. Clinical data, pathologic findings, technical details, and outcomes were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of primary technique effectiveness and complications. Local tumor progression-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival were calculated. One hundred RCC lesions underwent 115 RF ablation sessions in 84 patients. Median follow-up was 24 months (mean, 27 mo; range, 1-106 mo). RESULTS Efficacy of RF ablation was defined per International Working Group of Image-Guided Tumor Ablation criteria. Total, primary, and secondary technique effectiveness rates were 95% (95 of 100), 86% (86 of 100), and 9% (nine of 100), respectively. Primary efficacy was associated with size (P < .001), proximity to collecting system (P = .001), RENAL nephrometry score (P < .001), and number of ablation zones (P < .001). Complications occurred in 13% of patients, without procedure-related deaths. The median 2.1-year local progression-free, metastasis-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates were 86%, 98.7%, 100%, and 97.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous image-guided RF ablation for RCC provides excellent intermediate oncologic control.

The authors report the results of patients who underwent Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) flow diversion using novel strategies for treatment of fusiform posterior circulation aneurysms, and compare these results with those from previously reported series. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of data from consecutive patients with fusiform vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms treated with the PED. RESULTS This review resulted in the identification of 12 such patients (mean [± SD] age 55.1 ± 14.1 years). Eleven patients had symptoms; 1 had a dissecting aneurysm identified on imaging for neck pain. The average aneurysm size was 13.25 ± 4.5 mm. None of the aneurysms were ruptured or previously treated. The average clinical follow-up duration was 22.1 ± 10.7 months and radiological follow-up was 14.5 ± 11.1 months from the index PED treatment. One patient suffered a perforator stroke and had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4 at last follow-up. Another patient had a retained stent pusher requiring retrieval via surgical cut-down but recovered to an mRS score of 0 at last follow-up. Eleven (91.7%) of 12 patients recovered to an mRS score of 0 or 1. Two patients had aneurysmal remnants at 7 and 10 months, respectively, after the index PED, which were retreated with PEDs. At last follow-up, all 12 aneurysms were occluded and PEDs were patent. The minimum follow-up duration was 12 months from the index PED treatment; no patient experienced delayed hemorrhage, stroke, or in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion with selective adjunctive techniques is evolving to become a safer treatment option for posterior circulation aneurysms. This is the longest clinical follow-up duration reported for a single-center experience of flow-diversion treatment of these aneurysms.","Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Lin, Ning; Sonig, Ashish; Rai, Ansaar T; Carpenter, Jeffrey S; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.6.jns1565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26654175/,390

A total of 5796 abstracts were retrieved through a systematic search for articles published between January 1, 2001, to February 4, 2017, in the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, PsychInfo, British Library, Conference Proceeding Citation Index, OpenGrey trials (including cluster-randomised trials) and non-randomised studies (comprising controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, cohort studies) of care bundles for any health condition and any healthcare settings were considered. Following the removal of duplicated studies, two reviewers independently screen 3134 records. Three authors performed data extraction independently. We compared the care bundles with usual care to evaluate the effects of care bundles on the risk of negative patient outcomes. Random-effect models were used to further explore the effects of subgroups. RESULTS In total, 37 studies (6 randomised trials, 31 controlled before-after studies) were eligible for inclusion. The effect of care bundles on patient outcomes is uncertain. For randomised trial data, the pooled relative risk of negative effects between care bundle and control groups was 0.97 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.34; 2049 participants]. The relative risk of negative patient outcomes from controlled before-after studies favoured the care bundle treated groups (0.66 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.75; 119,178 participants]). However, using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of all of the evidence to be very low (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness). CONCLUSIONS Very low quality evidence from controlled before-after studies suggests that care bundles may reduce the risk of negative outcomes when compared with usual care. By contrast, the better quality evidence from six randomised trials is more uncertain.

In this study, we experimentally evaluate the ability of spiked saliva-moist swabs and spiked swabs without any transport medium to retain SARS-CoV-2 for storage and transport at different environmental settings during different incubation time periods. Our results show that at ambient temperature of 20°C, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains stable for up to 9 days allowing a long-time span for transport and storage without compromising clinical results. Additionally, this study demonstrates that saliva-moist swabs can also be stored at -20°C and +4°C for up to 26 days without affecting RT-qPCR results. Our data is relevant for low-and middle-income countries, which have limited access to rapid refrigerated transport and storage of samples representing an economical alternative. Finally, our study demonstrates the practical and economic advantage of using swabs without transport medium. This article is protected by copyright.

DATA SOURCES The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation. CONCLUSIONS Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases. Ongoing trials aim to evaluate the effects of glucose-lowering agents in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.","Berlie, Helen D; Kale-Pradhan, Pramodini B; Orzechowski, Tara; Jaber, Linda A",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028021999473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657863/,390
73517,Estimated HbA1c and glucose management indicator (GMI): are they the same?,2020-10-15,"Liberibacter pathogens are the causative agents of several severe crop diseases worldwide, including citrus Huanglongbing and potato zebra chip. These bacteria are endophytic and nonculturable, which makes experimental approaches challenging and highlights the need for bioinformatic analysis in advancing our understanding about Liberibacter pathogenesis. Here, we performed an in-depth comparative phylogenomic analysis of the Liberibacter pathogens and their free-living, nonpathogenic, ancestral species, aiming to identify major genomic changes and determinants associated with their evolutionary transitions in living habitats and pathogenicity. Using gene neighborhood analysis and phylogenetic classification, we systematically uncovered, annotated, and classified all prophage loci into four types, including one previously unrecognized group. We showed that these prophages originated through independent gene transfers at different evolutionary stages of Liberibacter and only the SC-type prophage was associated with the emergence of the pathogens. Using ortholog clustering, we vigorously identified two additional sets of genomic genes, which were either lost or gained in the ancestor of the pathogens. Consistent with the habitat change, the lost genes were enriched for biosynthesis of cellular building blocks. Importantly, among the gained genes, we uncovered several previously unrecognized toxins, including new toxins homologous to the EspG/VirA effectors, a YdjM phospholipase toxin, and a secreted endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (EEP) protein. Our results substantially extend the knowledge of the evolutionary events and potential determinants leading to the emergence of endophytic, pathogenic Liberibacter species, which will facilitate the design of functional experiments and the development of new methods for detection and blockage of these pathogens. IMPORTANCE Liberibacter pathogens are associated with several severe crop diseases, including citrus Huanglongbing, the most destructive disease to the citrus industry. Currently, no effective cure or treatments are available, and no resistant citrus variety has been found. The fact that these obligate endophytic pathogens are not culturable has made it extremely challenging to experimentally uncover the genes/proteins important to Liberibacter pathogenesis. Further, earlier bioinformatics studies failed to identify key genomic determinants, such as toxins and effector proteins, that underlie the pathogenicity of the bacteria. In this study, an in-depth comparative genomic analysis of Liberibacter pathogens along with their ancestral nonpathogenic species identified the prophage loci and several novel toxins that are evolutionarily associated with the emergence of the pathogens. These results shed new light on the disease mechanism of Liberibacter pathogens and will facilitate the development of new detection and blockage methods targeting the toxins.","Tan, Yongjun; Wang, Cindy; Schneider, Theresa; Li, Huan; de Souza, Robson Francisco; Tang, Xueming; Swisher Grimm, Kylie D; Hsieh, Tzung-Fu; Wang, Xu; Li, Xu; Zhang, Dapeng",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00509-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523996/,390

Our work aims to evaluate the role of two-stage transverse preputial island flap urethroplasty for repair of proximal hypospadias with chordee. Material and methods This is a retrospective study including 57 children who underwent two-stage transverse preputial island flap urethroplasty. Glans meatus shaft (GMS) score was applied to 24 cases. Patient's characteristics, operative details and complications were assessed. Hypospadias objective scoring evaluation was used for postoperative assessment. Results The mean age at the first stage operation was 23.6 months (9-84); the mean time interval between the first and second stage operations was 8.1 months (6-12) and the mean follow-up duration was 52.1 months (24-96). Urethral meatus was proximal penile in 18 patients, penoscrotal in 24 and scrotal in 15. The mean degree of ventral curvature (VC) was 51.5° (30-90). After the second stage operation, postoperative complications occurred in 16 (28.1%) patients with urethrocutaneous fistula in 6 (10.5%) cases, diverticulum in 3 (5.3%), glans dehiscence in 5 (8.8%) and meatal stenosis in 2 (3.5%). All cases of glans dehiscence occurred in severe hypospadias and small glans. Moderate GMS score was present in 10 (41.7%) cases and severe GMS in 14 (58.3%). Complications occurred in 7 (29.1%) patients with 5 (20.8%) with a severe GMS score and 2 (8.3%) with a moderate GMS score. The hypospadias objective scoring evaluation showed satisfactory results, with 39 (68.4%) patients achieving a score of 16 points.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the effects of different propofol and/or desflurane administration protocols in terms of the prevention of ischaemia-reperfusion damage. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ninety patients, aged > 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) category III, scheduled to undergo primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), were included in the study. During maintenance, the patients in group 1 (n = 30) received a propofol infusion (5-6 mg/kg/h) combined with a fentanyl infusion (3-5 mcg/kg/h); the patients in group 2 (n = 30) also received a propofol infusion (5-6 mg/kg/h) combined with a fentanyl infusion (3-5 mcg/kg/h), but they were also given 6% desflurane inhalation for 15 min both before cross-clamping of the aorta and after removal of the clamp; the patients in group 3 (n = 30) received a propofol infusion (2-3 mg/kg/h) combined with a fentanyl infusion (3-5 mcg/kg/h) and received the continuous 6% desflurane inhalation. Blood samples were drawn in the preoperative period (S1), during cardiopulmonary bypass, before cross-clamping the aorta (S2), after removal of the cross-clamp (S3) and 24 h after the operation (S4). RESULTS All groups were similar in terms of age and BMI (p > 0.05). TNF-α levels were higher at S3 compared to S1, S2 and S4 (p > 0.001). The TNF-α levels at S4 were lower in group 3 than those in group 1 and group 2 (p < 0.05). In all groups, h-FABP levels showed an increase in S3 but were significantly lower at S4 (p < 0.05). In group 3, h-FABP levels at S2 and S3 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (p < 0.05). There was a moderate correlation between h-FABP and TNF-α levels (Spearman's rho = 0.472, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the measurement of h-FABP and TNF-α, low-dose propofol and continuous desflurane inhalation provide more effective preconditioning than propofol alone or a short course of desflurane in patients undergoing CABG.","Onk, Didem; Ozcelik, Fatih; Kuyrukluyıldız, Ufuk; Gunay, Murat; Onk, Alper; Ayazoglu, Tulin Akarsu; Coban, Abdulkadir; Alagol, Aysin",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/61045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068578/,390

OBJECTIVE This study was to compare patient satisfaction of telemedicine clinic to in-person visits; to evaluate the preference for telemedicine to in-person visits; to assess patients' willingness to proceed with major surgery and/or a minor procedure based on a telemedicine visit alone. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA One study showed promising utility of mobile health applications for spine patients. No studies have investigated telemedicine in the evaluation and management of spine patients. METHODS An 11-part questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes towards telemedicine for all patients seen within a 7-week period during the COVID-19 crisis. Patients were called by phone to participate in the survey. Chi squared and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test were performed to determine significance. RESULTS Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating it was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Patients saved a median of 105 minutes by using telemedicine compared to in-person visits. Fifty-two percent of patients have to take off work for in-person visits, compared to 7% for telemedicine. Thirty-seven percent preferred telemedicine to in-person visits. Patients who preferred telemedicine had significantly longer patient reported in-person visit times (score mean of 171) compared to patients who preferred in-person visits (score mean of 137), p = 0.0007. Thirty-seven percent of patients would proceed with surgery and 73% would proceed with a minor procedure based on a telemedicine visit alone. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine can increase access to specialty care for patients with prolonged travel time to in-person visits and decrease the socioeconomic burden for both patients and hospital systems. The high satisfaction with telemedicine and willingness to proceed with surgery suggest that remote visits may be useful for both routine management and initial surgical evaluation for spine surgery candidates.

Overexpression of the carboxyl terminus (CT) of the cognate channel Kv2.2 is neuroprotective by disrupting Kv2.1 surface clusters. Here, we define a seven-amino acid declustering domain within Kv2.2 CT (DP-2) and demonstrate its neuroprotective efficacy in a murine ischemia-reperfusion model. TAT-DP-2, a membrane-permeable derivative, induces Kv2.1 surface cluster dispersal, prevents post-injurious pro-apoptotic potassium current enhancement, and is neuroprotective in vitro by disrupting the association of Kv2.1 with VAPA. TAT-DP-2 also induces Kv2.1 cluster dispersal in vivo in mice, reducing infarct size and improving long-term neurological function following stroke. We suggest that TAT-DP-2 induces Kv2.1 declustering by disrupting Kv2.1-VAPA association and scaffolding sites required for the membrane insertion of Kv2.1 channels following injury.

Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are now a cornerstone of the WHOs ""Ending Cholera - A Global Roadmap to 2030"" global program for the eventual elimination of cholera. There are currently three WHO prequalified OCVs available, Dukoral®, Shanchol® and Euvichol-Plus®. These vaccines are effective but due to a multiple strain composition and two different methods of inactivation, are complex and costly to manufacture. We describe here the characterization and industrial scale development of Hillchol®; a novel, likely affordable single-component OCV for low and middle-income countries.

The novel OCV can be manufactured on an industrial scale at a low cost. Hillchol® was well tolerated in animal toxicology studies and shown to have non-inferior oral immunogenicity in mice for both intestinal-mucosal and serological immune responses when compared with a WHO-prequalified OCV. The optimized production of this single component OCV will reduce cost of OCV production and thus substantially increase vaccine availability.

METHODS This prospective investigation was conducted in individuals with morbid obesity who had undergone LGP from 2000 to 2016. Patients with weight loss failure, weight regain, and regain-prone cases were indicated for reoperation. Re-plication, laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB), and modified jejunoileal bypass were done as revisional surgery. RESULTS Revisional surgery was performed in 102 of 124 patients who needed reoperation. Overall, 39 re-plication, 38 LOAGB, and 25 malabsorptive procedures were performed. Re-plication was the shortest surgery and had the shortest length of hospital stay. The percentage of TWL at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up was 20.5%, 25%, and 26.8% for re-plication; 20.2%, 27%, and 30.5% for LOAGB; and 22.9%, 28.9%, and 32.6% for the malabsorptive procedure, respectively. In addition, the percentage of EWL at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up was 62%, 74.6%, and 79.6% for re-plication; 51.6%, 68.2%, and 75.9% for LOAGB; and 55.4%, 70.1%, and 79.1% for malabsorptive procedure, respectively. In long-term follow-up, according to %TWL, LOAGB and malabsorptive procedure had better outcome compared to re-plication, whereas there was no statistically significant difference in %EWL among the three surgical approaches. CONCLUSIONS In terms of weight loss, reoperation on failed LGP was completely successful and no treatment failure was reported. All three revisional procedures, including re-plication, LOAGB, and malabsorptive procedure showed promising results and provided substantial weight loss. Since there is little information about the long-term efficacy and safety of revisional surgery on failed LGP, we highly recommend further investigations to confirm our results.","Heidari, Reza; Talebpour, Mohammad; Soleyman-Jahi, Saeed; Zeinoddini, Atefeh; Sanjari Moghaddam, Ali; Talebpour, Atieh",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-018-3522-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251095/,390

79339,Effectiveness of a Guided Web-Based Intervention to Reduce Depressive Symptoms before Outpatient Psychotherapy: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND Our current understanding of atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis pathophysiology is largely derived from skin biopsy studies that cause scarring and may be impractical in large-scale clinical trials. Although tape strips show promise as a minimally invasive technique in these common diseases, a comprehensive molecular profiling characterizing and differentiating the 2 diseases in tape strips is unavailable. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to construct a global transcriptome of tape strips from lesional and nonlesional skin of adults with moderate-to-severe AD and psoriasis. METHODS A total of 20 tape strips were obtained from lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with AD and psoriasis and skin from controls (n = 20 each); the strips were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with quantitative RT-PCR validation of immune and barrier biomarkers. RESULTS We detected RNA-seq profiles in 96 of 100 of samples (96%), with 4123 and 5390 genes differentially expressed in AD and psoriasis lesions versus in controls, respectively (fold change ≥ 2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Nonlesional tape-stripped skin from patients with AD was more similar to lesional skin than to nonlesional skin of patients with psoriasis, which showed larger differentiation from lesions. AD and psoriasis tissues shared increases in levels of dendritic cell and T-cell markers (CD3, ITGAX/CD11c, and CD83), but AD tissues showed preferential TH2 skewing (IL-13, CCL17/TARC, and CCL18), whereas psoriasis was characterized by higher levels of expression of TH17-related (IL-17A/F and IL-36A/IL-36G), TH1-related (IFN-γ and CXCL9/CXCL10), and innate immunity-related (nitric oxide synthase 2/inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-17C) products (FDR < 0.05). Terminal differentiation (FLG2 and LCE5A), tight junction (CLDN8), and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism (FA2H and ALOXE3) products were significantly downregulated in both AD and psoriasis (FDR < 0.05). Nitric oxide synthase 2/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (determined by quantitative PCR) differentiated AD and psoriasis with 100% accuracy. CONCLUSION RNA-seq tape strip profiling detected distinct immune and barrier signatures in lesional and nonlesional AD and psoriasis skin, suggesting their utility as a minimally invasive alternative to biopsies for detecting disease biomarkers.","He, Helen; Bissonnette, Robert; Wu, Jianni; Diaz, Aisleen; Saint-Cyr Proulx, Etienne; Maari, Catherine; Jack, Carolyn; Louis, Maudeline; Estrada, Yeriel; Krueger, James G; Zhang, Ning; Pavel, Ana B; Guttman-Yassky, Emma",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709423/,390

A total of 241 non-diabetic participants from a Chinese rural cohort were included. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound (NAFLD, n = 71; Non-NAFLD, n = 171). Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-h food recall. Plasma oxidative stress related markers superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxo-dG) were measured. The association between dietary antioxidant vitamin intake, oxidative stress related markers and NAFLD were analysed by Spearman correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Mediation models were established to examine whether SOD mediated the association between dietary vitamin A or α-tocopherol intake and NAFLD. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that dietary vitamin A and α-tocopherol intake were positively correlated with SOD (p < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis found plasma SOD, dietary vitamin A and α-tocopherol intake were inversely associated with NAFLD (all p < .05). Mediation analysis indicated that SOD significantly mediated the indirect effect of dietary α-tocopherol (mediated effect = 13.21% total effect) or vitamin A (mediated effect = 3.12% total effect) intake on NAFLD. Our study indicated that dietary vitamin A and α-tocopherol intake may contribute to protect from NAFLD in Chinese non-diabetics, and the associations were partly mediated by SOD. However, SOD only accounted for a minor percentage of the association between vitamin A intake and NAFLD. Thus, other mechanisms underlying antioxidant vitamin' protective effect on NAFLD need further exploration.","Ma, Chifa; Liu, Yiwen; He, Shuli; Zeng, Jingbo; Li, Pingping; Ma, Chunxiao; Ping, Fan; Zhang, Huabing; Xu, Lingling; Li, Wei; Li, Yuxiu",Free radical research,https://doi.org/10.1080/10715762.2020.1825705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985285/,390

We summarise global data on use of amphetamines and mental health outcomes. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD 42017081893). We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycInfo for methamphetamine or amphetamine combined with psychosis, violence, suicidality, depression or anxiety. Included studies were human empirical cross-sectional surveys, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that assessed the association between methamphetamine and one of the mental health outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results for any use of amphetamines and amphetamine use disorders. Findings 149 studies were eligible and 59 were included in meta-analyses. There was significant heterogeneity in effects. Evidence came mostly from cross-sectional studies. Any use of amphetamines was associated with higher odds of psychosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95%CI 1.3-3.3), violence (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2-4.1; adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.4, 95%CI 0.8-2.4), suicidality OR = 4.4, 95%CI 2.4-8.2; AOR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.0-2.9) and depression (OR = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2; AOR = 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4). Having an amphetamine use disorder was associated with higher odds of psychosis (OR = 3.0, 95%CI 1.9-4.8; AOR = 2.4, 95%CI 1.6-3.5), violence (OR = 6.2, 95%CI 3.1-12.3), and suicidality (OR = 2.3, 95%CI 1.8-2.9; AOR = 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.8). Interpretation Methamphetamine use is an important risk factor for poor mental health. High quality population-level studies are needed to more accurately quantify this risk.

81047,Estimated Effect on Life Expectancy of Alleviating Primary Care Shortages in the United States.,2021-03-23,"IMPORTANCE During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a complete physical isolation has been worldwide introduced. The impossibility of visiting their loved ones during the hospital stay causes additional distress for families: in addition to the worries about clinical recovery, they may feel exclusion and powerlessness, anxiety, depression, mistrust in the care team and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impossibility of conducting the daily meetings with families poses a challenge for healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to delineate and share consensus statements in order to enable healthcare team to provide by telephone or video calls an optimal level of communication with patient's relatives under circumstances of complete isolation. EVIDENCE REVIEW PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies. Using an e-Delphi methodology, general and specific questions were posed, relevant topics were argumented, until arriving to delineate position statements and practical checklist, which were set and evaluated through an evidence-based consensus procedure. FINDINGS Ten statements and two practical checklists for phone or video calls were drafted and evaluated; they are related to who, when, why and how family members must be given clinical information under circumstances of complete isolation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The statements and the checklists offer a structured methodology in order to ensure a good-quality communication between healthcare team and family members even in isolation, confirming that time dedicated to communication has to be intended as a time of care.","Mistraletti, Giovanni; Gristina, Giuseppe; Mascarin, Sara; Iacobone, Emanuele; Giubbilo, Ilaria; Bonfanti, Silvia; Fiocca, Federico; Fullin, Giorgio; Fuselli, Ennio; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Mazzon, Davide; Giusti, Gian Domenico; Galazzi, Alessandro; Negro, Alessandra; De Iaco, Fabio; Gandolfo, Enrico; Lamiani, Giulia; Del Negro, Silvia; Monti, Laura; Salvago, Fabrizia; Di Leo, Silvia; Gribaudi, Maria Nefeli; Piccinni, Mariassunta; Riccioni, Luigi; Giannini, Alberto; Livigni, Sergio; Maglione, Carla; Vergano, Marco; Marinangeli, Franco; Lovato, Luisa; Mezzetti, Andrea; Drigo, Elio; Vegni, Elena; Calva, Sally; Aprile, Anna; Losi, Gianfranco; Fontanella, Lucia; Calegari, Giulio; Ansaloni, Cristina; Pugliese, Francesco Rocco; Manca, Salvatore; Orsi, Luciano; Moggia, Fabrizio; Scelsi, Silvia; Corcione, Antonio; Petrini, Flavia",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060189/,390
81152,Juvenile Embolic Stroke Complicating COVID-19 Infection.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND To report a new surgical technique for hysterectomy using robotic natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) as a scarless and gasless procedure. METHODS Thirteen consecutive patients with benign uterine disease underwent robotic NOTES hysterectomy at Eulji University Hospital between February 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS Due to the presence of pelvic adhesions, one of these patients underwent hybrid robotic NOTES hysterectomy with the assistance of isobaric single port laparoscopy; however, there was no conversion to another hysterectomy type such as conventional laparoscopy, laparotomy, or traditional multiport robotic surgery. Median uterine weight was 290 g (range 115-892 g). Median docking and console times were 15 min (range 5-25 min) and 135 min (range 92-215 min), respectively. Mean change in hemoglobin on the first postoperative day was 0.67 ± 0.7 g/dL. Median EBL was 50 mL (20-450 mL). Median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (3-4 days). No patients experienced postoperative complications such as damage to adjacent organs, re-operation, or vaginal cuff hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that robotic NOTES hysterectomy is a feasible and safe scarless and gasless surgical technique. It is an effective, minimally invasive vaginal access alternate to NOTES-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or conventional robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery hysterectomy in the surgical management of benign uterine disease. Nevertheless, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine its full clinical application.","Yang, Yun Seok",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07115-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31728751/,390
81314,Safety and efficiency of gasless laparoscopy: a systematic review protocol.,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND Dengue is a significant public health issue that is caused by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. The current vector control methods are unable to effectively reduce Aedes populations and thus fail to decrease dengue transmission. Hence, there is an urgent need for new tools and strategies to reduce dengue transmission in a wide range of settings. In this study, the Mosquito Home System (MHS) and Mosquito Home Aqua (MHAQ) formulations were assessed as commercial autodissemination traps in laboratory and small-scale field trials. METHOD Multiple series of laboratory and small-scale field trials were performed to assess the efficacy of MHS and MHAQ exposed to Ae. aegypti. In the laboratory trials, various parameters such as fecundity, fertility, wing size, oviposition preferences, residual effects, and MHAQ transference to other containers through controlled experiments were tested. For small-scale field trials, the efficacy of the MHS and MHAQ approaches was determined to ascertain whether wild mosquitoes could transfer the MHAQ formulation from MHS stations to ovitraps. RESULTS The data revealed that Ae. aegypti was highly susceptible to low concentrations of MHAQ formulations and had a residual effect of up to 3 months, with MHAQ exposure affecting fecundity, fertility, and mosquito wing size. In the oviposition studies, gravid females strongly preferred the hay infusion compared to tap water and MHAQ during egg-laying in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the use of commercial MHAQ by MHS was highly attractive in field settings compared to conventional ovitraps among local Aedes spp. mosquitoes. In addition, MHAQ horizontal transfer activities in the laboratory and small-scale field trials were demonstrated through larval bioassays. These findings demonstrated the potential of MHAQ to be transferred to new containers in each study site. CONCLUSION This study provided proof of principle for the autodissemination of MHAQ. Through further refinement, this technique and device could become an effective oviposition trap and offer an alternative preventive tool for vector control management.","Mohd Ngesom, Ahmad Mohiddin; Ahmad Razi, Anis; Azizan, Nur Syahirah; Wasi Ahmad, Nazni; Md Lasim, Asmalia; Liang, Yanfeng; Greenhalgh, David; Min, Jasmine Chia Siew; Sahani, Mazrura; Hod, Rozita; Othman, Hidayatulfathi",Parasites & vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04918-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407881/,390

Nineteen AAPs in 16 patients were evaluated. The AAP cumulative functional usage rate tended to drop within a year after its implantation because of infection and inappropriate positioning; however, its usability was extended for a maximum of 97 months after re-implantation. The operative modification of minimal superficial repositioning of the BA anastomosed with the graft significantly improved its usage rate by easing the cannulation via the graft and eliminated usage withdrawal caused by infection and dislocation. Occlusion, thrombus, and ligation of the BA never occurred even after surgical repairs for infectious AAP. The use of an AAP as a shunt-less vascular access could be an alternative to BA superficialization with avoidance of direct BA puncture.","Matsuda, Hiroaki; Oka, Yoshinari; Yoshida, Ryuichi; Katsura, Yuki; Takeuchi, Hidemi; Oyama, Takanori; Takatsu, Shigeko; Miyazaki, Masashi","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-9987.12515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28296208/,390

The emerging data from different countries indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) has intensified since the COVID-19 outbreak. The main purpose of the current study is to find out whether there is any difference in the incidence of IPV during and before the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and whether any sociodemographical factors are related to the incidence of IPV against pregnant women during quarantine. A cross-sectional, correlational design was in this study. The snowball sampling technique was adopted to select the participants, which produced a nonrepresentative sample of 215 pregnant women. The participants completed the Arabic version of the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire Screening Tool (DVQST). We found that women were exposed to different types of IPV before and during the quarantine. The most prevalent form of IPV was control and humiliation (n 172, 80%) and the least prevalent was sexual violence ((n 33, 15.3%), (n 24, 11.2%), respectively). However, there were statistically significant lower DVQST scores during the COVID-19 quarantine than before the quarantine. All types of IPV are significantly correlated with each other and with relationship problems (marital conflict, verbal fighting, understanding each other). While the findings are not generalizable to the general population of pregnant women in Jordan because the sample consisted only of women of high socioeconomic status due to the use of a nonprobability sampling technique, national campaigns should be developed and implemented in order to reduce IPV and change community behaviors and attitudes toward violence against women. It is also recommended that policymakers develop plans to help pregnant women during quarantine by, for example, training care providers on how to access vulnerable women.","Abujilban, Sanaa; Mrayan, Lina; Hamaideh, Shaher; Obeisat, Salwa; Damra, Jalal",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520984259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403908/,390

Respiratory illness caused by atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila may show overlapping manifestations and imaging features with COVID-19 causing clinical and laboratory diagnostic issues. We conducted a prospective study to identify co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria in an Indian tertiary hospital. METHODOLOGY From June 2020 to January 2021, a total of 194 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were also tested for atypical bacterial pathogens. For diagnosing M. pneumoniae, a real-time PCR assay and serology (IgM ELISA) were performed. C. pneumoniae diagnosis was made based on IgM serology. L. pneumophila diagnosis was based on PCR or urinary antigen testing. Clinical and epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria-positive and -negative patient groups were compared. RESULTS Of the 194 patients admitted with COVID-19, 17 (8.8%) were also diagnosed with M. pneumoniae (n=10) or C. pneumoniae infection (n=7). Confusion, headache, and bilateral infiltrate were found more frequently in SARS CoV-2 and atypical bacteria co-infection group. Patients in the M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae co-infection group were more likely to develop ARDS, required ventilatory support, had a longer hospital length of stay, and higher fatality rate compared to patients with only SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION Our report highlights co-infection with bacteria causing atypical pneumonia should be considered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 depending on the clinical context. Timely identification of co-existing pathogens can provide pathogen-targeted treatment and prevent fatal outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.

85112,Perioperative antibiotics in pediatric cardiac surgery: protocol for a systematic review.,2017,"UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) is routinely used in microbiology as a tool to check the optical density (OD) pertaining to the growth stages of microbial cultures at the single wavelength of 600 nm, better known as the OD600 . Typically, modern UV-Visible spectrophotometers can scan in the region of approximately 200-1000 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum, where users do not extend the use of the instrument's full capability in a laboratory. In this work, the full potential of UV-Visible spectrophotometry (multi-wavelength collection) was used to examine bacterial growth phases when treated with antibiotics showcasing the ability to understand the point of resistance when an antibiotic is introduced into the media and therefore understand the biochemical changes of the infectious pathogens. A multi-plate reader demonstrated a high throughput experiment (96 samples) to understand the growth of Escherichia coli when varied concentrations of the antibiotic tetracycline was added into the well plates. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were then used as the data mining techniques to interpret the UV-Visible spectral data and generate machine learning (ML) 'proof of principle' for the UV-Visible spectrophotometer plate reader. Results from this study showed that the PCA analysis provides an accurate yet simple visual classification and the recognition of E.coli samples belonging to each treatment. These data show significant advantages when compared to the traditional OD600 method where we can now understand biochemical changes in the system rather than a mere optical density measurement. Due to the unique experimental setup and procedure that involves indirect use of antibiotics, the same test could be used for obtaining practical information on the type, resistance, and dose of antibiotic necessary to establish the optimum diagnosis, treatment, and decontamination strategies for pathogenic and antibiotic resistant species.

85383,Risk and protective factors for GBV among women and girls living in humanitarian setting: systematic review protocol.,2021-08-28,"BACKGROUND Targeted radionuclide therapy with high-energy beta-emitters is generally considered suboptimal to cure small tumours (<300 mg). Tumour targeting of the CCK2 receptor-binding minigastrin analogue PP-F11 was determined in a tumour-bearing mouse model at increasing peptide amounts. The optimal therapy was analysed for PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y, (177)Lu or (213)Bi, accounting for the radionuclide specific activities (SAs), the tumour absorbed doses and tumour (radio) biology. METHODS Tumour uptake of (111)In-PP-F11 was determined in nude mice bearing CCK2 receptor-transfected A431 xenografts at 1 and 4 h post-injection for escalating peptide masses of 0.03 to 15 nmol/mouse. The absorbed tumour dose was estimated, assuming comparable biodistributions of the (90)Y, (177)Lu or (213)Bi radiolabelled peptides. The linear-quadratic (LQ) model was used to calculate the tumour control probabilities (TCP) as a function of tumour mass and growth. RESULTS Practically achievable maximum SAs for PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y and (177)Lu were 400 MBq (90)Y/nmol and 120 MBq(177)Lu/nmol. Both the large elution volume from the 220 MBq (225)Ac generator used and reaction kinetics diminished the maximum achieved (213)Bi SA in practice: 40 MBq (213)Bi/nmol. Tumour uptakes decreased rapidly with increasing peptide amounts, following a logarithmic curve with ED50 = 0.5 nmol. At 0.03 nmol peptide, the (300 mg) tumour dose was 9 Gy after 12 MBq (90)Y-PP-F11, and for (111)In and (177)Lu, this was 1 Gy. A curative dose of 60 Gy could be achieved with a single administration of 111 MBq (90)Y labelled to 0.28 nmol PP-F11 or with 4 × 17 MBq (213)Bi (0.41 nmol) when its α-radiation relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was assumed to be 3.4. Repeated dosing is preferable to avoid complete tumour receptor saturation. Tumours larger than 200 mg are curable with (90)Y-PP-F11; the other radionuclides perform better in smaller tumours. Furthermore, (177)Lu is not optimal for curing fast-growing tumours. CONCLUSIONS Receptor saturation, specific radiopharmaceutical activities and absorbed doses in the tumour together favour therapy with the CCK2 receptor-binding peptide PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y, despite its longer β-particle range in tissue, certainly for tumours larger than 300 mg. The predicted TCPs are of theoretical nature and need to be compared with the outcome of targeted radionuclide experiments.","Konijnenberg, Mark W; Breeman, Wout A P; de Blois, Erik; Chan, Ho Sze; Boerman, Otto C; Laverman, Peter; Kolenc-Peitl, Petra; Melis, Marleen; de Jong, Marion",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-014-0047-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116111/,390

METHODS We searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane Central and Embase for reference and citation tracking without language restrictions, from inception through 31 July 2018. Paired investigators independently selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eradication therapy with placebo or no treatment for asymptomatic or dyspeptic H. pylori-infected adults with no previous gastric carcinoma. The main outcome was gastric carcinoma incidence; secondary outcomes included gastric carcinoma-specific, non-gastric carcinoma and all-cause mortality. RESULTS A total of 5 population-based and 2 outpatient care-based RCTs involving 7303 adults were eligible. Eradication algorithms were heterogeneous, and unsuccessful eradication and reinfection were frequently observed. A Bayesian meta-analysis with competing risk outcomes found low-certainty evidence that eradication therapy might be more likely than control to reduce gastric carcinoma risk (HR=0.65; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.41 to 1.0; I2 =11%). The CrIs included the null effects across the subgroup and sensitivity analyses, apart from those based on particular models that excluded two RCTs that enrolled subjects with specific histological findings only (HR=0.55; CrI 0.30 to 0.89; I2 =14%). The uncertainty of the average 41% risk reduction in gastric carcinoma-specific mortality included a clinically important mortality risk increase (HR=0.59 favouring eradication therapy; CrI 0.25 to 1.20; I2 =13%; low certainty). CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of eradication therapy in preventing gastric carcinoma in H. pylori-infected, high-risk populations. Rigorously conducted large RCTs of healthy infected adults only would provide evidence of the true efficacy of successful eradication.

Protocol for a systematic review of observational studies employing approaches to improve causal inference.,2021-03-23,"Licensed indications for medicines were designed to regulate the claims that can be made about a medicine by a pharmaceutical company. Off-label prescribing (i.e. prescribing a drug for an indication outside of that for which it is licensed) is legal and an integral part of medical practice. In psychiatry, off-label prescribing is common and gives clinicians scope to treat patients who are refractory to standard therapy or where there is no licensed medication for an indication. However, efficacy or safety of such off-label use may not be established. There is a growing list of licensed indications for atypical antipsychotics (AAP) beyond schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, and also more evidence for other indications where pharmaceutical companies have not obtained a license. Pharmaceutical companies have promoted AAPs for off-label indications to increase sales and consequently have been fined by the US FDA for this. Since the 1990s, AAP use has expanded considerably, for example, the off-label use of quetiapine alone accounted for an estimated 17% of the AAP spend in New Zealand in 2010. There are a number of potential problems with the expanded use of AAPs outside of schizophrenia and related psychoses. A larger population will be exposed to their adverse effects, which include weight gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sudden cardiac death and increased mortality rates in the elderly with dementia. There are also concerns with the abuse of these agents, in particular quetiapine. Given that an increasing percentage of the population is being treated with these agents, off-label prescribing of AAPs is a cause for concern; they have a propensity to cause significant side effects and their efficacy and long-term safety for most off-label indications remains largely unknown, and therefore the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully weighed up prior to prescribing these agents off-label.","McKean, Andrew; Monasterio, Erik",CNS drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/11632030-000000000-00000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22448598/,390

Our objective was to determine whether warmth is analgesic in newborn infants undergoing vaccination-a routine painful hospital procedure. We used a prospective randomized controlled trial of 47 healthy full-term newborn infants. Infants were randomized into 1 of 3 conditions prior to vaccination: warmth exposure, pacifier suckling, or sucrose taste. Crying, grimacing, and heart rate differences were analyzed between groups before, during, and after vaccination as outcome measures. Warmer infants cried significantly less than sucrose taste or pacifier suckling after vaccination. Heart rate patterns reflected this analgesia. Core temperature did not differ between study groups.

Traditional amides are planar and the carbonyl group non-electrophilic due to nN → p*C=O conjugation. In this study, we report electrophilicity scale by exploiting 17O NMR and 15N NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N-C(O) cross-coupling by selective oxidative addition as well as precursors in electrophilic activation of N-C(O) bonds. Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides. These findings should have major implications on the fundamental properties of amide bonds.","Ielo, Laura; Pace, Vittorio; Holzer, Wolfgang; Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Meng, Guangrong; Szostak, Roman; Szostak, Michal",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202003213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668046/,390
87361,Cognitive-behavioural therapy for a variety of conditions: an overview of systematic reviews and panoramic meta-analysis.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND The footwear manufacturing industry is one of the significant sectors of leather businesses in India. In the Indian footwear production industry, there is an enormous potential for employment, export, and development. Kolhapuri footwear is a popular handmade craft in India. It is a well-designed craft used by Indian people for many years. Artisans using traditional tools manufacture this footwear manually. Workers of this craft use traditional methods and work in cottage-based enterprises where organized laws and legislations are not applicable. Therefore, any occupational hazard-related documentation is not available. Due to the nature of the job, workers occupy various apparent non-optimal postures that may cause multiple work-related disorders such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). OBJECTIVE The main objective was to study and assess different footwear manufacturing workstations and working postures. The work further aimed to improve the design of current workstations and evaluate the proposed design using virtual ergonomic assessment techniques. METHODS An anthropometric database for the Kolhapuri footwear making population was developed. This work measured 35 different body dimensions of the footwear manufacturing artisans. Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) was used for postural analysis of the artisans. RESULTS It was observed that the entire footwear making activity was carried out in awkward postures. RULA scores suggested that 'a change in posture' to improve the efficiency of artisans was required for most of the workstations. This work proposed a novel workstation design to reduce the high risk of MSDs. The design was evaluated for thigh clearance, vision analysis and RULA analysis with the help of Digital Human Modelling (DHM). The virtual ergonomics assessment of this design revealed that the vision, thigh clearances, and RULA scores were satisfactory in the new design. CONCLUSION The anthropometric database proposed in this study is likely to be useful in designing Kolhapuri footwear manufacturing tools. The proposed workstation and work layout are helpful to improve the accessibility of required tools and materials to footwear workers. It also helps to reduce occupational risks by easing uncomfortable work positions.","Jadhav, Ganesh Suresh; Arunachalam, M; Salve, Urmi Ravindra",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831216/,390

Organisms capable of forming biofilms tend to be more virulent and have ability of causing chronic infections. Chronic implant associated infections are very difficult to treat, requires a lot of time, money and other resources. Chronic infections produce a lot of morbidity and sometimes mortality to the patient. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old male treated for bilateral acetabular fracture sustained after fall from height due to an episode of seizure. After acetabular surgery, he developed surgical site infection unresponsive to wound wash and intravenous antibiotics. After two weeks, we started treatment with Qurion solution and Vacuum assisted suction (QiVAS) to which patient responded very well and his infection was cured. We are not aware of any study or case report using QiVAS therapy for treatment of infection associated with orthopaedic implant. CONCLUSION Orthopaedic implant related infection can be difficult to treat especially if caused by multidrug resistant organisms capable of forming biofilm. QiVAS therapy is a new method which can be used in such difficult situations to treat infection without removal of implant within short period of time thus reducing morbidity for patients.","Chouhan, Varun",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,https://doi.org/10.13107/jocr.2250-0685.440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28154812/,390

88060,Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 Levels Predict Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Men With Type 2 Diabetes.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT) is widely used to manage focal upper limb spasticity and is effective in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the modified Ashworth scale. Discrimination and quantification of the underlying neural and non-neural components of hyper-resistance may further improve understanding of the effect of BoNT. OBJECTIVE To explore the effects of BoNT on neural (NC), non-neural elastic (EC) and viscous (VC) components of resistance to passive wrist extension in adults with stroke or cerebral palsy, and the association between the effects on wrist hyper-resistance components and clinical spasticity, pain and motor function scales. DESIGN Pre-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention measurements at 6 and 12 weeks. SETTING An outpatient clinic of a hospital. PARTICIPANTS Adults with chronic stroke or cerebral palsy indicated for BoNT treatment for hyper-resistance in the wrist (N = 18). INTERVENTIONS BoNT injections in the wrist and/or finger flexor muscles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Wrist hyper-resistance components, using the NeuroFlexor, and clinical scales (modified Ashworth scale, Tardieu scale, passive wrist extension, pain, Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of the upper extremity, and action research arm test). RESULTS NC was significantly reduced 6 and 12 weeks post-intervention (median -11.96 Newton, p < 0.001 and median -9.34 Newton, p = 0.001, respectively); non-neural EC and VC showed no change. NC reduction 6 weeks post-intervention correlated significantly with BoNT dose (Pearson correlation coefficient rp = -0.56). No significant correlations were found between change scores in wrist hyper-resistance components and clinical scales. CONCLUSIONS BoNT affected the neural component of resistance to passive wrist extension, while leaving the non-neural elastic and viscous components unaffected. This instrumented approach to quantify the effects of BoNT in the wrist and finger flexor muscles on the components of wrist hyper-resistance may have an added value for BoNT treatment evaluation in clinical practice.

88271,Assessment of interprofessional competence in undergraduate health professions education: protocol for a systematic review of self-report instruments.,2020-06-12,"Objective: Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) plays an indispensable role in regulating bile acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism, and alterations of its circulating concentration is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Atherosclerosis is directly related to the death-deriving diabetic macroangiopathy in T2D, yet relationships between FGF19 and atherosclerosis in T2D remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of circulating FGF19 levels with the development of subclinical atherosclerosis (subAS) in patients with T2D in a 3-year prospective study. Methods: In the present study, 153 newly diagnosed T2D patients without subAS were recruited at baseline, and 137 of them completed a 3-year follow-up. FGF19 levels were measured in fasting serum samples collected at baseline and the third-year visits. Carotid, femoral, and iliac intima-media thickness (IMT) were detected by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound to determine the presence of subAS. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the relationship between serum FGF19 and subAS in patients with T2D. Results: At baseline, serum FGF19 levels were positively correlated with carotid IMT and iliac IMT in men (r = 0.239, P = 0.036; r = 0.309, P = 0.006). At the 3-year follow-up, 25 out of 153 patients developed subAS, and FGF19 levels in men were higher in the subAS group than in the non-subAS group [202.7 (177.9-373.6) vs. 133.4 (85.6-171.3) pg/ml, P = 0.028]. Furthermore, in men, higher baseline levels of FGF19 were independently associated with a greater risk of subAS at year 3 in patients with T2D with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.798 per 1 standard deviation (SD) of the FGF19 concentration [OR = 4.798 (95% CI, 1.680-13.706), P = 0.003]. Baseline FGF19 levels yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.769 to predict the development of subAS at year 3 in men with T2D. Conclusions: Serum FGF19 levels could help in predicting the development of atherosclerosis in men with T2D.","Hu, Jingyi; Liu, Zhiwen; Tong, Yue; Mei, Zubing; Xu, Aimin; Zhou, Pengcheng; Chen, Xiaoyan; Tang, Weili; Zhou, Zhiguang; Xiao, Yang",Frontiers in endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528406/,390

One hundred eight burn patients admitted to the Burn Treatment Center were prospectively enrolled from August 2008 to June 2009 and matched 1:2 with historic controls who were admitted from March 2006 to July 2008. Clinical care remained otherwise unchanged; however, several hospital initiatives (the national surgical improvement project, the surgical care improvement project, and a central venous line bundle) were initiated before and during the study. There were significantly less infections in the study population (18.52% of case patients vs 28.70% of control patients had infections, P = .047). Although there was a decrease in each infection subtype analyzed, a statistically significant reduction was only reached for pneumonias (1.85% in cases vs 5.86 in controls, P = .042). Implementation of polyhexamethylene biguanide biocide-impregnated gauze was temporally correlated with a significant decrease in healthcare-associated infections in burn population. As there was no corresponding decrease in wound infections, the impact of the gauze on healthcare-associated infections, if any, cannot be conclusively determined by this study.

An early cascade of physical and structural damaging events starts immediately post-TBI. This primary injury event initiates a series of neuropathological molecular and biochemical secondary injury sequelae, that last much longer and involve disruption of cerebral metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and can lead to neuronal damage and death. Coupled to these events, recent studies have shown that lifestyle factors, including diet, constitute additional risk affecting TBI consequences and neuropathophysiological outcomes. There exists molecular cross-talk among the pathways involved in neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, and behavioral outcomes, that are shared among western diet (WD) intake and TBI pathophysiology. As such, poor dietary intake would be expected to exacerbate the secondary damage in TBI. Hence, the aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiological consequences of WD that can lead to the exacerbation of TBI outcomes. We dissect the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury in this context. We show that currently available data conclude that intake of a diet saturated in fats, pre- or post-TBI, aggravates TBI, precludes recovery from brain trauma, and reduces the response to treatment.","Shaito, Abdullah; Hasan, Hiba; Habashy, Karl John; Fakih, Walaa; Abdelhady, Samar; Ahmad, Fatimah; Zibara, Kazem; Eid, Ali H; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F; Kobeissy, Firas H",EBioMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574954/,390

To increase the scale and efficacy of health promotion practice, culturally responsive approaches to well-being are needed in both communication and practice innovation. This mixed-methods evaluation sought to identify specific mechanisms used in a promising practice model and offers a potential theoretical framework to support public health programs in integrating culture and social justice into communication and intervention programs. Study Design. Rooted at the intersection of ethnographic and phenomenological worldviews, this mixed-methods, retrospective process evaluation used publicly available empirical and experiential data centered on the arts, science, and social justice to identify critical mechanisms used and incorporate them into an emergent theoretical framework. Method. The retrospective process evaluation used an ethnography-informed approach combined with scientific literature reviews. To integrate adjacent ideas into the emergent theoretical framework, a phenomenologically informed theme development approach was used. Results. The evaluation resulted in a five-step framework, called MOTIF, with the potential to be utilized in diverse situational and geographic contexts. Data that surfaced from related literature reviews revealed adjacent mechanisms from positive psychology, critical consciousness theory, and innovation design that were incorporated into the emergent framework.

It can compensate for the lack of trained geriatricians and integrate CGA in different healthcare disciplines leading to better clinical outcomes. This study assessed the usability of a self-administered geriatric assessment smartphone application. METHODS A cross-sectional study included participants from the geriatric clinic at Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. This study was performed in three phases: development and validation of an abbreviated geriatric assessment tool, and validation of the application prototype. Twenty subjects were recruited for pretesting the abbreviated assessment tool, then another 50 patients to validate this tool in a face-to-face interview. Afterwards, another 12 patients completed the prototype followed by a standardized office visit interview. Each assessment domain was evaluated in agreement with a valid reference test during the clinical interview. RESULTS The application was simple and user friendly. The scores of each domain correlated to the reference test scores (rho = 0.59-0.93). Most of the domains exhibited good agreement with the reference tests (kappa = 0.68-1.00) (except for frailty and nutritional assessment). CONCLUSIONS The mHealth geriatric assessment is possible and highly desirable during physical distancing and beyond. Obviously, this approach cannot substitute for clinical examination and multidisciplinary standard CGA. However, it may overcome some barriers facing the geriatrization of medicine. It would help general practitioners to provide pre-CGA evaluation, particularly in areas with limited access to formal geriatric healthcare services.

Objective To analyze if there is an association between the ABO system antigens and susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Material and methods The frequency of ABO system antigens was compared in 73 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 52 clinically healthy donors. Infection severity was assessed by comparing the frequency of antigens by disease severity and mortality. Results The risk of suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection increases in subjects with A vs. non-A antigen (OR = 1.45; 95 % CI: 1.061-1.921). Blood phenotype O reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.686; 95 % CI: 0.522-0.903). No differences were found regarding disease severity.

99854,Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy in simulated pediatric intubation.,2013,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a fibrosing disorder that may develop in patients who have advanced reduction in renal function. A causal relation between gadolinium (Gd(3+))-based contrast agents (Gd-CA) and NSF is probable and is supported by the accumulating data in the literature. From those data, the prevalence of NSF is seen to be significantly higher after exposure to gadodiamide than any other gadolinium-based agent. Gd-CA are either linear or macrocyclic chelates and are available as ionic or non-ionic preparations. The molecular structure, whether cyclic or linear, and the ionicity determine the stability of Gd-CA. Linear chelates are flexible open chains which do not offer a strong binding to Gd(3+). In contrast, the macrocyclic chelates offer a strong binding to Gd(3+) by the virtue of being pre-organised rigid rings of almost optimal size to cage the Gd(3+) atom. Non-ionic preparations are also less stable in comparison to the ionic ones, as the binding between Gd(3+) and the negatively charged carboxyl groups is stronger than that with amides or alcohol in the non-ionic preparations. According to stability constants and kinetic measurements, the most stable Gd-CA is the ionic-macrocyclic chelate Gd-DOTA and the least stable agents are the non-ionic linear chelates gadodiamide and gadoversetamide. The stability of Gd-CA seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of NSF. Gd-CA of low stability are likely to undergo transmetallation and release free Gd ions that may deposit in tissues and attract circulating fibrocytes to initiate the process of fibrosis. There have been no cases of NSF reported in the peer-reviewed literature after the exclusive use of the stable macrocyclic Gd-CA. This minireview covers the clinical and pathological features of NSF and updates the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition.","Morcos, S K; Thomsen, H S",Nephron.

Many such viral vector vaccines are now at various stages of clinical evaluation. Here, we introduce an attenuated form of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a potential chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1, with implications for use as a vaccine vector for other pathogens. The rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vector was attenuated by combining two major genome modifications. These modifications acted synergistically to greatly enhance vector attenuation and the resulting rVSV vector demonstrated safety in sensitive mouse and non-human primate neurovirulence models. This vector expressing HIV-1 gag protein has completed evaluation in two Phase I clinical trials. In one trial the rVSV/HIV-1 vector was administered in a homologous two-dose regimen, and in a second trial with pDNA in a heterologous prime boost regimen. No serious adverse events were reported nor was vector detected in blood, urine or saliva post vaccination in either trial. Gag specific immune responses were induced in both trials with highest frequency T cell responses detected in the prime boost regimen. The rVSV/HIV-1 vector also demonstrated safety in an ongoing Phase I trial in HIV-1 positive participants. Additionally, clinical trial material has been produced with the rVSV vector expressing HIV-1 env, and Phase I clinical evaluation will initiate in the beginning of 2016. In this paper, we use a standardized template describing key characteristics of the novel rVSV vaccine vectors, in comparison to wild type VSV. The template facilitates scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing transparency and comparability of information. The Brighton Collaboration V3SWG template may also be useful as a guide to the evaluation of other recombinant viral vector vaccines.","Clarke, David K; Hendry, R Michael; Singh, Vidisha; Rose, John K; Seligman, Stephen J; Klug, Bettina; Kochhar, Sonali; Mac, Lisa Marie; Carbery, Baevin; Chen, Robert T",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27395563/,390

This may be particularly true of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) and their caregivers - populations already overburdened by intersecting stressors (e.g. psychosocial, biomedical, familial, economic, social, or environmental). Addressing the adverse mental health sequelae of COVID-19 among ALHIV requires a multi-dimensional approach that at once (a) economically empowers ALHIV and their households and (b) trains, mentors, and supervises community members as lay mental health services providers. Mental health literacy programming can also be implemented to increase mental health knowledge, reduce stigma, and improve service use among ALHIV.

METHODS A total of 4262 women with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer treated at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 3858 patients underwent MRM, and 832 (21.6%) of them received postoperative RT (MRM + RT). A total of 404 patients received BCS plus postoperative RT (BCS + RT). All patients received axillary lymph node dissection, while 3.8% of them had upfront sentinel node biopsy. The association of survival outcomes with different surgical modalities (BCS vs. MRM) and the role of RT were evaluated using multivariable proportional hazards regression and confirmed by the propensity score-matching (PSM) method. RESULTS At a median follow-up of 71 months (range of 6-230 months), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the BCS and MRM groups were 96.5 and 92.7%, respectively (P = .001), and the corresponding 5-year disease-free-survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence (LRR) rates were 92.9 and 84.0%, and 2.0 and 7.0% (P = .001), respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that RT was an independent prognostic factor for improved OS (P = .001) and DFS (P = .009), and decreased LRR (P < .001). However, surgery procedure was not independently associated with either OS (P = .495), DFS (P = .204), or LRR (P = .996), which was confirmed by PSM analysis. CONCLUSION Postoperative radiotherapy rather than the surgery procedures was associated with superior survival outcomes in patients with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer.","Sun, Guang-Yi; Wen, Ge; Zhang, Yu-Jing; Tang, Yu; Jing, Hao; Wang, Jian-Yang; Zhang, Jiang-Hu; Yang, Yong; Zhao, Xu-Ran; Chen, Si-Ye; Jin, Jing; Song, Yong-Wen; Liu, Yue-Ping; Fang, Hui; Ren, Hua; Tang, Yuan; Qi, Shu-Nan; Li, Ning; Chen, Bo; Lu, Ning-Ning; Wang, Shu-Lian; Li, Ye-Xiong",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07646-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243177/,390

Given the paucity of evidence to inform otologic and neurotologic best practices during COVID-19, the recommendations herein are based on relevant peer-reviewed articles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 guidelines, United States and international hospital policies, and expert opinion. The suggestions presented here are not meant to be definitive, and best practices will undoubtedly change with increasing knowledge and high-quality data related to COVID-19. Interpretation of this guidance document is dependent on local factors including prevalence of COVID-19 in the surgeons' local community. This is not intended to set a standard of care, and should not supersede the clinician's best judgement when managing specific clinical concerns and/or regional conditions.Access to otologic and neurotologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent upon adequate protection of physicians, audiologists, and ancillary support staff. Otolaryngologists and associated staff are at high risk for COVID-19 disease transmission based on close contact with mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic procedures. While many otologic and neurotologic conditions are not imminently life threatening, they have a major impact on communication, daily functioning, and quality of life. In addition, progression of disease and delay in treatment can result in cranial nerve deficits, intracranial and life-threatening complications, and/or irreversible consequences. In this regard, many otologic and neurotologic conditions should rightfully be considered ""urgent,"" and almost all require timely attention to permit optimal outcomes. It is reasonable to proceed with otologic and neurotologic clinic visits and operative cases based on input from expert opinion of otologic care providers, clinic/hospital administration, infection prevention and control specialists, and local and state public health leaders. Significant regional variations in COVID-19 prevalence exist; therefore, physicians working with local municipalities are best suited to make determinations on the appropriateness and timing of otologic and neurotologic care.","Kozin, Elliott D; Remenschneider, Aaron K; Blevins, Nikolas H; Jan, Taha A; Quesnel, Alicia M; Chari, Divya A; Kesser, Bradley W; Weinstein, Jaqueline E; Ahsan, Syed F; Telischi, Fred F; Adunka, Oliver F; Weber, Peter; Knoll, Renata M; Coelho, Daniel H; Anne, Samantha; Franck, Kevin H; Marchioni, Daniele; Barker, Frederick G; Carter, Bob S; Lustig, Lawrence R; Bojrab, Dennis I; Bhansali, Sanjay A; Westerberg, Brian D; Lundy, Larry; Jackler, Robert K; Roland, J Thomas; Chandrasekhar, Sujana S; Antonelli, Patrick J; Carey, John P; Welling, D Bradley; Slattery, William H; Lee, Daniel J","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826772/,390

Positive shifts includes sub-themes: (a) philosophy, (b) instruction, assessment and curriculum, (c) collaboration, and (d) respect. Backsliding includes sub-themes: (a) wellness team functioning, (b) the loss of PD and collaboration time, and (c) reduced data collection. New directions includes sub-themes: (a) mastery learning, (b) during school physical activity, (c) stress, and (d) administrative support. The factors that were institutionalized were quality physical education leadership roles, change in teachers' philosophies that influenced their instruction and assessment, and garnered administrative support.

Our aim is to provide guidance for urologists to help prioritize urologic cancer surgeries. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed published literature on bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), penile cancer, testis cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, and adrenal cancer. RESULTS For muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), delays should be less than roughly 10 weeks and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered. For non-MIBC, patients should be counseled appropriately based on risk and intravesical therapies can continue. UTUC should also be treated with minimal delays for high risk patients, especially with ureteral tumors. Surgery for T1 renal cancers when indicated can be delayed until adequate resources are available. Patients with T2 renal cancer should be considered for early surgery if there are unfavorable pre-operative characteristics. Higher stage renal tumors should be considered for early surgery. Early multi-disciplinary approach is recommended for metastatic renal cancers. High risk prostate cancer may need preferential treatment and consideration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Penile cancer can have worse sexual or oncologic outcome with prolonged surgical delay. Likewise, adrenal cancer is aggressive and needs early surgical treatment. Testicular cancer should be treated in a timely manner with surgery or chemotherapy, as indicated. CONCLUSIONS This review should further assist urologists in recognizing patients with potentially aggressive tumor biology that warrant early treatment.","Tachibana, Isamu; Ferguson, Ethan L; Mahenthiran, Ashorne; Natarajan, Jay P; Masterson, Timothy A; Bahler, Clinton D; Sundaram, Chandru P",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692934/,390

Given the collapse of hospital care in Manaus in January 2021 and the results of three recent preprints, each that reports increased transmissibility of the P.1 variant, we propose some urgent measures. Genomic surveillance based on multi-step diagnostics, starting with RT-PCR type tests and up to sequencing, should be established. Efforts to identify reinfections associated with this variant and the update of its definition in protocols should be prioritized, and studies on the efficacy of currently available vaccines in Brazil concerning the new variant should be conducted. We also propose improving the Brazilian health surveillance system such that genomic surveillance is coordinated and thereby better able to respond to future emergencies in a more timely fashion. We call on the public agents involved in health surveillance to share data and information regarding the epidemic in a clear, fast and transparent way.

OBJECTIVES To measure changes in patients' utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6 months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. RESULTS A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, ±13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study. Utilization of exercise therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.57), massage therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83), and spinal manipulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93) decreased during the pandemic. A reduction in NSAID use was also observed (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). Participants reported a significant, but not clinically relevant, improvement in low back pain intensity during the pandemic (mean improvement, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; Cohen's d, 0.11). However, White participants reported a significant improvement in low back pain intensity (mean improvement, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46), whereas Black participants did not (mean improvement, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.19; p for interaction=0.03). Overall, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain interference with activities (mean improvement, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.20-2.02; Cohen's d, 0.20). The use of NSAIDs during the pandemic was associated with marginal increases in low back pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS Overall, decreased utilization of treatments for chronic low back pain did not adversely impact pain and functioning outcomes during the first 6 months of the pandemic. However, Black participants experienced significantly worse pain outcomes than their White counterparts.","Licciardone, John C",Journal of osteopathic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33770828/,390

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2019 and 2021, the Web of Science (WoS) All Databases collection was searched for publications related to COVID-19 and Urology. The keywords used during this search were coronavirus-19, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, pandemic, and/or urology. The top 50 cited (T50) publications were also identified and summarized. Exported Microsoft Excel files, Visualization of Similarities viewer (VOSviewer) software, and descriptive assessment were used for bibliometric and statistical analyses of the publications. RESULTS In total, 582 publications related to COVID-19 and urology were identified. In these publications, the most active author, journal, country, and organization were Francesco Porpiglia, European Urology, the United States of America (USA), and La Paz University Hospital, respectively.

106699,Depth of anaesthesia monitoring during procedural sedation and analgesia: a systematic review protocol.,2015,"The reproductive tract in avian females is sensitive to hormonal regulation. Exogenous estrogen induces immature oviduct development to improve egg production after molting. In this process, regressed female reproductive tract is regenerated in response to the secretion of estrogen. However, there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of the avian female reproductive system. In our previous study, results from microarray analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins is affected during molting. Herein, we artificially induced the molting period in chickens through a zinc-containing diet. Subsequently, changes in the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins were confirmed in the oviduct tissue. The levels of MUC5B, ORM1, RTBDN, and TENP mRNA were significantly high in the oviduct, and the genes were repressed in the regression phase, whereas these were expressed in the recrudescence phase, particularly in the luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium of the oviduct, during molting. Moreover, we observed that gene expression was induced in the magnum, the site for the secretion of egg white components. Next, differences in expression levels of the four genes in normal and cancerous ovaries were compared. Collectively, results suggest that the four selected genes are expressed in the female chicken reproductive tract in response to hormonal regulation, and egg white protein-encoding genes may serve as modulators of the reproductive system in hens.","Lee, Minkyeong; Yang, Changwon; Song, Gwonhwa; Lim, Whasun",Reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-20-0342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985412/,390
106866,A Lesson From 2020: Public Health Matters for Both COVID-19 and Diabetes.,2021-01-01,"Object: The pipeline embolization device (PED) has been used to treat non-saccular, unruptured, intradural vertebral artery aneurysms at some institutions. However, there is an absence of large controlled studies validating the feasibility of this treatment. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic feasibility of PED by comparing PED treatment with controlled stent-assisted coiling (SAC). Materials and Methods: Thirty-two PED procedures were matched in a 1:2 manner with 64 SAC procedures based on patient age, sex, aneurysm size, and aneurysm location. Technical factors, procedural complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in technical factors and procedural complications between the two groups (PED vs. SAC, 9.4 vs. 4.7%, P = 0.397). In multivariate analysis, smoking and therapeutic modality were identified as independent predictors of occlusion. Smoking was a risk factor for aneurysm obliteration [hazard ratio (HR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.89; P = 0.018]. Aneurysms treated with PED were more likely to achieve obliteration over time compared with aneurysms treated with SAC (HR 2.97; 95% CI, 1.79-4.93; P < 0.001). The rate of favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 0-2) was similar between the two groups (PED vs. SAC, 100 vs. 96.9%, P = 0.551). In the SAC group, one patient had neurological deficit with an mRS of four at the latest follow-up. There was no mortality in either group. Conclusions: The PED and SAC groups showed similar technical factors, procedural complications, angiographic results, and favorable clinical outcomes.

106922,Lipid emulsion treatment as an antidote for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity.,2021-04-01,"Background Early life exposures impact immune system development and therefore the risk of immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We systematically reviewed the impact of pre-, peri‑, and postnatal exposures up to the age of five years on subsequent IBD diagnosis. Methods We identified case-control and cohort studies reporting on the association between early life environmental factors and Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), or IBD overall. Databases were search from their inception until May 24th, 2019 until July 14th, 2020. We conducted meta-analyses for quantitative review of relevant risk factors that were comparable across studies and qualitative synthesis of the literature for a wide range of early life exposures, including maternal health and exposures during pregnancy, perinatal factors, birth month and related-factors, breastfeeding, hygiene-related factors and social factors, immigration, antibiotics, offspring health, including infections, and passive smoking. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019134980. Findings Prenatal exposure to antibiotics (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.5) and tobacco smoke (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.9), and early life otitis media (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.6) were associated with IBD. There was a trend towards an association between exposure to antibiotics in infancy and IBD (OR: 1.7, 95% CI 0.97, 2.9), supported by positive data on population-based data. Breastfeeding was protective against IBD. Other early life risk factors had no association with IBD, but data were limited and heterogenous. Interpretation Early life is an important period of susceptibility for IBD development later in life. Tobacco smoke, infections and antibiotics were associated positively, and breastfeeding was associated negatively with IBD. Our findings offer an opportunity to develop primary prevention strategies.

We enrolled 28 patients with acute CSC, 42 patients with chronic CSC, and 40 healthy controls. The presence of ARAs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey retina as an antigen substrate, while the presence of AECAs was determined using cultivated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primate skeletal muscle according to the manufacturer's instructions (Euroimmun AG). There were no differences in the prevalence of antibodies against rods, cones, cytoplasmic components of retinal nuclear layer cells, and retinal vessels between the acute and chronic CSC groups and the control group (P = 0.27, P = 0.16, P = 0.71, and P = 0.06, respectively). However, AECAs reactive with HUVECs were observed in 46% of patients with acute CSC, 45% of those with chronic CSC, and 22% of controls, whereas AECAs reactive with the skeletal muscle were present in 46%, 45%, and 15%, respectively (difference between groups: P = 0.045 for HUVECs and P = 0.005 for the skeletal muscle). Furthermore, AECA titers were higher in CSC patients than in controls (P = 0.004). This study provides evidence for the possible involvement of an autoimmune process directed against vessel antigens in the pathogenesis of CSC. AECAs may be more important than ARAs in this disease and may be involved in endothelial damage in the choroidal vessels and choriocapillaris, leading to hyperpermeability, which is central to the pathophysiology of CSC.","Karska-Basta, I; Pociej-Marciak, W; Chrzaszcz, M; Wilanska, J; Jager, M J; Markiewicz, A; Romanowska-Dixon, B; Sanak, M; Kubicka-Trzaska, A",Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.26402/jpp.2020.2.07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633241/,390

An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.","Coates, Wendy C; Yarris, Lalena M; Smith, Teresa Y",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616978/,390
109186,Leading Through the Unknown: A Network Perspective of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"COVID-19 manifests as a mild disease in most people but can progress to severe disease in nearly 20% of individuals. Disease progression is likely driven by a cytokine storm, either directly stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 or by increased systemic inflammation in which the gut might play an integral role. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the gut may cause increased intestinal permeability, alterations to the fecal microbiome, and increased inflammatory cytokines. Each effect may lead to increased systemic inflammation and the transport of cytokines and inflammatory antigens from the gut to the lung. Few interventions are being studied to treat people with mild disease and prevent the cytokine storm. Serumderived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) may prevent progression by (1) binding and neutralizing inflammatory antigens, (2) decreasing gut permeability, (3) interfering with ACE2 binding by viral proteins, and (4) improving the fecal microbiome. SBI is therefore a promising intervention to prevent disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Utay, Netanya S; Asmuth, David M; Gharakhanian, Shahin; Contreras, Moises; Warner, Christopher D; Detzel, Christopher J",Drug development research,https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110032/,390
109372,COVID-19 and Diabetes: A Collision and Collusion of Two Diseases.,2020-09-16,"PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was first described in 1999. Many techniques using newer instruments have emerged but none has been standardized. We describe our technique and experience, using non-articulating instruments with conventional trocars. METHOD Patients who underwent SILC over 2 years (July 2009-July 2011) were included in the study group. All consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies done during the same period by the same surgeon were included in the control group. Demographic data, previous abdominal surgeries, bile spillage, conversion, and duration of surgery were analyzed. RESULTS Seventy patients underwent SILC while 115 patients had laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ninety-three percent of SILCs were done in women as compared to 68 % in the control group (p < 0.0001). More SILC patients were younger (65 % were 30-50 years old) as compared to control patients (40 % were 50-70 years old, p < 0.001). The mean duration of SILC was 68 ± 2.15 min as compared to 66 ± 6.27 min in controls (p < .0001). Of the initial 20 SILC, nine required insertion of additional instruments and one was converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The subsequent 50 cases of SILC had only one conversion (p = 0.001). In the first 20 SILC, one patient (out of three) with BMI above 35 kg/m(2) required conversion to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one required insertion of an additional instrument. In the subsequent 50 cases, all the six patients with BMI above 35 (up to 40) were operated on successfully without any additional instrument insertion or conversion. CONCLUSIONS SILC has a learning curve. Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, and cholecystitis, age less than 75 years, and BMI <40 can undergo SILC. With experience, SILC using conventional laparoscopy instruments has comparable outcomes to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in properly selected patients and is economical.","Chaudhary, Sushant; Bhullar, Jasneet Singh; Subhas, Gokulakkrishna; Mittal, Vijay K; Kolachalam, Ramachandra",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-2102-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23188225/,390

Theses substrates were incubated in the following proportions: B100 (B100%), B85E15 (B85% + E15%), B85G15 (B85% + G15%), B85GE15 (B85% + G7.5% + E7.5%), and B70GE30 (B70% + G15% + E15%). Dry matter degradation (DMD), volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, and CH4 production were measured at 12, 24, and 48 h of incubation. Experimental design was a randomized complete block. At 48-h incubation, DMD ranged between 46.5 and 51.2% (P = 0.0015). The lowest cumulative gas production (CGP) was observed in B85E15 and B85G15 (160 mL CGP/g organic matter, on average). At 48 h, B85G15 and B100 produced 28.8 and 30.2 mg CH4/g DMD, respectively, while B85E15 or the mixtures, 33.5 mg CH4/g DMD, on average (P ≤ 0.05). B85E15 and B70G30 had the highest concentration of total VFA (P ≤ 0.05). Results showed that B85E15 and B70GE30 favor DMD and increased total production of VFA and CH4 at 48 h.

Docking analysis may be an important tool in the research for the development of more effective agents against specific drug targets or multitarget agents 1-3. METHODS In the present study, based on docking analysis, ten tetrahydrothiazolo[2,3-a]isoindole derivatives were chosen for evaluation of antimicrobial activity. RESULTS All compounds showed antibacterial activity against eight Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial species being in some cases, more potent than ampicillin and streptomycin against all species. The most sensitive bacteria appeared to be S. aureus, and En. cloacae while M. flavus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa were the most resistant ones. The compounds were also tested for their antifungal activity against eight fungal species. All compounds exhibited good antifungal activity better than reference drugs bifonazole (1.4 - 41 folds) and ketoconazole (1.1 - 406 folds) against all fungal species. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action docking studies on different antimicrobial targets were performed. CONCLUSION According to docking analysis, the antifungal activity can be explained by the inhibition of the CYP51 enzyme for most of the compounds with better correlation of the results obtained for the P.v.c. strain (linear regression between estimated binding Energy and log(1/MIC) with R 2 =0.867 and p=0.000091 or R 2 = 0.924, p= 0.000036, when compound 3 is excluded.

113011,Frailty measurement and outcomes in interventional studies: protocol for a systematic review of randomised control trials.,2017,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are major contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Routine serological diagnosis and surveillance play an important role in the prevention of PRDC, as it is a leading cause of economic losses to the swine industry. We herein describe an advanced microsphere-based immunoassay that permits the simultaneous detection of antibodies to PCV2 and PRRSV, thereby reducing the time and effort involved in testing. Recombinant PRRSV nucleoprotein antigen and the PCV2 capsid antigen were coupled to fluorophore-dyed beads with distinct spectral addresses. Weekly serum samples from 72 pigs that were experimentally exposed to either PCV2, PRRSV, or both PCV2 and PRRSV were used to validate the microbead assay (MBA) in comparison with the ""gold standard"" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The kinetics of the PCV2- and PRRSV-specific antibody responses measured by the microbead assay were comparable to those of the standard assays; Spearman's rank correlations were 0.72 (P < 0.001) for PRRSV and 0.80 (P < 0.001) for PCV2. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined using field sera whose positive or negative status was determined by the standard tests. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were both 98% for PCV2 and were 91% and 93%, respectively, for PRRSV (kappa coefficients, 0.85 and 0.67 for PCV2 and PRRSV, respectively). Multiplexing did not interfere with assay performance or diagnostic sensitivity. Therefore, the described study demonstrates proof of concept for the development of more versatile and economical microbead array-based multiplex serological test panels for veterinary use.","Lin, Kathy; Wang, Chong; Murtaugh, Michael P; Ramamoorthy, Sheela",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00557-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21734031/,390

This study examines medication use and anticholinergic burden (ACB) among a cohort of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. METHOD This cross-sectional study involving five Aboriginal communities (two in metropolitan Sydney and three on the mid-north coast of New South Wales) used a structured interview process to assess cognition, depression, and activities of daily living for a cohort of older adults (aged 60 years and over). Participants also reported on their health status, medical history, and prescription medications during the interview. ACB was calculated, and its association with adverse health outcomes including cognitive impairment, falls, hospitalization, and depressive symptoms were examined. RESULTS Most participants (95%) were taking at least one regular medication with polypharmacy (≥5 medications) observed in 43% of participants; 12.2% had a significant ACB (≥3) with antidepressants being a major contributor. Anticholinergic medication use was associated with cognitive impairment, recent hospitalization (past 12 months), and depressive symptoms. After controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, only the presence of depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with the use of anticholinergic medication (odds ratio 2.86; 95% confidence interval 1.48-5.51). CONCLUSIONS Clinically significant ACB was common in older Aboriginal Australians and was largely attributable to inappropriate use of tricyclic antidepressants. Greater awareness of medication-related risk factors among both health care professionals and Aboriginal communities can play an important role in improving health and quality of life outcomes.","Mate, Karen; Kerr, Karen; Priestley, Alison; Weaver, Natasha; Broe, Gerald A; Daylight, Gail; Draper, Brian; Cumming, Robert; Robinson-Kingi, Hemi; Delbaere, Kim; Radford, Kylie",International psychogeriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s104161022000174x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985391/,390

Among Latinas, interpersonal violence is also highly prevalent however the wide variation of interpersonal prevalence rates among Latinas is problematic. The aims of this systematic review of the literature were to (1) document the prevalence rates of violence among Latinas, (2) determine the types of violence that Latinas are most impacted by, and (3) assess the prevalence rates of interpersonal across Latina subethnicities. The research was based on seven databases including PsycArticles, PsycCRITIQUES, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Social Services Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, and PubMED for articles published from January 2007 up to July 2017. The following key words were used in the search: (Latinas OR Latinos OR Hispanics) AND (victim OR victimization) AND (domestic violence OR intimate partner violence OR Interpersonal Violence). We identified 41 articles in our search that reported rates of interpersonal violence which ranged from 1% to 83% with intimate partner violence and domestic violence being the most prevalent. Interpersonal violence was found to be more prevalent among individuals who identified as Mexican. Based on the findings, it is clear that efforts should be focused on conducting a lager national survey of interpersonal violence among Latinas.

Although data is limited on the scale of health care worker (HCW) displacement in conflict zones, it is widely acknowledged that conflict conditions result in the displacement of a significant portion of qualified HCWs from their country of origin. While voluntary HCW return is integral to health system rebuilding in conflict-affected and post-conflict settings, there has been little exploration of the nature of national or international policies which encourage HCW return and reintegration to their home countries in the post-conflict period. METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify policies and policy recommendations intended to facilitate the return of displaced HCWs to their home countries and acknowledge their contribution to rebuilding the post-conflict health system. We searched three bibliographic databases and a range of organisational and national health agency websites to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published in English or Arabic between 1 January 1990 to 24 January 2021, and extracted relevant information. We classified policies and policy recommendations using an adapted version of the UNHCR 4Rs Framework. RESULTS We identified nine peer-review articles and four grey literature reports that fit our inclusion criteria, all of which were published in English. These covered issues of repatriation (n = 3), reintegration (n = 2), health system rehabilitation and reconstruction (n = 2); six documents covered several of these themes. Information was available for nine conflict contexts: Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Namibia, Northern Uganda, South Sudan, Timor Leste, and Zimbabwe. Findings demonstrate that health system rebuilding and rehabilitation serve as precursors and reinforcers of the successful return, repatriation, and reintegration of displaced HCWs. CONCLUSIONS Despite the significant numbers of HCWs displaced by conflict, this study identified few specific policies and limited information explicitly focused on the repatriation and reintegration of such workers to their home country in the post-conflict period. Additional research is needed to understand the particular barriers faced by conflict-displaced HCWs in returning to their home country. Conflict-affected and post-conflict states should develop policies and initiatives that address factors within and beyond the health sector to encourage displaced HCW return and provide sustainable reintegration solutions for those who return to post-conflict health systems.","Rayes, Diana; Meiqari, Lana; Yamout, Rouham; Abbara, Aula; Nuwayhid, Iman; Jabbour, Samer; Abouzeid, Marian",Conflict and health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-021-00367-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962634/,390
114402,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Diabetes and COVID-19 in Association With Glucose-Lowering Medication.,2020-05-14,"Myelination is a sequential process that is tightly controlled by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Any CNS disease in which the neuronal myelin sheath is damaged is referred to as demyelinating disease. The present work was designed to study the histopathological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical changes in rat brain, mainly corpus callosum (CC), following oral administration of cuprizone (CPZ), and the role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in reducing these changes. Demyelination was induced by CPZ administration for short (4Ws) and long (8Ws) periods. NAC was given concomitantly and sequentially for similar periods. Spontaneous recovery after cessation of CPZ followed by no medication was also investigated. At the end of each experimental period, both cerebral hemispheres were extracted and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination and immuno-histochemical study. The obtained results showed a direct proportion between the duration of CPZ administration and the severity of demyelination. The co-administration of CPZ and NAC, had a fair protective impact that was stronger than the sequential administration of the two drugs. Incomplete spontaneous remyelination was observed after cessation of CPZ, being more evident in short than in long period group, indicating that when CPZ administration is prolonged, remyelination is delayed. In the light of the above results, it could be concluded that NAC has neuroprotective effects and has the potential to be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis; however, treatment should begin as soon as the disease manifests.","El Sharouny, S H; Shaaban, M H; Elsayed, R M; Tahef, A W; Abd ElWahed, M K",Folia morphologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fm.a2021.0044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954959/,390

However, the mechanism by which RBCs binding virus remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a kind of coronavirus, could hijack RBCs and cause typical diarrhea in neonatal piglets. In an epidemiology investigation of PEDV, the RBCs samples from diarrheic pigs in several pig farms were found to be PEDV-positive. PEDV could bind to neonatal RBCs through CD71 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and its viability was maintained for 12 h. PEDV-loaded RBCs could transfer the virus to CD3+ T cells by conjugation and reach the intestine mucosa, where it caused infection. Finally, a further animal challenge revealed that transfusing with PEDV-loaded RBCs could cause intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) infection and typical diarrhea symptom. Therefore, our studies illustrated the mechanism by which PEDV could cause intestinal infection through hijacking RBCs, further providing a novel insight into the role of RBCs as potential cells for viral transmission in coronavirus pathogenesis.","Li, Jianda; Yuan, Chen; Liu, Peng; Li, Yuchen; Zhang, Penghao; Yang, Qian",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901803/,390

METHODS Considering the evolution of school health education, we examine the significance of health literacy in our society and schools in contemporary times. RESULTS We must take a critical look at a place for education for health literacy and why it should be an innovative path in adaptive, reimagined, and revitalized schools.

Aging of the population has implications for care provision across the care continuum, particularly for people living with frailty. Despite known risks associated with frailty, there has been limited research on care pathways that address the needs of persons living with frailty. Our study aims to review and examine, in a rigorous way, the quality of evidence for multi-component interventions and care pathways focused on frailty. METHODS A comprehensive electronic search strategy will be used to identify studies that evaluate multi-component interventions or care pathways for persons living with frailty. The search strategy will include terms for frailty, multi-component interventions, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness applied to the following databases: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. An adapted search for Google Scholar and gray literature databases will also be used. References of included studies will be hand-searched for additional citations of frailty-inclusive care. Known experts and corresponding authors of identified articles will be contacted by email to identify further eligible studies. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Data will be extracted from eligible studies and it is anticipated that narrative analysis will be used. If studies with sufficient homogeneity are found, then pooled effects will be reported using meta-analysis.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study between October 2010 and December 2017. Transvaginal mesh surgery was performed in patients with symptomatic anterior and/or apical prolapse (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification ≥ stage 2). The primary outcome was rate of severe surgical complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (defined as grade ≥3), and the secondary outcome was the anatomical success at the last postoperative follow-up visit. RESULTS Three hundred and ninety-six patients were included, 289 of these patients underwent anterior sacrospinous fixation with uterine preservation, 50 had a previous hysterectomy and 57 underwent a concomitant hysterectomy. The median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range, 7 months). The rate of severe complications was 2.1%, 6.0%, and 5.3% in the uterine preservation group, previous hysterectomy group, and concomitant hysterectomy group, respectively (P = 0.2). The operative time was significantly higher in the concomitant hysterectomy group, and the mesh exposure rate was significantly higher in the previous hysterectomy group. The overall recurrence rate was 7.6%, with no differences between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS Concomitant and previous hysterectomy did not appear to increase the severe complication rate or anatomical failure after transvaginal mesh surgery. However, a history of hysterectomy appears to be a risk factor for vaginal mesh exposure. This must be considered in the choice between prosthetic and autologous management options for the treatment of posthysterectomy vault prolapse.","Breton, Florence; Abdirahman, Syad; Fatton, Brigitte; Calletwaert, Geertje; de Tayrac, Renaud; Allegre, Lucie",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000001006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411457/,390

Laparoscopic repair of incisional ventral hernia has been conducted recently, and the advantages of this procedure have been reported. However, in large orifice cases, the recurrence rate is increased. To improve recurrence rates in large cases, a hybrid method combining laparoscopic primary closure and mesh repair can be applied. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Monofilament thread was inserted into the abdominal cavity for hernia closure and pulled from the other side of the orifice. The same procedure was performed from the upper side to the lower side without closure, and all thread was placed in line. Both sides of the thread were then introduced to the midline of the incision through a subcutaneous route. This procedure was conducted with an introducer. All threads were tied, and then a mesh was placed. DISCUSSION Hybrid techniques already combine mini-laparotomy for hernia closure and subsequent laparoscopic intraoperative onlay mesh for reinforcement, but such techniques require laparotomy. In our technique, closure of the linea alba does not require laparotomy. All procedures were performed laparoscopically. This procedure is very easy and safe, and does not require the abdominal cavity to be opened. Thus, hybrid methods are effective for treating cases of incisional hernia involving a large orifice.","Yoshikawa, Kozo; Shimada, Mitsuo; Kurita, Nobuhiro; Sato, Hirohiko; Iwata, Takashi; Higashijima, Jun; Chikakiyo, Motoya; Nishi, Masaaki; Kashihara, Hideya; Takasu, Chie; Matsumoto, Noriko; Eto, Syohei",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25131330/,390

To understand the drug mode of action at the submicroscopic level (atoms and molecules), molecular modeling studies with the aid of computational chemistry methods have been of great help. A fundamental step in such theoretical investigations is the knowledge of the predominant drug molecular structure in solution, which is the real environment for the interaction with biological targets. Our strategy to access this valuable information is to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 1H NMR chemical shifts for several plausible molecular conformers and then find the best match with experimental NMR profile in solution (since it is extremely sensitive to conformational changes). Through this procedure, after optimizing 30 trial distinct molecular structures (ωB97x-D/6-31G(d,p)-PCM level of calculation), which may be considered representative conformations, we concluded that the global minimum (named M24), stabilized by an intramolecular N-H hydrogen bond, is not likely to be observed in water, chloroform, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. Among fully optimized conformations (named M1 to M30, and MD1 and MD2), we found M12 (having no intramolecular H-bond) as the most probable structure of CQ and HCQ in water solution, which is a good approximate starting geometry in drug-receptor interaction simulations. On the other hand, the preferred CQ and HCQ structure in chloroform (and CQ in DMSO-d6) solution was assigned as M8, showing the solvent effects on conformational preferences. We believe that the analysis of 1H NMR data in solution can establish the connection between the macro level (experimental) and the sub-micro level (theoretical), which is not so apparent to us and appears to be more appropriate than the thermodynamic stability criterion in conformational analysis studies.","Hernandes, Isabel S; Da Silva, Haroldo C; Dos Santos, Hélio F; De Almeida, Wagner B",The journal of physical chemistry.

Capsid particles are formed inside the cell cytosol by multimerization of core protein subunits and ultimately exported in an uncommon coatless state. Here, we investigated potential roles of Rab GTPases in capsid formation and trafficking by using RNA interference and overexpression studies. Naked capsid release does not require functions of the endosome-associated Rab5, Rab7 and Rab27 proteins, but depends on functional Rab33B, a GTPase participating in autophagosome formation via interaction with the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 complex. During capsid formation, Rab33B acts in conjunction with its effector, as silencing of Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16L1 also impaired capsid egress. Analysis of capsid maturation steps revealed that Rab33B and Atg5/12/16L1 are required for proper particle assembly and/or stability. In support, the capsid protein was found to interact with Atg5 and colocalize with Atg5/12/16L1, implicating that autophagy pathway functions are involved in capsid biogenesis. However, a complete and functional autophagy pathway is dispensable for capsid release, as judged by knockdown analysis of Atg8/LC3 family members and pharmaceutical ablation of canonical autophagy. Experiments aimed at analysing the capsid release-stimulating activity of the Alix protein provide further evidence for a link between capsid formation and autophagy.","Döring, Tatjana; Prange, Reinhild",Cellular microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439980/,390

Impella is currently the most common PVAD and actively pumps blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. PVADs unload the left ventricle, increase cardiac output and improve coronary perfusion. PVADs are typically placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory under fluoroscopic guidance via the femoral artery when feasible. In cases of severe peripheral arterial disease, PVADs can be implanted through an alternative access. In this article, we summarize the mechanism of action of PVAD and the data supporting their use in the treatment of cardiogenic shock.","Nandkeolyar, Shuktika; Velagapudi, Poonam; Basir, Mir B; Bharadwaj, Aditya S",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180879/,390

MATERIALS AND METHODS TRRP was performed in two fresh male cadavers (prostate volume 46 and 30 mL). In the first procedure we used four laparoscopic transvesical trocars and in the second a single-port device was placed percutaneously into the bladder. Pneumovesicum was established in both cases and the da Vinci-S robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used for the TRRP. All steps of the procedure, including dissection of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens, ligation of prostatic pedicles, release of neurovascular bundles, apical dissection, urethral transection, and urethro-vesical anastomosis, were done transvesically and robotically. Real time transrectal ultrasonography monitoring was used in the first cadaver. RESULTS Both procedures were technically successful transvesically with no need for additional ports or conversion to standard laparoscopy. The operative duration for the multi-port procedure was 3 h and for the single-port procedure was 4.2 h. Clashing of the da Vinci arms was the primary technical difficulty with the single-port procedure, but did not occur in the multi-port procedure. CONCLUSIONS TRRP under pneumovesicum is technically feasible using multiple-port or a single-port approach in the cadaver. The clinical application of this novel approach is imminent. Further refinement of technique and instruments might lead to an increasing role of percutaneous intraluminal surgery in various surgical disciplines.","Desai, Mihir M; Aron, Monish; Berger, Andre; Canes, David; Stein, Robert; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Kamoi, Kazumi; Crouzet, Sebastien; Sotelo, Rene; Gill, Inderbir S",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2008.08004.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990136/,390

METHODS The literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Web-of Science, and the Chinese databases Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. All CAP etiological studies on children under 5 y of age from China published in Chinese and English between the years of 2001 and 2015 were included. A total of 48 studies were included in the final review, comprising 100 151 hospitalized children with CAP episodes. Heterogeneity and the percentage of variation between studies was analyzed based on Q statistic and I2 indices, respectively. Random effect models were used to calculate the weighted average rate in all analyses. RESULTS The most frequently detected bacterial agents were Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.2%), Escherichia coli (5.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.9%), Haemophilus influenza (3.6%) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (3.3%). The most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (20.3%, in just 2 studies), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 17.3%), human bocavirus (9.9%), parainfluenza virus (5.8%), human metapneumovirus (3.9%) and influenza (3.5%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were identified in 9.5% and 2.9%, respectively, of children under 5 y of age with CAP. CONCLUSION This article provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the factors contributing to CAP in children under 5 y of age. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and influenza were the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in children. Corresponding, vaccines should be introduced into Chinese immunization programs, and further economic evaluations should be conducted. RSV is common in Chinese children and preventative measures could have a substantial impact on public health. These data also have major implications for diagnostic strategies and empirical treatments.","Ning, Guijun; Wang, Xuxia; Wu, Dan; Yin, Zundong; Li, Yixing; Wang, Huaqing; Yang, Weizhong",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1371381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922613/,390

Our study aims at evaluating the occurrence and expression of five SE genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, and see) in S. aureus previously isolated from broiler carcasses. Besides that, it also presents an in vitro analysis of the effects of sodium chloride and temperature on the levels of transcriptional expression. A total of 30 S. aureus isolates were investigated for the presence of SEs by PCR assay. The expression level and the effects of sodium chloride (2.5% NaCl), as well as temperature (8 ºC and 12 ºC), on the transcriptional expression, were evaluated by a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Twelve isolates carried at least one of the SE genes. Among them, five representative isolates presented transcriptional expression for at least one gene. Both sodium chloride and low temperatures interfered with the expression of the SE genes, decreasing their values. However, one isolate displayed relative expression 2.25 times higher for sed gene than S. aureus FRI 361 in optimal conditions (p < 0.05), demonstrating their toxigenic potential even under salt stress. There was no evidence of enterotoxin gene expression at 8 ºC.","Lopes, Graciela Volz; Bastos, Caroline Peixoto; da Silva, Wladimir Padilha",Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],https://doi.org/10.1007/s42770-021-00544-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151408/,390

126587,The COVID-19 Disease Burden in Germany in 2020.,2021-03-05,"During public health crises including the COVID-19 pandemic, resource scarcity and contagion risks may require health systems to shift-to some degree-from a usual clinical ethic, focused on the well-being of individual patients, to a public health ethic, focused on population health. Many triage policies exist that fall under the legal protections afforded by ""crisis standards of care,"" but they have key differences. We critically appraise one of the most fundamental differences among policies, namely the use of criteria to categorically exclude certain patients from eligibility for otherwise standard medical services. We examine these categorical exclusion criteria from ethical, legal, disability, and implementation perspectives. Focusing our analysis on the most common type of exclusion criteria, which are disease-specific, we conclude that optimal policies for critical care resource allocation and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not use categorical exclusions. We argue that the avoidance of categorical exclusions is often practically feasible, consistent with public health norms, and mitigates discrimination against persons with disabilities.","Auriemma, Catherine L; Molinero, Ashli M; Houtrow, Amy J; Persad, Govind; White, Douglas B; Halpern, Scott D",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1764141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420822/,390
127252,Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and swallowing function-a systematic review.,2020-02-15,"It has recently been shown that cell entry of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2) is mediated through endocytosis (Z. Qiu et al., J. Virol. 80:5768-5776, 2006). However, the molecular mechanism underlying MHV-2 entry is not known. Here we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to determine the molecular pathways for MHV-2 entry. Our results showed that MHV-2 gene expression and infectivity were significantly inhibited when cells were treated with chemical and physiologic blockers of the clathrin-mediated pathway, such as chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose medium. Furthermore, viral gene expression was significantly inhibited when cells were transfected with a small interfering RNA specific to the clathrin heavy chain. However, these treatments did not affect the infectivity and gene expression of MHV-A59, demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitions. In addition, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of caveolin 1 did not have any effect on MHV-2 infection, while it significantly blocked the caveolin-dependent uptake of cholera toxin subunit B. These results demonstrate that MHV-2 utilizes the clathrin- but not caveolin-mediated endocytic pathway for entry. Interestingly, when the cells transiently overexpressed a dominant-negative form (DIII) of Eps15, which is thought to be an essential component of the clathrin pathway, viral gene expression and infectivity were unaffected, although DIII expression blocked transferrin uptake and vesicular stomatitis virus infection, which are dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, MHV-2 entry is mediated through clathrin-dependent but Eps15-independent endocytosis.","Pu, Yinghui; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00837-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550663/,390

Progesterone has been speculated to be involved in the mediation of pathogen disgust in women, though with mixed experimental support. Here we considered the effects of acute progesterone on the disgust-like avoidance responses of female mice to pathogen threat. Estrous female mice discriminated and avoided the urinary and associated odors of males subclinically infected with the murine nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. These avoidance responses were not significantly affected by pre-treatment with progesterone. Likewise, brief (1 min) exposure to the odors of infected males attenuated the subsequent responses of females to the odors of the normally preferred unfamiliar males and enhanced their preferences for familiar males. Neither progesterone nor allopregnanolone, a central neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone, had any significant effects on the avoidance of unfamiliar males elicited by pre-exposure to a parasitized male. Progesterone and allopregnanolone, did, however, significantly attenuate the typical preferences of estrous females for unfamiliar uninfected males, suggestive of effects on social recognition. These findings with mice indicate that progesterone may have minimal effects on the responses to specific parasite threat and the expression of pathogen disgust but may influence more general social recognition and preferences.","Kavaliers, Martin; Bishnoi, Indra R; Ossenkopp, Klaus-Peter; Choleris, Elena",Hormones and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2020.104873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069752/,390

The cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute cardiac injury with unknown pathophysiologic mechanism has become increasingly prevalent. However, it is not yet understood how the extent of cardiac injury differs with the intensity of viral infection. In the current study, we aimed to assess the association between elevated cardiac biomarkers and the severity of COVID-19 infection. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed across PubMed and Embase databases from December 1, 2019 to July 10, 2020, to identify studies that reported cardiac biomarkers of troponin (TnI) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) in patients with COVID-19. These studies compared non-severe patients with severe patients, or survivors with non-survivors or medical patients with critically ill patients. The data were extracted for TnI, CK-MB, N-terminal-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Wherever possible, the data were pooled for meta-analysis (Review Manager, RevMan. version 5.3) with standard or weighted mean or median difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS A total of 25 studies involving 5,626 patients were included in the present analysis. More severe COVID-19 infection was found to be associated with higher mean values of TnI (-0.54 [-0.72, -0.36]) (ng/mL), CK-MB (-1.55 [-2.23, -0.88]) (ng/mL) and (-4.75 [-13.31, 3.82]) (units/L), NT-BNP (-815.7 [-1073.97, -557.42]) (pg/mL), D-dimer (-1.4 [-2.04, -0.77]) (mcg/mL), and LDH (-176.59 [-224.11, -129.06]) (units/L), as well as CRP (-64.03 [-68.88, -59.19]) (mg/L) and IL-6 (-22.59 [-29.39, -15.79]) (pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS There is significant association between elevated cardiac biomarkers and the severity of COVID-19, which underlines the increased risk of acute cardiac injury with more severe viral infection.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to determine quantitative measures of precisely how well pre-treatment IDRFs predict surgical outcomes and survival. METHODS A systematic review was performed for studies between January 1990 and July 2019 that compared surgical outcomes and/or survival in pediatric neuroblastoma patients with one or more IDRFs to patients without IDRFs. Summary risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS 19 retrospective cohort studies were included, representing data from 1132 patients. The risk ratio (RR) of incomplete surgical resection in IDRF-positive patients compared to IDRF-negative patients was 2.45 (95% CI 1.51-3.97). The RR of surgical complications was 2.30 (95% CI 1.46-3.61). The hazard ratio (HR) for 5-year EFS was 2.08 (95% CI 2.93-4.13) while the 5-year HR for OS was 2.44 (95% CI 1.46-4.08). CONCLUSION IDRF-positive neuroblastoma patients have a higher risk of incomplete surgical resection, surgical complications, and 5-year mortality and/or relapse. Our results affirm that IDRFs remain a useful prognostic tool for neuroblastoma patients both for short and long-term outcomes.

Use of steroids may reactivate the infection and repeated intravitreal therapy with anti-vascular growth factor inhibitors (Anti-VEGF) puts the patient again at the risk of exacerbation of inflammation or endophthalmitis. We describe a case of CME post traumatic endophthalmitis successfully treated with topical interferon therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION A 34-year-old Asian Indian lady with a history of cat bite to her right eye and treated elsewhere as traumatic endophthalmitis with recurrent macular edema, presented to us 1 year after the injury. She had received anti-VEGF injection for same. Her medical history was non-contributory except for close contact with her cat. Therapeutic trials with oral doxycycline followed by oral albendazole with steroids, as well as repeated anti-VEGF therapy failed to prevent recurrence of CME. Patient's steroid responsiveness and reluctance for injections, made us to opt for a novel topical Interferon therapy. Macular edema resolved in 2 months. Interruption of interferon therapy due to COVID-lock down resulted in recurrence of the CME, which again responded well to interferon monotherapy. CONCLUSION Topical interferon may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory macular edema and can serve as a, safer, economical and non-invasive treatment option compared to intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGFs.","Kawali, Ankush; Srinivasan, Sanjay; Mahendradas, Padmamalini; Shetty, Rohit",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211024809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120495/,390

Surgical training has been blocked and the learning curve flattened. However, COVID-19 led to the outbreak of multitudinous online courses. Master series: microsurgery for residents (MSMR) has been the most extensive and accessible online nonfee course transmitted so far regarding reconstructive microsurgery. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of the MSMR in the surgical community as an international educational tool during pandemic confinement. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective, observational, analytic, and transversal study was designed. An 11-item survey was sent to all the 1,513 attendees who completed at least 60% of course attendance during 2 days. Descriptive and analytic statistics were performed. The impact was measured by considering answers to questions 6 to 9 and 11 (course usefulness, microsurgery interest increase, desire to pursue a microsurgical career, attendance to in-person conferences, and overall score, respectively). RESULTS A total of 1,111 (73.4%) of eligible subjects were included. In total, 55.8% were plastic surgery residents. After the course, 98.9% would pursue a career in reconstructive microsurgery, and 45% would stop attending in-person conferences. The overall score of the event was 9.06 ± 0.9 (from 0 to 10) regardless of the current training status.

134829,Differences in COVID-19 Risk Between Occupational Groups and Employment Sectors in Germany.,2020-09-18,"INTRODUCTION Physical inactivity is a costly and leading health risk factor. Engaging in moderate or more intense regular physical activity reduces premature mortality at the population level. Walking is a viable option for achieving the recommended level of physical activity. Yet, the sedentary lifestyle is trending. Determinants of physical activity may be personal, social or environmental. Health promotion endeavours aiming to enhance population-level physical activity are reported in the literature. However, a full range of factors influencing the development and implementation of sustainable indoor walking programmes is unclear. The current review protocol is aimed at describing a process of realist synthesis to uncover contexts, mechanisms and outcomes of indoor walking intervention programmes, which might reveal facilitators, constraints and barriers of planning, implementing and participating in indoor walking initiatives open for the members of the general public. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will employ a realist synthesis to determine successes or failures in certain circumstances for specific stakeholders, which will aid in developing a sustainable mall walking health promotion and community engagement programme. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method articles and reports will be screened for intervention theories and models in order to identify elements of programmes that may be linked to the success or failure of the interventions. Data related to the context, mechanism and outcome of the interventions will be collected, analysed and synthesised iteratively until a theoretical understanding develops, which might explain the intricacies of the success and failure of identified indoor walking programmes. The review process will be conducted and evaluated by using the recommended tools. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval, such as Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, was not required for this study because no direct interaction with patients will occur for data collection and analysis.

135202,100 years on: the impact of the discovery of insulin on clinical outcomes.,2021-08-01,"Elevated postprandial triacylglycerols (TAG) are an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Men have higher plasma TAG and impaired TAG clearance compared to women, which may contribute to sex differences in risk of cardiovascular disease. Understanding mechanisms of sex differences in TAG metabolism may yield novel therapeutic targets to prevent cardiovascular disease. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a lipid shuttling protein known for its effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Although mice lack CETP, we previously demonstrated that transgenic CETP expression in female mice alters TAG metabolism. The impact of CETP on TAG metabolism in males, however, is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that CETP expression increases plasma TAG in males, especially in very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), by impairing postprandial plasma TAG clearance compared to wild-type (WT) males. Gonadal hormones were required for CETP to impair TAG clearance, suggesting a role for sex hormones for this effect. Testosterone replacement in the setting of gonadectomy was sufficient to restore the effect of CETP on TAG. Lastly, liver androgen receptor (AR) was required for CETP to increase plasma TAG. Thus, expression of CETP in males raises plasma TAG by impairing TAG clearance via testosterone signaling to AR. Further understanding of how CETP and androgen signaling impair TAG clearance may lead to novel approaches to reduce TAG and mitigate risk of cardiovascular disease.","Palmisano, Brian T; Anozie, Uche; Yu, Sophia; Neuman, Joshua C; Zhu, Lin; Edington, Emery M; Luu, Thao; Stafford, John M",Lipids,https://doi.org/10.1002/lipd.12271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783209/,390

METHODS We reviewed the surgical results of 33 patients who underwent surgical closure of PBF by thoracotomy access using three methods: Myoplasty (MYO)-12, omentoplasty (OMT)-10, and pedicled pericardial flap (PPF) with fibrin glue-11. Post-operative follow up was six months. RESULTS The patients' demography was comparable among the groups. The diameter of the fistulas ranged from 5 mm to total dehiscence. The mean time of the fistula manifestation (in weeks) was 21.5 in the MYO group, 19.50 in the OMT, and 20.1 in the PPF group. The shortest period of hospital drainage of the pleural space was noted in the PPF group. Healing of the fistula was obtained in 66.67% in the MYO group, 80% in the OMT, and 100% in the PPF group. The number of complications was similar in all groups. The hospitalization time was significantly shorter in the PPF group (13.00 d) versus the MYO group (19.58 d) and the OMT (20.01 d). Overall mortality rate was 18.18%; 33.33% of the patients in the MYO group and 20% in the OMT group died. There were no hospital deaths in the PPF group. CONCLUSION Pericardial flap supported by fibrin glue can be an effective method adjunctive to the treatment of postpneumonectomy PBF in selected patients. Compared with other methods of bronchial stump coverage (omentopasty and myoplasty), this one showed a higher percentage of healing of the fistulas and shorter duration of hospital drainage and hospitalization.","Jabłoński, Sławomir; Brocki, Marian; Wawrzycki, Marcin; Klejszmit, Piotr; Kutwin, Leszek; Kozakiewicz, Marcin",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2012.194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830332/,390

The current study investigated the safety of LigaSure for distal pancreatic resection in a porcine model. METHODS A distal pancreatectomy was performed in 22 pigs. Animals were randomly assigned to undergo conventional scalpel transection with hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant or pancreatic transection and sealing by LigaSure. Closed-suction drainage was collected daily. Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day (POD) 7 and the pancreatic remnant was sampled for histology. RESULTS Two grade A postoperative temporary pancreatic fistulas (ISGPF definition) developed after hand suturing but none after LigaSure sealing. Amylase and lipase levels in drainage fluid were higher in the suture group during the first postoperative days but showed no differences after the fourth day. All but two animals that had to be euthanized because of small bowel invagination survived until POD 7. No significant differences were found in macroscopic changes between groups at reexploration. Histology demonstrated focal, chronic granulating inflammation with minor necrosis in all animals.

The emergence of new resistance patterns and the spread of new viruses challenge the eradication of infectious diseases. The declining efficacy of antimicrobial drugs has become a global public health problem. Natural products derived from natural sources, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, have significant efficacy for the treatment of infectious diseases accompanied by less adverse effects, synergy, and ability to overcome drug resistance. As the Chinese female scientist Youyou Tu received the Nobel Prize for the antimalarial drug artemisinin, antimicrobial drugs developed from Traditional Chinese Medicine are expected to receive increasing attention again. This review summarizes the antimicrobial agents derived from natural products approved for nearly 20 years and describes their efficacy and mode of action. The aim of this unit is to review the current status of antimicrobial drugs from natural products in order to increase the value of natural products as a source of novel drug candidates for infectious diseases.","Ye, Ling; Zhang, Jiaxing; Xiao, Wei; Liu, Shuwen",Pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916205/,390

In this study, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) against human IL-6R from mRNA-displayed unnatural peptide library ribosomally initiated and cyclized with m-(chloromethyl)benzoic acid (mClPh) incorporated by genetic code expansion (sense suppression) was performed using the PURE (Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements) system. A novel 13-mer unnatural mClPh-cyclized peptide that binds to the extracellular domain of IL-6R was discovered from an extremely diverse random peptide library. In vitro affinity maturation of IL-6R-binding unnatural mClPh-cyclized peptide from focused libraries was performed, identifying two IL-6R-binding unnatural mClPh-cyclized peptides by next-generation sequencing. Because cyclization can increase the protease resistance of peptides, novel IL-6R-binding mClPh-cyclized peptides discovered in this study have the potential to be used for a variety of research, therapeutic, and diagnostic applications involving IL-6/IL-6R signaling.","Takamori, Yukio; Ando, Takehiro; Fuji, Daisuke; Yokoyama, Takumi; Yamamoto, Mizuki; Kawakami, Takashi",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340765/,390

137740,"In older adults with CKD and mild acidosis, oral sodium bicarbonate did not improve physical function.",2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND The battery life (BL) of portable home ventilator batteries is reported by manufacturers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ventilator mode, breathing frequency, PEEP, and leaks on the BL of 5 commercially available portable ventilators. METHODS The effects of the ventilator mode (volume controlled-continuous mandatory ventilation [VC-CMV] vs pressure support ventilation [PSV]), PEEP 5 cm H2O, breathing frequency (10, 15, and 20 breaths/min), and leaks during both volume-targeted ventilation and PSV on the BL of 5 ventilators (Elisée 150, Monnal T50, PB560, Vivo 50, and Trilogy 100) were evaluated. Each ventilator was ventilated with a test lung at a tidal volume of 700 ml and an inspiratory time of 1.2 s in the absence of leaks. RESULTS Switching from PSV to VC-CMV or the addition of PEEP did not significantly change ventilator BL. The increase in breathing frequency from 10 to 20 breaths/min decreased the BL by 18 ± 11% (P = .005). Leaks were associated with an increase in BL during the VC-CMV mode (18 ± 20%, P = .04) but a decrease in BL during the PSV mode (-13 ± 15%, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS The BL of home ventilators depends on the ventilator settings. BL is not affected by the ventilator mode (VC-CMV or PSV) or the addition of PEEP. BL decreases with an increase in breathing frequency and during leaks with a PSV mode, whereas leaks increase the duration of ventilator BL during VC-CMV.","Falaize, Line; Leroux, Karl; Prigent, Hélène; Louis, Bruno; Khirani, Sonia; Orlikowski, David; Fauroux, Brigitte; Lofaso, Frédéric",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24149669/,390

This research aims to reveal the variation of heavy metal speciation and potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of HMRGs and ARGs in manure composting under different initial chlortetracycline (CTC) concentrations. Treatments spiked with 20 mg/kg CTC (treatment P1), 100 mg/kg CTC (treatment P2), and the control (treatment CK) were operated. Results showed that CTC could be completely removed in the thermophilic phase of all the treatments despite of the initial concentrations. Bioavailable Cu in treatments CK, P1, and P2 declined by 14.5%, 27.1%, and 26.7% and bioavailable Zn declined by 15.3%, 29.5%, and 12.1%, respectively, after the composting, respectively. Relative abundance of HMRGs decreased by 6.49 log, 8.88 log, and 5.77 log, respectively, in treatments CK, P1, and P2. Relative abundance of ARGs decreased by 3.37 log, 4.86 log, and 3.32 log, respectively, in treatments CK, P1, and P2. Composting could effectively reduce genes pcoD, pcoA, zntA, tetQ, and tetA, which might locate on the same plasmid. CTC of 100 mg/kg promoted the co-selection of ARGs and HMRGs and increased the potential HGT of gene cusA.","Wang, Yao; Chen, Zhiqiang; Wen, Qinxue; Ji, Ye",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10557-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839909/,390

139206,Essential items for reporting of scaling studies of health interventions (SUCCEED): protocol for a systematic review and Delphi process.,2020-01-11,"PURPOSE Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using β-emitting radiolabelled somatostatin analogues like DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate shows beneficial results in patients suffering from somatostatin receptor overexpressing tumours. However, after high-dose therapy partial renal reabsorption of radiopeptides may lead to nephrotoxicity. Co-infusion of lysine/arginine lowers renal retention of these radiopeptides without affecting tumour uptake. Recently co-administration of Gelofusine has been described to have a comparable kidney-protecting effect in rats. In the present study optimal dosing of Gelofusine co-administration was studied in tumour-bearing rats. METHODS Doses of 40, 80, 120 or 160 mg/kg Gelofusine were co-injected with 15 µg DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, labelled with 3 MBq 111In for biodistribution (24 h post-injection, n = 4 per group) and with 60 MBq 111In for microSPECT imaging experiments at 3, 24 and 48 h post-injection. An additional group of rats received 80 mg/kg Gelofusine plus 400 mg/kg lysine co-injection. Biodistribution studies were performed both in older (475 g) and younger (300 g) rats, the latter bearing CA20948 tumours. RESULTS Co-injection of 40 mg/kg Gelofusine resulted in 40-50% reduction of renal uptake and retention of 111In-DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, whereas higher doses further increased the reduction to 50-60% in both groups of rats. Combining Gelofusine and lysine caused 70% reduction of renal uptake. The uptake of radiolabelled octreotate both in somatostatin receptor-expressing normal tissues and tumours was not affected by Gelofusine co-injection. CONCLUSION In rats co-injection of 80 mg/kg Gelofusine resulted in maximum reduction of renal retention of 111In-DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, which was further improved when combined with lysine. Tumour uptake of radiolabelled octreotate was not affected, resulting in an increased tumour to kidney ratio.","Melis, Marleen; Bijster, Magda; de Visser, Monique; Konijnenberg, Mark W; de Swart, Jan; Rolleman, Edgar J; Boerman, Otto C; Krenning, Eric P; de Jong, Marion",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-009-1196-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19585115/,390

Given the disproportionate impacts of this pandemic on communities of color, it is essential for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to focus on how structural racism drives these disparate outcomes. In May and June 2020, we conducted a 6-state online survey to examine racial/ethnic differences in exposure to COVID-19, risk mitigation behaviors, risk perceptions, and COVID-19 impacts. Results show that Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely than White respondents to experience factors associated with structural racism (eg, living in larger households, going to work in person, using public transportation) that, by their very nature, increase the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. Controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, non-White respondents were equally or more likely than White respondents to take protective actions against COVID-19, including keeping distance from others and wearing masks. Black and Hispanic respondents also perceived higher risks of dying of the disease and of running out of money due to the pandemic, and 40% of Black respondents reported knowing someone who had died of COVID-19 at a time when the US death toll had just surpassed 100,000 people. To manage the current pandemic and prepare to combat future health crises in an effective, equitable, and antiracist manner, it is imperative to understand the structural factors perpetuating racial inequalities in the COVID-19 experience.","Dickinson, Katherine L; Roberts, Jennifer D; Banacos, Natalie; Neuberger, Lindsay; Koebele, Elizabeth; Blanch-Hartigan, Danielle; Shanahan, Elizabeth A",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2021.0031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076499/,390

The Lewis score (LS) on CE could be used to objectively assess the inflammatory activity of the small bowel mucosa. However, only few reports on the correlation between the LS and CD prognosis exist. This study is aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of the LS by determining the cutoff value of the LS that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization. Methods This retrospective single-center study included 125 patients who underwent CE for small bowel CD. Eighty-six patients whose treatment was not changed after CE were analyzed. Inflammatory activity was assessed with the LS. We examined the clinical course of the patients who could be observed for 1 year after CE and investigated the LS cutoff value that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization within 1 year. We also examined the hospitalization-free and clinical relapse-free rates using the LS cutoff value and evaluated the factors related to emergency hospitalization. Results The LS cutoff value that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization within 1 year was 264 (area under the curve, 0.92 (P < 0.001); sensitivity, 0.80; and specificity, 0.94). The cumulative hospitalization-free rate and cumulative clinical relapse-free rate were significantly higher in patients with a LS < 264 (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that a LS < 264 was a statistically significant factor (P = 0.001; 95% CI, 0.010-0.308). Conclusion A LS of 264 is a useful cutoff value that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization. This LS cutoff value may help determine treatment strategies for CD.","Nishikawa, Takahiro; Nakamura, Masanao; Yamamura, Takeshi; Maeda, Keiko; Sawada, Tsunaki; Mizutani, Yasuyuki; Ishikawa, Takuya; Furukawa, Kazuhiro; Ohno, Eizaburo; Miyahara, Ryoji; Kawashima, Hiroki; Hirooka, Yoshiki",Gastroenterology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/4274257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944562/,390

140913,Quantifying the underestimation of projected global diabetes prevalence by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas.,2021-08-01,"Silk fibroin is a protein with a unique combination of properties and is widely studied for biomedical applications. The extraction of fibroin (degumming) from the silk filament impacts the properties of the outcoming material. The degumming can be conducted with different procedures. Among them, the most used and studied procedure in the research field is the alkali degumming with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). In this study, by the use of a statistical method, namely, design of experiment (DOE), we characterized the Na2CO3 degumming, taking into consideration the main process factors involved and changing them within a selected range of values. We considered the process temperature and time, the salt concentration, and the number of baths used, testing the impact of these variables on the fibroin properties by building empirical models. These models not only took into consideration the direct effect of the process factors but also their combined effect, which are not conventionally detectable with other methods. The weight loss and the amount of sericin removed in the process were determined and used as a measure of the effectiveness of the process. The secondary structure, the molecular weight, the diameter of fibers, and their morphology and mechanical properties were studied with the intent to correlate the macroscopical properties with the structural changes. We report, for the first time, the possibility to effectively remove all sericin from the silk fibroin using Na2CO3, using a process that requires less salt, water, and energy, in comparison with the standard alkali protocol, making this technique overall more environmentally sustainable; in addition, we have demonstrated the possibility to tune the material properties by varying the degumming conditions and even to optimize them with empirical statistically based equations that allow one to directly set the optimal process parameters. The major effect on the macroscopical properties (such as the ultimate strength and Young's modulus) has been proved to be correlated with the removal of sericin instead of the microstructural variations. Finally, a ready-to-use table with a set of optimized degumming procedures to maximize or minimize the studied properties was provided.","Bucciarelli, Alessio; Greco, Gabriele; Corridori, Ilaria; Pugno, Nicola M; Motta, Antonella",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594891/,390

We evaluated the feasibility of MIS Ivor Lewis esophagectomy in patients treated with induction chemoradiation to 50.4 Gy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 30 consecutive patients undergoing MIS Ivor Lewis esophagectomy after induction chemoradiation to a mean dose of 50.4 Gy by a single surgeon at a tertiary institution since 2010. Data collected included patient demographics, preoperative risk factors, neoadjuvant treatment modalities, histology, staging, operative factors, and perioperative complications. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 9.5 years, and 87% were men. The dominant histology was adenocarcinoma (90%), with most tumors (70%) located at the gastroesophageal junction. A total of 22 patients (73%) presented with dysphagia, but only 15 (50%) had associated weight loss (mean 12.2% total body mass). All patients had R0 resections; mean number of resected lymph nodes was 27.1 ± 11.4. Mean operating room time was 535 ± 120 minutes, with the last 10 operations 2 hours shorter than the preceding 20. Four patients (13.3%) had major complications. including 2 (6.7%) anastomotic leaks. There was no operative mortality. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy after chemoradiation to 50.4 Gy can be performed with decreased morbidity and mortality compared with historical series of open Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. Oncologic outcomes were acceptable as demonstrated by lymph node retrieval and complete resection rates. Operative time decreased significantly after 20 cases.","Thomay, Alan A; Snyder, Justin A; Edmondson, Donna M; Scott, Walter J",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0b013e31828130b7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23422805/,390
141342,Silent Hypoxemia of COVID-19 Pneumonia: Typical Courses With Implications for Outpatient Care.,2021-01-11,"Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been intensely studied for the removal of refractory pollutants because of the strong oxidizing capacity of hydroxyl radical. One of the emerging AOP methods gaining increased attention is bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) which can generate hydroxyl radical in-situ in the cathode chamber using the energy harvested by exoelectrogenic bacteria in the anode. In this study, the feasibility of BEF technology for the removal of metoprolol, a typical micropollutant widely found in the water environment, was for the first time investigated. It was found that applied voltage and working pH had a significant effect on removal efficiency while Fe2+ dosage as catalyst showed a little effect. Besides removal by hydroxyl radical, metoprolol might be adsorbed on the surface of the reactor, electrode, and precipitated with iron sludge, especially at neutral pH. In a batch experiment with a supplied voltage of 0.2 V, pH 3, and a Fe2+ dose of 0.2 mM, the removal rate of metoprolol in the BEF for the synthetic wastewater and the real effluent from the secondary sediment tank was 66% and 55% within 12 h, respectively. A possible degradation pathway was proposed. Then the removal of metoprolol in a continuous flow BEF system was further studied at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 2, 4, and 6 h, about 77%, 92%, and 95% removal was observed. A toxicity test (less than 20% inhibition on bioluminescence) during treatment and energy cost analysis (5.269 × 10-3 kWh/order/m3) in treating 10 μg/L of metoprolol containing wastewater effluent at continuous flow mode implied that the proposed BEF has a potential for wastewater treatment.","Yang, Xiaoyong; Zou, Rusen; Tang, Kai; Andersen, Henrik Rasmus; Angelidaki, Irini; Zhang, Yifeng",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736124/,390

The purpose of the systematic review described in this protocol is to investigate currently available home-based occupational therapy and physiotherapy programmes regarding both their feasibility and effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol describes a systematic review, developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015. Studies will be included in which primary data are collected, participants are children aged <18 years with any type of CP and the intervention of interest is a home-based occupational therapy or physiotherapy intervention. Comparators of interest are: no therapy, care as usual, centre-based occupational therapy or physiotherapy, an alternative home-based programme and a medical intervention. Studies will be included that report either on feasibility (ie, acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, expansion or integration) or on efficacy/effectiveness (ie, child-related upper extremity outcomes within all International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health levels or parent-related/caregiver-related outcomes on the psychological and social domain). Relevant studies will be identified by searching the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, OTSeeker and CPCI-S as well as the trial registers ICTRP and CENTRAL, the reference lists of included records and by circulating a bibliography of the included records to authors of included studies. There will be no restrictions on language or year of publication. The search strategy consists of terms related to the population and intervention. Data will be extracted in duplicate using a digital data extraction form. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The proposed study does not involve collection of primary data. Accordingly, no ethical approval is required. The authors will disseminate the findings of this systematic review through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentation(s).

The closed-syringe system offers a minimally invasive, gentle system with which to mobilize subdermal fat tissues in a suspension form. Resulting total nuclear counting of undifferentiated cells of the adipose-derived -SVF suggests that the yield achieved is better than use of always-on, constant mechanical pump applied vacuum systems. CONCLUSION Use of a closed-syringe lipoaspiration system featuring disposable microcannulas offers a safe and effective means of harvesting small volumes of nonmanipulated adipose tissues and its accompanying progenitor cells within the SVF. Closed syringes and microcannulas are available as safe, sterile, disposable, compact systems for acquiring high-quality AFG. Presented is a detailed, step-by-step, proven protocol for performing quality autologous structural adipose transplantation.","Alexander, Robert W; Harrell, David B","Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology",https://doi.org/10.2147/ccid.s40575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23630430/,390

We previously reported that moesin, the only ERM in Drosophila, controls mitotic morphogenesis and epithelial integrity. We also found that the Pp1-87B phosphatase dephosphorylates moesin, counteracting its activation by the Ste20-like kinase Slik. To understand how this signaling pathway is itself regulated, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen, looking for new regulators of moesin activity. We identified that Slik is a new member of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex (STRIPAK). We discovered that the phosphatase activity of STRIPAK reduces Slik phosphorylation to promote its cortical association and proper activation of moesin. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of STRIPAK phosphatase activity causes cell morphology defects in mitosis and impairs epithelial tissue integrity. Our results implicate the Slik-STRIPAK complex in the control of multiple morphogenetic processes.","De Jamblinne, Camille Valérie; Decelle, Barbara; Dehghani, Mehrnoush; Joseph, Mathieu; Sriskandarajah, Neera; Leguay, Kévin; Rambaud, Basile; Lemieux, Sébastien; Roux, Philippe P; Hipfner, David R; Carréno, Sébastien",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201911035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960945/,390
147541,"In high-risk adults, the Moderna vaccine had 94% efficacy against COVID-19 ≥14 d after the 2nd dose.",2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND Care transitions from the hospital to home are critical to the sustainability of our health care system. Ineffective care transitions can be caused by high incidences of post-discharge adverse events, by poor communication with patients, and/or by inadequate information transfer between providers from the hospital to home. Any one of these can lead to fragmented care, high readmission rates, increased visits to the emergency department, and ultimately poor patient outcomes. Despite the ongoing improvement efforts of health care organizations, the efficacy of person- and family-centered care transition interventions on the quality of care and on the patient experience are not known. The aim of this systematic review is to critically analyze the body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of person- and family-centered care transition interventions on the quality of care, and the experience of patients. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review using the Cochrane Handbook's guidelines and will adhere to a standardized reporting format: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group. Following a two-step screening process, data including the full reference, objectives, target population, description of the intervention and control intervention, outcome measures, design, length of post-intervention follow-up period, and the study results will be extracted, synthesized, and reported. Risk of bias and quality of the studies will also be assessed. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarize and present the evidence base for person- and family-centered care transition interventions. This review will also inform further research and will lay the groundwork for more empirical studies on person- and family-centered care transitions. Specifically, the results of this systematic review may inform the development of measures to monitor safe and effective person- and family-centered transitions from the hospital to home. These results may also be important for policy makers, decision-makers, clinicians, and patients/families who are involved in navigating the health care system.

149335,Reducing inpatient hypoglycaemia.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Laparo Endoscopic Single-site Surgery (LESS) represents an evolution of minimally invasive surgery and aims to improve cosmetic outcome and reduce surgical trauma and complications associated with traditional laparoscopy. This study was performed to present our preliminary experience in bilateral spermatic cord ligation with the LESS technique and compare the results with the outcomes of conventional laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Between June 2007 and May 2013, 24 patients were referred to our institute for bilateral varicocelectomy. The indications for this type of procedure were bilateral varicocele with impairment of semen parameters or chronic bilateral testicular pain. All procedures were performed via the same surgeon. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of laparoscopic surgery. Group A included 10 patients underwent LESS technique while group B included the remaining 14 patients that underwent conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS The comparison between the two techniques showed some important advantages for LESS: shorter operating time (45.4 min vs. 88.3 (P < .001), shorter hospital stay (16.6 hours vs. 51.4 hours) (P < .001), early return to the normal activity (2.3 days vs. 4.7 days) and better cosmetic outcomes. No conversions from LESS to conventional laparoscopy were necessary and blood loss was insignificant in all patients.All patients in the LESS group reported full satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome, whereas 85.7% of patients after conventional laparoscopy were fully satisfied with cosmesis. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral spermatic cord ligation with LESS is an alternative to conventional laparoscopy. The procedure was successfully performed in all patients. The trans-umbilical approach offers the advantage of a better cosmetic result, shorter hospital stay and less postoperative pain.","Micali, Salvatore; Ghaith, Ahmed; Martorana, Eugenio; Zordani, Alessio; Territo, Angelo; Bianchi, Giampaolo",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2490-14-83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341821/,390
149409,Answering the Call: Impact of Tele-ICU Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-28,"INTRODUCTION Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker approved for first-line treatment of metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expanded access program (EAP) allowed early access to afatinib and provided additional data on its safety, tolerability, and efficacy. METHODS The afatinib EAP was an open-label, multicenter, single-arm program in the United States that treated and followed patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. Afatinib 40 mg was administered orally once daily until discontinuation due to disease progression, adverse events (AEs), or transition to commercially available drug. RESULTS Three hundred twenty-two patients received ≥1 dose of afatinib. Most patients had received prior therapies. Drug-related AEs occurred in 89.4% of patients, including 7.8% with serious AEs. The most common afatinib-related AEs (all grades) were diarrhea (77.0%) and rash (36.0%). Dose reductions occurred in 31.1% of patients. Discontinuation rates due to diarrhea (1.6%) or rash/acne (0.3%) were low. Efficacy data were collected and analyzed when available, with 17.1% and 69.9% of patients achieving objective response and disease control, respectively, in this highly pretreated population. CONCLUSIONS No additional or unexpected safety concerns were revealed, and afatinib demonstrated antitumor activity in a heavily pretreated NSCLC patient population in a routine clinical setting.

150603,A comparison of self-reported and device measured sedentary behaviour in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-03-04,"BACKGROUND Coughing episodes occur frequently at extubation after thoracic surgery, and this may be due in part to the double-lumen tube (DLT). In this study, the DLT was replaced with either a single-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device or left in place, and the incidence of coughing at emergence was compared between the three groups. METHODS Fifty-eight adults scheduled for thoracic surgery with a DLT were included. Exclusion criteria were an anticipated difficult airway, obesity, and contraindication to the use of an LMA ProSeal™ (LMA-P). After surgery but before emergence, patients were randomized to having the DLT (1) removed and replaced by an LMA-P (LMA-P Group), (2) removed and replaced by an ETT (ETT Group), or (3) left in place (DLT Group). The primary outcome was the number of coughing episodes at extubation. RESULTS Among 184 patients screened, 124 did not meet inclusion criteria, and two patients, both in the ETT Group, were excluded after randomization, leaving 20, 18, and 20 patients in the LMA-P, ETT, and DLT Groups, respectively. There were fewer coughing episodes (median [quartiles]) in the LMA-P Group than in the DLT Group (0[0-1] vs 2[1-3], respectively; P = 0.01). In the DLT Group, 90% of patients coughed at least once. This incidence was not significantly different in the ETT Group (83%; P = 0.222) but was significantly reduced in the LMA-P Group (35%; P < 0.001). No patient had oxygen desaturation during airway exchange or at extubation. The incidence and severity of hoarseness and sore throat were similar in all groups. CONCLUSION Coughing at extubation after thoracic surgery can be reduced if the DLT is replaced by an LMA-P before emergence. The number of patients in this trial was too small to evaluate the risks associated with exchanging the airway device. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00925613.","Tanoubi, Issam; Sun, Joanna Ng Man; Drolet, Pierre; Fortier, Louis-Philippe; Donati, François",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-015-0403-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25985845/,390

We aim to systematically review current medical educational evidence for training of handheld otoscopy skills. METHODS Following the PRISMA guideline, studies reporting on training and/or assessment of handheld otoscopy were identified searching the following databases: PubMed, Embase, OVID, the Cochrane Library, PloS Medicine, Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ), and Web of Science. Two reviewers extracted data on study design, training intervention, educational outcomes, and results. Quality of educational evidence was assessed along with classification according to Kirkpatrick's model of educational outcomes. RESULTS The searches yielded a total of 6064 studies with a final inclusion of 33 studies for the qualitative synthesis. Handheld otoscopy training could be divided into workshops, physical simulators, web-based training/e-learning, and smartphone-enabled otoscopy. Workshops were the most commonly described educational intervention and typically consisted of lectures, hands-on demonstrations, and training on peers. Almost all studies reported a favorable effect on either learner attitude, knowledge, or skills. The educational quality of the studies was reasonable but the educational outcomes were mostly evaluated on the lower Kirkpatrick levels with only a single study determining the effects of training on actual change in the learner behavior. CONCLUSION Overall, it seems that any systematic approach to training of handheld otoscopy is beneficial in training regardless of learner level, but the heterogeneity of the studies makes comparisons between studies difficult and the relative effect sizes of the interventions could not be determined.","Frithioff, Andreas; Guldager, Mads Juhl; Andersen, Steven Arild Wuyts","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489421997289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629599/,390

This is achieved when the tissue bite (TB) is equal to or larger than the stitch interval (SI). Although TB and SI values are recommended in some textbooks, SL:WL ratios are rarely reported in veterinary textbooks. Additionally, no clinical data regarding these parameters could be found in small animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the SL:WL ratio of midline laparotomy closure in dogs and cats performed by surgeons with different levels of expertise and to compare the findings with current textbook recommendations. Midline laparotomy incisions of 100 dogs and 75 cats were closed in continuous pattern by diplomates and residents of both the European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) and the European College of Animal Reproduction (ECAR). The mean SL:WL ratio was 2.5 ± 0.7:1. The surgeons´ level of experience and the species and body weights of the animals did not have any significant influence on the SL:WL ratio. A moderate negative correlation was observed between the mean SI to mean TB (SI:TB) ratio and the SL:WL ratio. In this study, the mean SI matched the textbook recommendations both in feline and canine species, whereas the TB in cats was different. In this study, the SL:WL ratio was less than 4:1 without apparent complications. Because of the low prevalence of incisional hernia in dogs and cats larger studies are necessary to evaluate clinical significance of the presented data.","Winter, Verena; Degasperi, Brigitte; Bockstahler, Barbara; Dupré, Gilles",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107892/,390

METHODS A task force, including 10 rheumatologists and 4 infectious disease specialists from North America, was convened. Clinical questions were collated, and an evidence report was rapidly generated and disseminated. Questions and drafted statements were reviewed and assessed using a modified Delphi process. This included asynchronous anonymous voting by e-mail and webinars with the entire panel. Task force members voted on agreement with draft statements using a 1-9-point numerical scoring system, and consensus was determined to be low, moderate, or high based on the dispersion of votes. For approval, median votes were required to meet predefined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as agreement, uncertainty, or disagreement, respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus. RESULTS To date, the task force has approved 80 guidance statements: 36 with moderate and 44 with high consensus. These were combined, resulting in 27 final guidance statements.

Individual epidemiological studies have controlled for several confounders of the relationship between PTSD and increased dementia risk, yet particular risk factors underlying this relationship have not been determined. This systematic review protocol aims to identify risk and protective factors of dementia among adults with PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct an electronic search of the databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, The Cochrane Library, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Global. After screening the studies, quantitative synthesis will be performed, if possible. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. We will include randomised controlled trials and other types of research evidence including longitudinal cohort studies. Strength of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations method. Examples of variables that will be extracted are: year of PTSD diagnosis, comorbid conditions, health behaviours, pharmacological treatments and year of mild cognitive impairment or dementia diagnosis. We developed this systematic review protocol according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The proposed study will not collect individual-level data and, therefore, does not require ethical approval.

This 3-year follow-up study assesses late adverse effects, evaluates rehabilitative long-term effects and identifies patients who benefit the most. DESIGN RePCa was a randomized clinical trial with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 79) or usual care (n = 82). The intervention during the first 6 months consisted of consultations by nurses and physiotherapists focusing on psychosocial support and physical activity, respectively. Here we report the 3-year follow-up. Data consisted of disease-specific quality of life (EPIC-26), general quality of life (SF-12) and pelvic floor strength measured by electromyography. RESULTS One hundred forty-three patients (92%) responded. The primary outcome urinary irritative sum-score was no longer significantly different between groups. In patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline, we observed a significant long-term effect on the urinary irritative sum-score in favour of the intervention (+ 13.4 points P = .014). More patients had moderate-severe bowel problems in the control group (n = 10; 14%) compared to the intervention group (n = 2; 3%) (P = .016). Pelvic floor strength deteriorated significantly in both groups. CONCLUSION The short-term rehabilitation was beneficial but of limited benefit in the long term for all patients. A significant and clinically relevant effect was found in irradiated prostate cancer patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline. In both groups, pelvic floor strength was weakened during follow-up. IMPACT FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Prior research showed patients benefit from early rehabilitation. Identification of patients with moderate-severe urinary problems followed by a focused rehabilitation during the first 6 months after radiotherapy results in long-term improvement. Radiated patients have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Patients can be informed that they benefit from early rehabilitation, and they cannot expect larger changes in adverse effects within the first years, but they have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. Future rehabilitation studies could be applied mainly to patients with assessed rehabilitation needs after radiotherapy and intensified with long-term follow-up.","Dieperink, Karin B; Hansen, Steinbjørn; Wagner, Lis; Minet, Lisbeth R; Hansen, Olfred",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-020-00958-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079329/,390
153843,Futile trauma transfers: An infrequent but costly component of regionalized trauma care.,2021-07-01,"PURPOSE Although acute conjunctivitis has been listed from the beginning as a possible sign of COVID-19, the likelihood of this association remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 and conjunctivitis. METHODS In this retrospective, observational study, we recruited all patients with signs and symptoms of acute conjunctivitis seen at the Eye Emergency Department (ED), Turin Eye Hospital, between 01/01/2020 and 12/05/2020 and cross-checked our data with the Piedmont Region online COVID-19 registry in the same period. RESULTS Among 10,065 patients seen at our ED during the timespan considered, 88 underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection within 4 weeks before/after our examination. On average, NS was performed -0.72 ± 1.8 weeks before/after eye examination. Of the 77 patients with a negative NS, 26 (33.8%) had a diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis, whereas the remaining 51 (66.2%) had other eye disorders. Among the 11 patients with COVID-19, 7 (63,6%) had a diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis. We found a non-statistically significant increase in NS positivity rate (21.2%) among cases examined at our ED for acute conjunctivitis, compared to the NS positivity rate (7.3%) in patients examined for all other eye conditions (p = 0.092). The Odds Ratio of having a positive NS in patients with acute conjunctivitis was 3.43 (95% I.C. = 0.9-12.8, p = 0.06). Considering online-registry data of Turin population during the same time-span, among 2441 positive NS cases only 27 (1.1%) presented with acute conjunctivitis. CONCLUSION Our results do not reveal a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 and acute conjunctivitis.

154698,A unique disaster response in aged residential dementia care: Can the experience inform future care models?,2021-05-26,"Appropriate end points are crucial for the successful interpretation of clinical trials. Choosing end points for therapeutic trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) requires careful consideration, because they are complications of critical illness. It may be difficult to distinguish the consequences of VAP and HAP from manifestations of the underlying illnesses, and it is important to determine their incremental magnitude, to plan for possible treatment effects and, thus, sample size calculations. In this article, we discuss mortality, attributable mortality, and time to clinical events as possible end points for HAP and/or VAP trials. Because of the paucity of evidence on HAP, we focus predominantly on VAP. In a systematic review of applicable trials, VAP appears to have slight intensive care unit and low hospital-attributable mortality. VAP is associated with prolonged durations of intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. Because of these findings, superiority trials of VAP treatment that use mortality as a primary end point are not possible. Equivalency studies are possible, but there are sample size implications. The use of time to clinical event end points, especially when combined with mortality, may be the best option for trial in the future.","Muscedere, John G; Day, Andrew; Heyland, Daren K",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1086/653060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20597661/,390

We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. We evaluated 145 patients. The average age was 58.1 years, 64% were male, 68.3% had comorbidities, and 60% received steroid therapy. Disposition of patients was 48.3% discharged and 29.3% expired, of which 43.9% were African American. Mechanical ventilation was required in 55.9%, of which 34.5% expired. Avoidance of MV (p value = 0.002) and increased survival (p value < 0.001) was statistically associated with early dosing. Tocilizumab therapy was effective at decreasing mortality and should be instituted early in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Petrak, Russell M; Skorodin, Nathan C; Van Hise, Nicholas W; Fliegelman, Robert M; Pinsky, Jonathan; Didwania, Vishal; Anderson, Michael; Diaz, Melina; Shah, Kairav; Chundi, Vishnu V; Hines, David W; Harting, Brian P; Sidwha, Kamo; Yu, Brian; Brune, Paul; Owaisi, Anjum; Beezhold, David; Kent, Joseph; Vais, Dana; Han, Alice; Gowda, Neethi; Sahgal, Nishi; Silverman, Jan; Stake, Jonathan; Nepomuceno, Jenie; Heddurshetti, Renuka",Clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918792/,390

METHODS Prodrugs were synthesized, complexed with PAMAM dendrimer, characterized via ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), nuclear magnatic resonance (NMR), and tested in vitro using rat plasma vs. saline control and in an in vivo rat and guinea pig pain model (modified Randall and Selitto test). RESULTS We demonstrated that complexation with dendrimer allowed the solubilization of the prodrugs for in vivo applications without the need for salt, and that the structural design of the morphine prodrugs allowed the controlled release of morphine which extended the action of morphine-induced analgesia in an animal pain model from 2 h (control) to 6 h (Morphine Prodrug A). CONCLUSION The concept of complexing/solubilizing appropriately designed esterase-sensitive prodrugs with dendrimer to enhance the sustained release of these drugs may be a useful pharmacokinetic strategy for a range of therapeutics.","Ward, Brent B; Huang, Baohua; Desai, Ankur; Cheng, Xue-Min; Vartanian, Mark; Zong, Hong; Shi, Xiangyang; Thomas, Thommey P; Kotlyar, Alina E; Van Der Spek, Abraham; Leroueil, Pascale R; Baker, James R",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-012-0869-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23054086/,390

In response, countries are implementing societal measures aimed at curtailing transmission of SARS-CoV-22,3. Despite these measures, the COVID-19 epidemic could still result in millions of deaths as local health facilities become overwhelmed4. Advances in malaria control this century have been largely due to distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)5, with many SSA countries having planned campaigns for 2020. In the present study, we use COVID-19 and malaria transmission models to estimate the impact of disruption of malaria prevention activities and other core health services under four different COVID-19 epidemic scenarios. If activities are halted, the malaria burden in 2020 could be more than double that of 2019. In Nigeria alone, reducing case management for 6 months and delaying LLIN campaigns could result in 81,000 (44,000-119,000) additional deaths. Mitigating these negative impacts is achievable, and LLIN distributions in particular should be prioritized alongside access to antimalarial treatments to prevent substantial malaria epidemics.","Sherrard-Smith, Ellie; Hogan, Alexandra B; Hamlet, Arran; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charlie; Winskill, Peter; Ali, Fatima; Mohammad, Audu B; Uhomoibhi, Perpetua; Maikore, Ibrahim; Ogbulafor, Nnenna; Nikau, Jamilu; Kont, Mara D; Challenger, Joseph D; Verity, Robert; Lambert, Ben; Cairns, Matthew; Rao, Bhargavi; Baguelin, Marc; Whittles, Lilith K; Lees, John A; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Knock, Edward S; Okell, Lucy; Slater, Hannah C; Ghani, Azra C; Walker, Patrick G T; Okoko, Okefu Oyale; Churcher, Thomas S",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1025-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770167/,390

The highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the cytostatic drugs was accomplished by PET-TiO2. Among the contaminants, TAM was the most easily removed, requiring 90 min for complete elimination, while CP showed the highest resistance to photocatalysis, not being completely removed after 6 h. Liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis was employed for the identification of several transformation products (TPs) and potential pathways were proposed. A total of seventy (70) TPs including thirty-four (34) novel ones detected in AOPs were identified. The ecotoxicity of the mixture of the cytostatic drugs and TPs formed during the photocatalytic treatment was evaluated using Daphnia magna assay and was associated with the occurrence of specific TPs during the treatment process. The follow-up ECOSAR (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship) analysis further elucidated that only minor chemical transformations, such as the hydroxylation or the oxidative opening of an aromatic ring system, could hamper the adverse effects of cytostatic drugs in aquatic species.

Biosimilars, which are biotechnologically manufactured products the same as reference biologicals, have actually now achieved a substantial proportion of the market in some regions but there are still doubters among patients and physicians who fear a loss of quality even if there is no evidence for this. A part of this problem can be explained by the nocebo effect but which furthermore also has a substantial medical importance. This effect is described and explained in this article. Psychosocial and context-related factors, such as the relationship between patient and physician, previous experience with treatment and treatment expectations can either improve or impair the efficacy of treatment interventions. These phenomena are commonly known as placebo and nocebo effects. As placebo and nocebo effects can influence the development of symptoms, the frequency of undesired events and the efficacy of treatment, it is decisive to know these effects and to develop strategies for prevention in order to optimize the treatment results. Although in recent years experimental studies have achieved substantial progress in the clarification of the psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms of placebo effects, detailed mechanisms of nocebo effects are still widely unexplored. An improved understanding of these mechanisms promises the development of user-friendly strategies for the clinical care to improve treatment results and patient satisfaction.","Braun, J; Tsiami, S; Buehring, B; Kiefer, D; Andreica, I; Baraliakos, X; Kiltz, U",Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-019-00729-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31802197/,390

Several growth factors and inflammatory stimuli are known to induce macropinocytosis, but its endogenous inhibitors have remained elusive. Stimulation of Roundabout receptors by Slit ligands inhibits directional migration of many cell types, including immune cells and cancer cells. We report that SLIT2 inhibits macropinocytosis in vitro and in vivo by inducing cytoskeletal changes in macrophages. In mice, SLIT2 attenuates the uptake of muramyl dipeptide, thereby preventing NOD2-dependent activation of NF-κB and consequent secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokine, CXCL1. Conversely, blocking the action of endogenous SLIT2 enhances CXCL1 secretion. SLIT2 also inhibits macropinocytosis in RAS-transformed cancer cells, thereby decreasing their survival in nutrient-deficient conditions which resemble tumor microenvironment. Our results identify SLIT2 as a physiological inhibitor of macropinocytosis and challenge the conventional notion that signals that enhance macropinocytosis negatively regulate cell migration, and vice versa.","Bhosle, Vikrant K; Mukherjee, Tapas; Huang, Yi-Wei; Patel, Sajedabanu; Pang, Bo Wen Frank; Liu, Guang-Ying; Glogauer, Michael; Wu, Jane Y; Philpott, Dana J; Grinstein, Sergio; Robinson, Lisa A",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17651-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807784/,390

The different timing of pandemic peak in geographically distinct locations creates a short window of response opportunity. Rapid dissemination of medical information from early affected areas to later ones is therefore crucial to optimise planning. Formulating the best system response for at-risk patient populations is especially complex. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are exposed to long-term immunosuppressive disease modifying treatments (DMTs) and, in theory, could be at increased risk of contracting the virus and developing complications. Social media, such as Twitter, can provide a global platform to rapidly share information and individual experiences. METHODS AND RESULTS This report summarizes the case experience of pwMS with COVID-19 infection in the first month of the pandemic as reported on Twitter using the #MSCOVID19 hashtag. 26 individual cases of COVID-19 in pwMS were reported from Europe and the United States of America. The cases involved a combination of relapsing and progressive MS phenotypes treated with a range of DMT (5 anti CD20 therapy, 4 cladribine, 4 fingolimod, 4 injectables, 3 alemtuzumab, 2 dimethyl fumarate, 2 untreated, 1 teriflunomide, 1 natalizumab). The cases shared present the earliest reported data on outcomes of COVID-19 infection in pwMS. Whilst limited, the cautiously reassuring nature of these early cases assisted in clinical management by allowing neurologists to continuously reassess their approach to DMT management.","Nesbitt, Cassie; Rath, Louise; Yeh, Wei Zhen; Zhong, Michael; Wesselingh, Robb; Monif, Mastura; Richards, Janene; Minh, Viet Bui; Jokubaitis, Vilija G; Skibina, Olga; Butzkueven, Helmut; van der Walt, Anneke",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629402/,390

This prompted a serosurvey of healthy dogs from around the state to determine the distribution of exposure risk and to provide insight into serovar epidemiology in the region. In addition, a convenience sample of sera from injured raccoons was also tested, and clinical serological data from the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory were examined. The proportion of dogs with an antibody titre (>or=1:100) to any serovar was 27/158 (17.1%, 95% CI 11.6-23.9), and that proportion among raccoons was 22/115 (19.1%, 95% CI 12.4-27.5) suggesting that the potential for exposure in Washington state is not uncommon. The most frequently detected serovars in healthy dogs were Autumnalis, Icterohemorrhagiae and Canicola, in clinical canine samples Autumnalis, Bratislava and Pomona were more frequent and in sick or injured raccoons Autumnalis, and Pomona were most frequently detected. Clinical canine serology demonstrated a late summer-fall seasonality that was consistent with other reports. An outbreak of canine leptospirosis occurred during 2004-2006 and was located primarily in western Washington counties, as were three reported human cases in 2005. Canine leptospirosis surveillance is an important tool for detecting human risk of exposure and may provide insights into which serovars are currently of clinical importance.","Davis, M A; Evermann, J F; Petersen, C R; VancerSchalie, J; Besser, T E; Huckabee, J; Daniels, J B; Hancock, D D; Leslie, M; Baer, R",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01137.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18631236/,390

Modeling cDC development is both crucial to study cDCs and harness their potential in immunotherapy. Here we addressed whether cDCs could differentiate in response to trophic cues delivered by mesenchymal components of the hematopoietic niche where they physiologically develop and maintain. We found that expression of the membrane bound form of human FLT3L and SCF together with CXCL12 in a bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell line is sufficient to induce the contact-dependent specification of both type 1 and type 2 cDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Engraftment of these engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs) together with CD34+ HSPCs creates an in vivo synthetic niche in the dermis of immunodeficient mice. Cell-to-cell contact between HSPCs and stromal cells within these organoids drive the local specification of cDCs and CD123+AXL+CD327+ pre/AS-DCs. cDCs generated in vivo display higher levels of resemblance with human blood cDCs unattained by in vitro generated subsets. Altogether, eMSCs provide a novel and unique platform recapitulating the full spectrum of cDC subsets enabling their functional characterization in vivo.","Anselmi, Giorgio; Vaivode, Kristine; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Bourdely, Pierre; Missolo-Koussou, Yoann; Newell, Evan; Hickman, Oliver; Wood, Kristie; Saxena, Alka; Helft, Julie; Ginhoux, Florent; Guermonprez, Pierre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/835223,390

Methods: 3,165 ( 25%) of US urology providers, representing 48 states and territories, participate in the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry, which collects data via automated extraction from electronic health record systems. We analyzed trends in PCa care delivery from 156 practices contributing data in 2019 and 2020. Risk stratification was based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason, and clinical T-stage, and we used a natural language processing algorithm to determine Gleason and T-stage from unstructured clinical notes. The primary outcome was mean weekly visit volume by PCa patients per practice (visits defined as all MD and mid-level visits, telehealth and face-toface), and we compared each week in 2020 through week 44 (November 1) to the corresponding week in 2019. Results: There were 267,691 PCa patients in AQUA who received care between 2019 and 2020. From mid-March to early November, 2020 (week 10 - week 44) the magnitude of the decline and recovery varied by risk stratum, with the steepest drops for low-risk PCa (Table). For 2020, overall mean visits per day (averaged weekly) were similar to 2019 for the first 9 weeks (25). Visits declined to week 14 (18.19;a 31% drop from 2019), recovered to 2019 levels by week 23, and declined steadily to 11.89 (a 58% drop from 2019) as of week 44, the cut off of this analysis. Conclusions: Access to care for men with PCa was sharply curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the impact was less for men with high-risk disease compared to those with low-risk disease, visits even for highrisk individuals were down nearly one-third and continued to fall through November. This study provides real-world evidence on the magnitude of decline in PCa care across risk groups. The impact of this decline on cancer outcomes should be followed closely.","Cooperberg, M.

170713,Reciprocal Abstracts,2021,"Background Effective autonomous exoskeletons will need to be useful at a variety of walking speeds, but we do not know how optimal exoskeleton assistance should change with speed. Optimal exoskeleton assistance may increase with speed similar to biological torque changes or a well-tuned assistance profile may be effective at a variety of speeds. Methods We optimized hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance to reduce metabolic cost for three participants walking at 1.0 m/s, 1.25 m/s and 1.5 m/s. We measured metabolic cost, muscle activity, exoskeleton assistance and kinematics. We performed two tailed paired t-tests to determine significance. Results Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking compared to wearing the exoskeleton with no torque applied by 26%, 47% and 50% at 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 m/s, respectively. For all three participants, optimized exoskeleton ankle torque was the smallest for slow walking, while hip and knee torque changed slightly with speed in ways that varied across participants. Total applied positive power increased with speed for all three participants, largely due to increased joint velocities, which consistently increased with speed. Conclusions Exoskeleton assistance is effective at a range of speeds and is most effective at medium and fast walking speeds. Exoskeleton assistance was less effective for slow walking, which may explain the limited success in reducing metabolic cost for patient populations through exoskeleton assistance. Exoskeleton designers may have more success when targeting activities and groups with faster walking speeds. Speed-related changes in optimized exoskeleton assistance varied by participant, indicating either the benefit of participant-specific tuning or that a wide variety of torque profiles are similarly effective.","Bryan, Gwendolyn M.; Franks, Patrick W.; Song, Seungmoon; Voloshina, Alexandra S.; Reyes, Ricardo; O’Donovan, Meghan P.; Gregorczyk, Karen N.; Collins, Steven H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437212,390

To better understand lifestyle experience, study 1 adopts a phenomenological approach to conceptualize lifestyle experience that is generated within consumers in a hotel setting. It is discovered that sense of community and culture is the spirit of a lifestyle experience that lives up to its name. In addition, it is uncovered that lifestyle experiences essentially meets consumer's higher-ordered psychological social needs. Studies 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate the development of a scale, LHEI—Lifestyle Hotel Experience Index, that captures consumer's lifestyle hotel experience. Such scale can be easily adapted to measure lifestyle experiences in other contexts. This paper contributes to current research by conceptualizing and quantifying the novel lifestyle experience. It contributes to the industry as a wakeup call for more sustainable and consumer-centric strategies in value co-creation.","Li, Yizhi Kandampully Jay Liu Stephanie Q.; Bujisic, Milos",Tourism Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104388,390

Method: a scoping review, followed by meta-analysis, conducted in the BVS, EMBASE, PUBMED, CINAHL, PsycINFo, SCOPUS and Web of Science information sources. The review protocol is registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under number under number CRD42020192918. Searches in electronic databases were carried out from 22 to 27 July 2020The data were analyzed and synthesized in a narrative fashion. Results: a total of 31 studies were included in the review; of these, 12 were included in the meta-analysis. The Nursing professionals presented higher anxiety indexes than the other health professionals. The following stood out in the interventions for the management of anxiety: emotional support, social support, educational campaign, implementation of safety policies, and adoption of a positive coping style. Conclusion: the evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of Nursing professionals experienced high anxiety levels, which interfered with COVID-19 prevention and control. Therefore, it becomes necessary to establish intervention protocols to reduce anxiety, with clear and objective language, favoring emotional support, positive coping techniques, and a welcoming work environment, in addition to implementing policies that ensure protective measures against COVID-19.","Departamento de Enfermagem Materno-Infantil e PsiquiátricaPereira, Caroline Figueira; Departamento de Enfermagem Materno-Infantil e PsiquiátricaVargas, Divane de; Evangelista, Priscila Araujo; Ito, Victor Daichi; Aguilar, Thiago Faustino",Texto & contexto enferm,https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-265x-tce-2021-0015,390

The objective is to determine the scope and reuse capacity of the available data, determine the number of datasets and their free access, the proportion in reusable download formats, the main providers, their publication chronology, and to verify their scientific provenance. On the other hand, we also define possible relationships between the publication of datasets and the main pandemics that have occurred during the last 10 years. The results obtained highlight that only 52% of the datasets are related to scientific research, while an even smaller fraction (15%) are reusable. There is also an upward trend in the publication of datasets, especially related to the impact of the main epidemics, as clearly confirmed for the Ebola virus, Zika, SARS-CoV, H1N1, H1N5, and especially the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Finally, it is observed that the search engine has not yet implemented adequate methods for filtering and monitoring the datasets.

In this paper, a preliminary implementation of a system monitoring the fetus heart rate has been designed and implemented as a mobile wearable measuring system with remote sensing. The proposed implementation turns out to be an efficient combination of simplicity and cost effectiveness and is accompanied with preliminary accurate measurements of fetus heart rate. The developed board uses an ESP-8266 transceiver module and is programmed to transmit the data efficiently to a remote server station using a IEEE 802.11 b/g/n - based wireless network.

Here we argue that such non-appearance of quantum memory is specific to those particular observers which do not incorporate the presence of wave in their trajectory. In fact a detector, associated with a frame which is affected by the shock, can not be trivial in terms of its response. We explicitly show that the later type of frame detects particle in the shock wave Minkowski vacuum which is the effect of shock. Therefore this quantum memory is very special to specific class of observers as far as Dray-'t Hooft spacetime is concerned.

In contrast, deep sequencing of the T Cell Receptor (TCR) repertoire offers a global view whose theoretical sensitivity is limited only by the depth of available sampling. However, assignment of antigen specificities within TCR repertoires has become a bottleneck. Here, we combine antigen-driven expansion, deep TCR sequencing and a novel analysis framework to show that homologous ‘Clusters of Expanded TCRs (CETs)’ can be confidently identified without cell isolation, and assigned to antigen against a background of non-specific clones. We show that clonotypes within each CET respond to the same epitope, and that protein antigens stimulate multiple CETs reactive to constituent peptides. Finally, we demonstrate the personalized assignment of antigen-specificity to rare clones within fully-diverse unexpanded repertoires.

178151,Video Visit: A New Tool for Diabetes Post-hospitalization Follow-up,2021,"The portal of entry for coronavirus is the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Severity, organ manifestations and outcome of COVID-19 are determined by the viral load, burdening the attacked organism. Condition of the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa and the capacity of their defence system are crucial for virus penetration, fusion with epithelial cells and replication. Direct neural spread, penetration into the deeper airways and spread through the lymph nodes depend on these functions. Virus binding and engulfment is an active process. The virus penetrates the endosomes of the epithelial cell, by enzymatic transfer where it is recognised by natural defence agents and triggers the first defence responses. These alarm the entire immune system and trigger a whole chain of inflammatory and enzymatic defence processes (cytokine and bradykinin storm) proportional to the viral load. The severity endpoint of COVID-19 pathology is alveolitis, cerebral vasculitis and intestinal damage, often with fatal outcome. The airway mucosa defends itself by secreting surface factors and recruiting and activating cells of the adaptive immune system. An important element of the latter is the early appearance of secretory IgA in the mucosa. The viral invasion can be prevented by application of a nasal spray containing carrageenan, which engages the virus and prevents its attachment by the gel-forming property of carrageenan. This effect has worked in previous virus epidemics and the first COVID-19 experiences confirm its protective role. © 2021 Literatura Medica Publishing House.

178654,The Inaccuracy of Commercial Home Hemoglobin A1c Tests,2021,"Introduction: SARS-CoV2, first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan as COVID-19 causing respiratory illness, rapidly evolved into a pandemic owing to its very high infectivity. There is insufficient evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of COVID-19 infection, and the reports on whether smoking increases or reduces the risk of respiratory infections, are contradictory. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine the effects of nicotine consumption on the infectivity of COVID-19. Methods: We performed in silico computer simulation-based study. The structures of SARS-CoV2spike ectodomain, and its receptor ACE2, were obtained from PDB. The structure of nicotine and its metabolites NNK and NNAL were obtained from the PubChem chemical database. After optimization, they were interacted using AutoDock 4.2, to see the effect of nicotine, NNK, or NNAL presence on the docking of viral spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Results: ACE2 vs spike protein interaction results were used as a control (ZDOCK score 1498.484, with four hydrogen bonds). The NNK+ACE2 vs spike protein docking formed 10 hydrogen bonds with the highest ZDOCK score of 1515.564. NNAL+ ACE2 vs spike protein interaction formed eleven hydrogen bonds with the ZDOCK score of 1499.371. Nicotine+ACE2 vs spike protein docking showed the lowest ZDOCK score of 1496.302 and formed 8 hydrogen bonds. Whereas, NNK+spike vs ACE2 interaction had a ZDOCK score of 1498.490 and formed eight hydrogen bonds. NNAL+spike vs ACE2 docking formed eleven hydrogen bonds with a ZDOCK score of 1498.482. And Nicotine+spike vs ACE2 interaction showed a ZDOCK score of 1498.488 and formed 9 hydrogen bonds. Conclusions: The binding of nicotine to either spike of virus or its receptor ACE2 is not affecting the viral docking with the receptor. But binding of NNK, a metabolite of nicotine, is facilitating the viral docking with its receptor indicating that smoking may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection.","Jamal, Q. M.

183732,Risks from microbes on the rise: reasons why and ways to prevent future epidemics.,2004,"A conundrum of wildlife tourism is balancing wildlife conservation and tourist satisfaction. Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) are a flagship species for biodiversity and there is worldwide interest in gorilla trekking safaris. This tourism provides substantial revenue to the government and local communities for gorilla protection, but puts them in danger of zoonotic diseases. To minimize disease transmission, health guidelines are in place for visitors whereby they are asked to remain 7 m from the endangered apes and stay in a cohesive group. Unfortunately, tourists often do not follow these rules and consequently their behavior puts gorillas at risk. The pre‐trekking messages presented to tourists in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda were changed to determine if the way messages are stated affects visitor adherence to rules. Tourists (n = 389) either received strategic messages that were positively or negatively framed in relation to expectations to follow specific rules to adhere to health guidelines, and tourist behavior was measured, such as the nearest distance they were to gorillas, and their cohesiveness. Using generalized linear mixed models, it was found that framing messages affected tourist behavior. Tourists who received a negatively framed message had a higher adherence to rules than those who received a positive or control message. They were 75% further from the gorillas (7.26 vs. 4.52 m), more cohesive (0.40 vs. 0.81 m to each other), and approached the gorillas less (0.34 vs. 1.32 times) than the control message. These findings demonstrate that communicating in different ways promotes changes in behavior by tourists, which reduces the chances of epizootic respiratory infections being passed to vulnerable animals. Strategic message framing should be widely considered as a cost‐effective mechanism to promote behavior change during ecotourism.","Gessa, Simplicious J.; Rothman, Jessica M.",Conservation Science and Practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.515,390

To verify MDB financial additionality, this study examines whether the PPI projects with multilateral support have significantly larger investment commitments than the total average projects by using the PPI database of the World Bank for 1996–2020. The empirical analysis identifies MDB financial additionality, in that the larger investment commitments of multilateral-supported projects beyond the average are confirmed in any income levels and regions in host countries and any sectors and types in the projects. In particular, MDB financial additionality is valid even in low-income countries where private finance is still too premature to be available. In the host countries where their government effectiveness is in the poorest edge, however, MDB financial additionality loses its significance, thereby requiring the governance enhancement and capacity building in the host countries and innovative blended finance instruments for its additionality to work.","Yasumura, Kota",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158412,390

Eighty-nine cases with COVID-19 pneumonia were divided into two groups according to the level of poor prognostic criteria (blood lymphocyte count <800/µL or C-reactive protein >10x upper limit of normal value or D-dimer >1000 ng/mL). The severity of pulmonary parenchymal findings was scored using two separate scoring systems previously as well as a third separate scoring system, namely the “modified CT severity scoring”. The cut-off point for severe infection was investigated by comparing the scores of the groups with and without severe infection. Results: All three scoring systems were significantly higher in the group with severe infection compared to those without severe infections. A modified CT score above 3.4 accompanies at least one of the poor prognosis findings (sensitivity 77.6%, specificity 61%).

As a result, activities that draw large crowds together so that people can access public services are inevitable. Several cities that have been declared as smart cities in Indonesia have made a breakthrough by making use of information and communication technology (ICT)-based applications. This can be of great help for societies during pandemics. ICT has been able to help citizens perform various activities from home with the help of applications. This study aims to identify various applications that support the implementation of the concept of a smart city. This applies particularly to those applications that are based on ICT that can tackle the unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic and make recommendations regarding future developments. The data collected for this study were analyzed using secondary sources obtained from various clusters of literature, the internet, and social media. In addition, primary data was gathered from discussion forums. This paper employs a qualitative approach with qualitative descriptive data analysis techniques and hierarchical cluster analysis. Qualitative descriptive analysis was utilized to explore the conditions of smart cities, the regional conditions of the pandemic, and smart city applications more generally.

Five anchor residues were identified in this study by measuring the peptide-binding affinities of substituted Qdm peptides in experiments with purified recombinant Qa-1(b). A candidate peptide-binding motif was determined by sequence analysis of peptides eluted from Qa-1 that had been folded in the presence of random peptide libraries or pools of Qdm derivatives randomized at specific anchor positions. The results indicate that Qa-1(b) can bind a diverse repertoire of peptides but that Qdm has an optimal primary structure for binding Qa-1(b). Flow cytometry experiments with Qa-1(b) tetramers and NK target cell lysis assays demonstrated that CD94/NKG2A discriminates between Qa-1(b) complexes containing peptides with substitutions at nonanchor positions P4, P5, or P8. Our findings suggest that it may be difficult for viruses to generate decoy peptides that mimic Qdm and raise the possibility that competitive replacement of Qdm with other peptides may provide a novel mechanism for activation of NK cells.","Kraft, Jennifer R.; Vance, Russell E.; Pohl, Jan; Martin, Amy M.; Raulet, David H.; Jensen, Peter E.",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193274/,390
186182,Utilizing Telemedicine for Group Visit Provider Encounters: A Feasibility and Acceptability Study.,2020,"In the course of systematic analysis of protein sequences containing the purine NTP-binding motif, a new superfamily was delineated which included 25 established or putative helicases of Escherichia coli, yeast, insects, mammals, pox- and herpesviruses, a yeast mitochondrial plasmid and three groups of positive strand RNA viruses. These proteins contained 7 distinct highly conserved segments two of which corresponded to the ""A"" and ""B"" sites of the NTP-binding motif. Typical of the new superfamily was an abridged consensus for the ""A"" site, GxGKS/T, instead of the classical G/AxxxxGKS/T. Secondary structure predictions indicated that each of the conserved segments might constitute a separate structural unit centering at a beta-turn. All previously characterized mutations impairing the function of the yeast helicase RAD3 in DNA repair mapped to one of the conserved segments. A degree of similarity was revealed between the consensus pattern of conserved amino acid residues derived for the new superfamily and that of another recently described protein superfamily including a different set of prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral (putative) helicases.","Gorbalenya, A E; Koonin, E V; Donchenko, A P; Blinov, V M",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC318027/,390

MATERIALS AND METHODS The total number of newly diagnosed cases of oral submucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers, recorded at two dental institutional settings before lockdown (January-March 2020) and after lockdown (June-August 2020), were included retrospectively and compared. RESULTS The study included a total of 797 cases at both institutions. At Institution-I, a total of 312 cases were recorded before the lockdown, and 63 cases were recorded after the lockdown. At Institution-II, a total of 311 cases were reported before lockdown, and 111 cases were recorded after lockdown. Comparisons between the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown data yielded a significant change in the proportions of oral sub-mucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers at both institutions (Chi-square test; p < 0.001). Following the lockdown, a substantial reduction was observed in the proportion of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) cases at both institutions, and the proportion of oral cancers increased at both institutions. There was a significant difference between the proportions of cases reported before lockdown at both institutions (p < 0.001). However, after-lockdown, no such differences were noted (p = 0.69); the absence of significance could most likely be due to the low sample size or low-power during the post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION The oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral cancer (OC) patient volumes reduced substantially following lockdown. During the post-lockdown period, the proportion of oral cancers increased, whereas the proportion of OSMF cases decreased. Results indicate that OPMD and oral cancer patients were impacted differently by the lockdown. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study provides insight into the impact of lockdown and highlights the importance of reestablishing oral oncology-related patient care. A vital discussion is also provided on useful compensatory strategies that may reduce delays during the ongoing crisis. How to cite this article: Panta P, Reddy P, Misra SR, et al.

A literature review was conducted to assess the length of epidemiological outbreak investigations in Europe in peer-reviewed publications. We determined time intervals between outbreak declaration to hypothesis generation, and hypothesis generation to availability of results from an analytical study. Outbreaks were classified into two groups: those with a public health impact across regions within a country and requiring national coordination (level 3) and those with a severe or catastrophic impact requiring direction at national level (levels 4 and 5). Investigations in Europe published between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed. We identified 86 papers for review: 63 level 3 and 23 level 4 and 5 investigations. Time intervals were ascertained from 55 papers. The median period for completion of an analytical study was 15 days (range: 4-32) for levels 4 and 5 and 31 days (range: 9-213) for level 3 investigations. Key factors influencing the speed of completing analytical studies were outbreak level, severity of infection and study design.

188942,Recognizing and managing emerging infectious diseases in the emergency department.,2018,"Within the hematopoietic lineage, the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CD66 reacts with cells of the granulocyte lineage, but not with the majority of progenitor cells from human bone marrow. Our previous studies have shown that CD66 binds specifically to at least three carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) superfamily members, ie, CEA itself, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), and CGM1, but not to CGM6 (NCA-95). In this report, we show that CD66 will also identify the biliary glycoproteins (BGP). A full-length cDNA for the BGPc molecule (a cytoplasmic splice variant of BGPa) was isolated by expression cloning using the CD66 MoAbs. This protein has an identical extracellular and transmembrane sequence to BGPa with one N-terminal IgV like domain, three IgC-like extracellular domains (A1, B1, and A2), plus a transmembrane domain, but the cytoplasmic domain is spliced by 53 nucleotides. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments show that this splice variant can be detected in colonic carcinoma cell lines, in primary colonic adenocarcinomas, and in myeloid and B-cell lines to varying degrees. Quantitative analyses of BGPc RNA expression by RNase protection indicate that abundant levels occur only in the colonic, but not in the hematopoietic, cell lines tested. Studies presented here show that BGPc mediates homotypic adhesion and suggest that the cytoplasmic splicing does not alter the initial homotypic adhesion properties of BGPa.","Watt, S M; Fawcett, J; Murdoch, S J; Teixeira, A M; Gschmeissner, S E; Hajibagheri, N M; Simmons, D L",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8018919/,390
190030,"Anti-coagulation in COVID-19: Dare I Give, Dare I Don't!",2021-08-01,"The carbohydrate parts of cell surface glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans constitute receptors for many enveloped as well as non-enveloped human viruses. The majority of viral receptors of carbohydrate nature are negatively charged, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or glycans containing sialic acid. Not uncommonly, virus-carbohydrate interactions are responsible for specific tissue tropism, where the affinity of influenza virus for glycans in the respiratory tract containing (a2-6)-linked sialic acid is an important example. Similarly, the number and spacing of sulfates may guide viruses to optimal GAG molecules, although this remains unproven on tissue level. A further understanding of structure and tissue distribution of carbohydrate virus receptors and their viral ligands is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis of such viruses. Also neutral glycans such as histo-blood group substances may function as virus receptors. Here, natural resistance to a given viral disease may occur in a human subpopulation due to lack of such receptors caused by deletion-mutants in critical human genes. As regards antiviral applications, the receptor-destroying enzymes, in contrast to receptor binding proteins, at the surface of, for example, influenza virus have proven to be an excellent target for intervention, which is why sialic acid analogues are now in clinical use both for prophylaxis and treatment.","Olofsson, Sigvard; Bergström, Tomas",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16019714/,390

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective multicenter study of consecutive patients over the age of 18 years with suspected COVID-19 who were transported from home over the course of 3 months after telephone interviews with dispatchers. We analyzed clinical and epidemiologic variables and comorbidities in relation to death within 2 days of the call. Using data from the development cohort, we built a risk model by means of logistic regression analysis of categorical variables that were independently associated with 2-day mortality. The scale was validated first in a validation cohort in the same province and then in a cohort in a different province. RESULTS A total of 2320 patients were included. The mean age was 79 years, and 49.8% were women. The overall 2-day mortality rate was 22.6% (376 deaths of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection). The model included the following factors: age, location (rural location as a protective factor), institutionalization, desaturation, lung sounds (rhonchi), and altered mental status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for death within 2 days was 0.763 (95% CI, 0.725-0.802; P .001). Mortality in patients at high risk (more than 2.4 points on the scale) was 60%. CONCLUSION This risk scale derived from information available to an emergency dispatch center is applicable to patients with suspected COVID-19. It can stratify patients by risk of early death (within 2 days), possibly helping with decision making regarding whether to transport from home or what means of transport to use, and destination.","Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco; Sanz-García, Ancor; Alberdi Iglesias, Ana; Ortega Rabbione, Guillermo; Del Pozo Vegas, Carlos; de la Torre-Díez, Isabel; Fernández Bayón, Germán; Delgado Benito, Juan Francisco; Gómez-Escolar Pérez, Marta; García Cortés, José Javier; López-Izquierdo, Raúl",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251139/,390

Advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. Thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. Most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. A more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. In addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases.

After RSV infection, both class I- and class II-restricted CTLps were detected by day 4 or 5 postinfection (p.i.). Peak CTLp frequencies were detected by day 7 p.i. The class II-restricted CTLp frequencies in the BAL following RSV infection were less than class I-restricted CTLp frequencies through day 14 p.i., during which class I-restricted CTLp frequencies remained elevated, but then declined by 48 days p.i. The frequencies of class II-restricted CTLps in the BAL were 2- to 10-fold less than those of class I-restricted CTLps. For spleen cells, frequencies of both MHC class I- and II-restricted CTLps to live RSV were similar. In contrast, class II-restricted CTLps predominated in FI-RSV-vaccinated mice. RSV challenge of vaccinated mice resulted in an increase in the frequency of class I-restricted CTLps at day 3 p.i. but did not enhance class II-restricted CTLp frequencies. These studies demonstrate differences in the CTLp response to live RSV infection compared with FI-RSV immunization and help define possible mechanisms of enhanced disease after FI-RSV immunization. In addition, these studies provide a quantitative means to address potential vaccine candidates by examining both MHC class I- and II-restricted CTLp frequencies.","Tripp, R A; Anderson, L J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9765442/,390
192825,[The influence of corona related factors on acute psychiatric admissions].,2021,"Discrete RNA secondary and higher-order structures, typically local in extent, play a fundamental role in RNA virus replication. Using new bioinformatics analysis methods, we have identified genome-scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) in many genera and families of positive-strand animal and plant RNA viruses. There was remarkably variability between genera that possess this characteristic; for example, hepaciviruses in the family Flaviviridae show evidence for extensive internal base-pairing throughout their coding sequences that was absent in both the related pestivirus and flavivirus genera. Similar genus-associated variability was observed in the Picornaviridae, the Caliciviridae, and many plant virus families. The similarity in replication strategies between genera in each of these families rules out a role for GORS in a fundamentally conserved aspect of this aspect of the virus life cycle. However, in the Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Caliciviridae, the existence of GORS correlated strongly with the ability of each genus to persist in their natural hosts. This raises the intriguing possibility of a role for GORS in the modulation of innate intracellular defense mechanisms (and secondarily, the acquired immune system) triggered by double-stranded RNA, analogous in function to the expression of structured RNA transcripts by large DNA viruses. Irrespective of function, the observed evolutionary conservation of GORS in many viruses imposes a considerable constraint on genome plasticity and the consequent narrowing of sequence space in which neutral drift can occur. These findings potentially reconcile the rapid evolution of RNA viruses over short periods with the documented examples of extreme conservatism evident from their intimate coevolution with their hosts.","Simmonds, Peter; Tuplin, Andrew; Evans, David J",RNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15273323/,390

METHODS A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA format in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect electronic databases between January and May 2020. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies. RESULTS A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Professionals' mental health and mental functions were compromised, being especially affected those professionals on the front line of battle against the virus. However, these stats were below the general population data. Although there is wide variability of results, medium-high levels of anxiety (26,5%-44,6%), depression (8,1%-25%), concern and insomnia are detected (23,6%-38%).

The molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced susceptibility of elderly populations are not known, and robust animal models are needed that recapitulate the increased pathogenic phenotype noted with increasing age. Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant spike glycoproteins that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic. The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies. The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals. In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12-month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/61/03 strain or early-human-phase GZ02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains. This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic spike glycoproteins will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly.","Rockx, Barry; Sheahan, Timothy; Donaldson, Eric; Harkema, Jack; Sims, Amy; Heise, Mark; Pickles, Raymond; Cameron, Mark; Kelvin, David; Baric, Ralph",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507479/,390

In addition, cell lines stably expressing the E gene under the CMV promoter have been developed. The Sindbis replicon vector and the ectopic TGEV E protein did not interfere with the rescue of infectious TGEV from full-length cDNA. Recombinant TGEV deficient in the nonessential 3a and 3b genes and the essential E gene (rTGEV-Delta3abDeltaE) was successfully rescued in these cell lines. rTGEV-Delta3abDeltaE reached high titers (10(7) PFU/ml) in baby hamster kidney cells expressing porcine aminopeptidase N (BHK-pAPN), the cellular receptor for TGEV, using Sindbis replicon and reached titers up to 5 x 10(5) PFU/ml in cells stably expressing E protein under the control of the CMV promoter. The virus titers were proportional to the E protein expression level. The rTGEV-Delta3abDeltaE virions produced in the packaging cell line showed the same morphology and stability under different pHs and temperatures as virus derived from the full-length rTGEV genome, although a delay in virus assembly was observed by electron microscopy and virus titration in the complementation system in relation to the wild-type virus. These viruses were stably grown for >10 passages in the E(+) packaging cell lines.

We used an extended Behavioural Marker Risk Index (BMRI) to measure teamwork and communication, because a relationship has previously been documented between BMRI scores and surgical patient outcomes. METHODS Trained observers scored general surgical teams in the OR at the two study hospitals before and after MORSim, using the BMRI.

Dawson (1990), Virology 174, 145-157) for the TMV OM and U1 strains, respectively, has been reexamined and mapped to position 4838 for strain U1. Sequences of the MP and CP sgRNA promoters were delineated by deletion analysis. The boundaries for minimal and full MP sgRNA promoter activity were localized between -35 and +10 and -95 and +40, respectively, relative to the transcription start site. The minimal CP sgRNA promoter was mapped between -69 and +12, whereas the boundaries of the fully active promoter were between -157 and +54. Computer analysis predicted two stem-loop structures (SL1 and SL2) upstream of the MP sgRNA transcription start site. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis suggested that SL1 secondary structure, but not its sequence, was required for MP sgRNA promoter activity, whereas a 39-nt deletion removing most of the SL2 region increased MP sgRNA accumulation fourfold. Computer-predicted folding of the fully active CP sgRNA promoter revealed one long stem-loop structure. Deletion analysis suggested that the upper part of this stem-loop, located upstream of the transcription start site, was essential for transcription and that the lower part of the stem had an enhancing role.","Grdzelishvili, V Z; Chapman, S N; Dawson, W O; Lewandowski, D J",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11017798/,390

200416,Indicators and prediction models for the severity of Covid-19,2021,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide. The major challenge for current antiviral treatment is the elevated drug resistance that occurs via rapid viral mutagenesis. In this study, we developed AAV vectors to simultaneously deliver two or three shRNAs targeting different HBV-related genes. These vectors showed markedly better antiviral effects than ones that delivered a single shRNA in vitro. A dual shRNA expression vector (AAV-157i/1694i), which simultaneously expressed two shRNAs targeted the S and X genes of HBV, reduced HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA levels by 87+/-4, 80.3+/-2.6 and 86.2+/- 7% respectively, eight days post-transduction. In a mouse model of prophylactic treatment, HBsAg and HBeAg were reduced to undetectable levels and the serum HBV DNA level was reduced by at least 100 fold. These results indicate that AAV-157i/1694i generates potent anti-HBV effects and that the strategy of constructing multi-shRNA expression vectors may lead to enhanced anti-HBV efficacy and overcome the evading mechanism of the virus and thus the development of drug resistance.

201072,An Aspect of Kumbh Mela Massive Gathering and COVID-19,2021,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection of natural interferon producing cells (NIPCs) impairs the induction of interferon (IFN)-alpha and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), thereby preventing both their autocrine maturation and the paracrine maturation of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). The present study shows that the PCV2-mediated inhibition of NIPCs was mediated by viral DNA, although it was independent of virus replication. The inhibitory effect of PCV2 DNA was more diversified than if it had simply targeted CpG-ODN-induced cytokines (IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, IL-12). A broad spectrum inhibition was noted, affecting responses induced by toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 and TLR9 agonists, as well as viruses including pseudorabies virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and classical swine fever virus. From these results, it would appear that PCV2 DNA can induce a dominant negative signal influencing independent pattern recognition receptor-induced activation cascades. Despite a concomitant internalization of PCV2 DNA and CpG-ODNs, no colocalization was observed, indicating that PCV2 DNA and CPG-ODNs may not target the same receptor. This study describes a novel modulation of the innate immune response, which would render the host more susceptible to secondary or concomitant microbial infections.","Vincent, Isabelle E; Balmelli, Carole; Meehan, Brian; Allan, Gordon; Summerfield, Artur; McCullough, Kenneth C",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17038051/,390

OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to examine the effects of radiotherapy on neovascular AMD. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group trials register) on The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004) and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (May 2004). We also wrote to investigators of trials included in the review to ask if they were aware of any other studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials in which radiotherapy was compared to another treatment, sham treatment, low dosage irradiation or no treatment in people with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to AMD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers independently extracted the data. Relative risks were combined using a random effects model. The percentage of the variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity, rather than sampling error, was estimated using I2. MAIN RESULTS Eleven trials randomising a total of 1078 people were included in this review. All trials used a similar method of delivering the radiotherapy treatment (external beam). Dosage ranged from 7.5 to 24 Gy. Most trials found effects (not always significant) that favoured treatment. However, there was considerable inconsistency in the results between trials (I2 > 50%). As only 11 trials were included in the review and only some of these trials provided data for each outcome our ability to determine the causes of the heterogeneity between trials was limited. Subgroup analyses did not reveal any statistically significant interactions although with small numbers of trials in each subgroup (range two to four) this was not surprising. There was some indication that trials with no sham irradiation reported a greater effect of treatment as did trials with a greater percentage of participants with classic choroidal neovascularisation. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS This review currently does not provide evidence that external beam radiotherapy is an effective treatment for neovascular AMD. If further trials are to be considered to evaluate radiotherapy in AMD then adequate masking of the control group must be considered. Given the recent evidence that most lesions are amenable to treatment with photodynamic therapy if identified at a small lesion size, trials evaluating radiotherapy against photodynamic therapy are warranted.","Sivagnanavel, V; Evans, J R; Ockrim, Z; Chong, V",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495075/,390

Those performing aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation have been designated by the Centers for Disease Control as increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Evaluation of aerosolizing containing barriers for intubation has been limited to date. Some have raised concerns about the universal use of these devices and their possible iatrogenic side effects. It is clear that in time periods of atypical practice that quality and outcome review are critical to addressing novel problems as they arise. An unusual set of injury patterns associated with videolaryngoscopy lead to further evaluation and reconsideration of these devices in our own military department.

(Special issue on diabetes and COVID-19: the IDF perspective.),2020,"OBJECTIVE The disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 has led to severe situations and mortality in elderly people. The objective of this study was to describe the collaboration between hospital professionals and nursing homes when applying preventive measures for the transmission of COVID-19 and in the assistance of institutionalized patients. METHODS A descriptive study was carried out in 4 centers with information collected by researchers in two moments of the COVID-19 pandemic. The information collected was related to the resources and knowledge of infection prevention, details about face-to-face and telematic assistance from the hospital team, as well as material, drugs provided, and clinical results. The variables studied were described by means of percentages, absolute frequencies and ratios; statistical chi-square tests and McNemar'test were used. RESULTS The study was conducted in 4 centers with a total of 640 residents and an initial occupancy between 62% and 85%. Differences were found regarding the ratio of staff and knowledge of preventive measures of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was improved in the second period of the study. The number of face-to-face visits (from 5 to 22) and telematic visits (between 42 and 109 patients) were different in the 4 nursing homes, as well as the material provided, adapted to the needs of each center. The percentage of infected patients ranged from 6.1% to 90.2%, and the accumulated mortality in the second period ranged from 15.38% to 38.35% of the residents at the beginning of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The collaboration between the professionals of healthcare centers and the hospital, adapted to the needs of each center, has allowed to improve the assistance to the residents and the coordination between the professionals, optimizing the available resources.","Sáez-López, Pilar; Arredondo-Provecho, Ana Belén",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850095/,390

This project was conducted from May 6 to 12, 2003. A total of 126 nurses working in hospitals participated in this study. A conceptual model was developed, and the author designed a questionnaire to test this model. The developed model explained 32% of the variance in nurses' willingness to provide care for SARS patients. Nurses' levels of agreement with general SARS infection control measures, self-treatment of relief of fever and cough, necessity to close Hoping and Jenchi hospitals, nurses' physical health status, and holding a bachelor's degree were statistically significant predictors of nurses' willingness to care for SARS patients. Based on these findings, suggestions and study limitations are discussed.","Tzeng, Huey-Ming",Outcomes management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14618778/,390
202694,COVID-19 and neurosurgery: Time for triage,2020,"Rather than aiming to produce more 'rational' or more 'other-regarding' citizen judgements (the outcome of which is uncertain), deliberative democratic exercises should be re-designed to maximise democratic participation. To do this, they must involve citizens and experts, a novel arrangement that will benefit both cohorts. For the former, a more inclusive form of deliberation will offer an opportunity to contribute to political discussion and be listened to by people with political or policy-based authority. For the latter, it will provide a venue through which expertise can be brought to bear on democratic decision making without risk of scapegoating or politicisation. More broadly, deliberation that prioritises dialogue (over, say, opinion change) affirms the principle that political decisions reflect value judgements rather than technically 'right' or technically 'wrong' answers-judgements that are legitimate if arrived at through discussion involving the people due to be affected by the resultant policy. This article sets out the advantages of this form of deliberation-which bears some similarity to certain types of citizen science-in the context of the UK government's responses to Covid-19; both the confused decision making evident to date, and the forthcoming re-opening phases that will prioritise or advantage some constituencies over others.","Pearse, Harry",Political quarterly,,390

203305,Nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors: possible treatments for COVID-19 in diabetes,2020,"BACKGROUND: While many cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mild, patients with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), older age, and morbid obesity are at higher risk of hospitalization and death. These conditions are characteristic of patients eligible for bariatric surgery, many of whom underwent weight loss procedures in the months prior to cessation of elective surgery in March 2020. The effects of the virus on these high-risk patients who had increased healthcare exposure in the early days of the pandemic are currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of patients who underwent bariatric surgery during the early evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study including patients from a single center who underwent bariatric surgery from January 1st, 2020 to March 18th, 2020. A database was created to analyze patients' demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes. All patients were contacted and a telephone survey was completed to inquire about COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and testing 30 days before and after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients underwent bariatric surgery during the study period. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was the most common procedure (71.6%). One hundred seventy-eight patients (93.7%) completed the telephone survey. Postoperatively, 19 patients (10.7%) reported COVID-19 compatible symptoms, and six patients (3.4%) went on to test positive for COVID-19. There were no COVID-19-related hospital admissions or mortalities in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidly obese patients are at high risk of severe disease secondary to COVID-19, and those undergoing bariatric surgery during the evolution of the pandemic reported symptoms at a rate of 10.7% 30 days after the surgery. While none of these patients suffered severe COVID-19 disease, the temporal relationship of their symptomatology and increased exposure to the healthcare system as a result of their surgery suggest an increased risk of disease with elective surgery.","Romero-Velez, Gustavo; Pereira, Xavier; Skendelas, John Paul; Costinett, Shauna; Grosser, Rachel; Creange, Collin; Rodriguez-Quintero, Jorge Humberto; Munoz Flores, Fernando; Moran-Atkin, Erin; Choi, Jenny; Lima, Diego L; Camacho, Diego R",Surg. endosc,,390

Therapies to prevent or treat COVID-19, including antiviral drug and several vaccines, are still being development. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressing in lung, has been confirmed to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 infection, interventions for attachment of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 may be a potential approach to prevent viral infections and it is considered as a potential target for drug development. In this study, we observed that seabuckthorn and its flavonoid compounds quercetin and isorhamnetin were shown strong retention to ACE2 overexpression HEK293 (ACE2h ) cells by CMC analysis. Based on drug receptor interaction analysis and viral entry studies in vitro, we evaluated the interaction of two flavonoid compounds and ACE2 as well as the inhibitory effect of the two compounds on viral entry. Surface plasmon resonance assay proved the effect that isorhamnetin bound to the ACE2, and its affinity (KD value) was at the micromolar level, that was, 2.51 ± 0.68 µM. Viral entry studies in vitro indicated that isorhamnetin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus entering ACE2h cells. Based on promising in vitro results, we proposed isorhamnetin to be a potential therapeutic candidate compound against COVID-19.","Zhan, Yingzhuan; Ta, Wenjing; Tang, Wenjuan; Hua, Ruochen; Wang, Jue; Wang, Cheng; Lu, Wen",Drug dev. res,,390

208826,A Review of Ophthalmic Telemedicine for Emergency Department Settings,2021,"Environmental monitoring in public spaces can be used to identify surfaces contaminated by persons with COVID-19 and inform appropriate infection mitigation responses. Research groups have reported detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces days or weeks after the virus has been deposited, making it difficult to estimate when an infected individual may have shed virus onto a SARS-CoV-2 positive surface, which in turn complicates the process of establishing effective quarantine measures. In this study, we determined that reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of viral RNA from heat-inactivated particles experiences minimal decay over seven days of monitoring on eight out of nine surfaces tested. The properties of the studied surfaces result in RT-qPCR signatures that can be segregated into two material categories, rough and smooth, where smooth surfaces have a lower limit of detection. RT-qPCR signal intensity (average quantification cycle (Cq)) can be correlated to surface viral load using only one linear regression model per material category. The same experiment was performed with infectious viral particles on one surface from each category, with essentially identical results. The stability of RT-qPCR viral signal demonstrates the need to clean monitored surfaces after sampling to establish temporal resolution. Additionally, these findings can be used to minimize the number of materials and time points tested and allow for the use of heat-inactivated viral particles when optimizing environmental monitoring methods. ImportanceEnvironmental monitoring is an important tool for public health surveillance, particularly in settings with low rates of diagnostic testing. Time between sampling public environments, such as hospitals or schools, and notifying stakeholders of the results should be minimal, allowing decisions to be made towards containing outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Safer At School Early Alert program (SASEA) [1], a large-scale environmental monitoring effort in elementary school and child care settings, has processed > 13,000 surface samples for SARS-CoV-2, detecting viral signals from 574 samples. However, consecutive detection events necessitated the present study to establish appropriate response practices around persistent viral signals on classroom surfaces. Other research groups and clinical labs developing environmental monitoring methods may need to establish their own correlation between RT - qPCR results and viral load, but this work provides evidence justifying simplified experimental designs, like reduced testing materials and the use of heat-inactivated viral particles.","Salido, Rodolfo A.; Cantú, Victor J.; Clark, Alex E; Leibel, Sandra L.; Foroughishafiei, Anahid; Saha, Anushka; Hakim, Abbas; Nouri, Alhakam; Lastrella, Alma L.; Castro-Martínez, Anelizze; Plascencia, Ashley; Kapadia, Bhavika; Xia, Bing; Ruiz, Christopher; Marotz, Clarisse; Maunder, Daniel; Lawrence, Elijah S.; Smoot, Elizabeth W.; Eisner, Emily; Crescini, Evelyn S.; Kohn, Laura; Vargas, Lizbeth Franco; Chacón, Marisol; Betty, Maryan; Machnicki, Michal; Wu, Min Yi; Baer, Nathan A.; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; DeHoff, Peter; Saever, Phoebe; Ostrander, R.

In the case of imported pandemics, the first-best solution is to restrict national borders to identify and isolate infected individuals. However, when that opportunity is not fully seized and there is no preventative intervention available, second-best options must be chosen. In this article we develop a system of differential equations that simulate both the fiscal and human costs associated to different mitigation measurements. After simulating several scenarios, we conclude that herd immunity (or unleashing the pandemic) is the worst policy in terms of both human and fiscal cost. We found that the second-best policy would be a strict policy (e.g. physical distancing with massive testing) established under the first 20 days after the pandemic, that lowers the probability of infection by 80%. In the case of the US, this strict policy would save more than 239 thousands lives and almost $170.8 billion to taxpayers when compared to the herd immunity case.","Cruz-Aponte, Mayte'e; Caraballo-Cueto, Jos'e",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01363v1.pdf,390

This study was conducted at the Departments of Oncology of four hospitals located in the Verona area in Italy to investigate the psychological consequences of the pandemic on cancer patients under active anticancer treatments. A 13-item ad hoc questionnaire to evaluate the psychological status of patients before and during the pandemic was administered to 474 consecutive subjects in the time frame between April 27th and June 7th 2020. Among the 13 questions, 7 were considered appropriate to elaborate an Emotional Vulnerability Index (EVI) that allows to separate the population in two groups (low versus high emotional vulnerability) according to observed median values. During the emergency period, the feeling of high vulnerability was found in 246 patients (53%) and was significantly associated with the following clinical variables: female gender, being under chemotherapy treatment, age &#8804; 65 years. Compared to the pre-pandemic phase, the feeling of vulnerability was increased in 41 patients (9%), remained stably high in 196 (42%) and, surprisingly, was reduced in 10 patients (2%). Overall, in a population characterized by an high level of emotional vulnerability the pandemic had a marginal impact and only a small proportion of patients reported an increase of their emotional vulnerability.","Pigozzi, Eva; Tregnago, Daniela; Costa, Lucia; Insolda, Jessica; Turati, Enrico; Rimondini, Michela; Donisi, Valeria; Madera, Pietro; Fiorica, Francesco; Giuliani, Jacopo; Greco, Filippo; Mercanti, Anna; Trolese, Annarita; Furlani, Lara; Piacentini, Paolo; Durante, Emilia; Mandarà, Marta; Pilotto, Sara; Avancini, Alice; Trestini, Ilaria; Zaninelli, Marta; Moretti, Francesca; Milella, Michele; Bonetti, Andrea",PLoS One,,390
211332,COVID 19 infection: Pediatric perspectives,2021,"The eye is the specialized part of the body and is comprised of numerous physiological ocular barriers that limit the drug absorption at the action site. Regardless of various efforts, efficient topical ophthalmic drug delivery remains unsolved and, thus, it is extremely necessary to advance the contemporary treatments of ocular disorders affecting the anterior and posterior cavities. Nowadays, the advent of nanotechnology-based multicomponent nanoemulsions for ophthalmic drug delivery has gained popularity due to the enhancement of ocular penetrability, improve bioavailability, increase solubility, and stability of lipophilic drugs. Nanoemulsions are offered the sustained/controlled drug release and increase residence time which depends on the viscosity, compositions, and stabilization process, etc., hence, decrease the instillation frequency and improve patient compliance. Further, due to the nanosized of nanoemulsions, the sterilization process is easy as conventional solutions and cause no blur vision. The review aims to summarizes the various ocular barriers, manufacturing techniques, possible mechanisms to the retention and deep penetration into the eye, and appropriate excipients with their under-lying selection principles to prevent destabilization of nanoemulsions. This review also discusses the characterization parameters of ocular drug delivery to spike the interest of those contemplating a foray in this field.

METHODS: The participants were recruited from a Chinese university (n = 195; 58.5% females). The first three-wave surveys were conducted before COVID-19 (during December of Year 1, June of Year 1, and December of Year 2 of their college study; Time 1, Time 2, Time 3), while the fourth survey (Time 4; during June of Year 2 of their college study) was conducted in June 2020 during COVID-19. COVID-19-related factors, including quarantine, lockdown, boredom, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, were investigated. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in the levels of depressive symptoms and prevalence of probable depression during COVID-19 (69.2%) compared to those 18 months, 12 months and 6 months before COVID-19 (41.5, 45.6, 48.2%) but non-significant changes in SPA. Boredom and emotional loneliness were positively associated with both SPA and depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Social loneliness was also positively associated with depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Quarantine and lockdown were not significantly associated with SPA or depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that the study population may be a high risk group of probable depression. Future studies should continue to track these mental and behavioral status with the progression of the epidemic. The identified emotional factors could be used to reduce depressive symptoms during COVID-19 and prevent the potential risk of SPA.","Yang, Xue; Hu, Huahua; Zhao, Chengjia; Xu, Huihui; Tu, Xiaolian; Zhang, Guohua",BMC Psychiatry,,390

212663,The Cytokine Profiles and Immune Response Are Increased in COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2021,"Health innovations are generally oriented on a techno-economic vision. In this perspective, technologies are seen as an end in themselves, and there is no arrangement between the technical and the social values of innovation. This vision prevails in sanitary crises, in which management is carried out based on the search for punctual, reactive, and technical solutions to remedy a specific problem without a systemic/holistic, sustainable, or proactive approach. This paper attempts to contribute to the literature on the epistemological orientation of innovations in the field of public health. Taking the Covid-19 and Ebola crises as examples, the primary objective is to show how innovation in health is oriented towards a techno-economic paradigm. Second, we propose a repositioning of public health innovation towards a social paradigm that will put more emphasis on the interaction between social and health dimensions in the perspective of social change. We will conclude by highlighting the roles that public health could play in allowing innovations to have more social value, especially during sanitary crises.","Niang, Marietou; Dupéré, Sophie; Alami, Hassane; Gagnon, Marie-Pierre",Global Health,,390

This new virus belongs to the group of enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent plasma.","Maciorowski, Dawid; Ogaugwu, Christian; Durvasula, Subba Rao; Durvasula, Ravi; Kunamneni, Adinarayana",SLAS Discov,,390

Here, A9, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of the tyrphostin class, is identified as a robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell-based assays. Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.","Dong, Wanyu; Xie, Wenting; Liu, Yunbo; Sui, Baokun; Zhang, Hao; Liu, Liran; Tan, Yubei; Tong, Xiaohan; Fu, Zhen F; Yin, Ping; Fang, Liurong; Peng, Guiqing",Antiviral Res,,390

Although researchers have studied the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking, the underlying factors of both associations are rarely compared. Using path analysis, we compared the mediating effects of behaviour-specific outcome expectancies and self-efficacy beliefs on the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking. A sample of 627 university students (76.10% female, Mage = 20.75, SD = 1.88) completed a battery of questionnaires. Alexithymia exhibited indirect effects on NSSI via affect regulation expectancies, pain expectancies, communication expectancies, and low self-efficacy to resist NSSI. Alexithymia exhibited indirect effects on risky drinking via expectations of increased confidence and negative consequences. However, the indirect effects differed depending on the valance of the emotion the individual had difficulties appraising. Our findings indicate that the underlying factors in the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking could differ. Where individuals who have difficulties appraising negative emotions may engage in NSSI to help regulate negative feelings, they may consume alcohol to gain more confidence in expressing their feelings.

214726,Using twitter and web news mining to predict COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. METHODS: We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates, utilizing the incubation period. Combining this data with known information of the infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. RESULTS: We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with a peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). The median incubation period was estimated to be 2.87 days (95% CI, 2.33-3.50 days), and the median serial interval to be 3.56 days (95% CI, 2.72-4.44 days). CONCLUSIONS: Considering that the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measures might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Chun, June Young; Baek, Gyuseung; Kim, Yongdai",Int J Infect Dis,,390

Rapid and early detection is essential to contain COVID-19. Here, we first developed a deep learning (DL) integrated radiomics model for end-to-end identification of COVID-19 using CT scans and then validated its clinical feasibility. We retrospectively collected CT images of 386 patients (129 with COVID-19 and 257 with other community-acquired pneumonia) from three medical centers to train and externally validate the developed models. A pre-trained DL algorithm was utilized to automatically segment infected lesions (ROIs) on CT images which were used for feature extraction. Five feature selection methods and four machine learning algorithms were utilized to develop radiomics models. Trained with features selected by L1 regularized logistic regression, classifier multi-layer perceptron (MLP) demonstrated the optimal performance with AUC of 0.922 (95% CI 0.856-0.988) and 0.959 (95% CI 0.910-1.000), the same sensitivity of 0.879, and specificity of 0.900 and 0.887 on internal and external testing datasets, which was equivalent to the senior radiologist in a reader study. Additionally, diagnostic time of DL-MLP was more efficient than radiologists (38 s vs 5.15 min).

The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, heparin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1449 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 240 were still admitted, and 85 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow-up time was 8 (IQR 5-12) days. Hydroxychloroquine had been used in 1857 patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI): 0.44 (0.29-0.67). This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90% and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.45 (0.30-0.68) p < 0.001, and also when all the other drugs, and time of admission, were included as covariates. The association between hydroxychloroquine and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community.

217834,Premature ovarian insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 infection: An original case report,2021,"During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected almost 108 individuals. Quite a number of vaccines against COVID-19 were therefore developed, and a few recently received authorization for emergency use. Overall, these vaccines target specific viral proteins by antibodies whose synthesis is directly elicited or indirectly triggered by nucleic acids coding for the desired targets. Among these targets, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 spike protein (SP) does frequently occur in the repertoire of candidate vaccines. However, the immunogenicity of RBD per se is limited by its low molecular mass, and by a structural rearrangement of full-length SP accompanied by the detachment of RBD. Here we show that the RBD of COVID-19 SP can be conveniently produced in Escherichia coli when fused to a fragment of CRM197, a variant of diphtheria toxin currently used for a number of conjugated vaccines. In particular, we show that the CRM197-RBD chimera solubilized from inclusion bodies can be refolded and purified to a state featuring the 5 native disulphide bonds of the parental proteins, the competence in binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and a satisfactory stability at room temperature.

METHODS: We performed an international observational cohort study of clinical and outcome data regarding suspected MIS-C that had been uploaded by physicians onto a Web-based database. We used inverse-probability weighting and generalized linear models to evaluate intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) as a reference, as compared with IVIG plus glucocorticoids and glucocorticoids alone. There were two primary outcomes: the first was a composite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by day 2 or later or death; the second was a reduction in disease severity on an ordinal scale by day 2. Secondary outcomes included treatment escalation and the time until a reduction in organ failure and inflammation. RESULTS: Data were available regarding the course of treatment for 614 children from 32 countries from June 2020 through February 2021; 490 met the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C. Of the 614 children with suspected MIS-C, 246 received primary treatment with IVIG alone, 208 with IVIG plus glucocorticoids, and 99 with glucocorticoids alone; 22 children received other treatment combinations, including biologic agents, and 39 received no immunomodulatory therapy. Receipt of inotropic or ventilatory support or death occurred in 56 patients who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids (adjusted odds ratio for the comparison with IVIG alone, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 1.82) and in 17 patients who received glucocorticoids alone (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.22 to 1.33).

Integrating patients data with clinical trials data is enormously promising as it provides a comprehensive knowledge base that accelerates the clinical research response-ability to tackle emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This work introduces EMR2vec, a platform that customises advanced NLP, machine learning and semantic web techniques to link potential patients to suitable clinical trials. Linking these two different but complementary datasets allows clinicians and researchers to compare patients to clinical research opportunities or to automatically select patients for personalized clinical care. The platform derives a 'bag of medical terms' (BoMT) from eligibility criteria by normalizing extracted entities through SNOMED-CT ontology. With the usage of BoMT, an ontological reasoning method is proposed to represent EMR and clinical trials in a vector space model. The platform presents a matching process that reduces vector dimensionality using a neural network, then applies orthogonality projection to measure the similarity between vectors. Finally, the proposed EMR2vec platform is evaluated with an extendable prototype based on Big data tools.","Dhayne, Houssein; Kilany, Rima; Haque, Rafiqul; Taher, Yehia",Comput Ind Eng,,390

Our results show that COVID-19 anxiety and negative mood are positively predicted by death anxiety and the use in communication of general COVID-19 information. Death reflection reduces negative mood in relation to COVID-19 and attenuates the positive association between death anxiety on the one hand and the negative mood and anxiety in relation to COVID-19 on the other hand. The use of humoristic information about COVID-19 reduces anxiety and social distance towards people infected with COVID-19 and also attenuates the positive association between the use in communication of general COVID-19 information and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Our results also show that the association between death anxiety and social distance towards those infected with COVID-19 is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Finally, the association between the use of COVID-19 information in interpersonal communication and social distance is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19.

221727,The prevalence and management of deteriorating patients in an Australian emergency department,2020,"During coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic hand hygiene was one of the most essential preventive practice health care workers (HCWs) due to their frequent washing their hands with sanitizers. Wearing gloves after using hand sanitizers may cause skin irritation and dryness. Wearing masks were effective in reducing the probability of infection with COVID-19, but wearing them for long time cause many problems. This paper was aimed to compare between Saudi and Egyptian HCWs upon using sanitizers and personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected through a well-structured questionnaire, among Saudi HCWs (online) and Egyptian HCWs through paper questionnaire interview. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions about Socio-demographic, types of masks, gloves and sanitizers they used during their works. It includes the adverse skin reactions on hands and face upon using PPE for long periods during COVID 19 pandemic. Our results revealed that most of Saudi & Egyptian HCWs wearing surgical masks (57.8% & 63.6%), &gt; N95 (12.9% & 18.2%), using latex surgical gloves (44.9% & 56.8%), &gt; plastic gloves (11.1% & 18.2%) respectively. The most affected area from wearing PPE are hands (49.8% & 54.5%) followed by Auricular area (44% & 40.9%), nasal bridge (28.9% & 22.7%), check (16.9% & 13.6%), whole face (15.6% & 25%) among Saudi & Egyptian HCWs respectively. About 70% of Egyptian HCWs from our participants used alcohol 70% in form of gel as sanitizer which was significantly higher than Saudi HCWs (59.1%). While no significant differences were found from using other sanitizers such as liquid alcohol 70% or Dettol. The most adverse reaction due to using sanitizers was skin dryness (55.1% & 63.6%) among Saudi & Egyptian HCWs respectively. We can conclude that significant increase was found among HCWs in Egypt either in wearing surgical and N95 masks or in wearing surgical and plastic gloves when compared to Saudi HCWs. According to the side effects on hands and face due to wearing PPE among HCWs either from KSA or Egypt, there were some variations by increase or decrease in the percentages. The most adverse reaction due to using sanitizers (specially alcohol 70% in form of gel) was skin dryness.","Mahmoud, M. R.; Almuaili, J. A. J.; Shaheen, S. M.; Alatifi, M. N. Z.; Abdelaziz, O.

225079,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess Feasibility and Acceptability of Telephone-Based Psychosocial Interventions in Individuals Who Attempted Suicide,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: The human desire to achieve an improved/better way of looking can be traced back through all times of human history and culminated in the realm of plastic surgery in the beginning of the early 20th century. In particular a main interest was hereby the so-called facelift surgery and the first two German pioneers in this field: Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer. AIM OF THE PAPER: The surgeons Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer contributed to a big part to the development of facelift techniques. The paper aims to highlight in which way both surgeons conducted their research work and the topic of facelift and which findings could be drawn out of their work. METHOD: On the basis of old specialist literature and congressional quotations the curriculua vitae of Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer are portrayed, as well as their professional career and their ground breaking work for facelift surgery and its differences amongst each other. CONCLUSION: Both Eugen Holländer and Erich Lexer performed, independently from another, the first facelifts in Germany. Hereby, their operative approach was different. In contrast to Holländer who only performed skin resections for a better tightening of the face, Lexer undermined the skin in an area of multiple centimetres.Even in their suture technique the difference was visible. Lexer for instance conducted a special suture technique by including the fascia temporalis superficialis in his sutures for achieving lasting stability and tension relief. Due to this reason Lexer can be regarded without any doubt as the initial pioneer of modern facelift surgery.","Locher, Wolfgang G; Feinendegen, Dominik L",Handchir. mikrochir. plast. chir,,390
225850,The bone prone team,2020,"PURPOSE: The last two decades have seen the emergence of several viral outbreaks. Some of them are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) - the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ever, vaccines for emergency use have been authorized for the control and prevention of COVID-19. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine for prophylaxis of COVID-19 and for other future epidemics. METHODS: This review describes patented vaccines for SARS and MERS-CoV and vaccines developed and approved for emergency use against the new coronavirus (COVID-19). The European Patent Office and the World Intellectual Property Organization were the patent databases used using specific terms. In addition, another search was carried out in the Clinical Trials in search of ongoing clinical studies focused on the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The patent search showed that most vaccines are based on viral vector platforms, nucleic acids, or protein subunits. The review also includes an overview of completed and ongoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 in several countries. CONCLUSION: The information provided here lists vaccines for other types of coronavirus that have been used in the development of vaccines for COVID-19.","Nascimento Júnior, José Adão Carvalho; Santos, Anamaria Mendonça; Cavalcante, Rafael Ciro Marques; Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José; Walker, Cristiani Isabel Banderó; Borges, Lysandro Pinto; Frank, Luiza Abrahão; Serafini, Mairim Russo",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,390
225851,The bone prone team,2020,"(1) Background: The present study is aimed to determine the predicting role of objective (lifestyle) and subjective factors of middle-aged women's psycho-emotional health such as their relations with parents, attachment and separation types. Women who are overloaded with professional and family roles have high stress level, their indicators of psychological well-being and emotional level decrease when they have to give everyday care to their elderly parents. (2) Methods: The research sample has two empirical groups. Sample of Study 1 includes middle-aged women (n = 61) aged 38-56 (M = 48.1, SD = 3.5); sample of Study 2 includes middle-aged women (n = 85) aged 33-52 (M = 40.6, SD = 3.1): married (70.5%) and divorced (29.5%), having children of 14-28 years old; giving everyday care to elderly parents for more than 1.5 yrs. Some live separately (62.3 %), or have to cohabitate with parents (37.7%). All women evaluate their life situation as difficult and manifest signs of high psycho-emotional stress. We used methods adapted for the Russian-speaking sample: getting socio-demographic information, an interview; The scales of psychological well-being; Attachment style and Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaires (study 1); Psychological Separation Inventory, Purpose-in-Life Test, projective methods (study 2), mathematical statistics. (3) Results: A number of factors and indicators of women's psycho-emotional health decrease in the situation of role overload have been identified. Among the factors there are four main types of women's relationships with parents: Anxious closeness; Ambivalence of feelings; Secondary relationship with parents; Alienation, predicting of psycho-emotional health that are reducing or enhancing their personal resources. Besides, a type of separation of an adult woman from her mother predicts her level of well-being. (4) Conclusions: The study confirms that middle-aged Russian women's psycho-emotional health depends on contextual factors (difficult role-overloaded lifestyle) and factors integrating women's relations towards parents, attachment, guilt and separation. Types of middle-aged women's relationships with parents contribute to their psychoemotional health in a different way.","Saporovskaia, Maria V; Kryukova, Tatiana L; Voronina, Maria E; Tikhomirova, Elena V; Samokhvalova, Anna G; Khazova, Svetlana A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,390
226313,Telehealth in pregnancy,2020,"This article analyses the state of democracy in the European Union (EU) using gender lens on the Treaty of Lisbon and three of the main European crises in the first decade since its entry into force (2009-2019): the economic crisis (2008-2014);Brexit (2017–2020) and the democratic decline and triggering of Article 7 TEU against Poland and Hungary (2017 and 2018 respectively). By drawing on feminist democracy theory, it shows the interdependent connections of democracy and gender equality in the analysed European crises. It examines the two dimensions of the double democratic deficit through gender lens –the underrepresentation of women and gender sensitivity– in the adoption and provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and European decision-making and responses to the crises. It argues that the gender-blind European responses to the crises of the first decade of the Treaty of Lisbon have contributed –among other factors– to the deterioration of the EU’s democratic structures and procedures, and have also, in turn, contributed to restraining progress on gender equality and exacerbating gender inequality across different member states. Given Ursula Von der Leyen’s declared plans for a “new push for European democracy”, and the new EU crisis emerged by the Covid-19 virus pandemic, the article points to some key gender aspects that might be worth considering for the future of the European democratic project. © 2021 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Globally, according to the latest World Health Organization report (10 August 2020), COVID-19 has affected nearly 20 million lives, causing 728 013 deaths. Due to the lack of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines, the outbreak of disease has spawned a corpus of contagious infection all over the world, day by day, without control. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a very rapid infection rate, it is essential to develop a novel ameliorative and curative strategy as quickly as possible. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a type of adaptive immunity that has already been found to be effective in confronting several infectious diseases from the last two decades. For example, CP therapy was used in the treatment of viral-induced diseases like SARS-CoV epidemics, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemics, Ebola epidemics and H1N1 pandemic. In this review, we have mainly focused on the therapeutic role of CP therapy and its neutralizing effect to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.","Piyush, Ravikant; Rajarshi, Keshav; Khan, Rajni; Ray, Shashikant",Open Biol,,390

In the first half of 2020, because of the widespread of the COVID-19, researches were focused on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, air, and on surfaces, in order to assess the risk of contracting the viral infection from contaminated environments. So far, the survival of the novel Coronavirus out of the human body has been reported for short time periods (from hours to few days, in optimized in vitro conditions), mainly because of the need of an host organism which could consent the viral attack, and due to the weak external membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding strategies in the environment, either through animate and unanimate matrices, or exploiting the organic matter in water, wastewater, and waste in general, have been discussed in the present article. We concluded that, besides the high infectuousness of the novel Coronavirus, the transmission of the pathogen may be efficiently contained applying the adequate preventive measures (e.g., personal protection equipments, and disinfecting agents), indicated by national and international health authories.","Carraturo, Federica; Del Giudice, Carmela; Morelli, Michela; Cerullo, Valeria; Libralato, Giovanni; Galdiero, Emilia; Guida, Marco",Environ Pollut,,390

This large-scale study characterized immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using multidimensional flow cytometry, with the aim of identifying high-risk immune biomarkers. Holistic and unbiased analyses of 17 immune cell-types were conducted on 1,075 peripheral blood samples obtained from 868 COVID-19 patients and on samples from 24 patients presenting with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections and 36 healthy donors. Immune profiles of COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those of age-matched healthy donors but generally similar to those of patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed three immunotypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection; immunotype 1 (14% of patients) was characterized by significantly lower percentages of all immune cell-types except neutrophils and circulating plasma cells, and was significantly associated with severe disease. Reduced B-cell percentage was most strongly associated with risk of death. On multivariate analysis incorporating age and comorbidities, B-cell and non-classical monocyte percentages were independent prognostic factors for survival in training (n=513) and validation (n=355) cohorts. Therefore, reduced percentages of B-cells and non-classical monocytes are high-risk immune biomarkers for risk-stratification of COVID-19 patients.","Martín-Sánchez, Esperanza; Garcés, Juan José; Maia, Catarina; Inogés, Susana; López-Díaz de Cerio, Ascensión; Carmona-Torre, Francisco; Marin-Oto, Marta; Alegre, Félix; Molano, Elvira; Fernandez-Alonso, Mirian; Perez, Cristina; Botta, Cirino; Zabaleta, Aintzane; Alcaide, Ana Belen; Landecho, Manuel F; Rua, Marta; Pérez-Warnisher, Teresa; Blanco, Laura; Sarvide, Sarai; Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia; Alignani, Diego; Moreno, Cristina; Pineda, Iñigo; Sogbe, Miguel; Argemi, Josepmaria; Paiva, Bruno; Yuste, José Ramón",Front Immunol,,390

The median age was 54.1 years (1.0-80.3) for allogeneic, and 60.6 years (7.7-81.6) for autologous HCT patients. The median time from HCT to COVID-19 was 15.8 months (0.2-292.7) in allogeneic and 24.6 months (-0.9 to 350.3) in autologous recipients. 83.5% developed lower respiratory tract disease and 22.5% were admitted to an ICU. Overall survival at 6 weeks from diagnosis was 77.9% and 72.1% in allogeneic and autologous recipients, respectively. Children had a survival of 93.4%. In multivariate analysis, older age (p = 0.02), need for ICU (p < 0.0001) and moderate/high immunodeficiency index (p = 0.04) increased the risk while better performance status (p = 0.001) decreased the risk for mortality.

The aim of the study was to assess whether and to what extent the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the health behaviours of young adults. METHODS: 506 people aged 18 to 34 ([Formula: see text] =24.67 years ±4.23 years) who filled in an online survey were qualified for the study. Assessment was made of eating habits (a modified Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ), physical activity and sedentary behaviours (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, short form IPAQ-SF), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and generalized anxiety (Generalized anxiety Disorder, 7-item, GAD-7 scale). RESULTS: During the pandemic, young adults changed their dietary preferences toward sweets and cereal products, increased alcohol (p < 0.001) and fat (p = 0.005) intake, significantly reduced their physical activity (from 8752.5 metabolic equivalents (MET) min/week vs. 6174.6 MET min/week, p < 0.001), increased the time spent sedentarily (Me = 240 min vs. Me = 360 min, p < 0.001) and had decreased sleep quality (PSQI score Me = 7.00 vs. Me = 9.00). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic worsened health behaviours and intensified the feeling of generalized anxiety in young adults. Generalized anxiety during obligatory lockdown had the greatest negative impact on sedentary behaviours and sleep quality.","Czenczek-Lewandowska, Ewelina; Wyszynska, Justyna; Leszczak, Justyna; Baran, Joanna; Weres, Aneta; Mazur, Artur; Lewandowski, Bogumil",BMC Public Health,,390
238657,How fast should social restrictions be eased in England as COVID-19 vaccinations are rolled out?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of COVID-19 poses a global health emergency. One of the most frequently reported data is sex-related severity and mortality: according to the last available analysis on 239,709 patients in Italy, lethality is 17.7% in men and 10.8% in women, with 59% of total deaths being men. Interestingly, the infection rate is lower in males than in females, with 45.8% and 54.2% of positive cases, respectively, suggesting that gender-related factor may worsen disease evolution. A tentative hypothesis to explain these findings is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in viral infection. PURPOSE: In this review, we summarize the available evidence pointing to gender-related differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, from both genetic and endocrine points of view. RESULTS: Altogether, available evidence points toward two not-mutually exclusive mechanisms in gender susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex hormonal regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. On one hand, ACE2 expression could be increased in women, either by estrogens or constitutively by X chromosome inactivation escape or by reduced methylation, providing a larger reservoir of ACE2 to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of RAS regulatory axis. On the other, low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, despite the increased expression of ACE2, which represents the Trojan horse for SARS-CoV-2 entry. CONCLUSIONS: Both mechanisms consistently point to the role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in the differential severity and lethality of COVID-19 in men and women.","Foresta, C; Rocca, M S; Di Nisio, A",J. endocrinol. invest,,390
238788,Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: Balancing contrasting claims,2020,"Objective: Since December 2019, new pneumonia of unknown aetiology broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Subsequently, a virus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of the disease. Currently, the epidemic has spread all over the world. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. At the moment, the nuclide acid test is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of this infection. Methods: In the present paper, we report our experience with all patients who came to the Emergency Department from March 1 to April 1, 2020, with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patients: they all underwent a first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency department and, if negative, a second one after at least 24 hours. Results: Our study shows how the results obtained at time zero are usually identical to the ones obtained after 24 hours. We thus suggest, in patients with high suspicion of COVID19 and a negative result at the first swab, to repeat the test after at least 48 hours, during which patients with symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia disease should be kept in isolation to avoid the risk of contagion. Conclusions: these measures and in particular the early identifica-tion of cases with consequent isolation will allow the containment of the spread of the virus, representing one of the fundamental measures to guarantee and strengthen the control of the infection to reduce hospital admissions, the overload of national health service and health costs.","Piccioni, A; Franza, L; Rosa, F; Cicchinelli, S; Saviano, A; Valletta, F; de Cunzo, T; Zanza, C; Covino, M; Ojetti, V; Franceschi, F; Candelli, M",Clin Ter,,390
239039,Information Typology in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Crisis;a Commentary,2020,"The ReLU activation function (AF) has been extensively applied in deep neural networks, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for image classification despite its unresolved dying ReLU problem, which poses challenges to reliable applications. This issue has obvious important implications for critical applications, such as those in healthcare. Recent approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets, including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating its potential to be the new benchmark or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image classification tasks involved in critical applications, such as medical diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.","Parisi, L.; Neagu, D.; Ma, R.; Campean, F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08031v1.pdf,390

Because of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, multiple biomarkers must be analyzed to compensate for the low sensitivity and specificity of single biomarker targets. Conventional LFAs, such as gold nanoparticle dyed assays, are limited to approximately five targets-the maximum number of test lines on an assay. To increase the information obtainable from each test line, we combined green and red emitting quantum dots (QDs) as labels for C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibodies in an optical duplex immunoassay. CdSe-QDs with sharp and tunable emission bands were used to simultaneously quantify CRP and IL-6 in a single test line, by using a single UV-light source and two suitable emission filters for readout through a widely available BioImager device. For image and data processing, a customized software tool, the MultiFlow-Shiny app was used to accelerate and simplify the readout process. The app software provides advanced tools for image processing, including assisted extraction of line intensities, advanced background correction and an easy workflow for creation and handling of experimental data in quantitative LFAs. The results generated with our MultiFlow-Shiny app were superior to those generated with the popular software ImageJ and resulted in lower detection limits. Our assay is applicable for detecting clinically relevant ranges of both target proteins and therefore may serve as a powerful tool for POC diagnosis of inflammation and infectious events.","Ruppert, Christoph; Kaiser, Lars; Jacob, Lisa Johanna; Laufer, Stefan; Kohl, Matthias; Deigner, Hans-Peter",J Nanobiotechnology,,390

242557,Clinical Outcomes of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) may result in serious complications involving several organ systems, including myocardial tissue. An exaggerated host inflammatory response, described as a cytokine storm, has been linked to play a major role in these complications. Colchicine and other pharmaceutical agents have been proposed to counter the cytokine storm and improve outcomes. In this exploratory review, we utilized a PubMed and Cochrane Database search aiming to identify the biochemical characteristics of the cytokine storm as well as to identify the potential effect of colchicine on these inflammatory biomarkers. The research yielded 30 reports describing the characteristics of the cytokine storm and 44 reports describing the effect of colchicine on various inflammatory biomarkers. According to our research, colchicine may be an agent of interest in the treatment of COVID-19 via its anti-inflammatory properties. However, there are potential drug interactions with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors resulting in acute colchicine toxicities. Additionally, there is scarce evidence regarding the efficacy of colchicine in the acute phase of disease, since most trials evaluated its effect in chronic conditions. In this direction, our team proposes three different hypotheses for evaluating the place of colchicine in the treatment of COVID-19.","Papadopoulos, Christodoulos; Patoulias, Dimitrios; Teperikidis, Eleftherios; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Toumpourleka, Maria; Boulmpou, Aristi; Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Doumas, Michael; Vassilikos, Vassilios P",SN Compr Clin Med,,390

Diabetes Care 2020;43:1392-1398",2020,"Depression is associated with an increased risk of aging-related diseases. It is also seemingly a common psychological reaction to pandemic outbreaks with forced quarantines and lockdowns. Thus, depression represents, now more than ever, a major global health burden with therapeutic management challenges. Clinical data highlights that physical exercise is gaining momentum as a non-pharmacological intervention in depressive disorders. Although it may contribute to the reduction of systemic inflammation associated with depression, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial physical exercise effects in emotional behavior remain to be elucidated. Current investigations indicate that a rapid release of extracellular vesicles into the circulation might be the signaling mediators of systemic adaptations to physical exercise. These biological entities are now well-established intercellular communicators, playing a major role in relevant physiological and pathophysiological functions, including brain cell-cell communication. We also reviewed emerging evidence correlating depression with modified circulating extracellular vesicle surfaces and cargo signatures (e.g., microRNAs and proteins), envisioned as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, efficient disease stratification and appropriate therapeutic management. Accordingly, the clinical data summarized in the present review prompted us to hypothesize that physical exercise-related circulating extracellular vesicles contribute to its antidepressant effects, particularly through the modulation of inflammation. This review sheds light on the triad ""physical exercise-extracellular vesicles-depression"" and suggests new avenues in this novel emerging field.","Soares, Edna; Reis, Julie; Rodrigues, Mariana; Ribeiro, Carlos Fontes; Pereira, Frederico C",Int. j. mol. sci.

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with type A acute aortic syndromes (AAS) diagnosed with COVID-19 in the perioperative period. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data between March and August 2020 from 20 participating cardiac surgery centers in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Among 122 patients who underwent emergency surgical repair for type A AAS at the participating centers, 3 patients (2.5%) tested positive for COVID-19 in the preoperative screeing, and 4 cases turned to be positive in the postoperative period having been operated on an unknown COVID-19 status. Another patient was diagnosed of COVID-19 disease based on radiological features. These eight patients had increased postoperative complications, including respiratory failure, longer ventilation times, and Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) stay and increased mortality when compared with COVID-19 negative patients.

We evaluate the representativeness of FBDM data using the Mann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an anomaly analysis to reveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement during the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results show that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total population from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the placing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents. A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a densely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one, possibly due to the better access to transportation. In sparsely populated fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to seek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with an assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives can provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder decision-making.","Jia, Shenyue; Kim, Seung Hee; Nghiem, Son V.; Doherty, Paul; Kafatos, Menas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01084v1.pdf,390
256156,Patients perspective on the effect of COVID-19 on heart failure admissions,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Current SARS-CoV-2 containment measures rely on controlling viral transmission. Effective prioritization can be determined by understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household and healthcare settings. We also examined whether household transmission differed by symptom status of index case, adult and children, and relationship to index case. METHODS: We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases between January 1 and July 25, 2020. High-quality studies presenting original data for calculating point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were included. Random effects models were constructed to pool SAR in household and healthcare settings. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger's meta-regression test. RESULTS: 43 studies met the inclusion criteria for household SAR, 18 for healthcare SAR, and 17 for other settings. The pooled household SAR was 18.1% (95% CI: 15.7%, 20.6%), with significant heterogeneity across studies ranging from 3.9% to 54.9%. SAR of symptomatic index cases was higher than asymptomatic cases (RR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.46, 7.14). Adults showed higher susceptibility to infection than children (RR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.17). Spouses of index cases were more likely to be infected compared to other household contacts (RR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79, 3.19). In healthcare settings, SAR was estimated at 0.7% (95% CI: 0.4%, 1.0%). DISCUSSION: While aggressive contact tracing strategies may be appropriate early in an outbreak, as it progresses, measures should transition to account for setting-specific transmission risk. Quarantine may need to cover entire communities while tracing shifts to identifying transmission hotspots and vulnerable populations. Where possible, confirmed cases should be isolated away from the household.","Koh, Wee Chian; Naing, Lin; Chaw, Liling; Rosledzana, Muhammad Ali; Alikhan, Mohammad Fathi; Jamaludin, Sirajul Adli; Amin, Faezah; Omar, Asiah; Shazli, Alia; Griffith, Matthew; Pastore, Roberta; Wong, Justin",PLoS One,,390

(Special issue on diabetes and COVID-19: the IDF perspective.),2020,"The paper analyses the embeddedness of informality in the city and ambiguities among low-income families around what constitutes the formal and informal in the arenas of housing, lottery betting and labour. Through ethnography of women navigating various dimensions of informality in Salvador, Brazil, the paper portrays the gendered circumstances and vulnerabilities of making a living and maintaining a home in peripheral neighbourhoods in the city. Specifically, the paper examines the implications of debt on women’s lives and life choices in the informal city. The paper demonstrates that formality was often beyond their means and aspirations whereas many informal practices, including credit practices, enable life to continue by providing a meagre income and the opportunity to avoid expenses such as rent and utility bills. Yet these same practices keep women on the margins of the city and the formal economy. Marginality engenders vulnerability, exacerbated during periods of turbulence as seen in the current context of Brazil’s economic downturn and struggle to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.

Contextually, the corresponding multi-faceted chain of healthcare events is likely to be severely disturbed or even temporarily broken under the force majeure conditions such as global pandemics. Consequently, the chronic liver disease is highly representative for the management of any severe chronic disorder under lasting pandemics with unprecedented numbers of acutely diseased persons who, together with the chronically sick patient cohorts, have to be treated using the given capacity of healthcare systems with their limited resources. Current study aimed at exploring potentially negative impacts of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak on the quality of the advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) management considering two well-classified parameters, namely, (1) the continuity of the patient registrations and (2) the level of mortality rates, comparing pre-COVID-19 statistics with these under the current pandemic in Slovak Republic. Altogether 1091 registrations to cirrhosis registry (with 60.8% versus 39.2% males to females ratio) were included with a median age of 57 years for patients under consideration. Already within the very first 3 months of the pandemic outbreak in Slovakia (lockdown declared from March 16, 2020, until May 20, 2020), the continuity of the patient registrations has been broken followed by significantly increased ACLD-related death rates. During this period of time, the total number of new registrations decreased by about 60% (15 registrations in 2020 versus 38 in 2018 and 38 in 2019).

This study aimed to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among patients with mild to moderate illness in Fangcang shelter hospitals. Methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China. The participants were assessed by quantifying their symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stressful life events and analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Using correlation analysis, we examined associations between exposure to COVID-19 and subsequent psychological distress in response to the outbreak. Results: In total, 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms. The depressive and anxiety symptoms were highly related to sleep disturbances and hypochondriasis (all r > 0.50, P < 0.01). The impact of the event was positively related to depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis and life events (all r > 0.35, P < 0.01) but was negatively related to psychological resilience (r = -0.41, P < 0.01). The presence of the COVID-19 infection in this setting was associated with increased anxiety, depression and stress levels, and decreased sleep quality, and seriously affected patients' quality of life as well as adversely affecting the course and prognosis of physical diseases. Conclusion: The sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of COVID-19 patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals were significantly related to the impact of the epidemic.","Zhang, Guang-Yin; Liu, Qi; Lin, Jing-Yu; Yan, Lin; Shen, Li; Si, Tian-Mei",,,390
261465,Possible link between anosmia and COVID-19: sniffing out the truth,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an enormous dislocation of society especially in South Africa. The South African government has imposed a number of measures aimed at controlling the pandemic, chief being a nationwide lockdown. This has resulted in income loss for individuals and firms, with vulnerable populations (low earners, those in informal and precarious employment, etc.) more likely to be adversely affected through job losses and the resulting income loss. Income loss will likely result in reduced ability to access healthcare and a nutritious diet, thus adversely affecting health outcomes. Given the foregoing, we hypothesize that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will disproportionately affect the health of the poor. METHODS: Using the fifth wave of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset conducted in 2017 and the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset conducted in May/June 2020, this paper estimated income-related health inequalities in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health was a dichotomized self-assessed health measure, with fair and poor health categorized as ""poor"" health, while excellent, very good and good health were categorized as ""better"" health. Household per capita income was used as the ranking variable. Concentration curves and indices were used to depict the income-related health inequalities. Furthermore, we decomposed the COVID-19 era income-related health inequality in order to ascertain the significant predictors of such inequality. RESULTS: The results indicate that poor health was pro-poor in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, with the latter six times the value of the former. Being African (relative to white), per capita household income and household experience of hunger significantly predicted income-related health inequalities in the COVID-19 era (contributing 130%, 46% and 9% respectively to the inequalities), while being in paid employment had a nontrivial but statistically insignificant contribution (13%) to health inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significance and magnitude of race, hunger, income and employment in determining socioeconomic inequalities in poor health, addressing racial disparities and hunger, income inequality and unemployment will likely mitigate income-related health inequalities in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nwosu, Chijioke O; Oyenubi, Adeola",Int J Equity Health,,390

262002,"Letter to Editor in response to ""COVID-19: From bench to bedside"" by Singh et al",2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been widely communicated that individuals with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe disease due to COVID-19 than healthy peers. As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services. RESULTS: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded ""understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition."" CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.","Horrell, Lindsey Nicole; Hayes, Sara; Herbert, Leslie Beth; MacTurk, Katie; Lawhon, Lauren; Valle, Carmina G; Bhowmick, Amrita",J Med Internet Res,,390

It has 121 amino acids with two genotypes, orf8L and orf8S. In this study, we overexpressed the orf8L and orf8S of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the orf8b of SARS-CoV to investigate their roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inhibition of interferon beta (IFNß) production. We found that the two genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 orf8 are capable of inducing ER stress without significant difference by triggering the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzymes 1 (IRE1) branches of the ER stress pathway. However, the third branch of ER stress pathway, i.e. the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), was unaffected by the overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 orf8L or orf8S. Moreover, both orf8L and orf8S of SARS-CoV-2 are capable of down regulating the production of IFNß and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), ISG15 and ISG56 induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)). Moreover, we also found decreased nuclear translocation of Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), after overexpressing orf8L and orf8S induced by poly (I:C). Our data demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein could induce ER stress by activating the ATF6 and IRE1 pathways, but not the PERK pathway, and functions as an interferon antagonist to inhibit the production of IFNß. However, these functions appeared not to be affected by the genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 orf8L and orf8S.","Rashid, Farooq; Dzakah, Emmanuel Enoch; Wang, Haiying; Tang, Shixing",Virus Res,,390

At the date of this evidence map´s publication, there is no evidence of specific treatments for COVID-19. This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to mental health and mild viral respiratory infections, as well as immune system strengthening and antiviral activity). Method: This evidence map applies methodology developed by Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information based on the 3iE evidence gap map. A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Virtual Health Library and PubMed, using the MeSH and DeCS terms for respiratory viral diseases associated with epidemics, COVID-19 symptoms, relevant mental health topics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM. Results: For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 62 interventions (18 phytotherapy, 9 mind-body therapies, 11 traditional Chinese medicine, 7 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 mental health, 25 complementary clinical management of the infection and 5 other). Conclusion: The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of mental health, and it is directed to researchers and health professionals specialized in TCIM. Most of the antiviral activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory viruses in general, and not specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This information may be useful to guide new research, but not necessarily to support a therapeutic recommendation. Finally, any suspicion of COVID-19 infection should follow the protocols recommended by the health authorities of each country/region.","Portella, Caio Fabio Schlechta; Ghelman, Ricardo; Abdala, Carmen Verônica Mendes; Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral",Integr Med Res,,390

264985,Euglycaemic ketoacidosis during gestational diabetes with concomitant COVID-19 infection,2020,"Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a severe complication of inflammatory immune diseases or treatment of malignancies; it may also appear during the progression of COVID-19. CSS is caused by dysregulation of the synthesis of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory, regulatory, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to pathologic activation of innate and adaptive (Th1 and Th17 mediated) immunity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CSS. The significant role of IL-6 in pathogenesis of COVID-19 was confirmed in a range of studies, which showed that the plasma concentration of IL-6 was increased in patients with severe COVID-19. Currently, IL-6 inhibitor therapeutics are not yet approved for the treatment of COVID-19; however, these medicines, including tocilizumab (TCZ) are used off-label for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, including life-threatening conditions. The role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of CSS during COVID-19 is important however, a number of related issues are not yet clear. These issues include the indications for treatment with IL-6 inhibitors, as well as the estimation of risk associated with the disease, outcomes, treatment options, and adverse drug reactions. The development of personalized immunomodulatory therapy, with respect to the role of cytokines in pathogenesis, requires the studies that aimed to find other relevant therapeutic targets for the treatment of CSS in patients with COVID-19. These therapeutic targets include inhibition of IL-1, IL-6, TNF&#945;, GM-CSF, IFNÎ³, IL-17, IL-18, and also activation of the complement system. The challenge of CSS in patients with COVID-19 is identifying the correct scientific targets and developing clinical trials aimed to evaluate the pathogenesis and treat immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).

For 2 weeks in February, we had the highest number of COVID-19 cases behind China. In this article, we summarize the key national and institutional policies that were implemented in response to COVID-19. We also describe in detail, with relevant data, how our vascular surgery practice has changed because of these policies and COVID-19. We show that with a segregated team model, the vascular surgery unit can still function while reducing risk of cross-contamination. We explain the various strategies adopted to reduce outpatient and inpatient volume. We provide a detailed breakdown of the type of vascular surgical cases that were performed during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with preceding months. We discuss our operating room and personal protective equipment protocols in managing a COVID-19 patient and share how we continue surgical training amid the pandemic. We also discuss the challenges we might face in the future as COVID-19 regresses.","Ng, Jun Jie; Gan, Tiffany R X; Niam, Jen Yong; Menon, Raj K; Ho, Pei; Dharmaraj, Rajesh B; Wong, Julian C L; Choong, Andrew M T L",J Vasc Surg,,390
266707,Safety Audits in the Emergency Department: Applying the Threat and Error Model to the Management of Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis,2020,"The dramatic growth of urbanization in modern cities calls for smart strategies to resolve crucial problems such as transportation, healthcare, energy, and civil infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most exciting enabling technologies to address smart city problems by creating a large global network of interconnected physical objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. Since the end of 2019, the world has been confronted with the challenge of the COVID-19 virus originating in Wuhan, China. Precautionary measures are expected to be needed in the world to combat the pandemic of COVID-19 until an effective vaccine is developed. The disease has already proven the value of modern smart healthcare which plays a significant role in preventing COVID-19. The aim of this research is to develop the COVID-19 cluster tracking system, and face mask detection system for public safety. The proposed cluster tracking system was validated for 26 test subjects in an experimental scenario of a potential COVID-19 cluster. The accuracy of the proposed face mask detection system was 86.96% observed at 0.9756 precision. According to the testing results, the proposed system was showed promising outcomes for the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in a smart city. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Herath, H.

268948,Post-Test Probability of COVID-19 Using CT,2021,"Background: On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care. Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities. Methods: For this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours. Findings: Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585â000 to 117â000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown). Interpretation: Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.

Liver injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and clarifying its characteristics is needed. This study aimed to identify factors associated with liver injury and to develop a new classification of predictive severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Confirmed patients with COVID-19 (n = 60) were recruited retrospectively from Musashino Red Cross Hospital. The factors of liver injury especially on the elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were analyzed. Grading was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: During a median hospitalization follow-up of 15 (4-41) days, 51 (85.0%) patients had COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical courses, oxygenation was needed for 25 (41.6%) patients and intubation was needed for 9 (15.0%) patients. A total of 27 (45.0%) patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (GS), such as appetite loss, diarrhea, and nausea. A logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, oxygenation, intubation, and GS were significant factors of liver injury. Based on these results, patients were classified into three groups: group 1, no oxygenation pneumonia; group 2, pneumonia with oxygenation or GS; and group 3, intubation. We classified 25 (41.7%), 26 (43.3%), and 9 (15.0%) patients into mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. The peak of AST and ALT levels was significantly stratified with this criteria (mild [median AST, 28 IU/L; median ALT, 33 IU/L], moderate [median AST, 48 IU/L; median ALT, 47.5 IU/L], and severe [median AST, 109 IU/L; median ALT, 106 IU/L]; P<0.001 and P = 0.0114, respectively).

The present study aims to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on the daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 10 European countries, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Belarus. This region has a relatively low temperature and high humidity, and has homogenous European ethnicity with almost similar socioeconomic culture and health care system. The data on COVID-19 pandemic including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from World Health Organization (WHO). The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web ""Time and Date"". The daily cases, deaths, temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" in the European region, from Jan 27, 2020 to July 17, 2020. RESULTS: In 10 European countries, (Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Belarus), the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 27, 2020 to July 17, 2020 was 17.07±0.18°C, and humidity was 54.78±0.47%. The overall results revealed a significant inverse correlation between humidity and the number of cases (r= -0.134, p<0.001) and deaths (r= -0.126, p<0.001). Moreover, an increase in temperature was linked with an increase in the number of cases (r=0.062, p=0.013) and deaths (r=0.118, p<0.001). The regression analysis results further revealed that with an increase of 1% humidity the number of cases (ß = -15.90, p<0.001) and deaths (ß=-1.56, p<0.001) reduced significantly. Whereas, with an increase of 1°C in temperature the number of cases (ß = 20.65, p<0.001) and deaths (ß = 3.71, p<0.001) increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths, however, a rise in temperature was allied with an upsurge in the number of daily cases and daily deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in European countries. The study findings on weather events and COVID-19 pandemic have an impact at European regional levels to project the incidence and mortality trends with regional weather events to enhance public health readiness and assist in planning to fight against this pandemic situation.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Sumaya, O Y; Sami, W; Shafi, K M; Meo, A S; Usmani, A M; Akram, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,390

This study was conducted to explore the extent of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experiences among nurses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. METHOD: This study used a cross-sectional study design with a convenience sampling approach. A sample of 259 participants completed the study questionnaires, including a socio-demographic questionnaire and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, between May and July 2020. RESULT: The prevalence of PTSD among the study participants was 37.1%. The majority of study participants who exhibited PTSD symptoms presented the lowest level of PTSD (17%). The results indicated significant differences in overall COVID-19-related PTSD according to the participant's age (F = 14.750, P = .000), gender (F = 30.340, P = .000), level of education (F = 51.983, P =.000), years of experience (F = 52.33, P = .000), place of work (F = 19.593, P = .000), and working position (F = 11.597, P = .000), as determined by one-way ANOVA. CONCLUSION: Nurses must be qualified and accredited to cope with reported PTSD cases and their consequences in relation to COVID-19 outbreaks. A close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team is required to recognise, manage, and encourage safety literacy among health care professionals and individuals diagnosed with or suspected of PTSD due to COVID-19 outbreaks or any other viral outbreaks.","Qutishat, Mohammad; Abu Sharour, Loai; Al-Damery, Kholoud; Al Harthy, Ibtisam; Al-Sabei, Sulaiman",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,390

The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of-Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population. METHOD: A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire. FINDINGS: The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p<0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p<0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p<0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3·1-3·6% for depressive disorders and 3·0-3·5% for anxiety disorders).","Pandey, Deeksha; Bansal, Suvrati; Goyal, Shubham; Garg, Akanksha; Sethi, Nikita; Pothiyill, Dan Isaac; Sreelakshmi, Edavana Santhosh; Sayyad, Mehmood Gulab; Sethi, Rishi",PLoS One,,390

Data were collected for each fertility trait from 3435 test-week records from 715 hens, 158 mate sires, and 972 pedigree animals. Three random regression models were analyzed: model 1 (M1: A + PE) was adjusted by using additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Model 2 (M2: A + PE + D) was adjusted by using the dominance effect. Finally, model 3 (M3: A + MS + PE + D) was adjusted by using the mate sire effect. The results found the low heritability of FER (M1 to M3), HOF (M1 to M3), and HOS (M1 to M3) ranged from 0.031-0.040, 0.037-0.066, and 0.040-0.059, respectively. Adjustment for the dominance and mate sire effects in M3 reduced the upward bias in heritability and improved the accuracy of variance component estimates compared to M1 and M2. In conclusion, the genetic evaluation for FER, HOF, and HOS can include the dominance and MS effects to increase the accuracy of evaluation of breeding values and plan for mate selection in breeding programs.","Mookprom, Suphunnee; Duangjinda, Monchai; Puangdee, Somsook; Kenchaiwong, Wootichai; Boonkum, Wuttigrai",Trop Anim Health Prod,,390

291433,Moving Patient Care Forward in the Biden Era,2021,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, can be used to treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with observed improvements in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case series. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to determine if tocilizumab benefits patients hospitalized with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe, &#8805; 3 L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; P < .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; P < .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; P = .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 153 [64%]) comprised 90% of those with severe disease; 44% of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs 71 mg/L; P < .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; P < .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83% vs 91%; P = .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95% CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P = .002). INTERPRETATION: A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.","Price, Christina C; Altice, Frederick L; Shyr, Yu; Koff, Alan; Pischel, Lauren; Goshua, George; Azar, Marwan M; Mcmanus, Dayna; Chen, Sheau-Chiann; Gleeson, Shana E; Britto, Clemente J; Azmy, Veronica; Kaman, Kelsey; Gaston, David C; Davis, Matthew; Burrello, Trisha; Harris, Zachary; Villanueva, Merceditas S; Aoun-Barakat, Lydia; Kang, Insoo; Seropian, Stuart; Chupp, Geoffrey; Bucala, Richard; Kaminski, Naftali; Lee, Alfred I; LoRusso, Patricia Mucci; Topal, Jeffrey E; Dela Cruz, Charles; Malinis, Maricar",Chest,,390

PURPOSE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we attempted to investigate the association between heart failure (HF) and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, ""Heart failure"" and ""COVID-19"". The outcome of interest was mortality and poor prognosis (defined by incidence of severe COVID-19 infection, admission to ICU, and use of ventilator) in patients with preexisting heart failure with coronavirus disease. RESULTS: We identified 204 potential articles from our search, and 22 duplicates were removed. After screening of the titles and abstracts of the remaining 182 articles we identified 92 potentially relevant articles. We excluded 74 studies due to the following reasons: four studies were systematic reviews, two studies were meta-analyses, three articles were literature reviews, and 65 articles did not report on the outcome of interest. Finally, we included the remaining 18 studies in our qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. There were 21,640 patients from 18 studies. HF was associated with hospitalization in COVID19 HR was 2.37 [1.48, 3.79; p < 0.001], high heterogeneity [I2, 82%; p < 0.001]. HF was associated with a poor outcome demonstrated by an OR of 2.86 [2.07; 3.95; p < 0.001] high heterogeneity [I2, 80%; p < 0.001]. Patient with preexisting HF was associated with higher mortality OR of 3.46 [2.52, 4.75; p < 0.001] moderately high heterogeneity [I2, 77%; p < 0.001].

293145,Allocating scarce intensive care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic: practical challenges to theoretical frameworks,2021,"As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the essential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on our economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases optimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model people's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage between economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period of the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19 pandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the outbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.","Fu, Yuting; Xiang, Haitao; Jin, Hanqing; Wang, Ning",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06070v1.pdf,390
293275,Late presentation of organising pneumonia in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has necessitated significant changes to healthcare delivery but little is known regarding patient opinions of risks compared with benefits. This study investigates patient perceptions concerning attendance for planned orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 250 adult patients from the elective orthopaedic waiting list at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board were telephoned during lockdown. They were risk stratified for COVID-19 based on British Orthopaedic Association guidance and a discussion was held to determine patient willingness to proceed with surgery. The primary outcome measure was patients' willingness to proceed. RESULTS: Of the total number telephoned, 196 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 57.4 years; 129 patients were willing to attend for surgery, leaving over one-third wishing to cancel or defer. The most frequent reason given for not wishing to attend was fear of contracting COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference in the willingness to proceed observed with increasing clinical risk (&#967;2(3) = 50.073, p = .000) with almost double the expected count of unwilling to proceed in the high and very high risk groups, equalled by half the expected count in the low risk group. DISCUSSION: This study illustrates the variable and personal decisions that patients are making about orthopaedic care because of COVID-19. It highlights the need for change to departmental processes regarding recommencement of planned surgical lists. It also reconfirms the importance of regular communication and shared decision making between a well-informed patient and a holistic orthopaedic team.","Kinghorn, A F; Mercer, S T; Yasin, T; John, A; Trickett, R W",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,390
293603,"Anticipating 3rd COVID wave: If we sweat in peace, less we bleed in war",2021,"Laminarin is an abundant algal polysaccharide that serves as carbon storage and fuel to meet the nutrition demands of heterotrophic microbes. Laminarin depolymerization catalyzed by microbial extracellular enzymes initiates remineralization, a key process in ocean biogeochemical cycles. Here, we described a glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family laminarinase from a marine algae-associated flavobacterium at the biochemical and structural levels. We found that the endolytic enzyme cleaved laminarin with a preference for ß-1,3-glycoside linkages and showed transglycosylation activity across a broad range of acceptors. We also solved and compared high-resolution crystal structures of laminarinase in the apo form and in complex with ß-1,3-tetrasaccharides, revealing an expanded catalytic cleft formed following substrate binding. Moreover, structure and mutagenesis studies identified multiple specific contacts between the enzyme and glucosyl residues essential for the substrate specificity for ß-1,3-glucan. These results provide novel insights into the structural requirements for substrate binding and catalysis of GH16 family laminarinase, enriching our understanding of bacterial utilization of algal laminarin.IMPORTANCE Heterotrophic bacterial communities are key players in marine biogeochemical cycling due to their ability to remineralize organic carbon. Processing of complex organic matter requires heterotrophic bacteria to produce extracellular enzymes with precise specificity to depolymerize substrates to sizes sufficiently small for uptake. Thus, extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis initiates microbe-driven heterotrophic carbon cycling. In this study, based on biochemical and structural analyses, we revealed the depolymerization mechanism of ß-1, 3-glucan, a carbon reserve in algae, by laminarinase from an alga-associated marine flavobacterium. The findings provide new insights into the substrate recognition and catalysis of bacterial laminarinase and promote a better understanding of how extracellular enzymes are involved in organic matter cycling.","Yang, Jian; Xu, Yuqun; Miyakawa, Takuya; Long, Lijuan; Tanokura, Masaru",,,390
293657,Disrespect and abuse of women during the process of childbirth at health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread over the world rapidly creating one of the largest pandemics ever. The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value. We also estimate that the implementation of the latter a week earlier or later would have lead to a difference of about respectively -13k and +50k hospital deaths by the end of lock-down. The present parsimonious discrete-time framework constitutes a useful tool for now- and forecasting simultaneously community incidence and ICU capacity strain.","Sofonea, Mircea T; Reyné, Bastien; Elie, Baptiste; Djidjou-Demasse, Ramsès; Selinger, Christian; Michalakis, Yannis; Alizon, Samuel",Epidemics,,390

The public's gaze is focused on the urgent health crisis, while many children are at risk due to social isolation and reduced social services. OBJECTIVE: Examine child protection in Israel during COVID-19, as portrayed in mainstream news media and government policy documents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study analyzed all policy documents and mainstream media reports published in Israel from March to May 2020, during the initial mandatory nationwide quarantine. METHODS: (1) Search of relevant articles in mainstream news websites; (2) Search of documents in official websites of relevant government ministries and agencies. RESULTS: 28 government policy documents and 22 media articles were found relevant. When examined chronologically, what stood out was the initial decision to shut down social services, including some of the residential care units for youth at risk, and declare social workers ""non-essential"". These decisions were revoked a few weeks into the quarantine, following persistent media pressure by child advocates, resulting in minor changes in policy. CONCLUSION: Children were initially invisible to Israeli policymakers facing the pandemic, highlighting the centrality of advocates promoting children's rights and of mainstream news media in disseminating the discourse of protecting children from maltreatment, especially in times of crisis. Moreover, the study points to the heightened threat to at-risk children due to inadequate policies, and to the urgent need to develop child protection policies in order to avoid further risk in future global crises.","Katz, Carmit; Cohen, Noa",Child Abuse Negl,,390

295839,Dying during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Impact of Infection Control Measures at the Bedside,2021,"Tocilizumab is one of few treatments that have been shown to improve mortality in patients with COVID-19, but increased demand has led to relative global shortages. Recently, it has been suggested that lower doses, or fixed doses, of tocilizumab could be a potential solution to conserve the limited global supply while conferring equivalent therapeutic benefit to the dosing regimens studied in major trials. The relationship between tocilizumab dose, exposure, and response in COVID-19 has not been adequately characterized. There are a number of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters which likely differ between patients with severe COVID-19 and patients in whom tocilizumab was studied during the FDA approval process. Likewise, it is unclear whether a threshold exposure is necessary for tocilizumab efficacy. The safety and efficacy of fixed versus weight-based dosing of tocilizumab has been evaluated outside of COVID-19, but it is uncertain if these observations are generalizable to severe or critical COVID-19. In the current review, we consider the potential advantages and limitations of alternative tocilizumab dosing strategies. Leveraging PK models and simulation analyses, we demonstrate that a fixed single dose of tocilizumab 400 mg is unlikely to produce PK exposures equivalent to those achieved in the REMAP-CAP trial, though weight-stratified dosing appears to produce more uniform exposure distribution. Data from current and future trials could provide PK/PD insight to better inform dosing strategies at the bedside. Ultimately, rational dosing strategies that balance available limited supply with patient needs are required.","Leung, Elizabeth; Jorgensen, Sarah C.J.; Crass, Ryan L.; Raybardhan, Sumit; Langford, Bradley; Moore, W.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited and classified into one of the following four groups: normal controls (n = 52), diabetes without DR (n = 49), non-proliferative DR (n = 51) and proliferative DR (n = 38). Using OCTA, the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the choriocapillaris vessel densities were measured and compared in different macular areas: the fovea (1-mm diameter circular area), parafovea (1-3-mm diameter ring) and perifovea (3-6-mm ring). RESULTS: With DR progression, vessel densities in the SCP and DCP as well as the choriocapillaris decreased, while the foveal avascular zone area increased (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with controls, the SCP and DCP vessel densities of the diabetes without DR group were decreased in all areas of the macula (p < 0.020 for all), while the choriocapillaris vessel density was decreased only in the perifoveal area (p = 0.823 for the foveal area; p = 0.631 for the parafoveal area; p = 0.039 for the perifoveal area). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that all retinal and choroidal microvascular indices were significantly associated with the DR severity. CONCLUSION: The morphological changes in the macular microvasculature were associated with DR severity. Also, the changes were found to be more vulnerable in the retinal capillary plexuses than the choriocapillaris.","Ryu, Gahyung; Kim, Inhye; Sagong, Min",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,390

Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. RESULTS: 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.","Deng, Qing; Hu, Bo; Zhang, Yao; Wang, Hao; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Hu, Wei; Cheng, Yuting; Yan, Jie; Ping, Haiqin; Zhou, Qing",Int J Cardiol,,390
296805,Comparison of Time to Clinical Improvement With vs Without Remdesivir Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic strained health-care systems throughout the world. For some, available medical resources could not meet the increased demand and rationing was ultimately required. Hospitals and governments often sought to establish triage committees to assist with allocation decisions. However, for institutions operating under crisis standards of care (during times when standards of care must be substantially lowered in the setting of crisis), relying on these committees for rationing decisions was impractical-circumstances were changing too rapidly, occurring in too many diverse locations within hospitals, and the available information for decision making was notably scarce. Furthermore, a utilitarian approach to decision making based on an analysis of outcomes is problematic due to uncertainty regarding outcomes of different therapeutic options. We propose that triage committees could be involved in providing policies and guidance for clinicians to help ensure equity in the application of rationing under crisis standards of care. An approach guided by egalitarian principles, integrated with utilitarian principles, can support physicians at the bedside when they must ration scarce resources.","Supady, Alexander; Curtis, J Randall; Abrams, Darryl; Lorusso, Roberto; Bein, Thomas; Boldt, Joachim; Brown, Crystal E; Duerschmied, Daniel; Metaxa, Victoria; Brodie, Daniel",Lancet Respir.

Comment on Br J Anaesth 2021; 126: 44-7,2020,"BACKGROUND: To fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have implemented social distancing and lockdowns. We investigated the changes in the trauma patterns of emergency plastic surgeries in the midst of a pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients treated for emergency plastic surgeries was performed at our hospital in Seoul. We conducted the analysis between March 1 and June 30, 2020, and compared the data obtained with that of the same period in 2019. We also investigated changes in trauma patterns according to the social distancing level from July 2020 to February 2021. RESULTS: There was a total of 800 emergency plastic surgery patients from March to June 2020, which was less than the 981 in the corresponding period in 2019. The proportion of patients aged 7-17 years and &gt;= 80 in 2020 showed a significant decrease. In 2020, patients presenting with facial trauma decreased and hand trauma, markedly laceration, increased significantly. In 2020, more injuries happened at home, whereas significantly fewer injuries happened on the streets. In 2020, slipping and sports injury decreased, whereas penetrating injury increased significantly. In the changes observed according to the social distancing level, there were significant differences in age classification, facial open wound, and the mechanism of injury. CONCLUSION: Social distancing has caused a change in emergency plastic surgeries. To ensure safe and appropriate treatment, strict epidemiologic workup and protective equipment are required.","Yoon, Y. S.; Chung, C. H.; Min, K. H.",Archives of Craniofacial Surgery,,390

In May 2020, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) held a VC, free-of-charge. In the absence of systematic studies on this topic, the aim of this study is to evaluate the attendance and perceived quality of the 2020 EAN virtual congress (VC) compared to the 2019 EAN face-to-face congress (FFC). METHODS: Analysis of demographic data of participants obtained from the online registration collected. Comparison of the two congresses based on a survey with questions on the perception of speakers' performance, quality of networking, and other aspects. RESULTS: Of 43,596 registered participants, 20,694 active participants attended the VC. Compared to 2019, the number of participants tripled (6916 in 2019) and the cumulated number of participants attending the sessions was five times higher (169,334 in 2020 vs 33,024 in 2019). Out of active participants 55% were from outside Europe, 42% were board-certified neurologists (FFC: 80%), and 21% were students (FFC: 0.6%). The content of the congress was evaluated as 'above expectation' by 56% of the attendees (FFC: 41%). Out of the respondents who had been exposed to earlier EAN congresses 73% preferred the FFC congress compared to the VC (17%). CONCLUSION: The VC fulfilled the main mission of organizing high quality EAN congresses despite the restrictions of the impersonal format. The geographical distribution of the participants prove the expected higher inclusivity of a VC.

Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","Oulas, Anastasis; Zanti, Maria; Tomazou, Marios; Zachariou, Margarita; Minadakis, George; Bourdakou, Marilena M; Pavlidis, Pavlos; Spyrou, George M",PLoS One,,390
305406,Who is the Most Stressed During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Data From 26 Countries and Areas,2020,"Introduction/Aim: Regular exercise may have beneficial effects on high blood-pressure, as shown in different types of experimental hypertension models in rats. The present study aims to investigate the effects of 6-week swimming training on blood pressure, oxidative stress variables of selected tissues, serum adrenomedullin (ADM) levels, and in situ muscle contraction in rats with hypertension induced by N&#969;-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOs). Materials and Methods: Twenty-six male Sprague Dawley, 8 weeks of age, rats were randomly divided into four groups: (I) normotensive (C), (II) normotensive + exercise (E), (III) hypertensive (L), and (IV) hypertensive + exercise (LE). Hypertension was induced by the oral administration of L-NAME (60 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Exercise was performed 5 times (1-h each) per week for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood and tissue samples (the gastrocnemius muscle, heart, kidney, and thoracic aorta) were collected following contractile properties of the gastrocnemius muscle in situ weredetermined. In the collected tissues, oxidative stress (e.g., lipid oxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity) and serum ADM levels were measured. 6-week L-NAME administration per se (Group L) led to a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to other groups. Results: Importantly, 6-week exercise caused a protective effect of high blood pressure in the rats received L-NAME (Group LE). The level of ADM was lower in the rats received L-NAME than that of the control group. L-NAME increased lipid peroxidation in the thoracic aorta and decreased superoxide dismutase in the heart, kidney and muscle, and decreased catalase and glutathione in the heart. However, the exercise intervention did not have protective effect on the L-NAME-mediated oxidative damage in the collected tissues. Conclusion: In conclusion, 6-week exercise intervention rescued rats from high blood pressure, but did not have ameliorative effect on the decreased ADM levels.","Koc Yildirim, Ece; Dedeoglu, Zahide; Kaya, Mehmet; Uner, Aykut G",Clin Exp Hypertens,,390

In the absence of a vaccine, the goal is to target the viral life cycle and alleviate the lung-damaging symptoms of infection, which can be life-threatening. There are numerous protein kinases associated with these processes that can be inhibited by FDA-approved drugs, the repurposing of which presents an alluring option as they have been thoroughly vetted for safety and are more readily available for treatment of patients and testing in clinical trials. Here, we characterize more than 30 approved kinase inhibitors in terms of their antiviral potential, due to their measured potency against key kinases required for viral entry, metabolism, or reproduction. We also highlight inhibitors with potential to reverse pulmonary insufficiency because of their anti-inflammatory activity, cytokine suppression, or antifibrotic activity. Certain agents are projected to be dual-purpose drugs in terms of antiviral activity and alleviation of disease symptoms, however drug combination is also an option for inhibitors with optimal pharmacokinetic properties that allow safe and efficacious co-administration with other drugs, such as antiviral agents, IL-6 blocking agents, or other kinase inhibitors.","Weisberg, Ellen; Parent, Alexander; Yang, Priscilla L; Sattler, Martin; Liu, Qingsong; Liu, Qingwang; Wang, Jinhua; Meng, Chengcheng; Buhrlage, Sara J; Gray, Nathanael; Griffin, James D",Pharm Res,,390

Whenever herpes zoster leads to trigeminal involvement, the ophthalmic division is the most implicated. COVID-19 emerged as a viral cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome that spread all over the world in the last months. Co-infection with COVID and other viruses has been registered, but sparsely and embracing the respiratory ones. METHODS: report a case of a co-infection of COVID-19 with VZV, and review the literature. RESULTS: 39-year-old immunocompetent man with oligosymptomatic infection by COVID-19 evolved to left facial herpes zoster affecting the three divisions of trigeminal nerve. The co-infection was remotely registered with other respiratory virus, being influenza the most mentioned. However, the present case is associated to the emergence of a latent virus infection, which might be related to the viral inflammatory response, especially ascending from the nasal cavity, where trigeminal branches are also placed. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of the latent infection by VZV under a rare presentation might illustrate the impact at least locally of COVID-19, once retrograde reactivation of VZV was possibly induced in a young immunocompetent patient.","de Freitas Ferreira, Ana Carolina Andorinho; Romão, Tayla Taynan; SIlva Macedo, Yuri; Pupe, Camila; Nascimento, Osvaldo Jm",Eur. j. neurol,,390

311849,Outcomes Associated With Use of a Kinin B2 Receptor Antagonist Among Patients With COVID-19,2020,"Human C5a (hC5a), one of the pro-inflammatory glycoproteins of the complement system is known to undergo production hyperdrive in response to stress and infection. hC5a has been associated with the pathogenesis of many chronic and acute diseases, due to its proven ability in triggering the 'cytokine storm', by binding to its cognate receptor C5aR, expressed in myriad of tissues. Given the pleiotropic downstream function of hC5a, it is logical to consider the hC5a or its precursors as potential drug targets, and thus, we have been rationally pursuing the idea of neutralizing the harmful effect of excessive hC5a, by implementing the repurposing strategies for FDA-approved drugs. Indeed, the proof of principle biophysical studies published recently is encouraging, which strongly supports the potential of this strategy. Considering BSA-carprofen as a reference model system, the current study further explores the inherent conformational plasticity of hC5a and its effect in accommodating more than one drug molecule cooperatively at multiple sites. The data generated by recruiting a battery of experimental and computational biology techniques strongly suggest that hC5a can sequentially accommodate more than one raloxifene molecule with an estimated Ki â¼ 0.5 µM and Ki â¼ 3.58 µM on its surface at non-analogous sites. The study hints at exploration of polypharmacology approach, as a new avenue for discovering synergistic drug molecule pairs, or drug molecules with 'broad-range' binding affinity for targeting the different 'hot spots' on hC5a, as an alternative combination therapy for possible management of the 'cytokine storm'-related inflammatory diseases, like COVID19.

In this study, we report the anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties of aqueous methanolic extract of Cuscuta reflexa (Cs.Cr) against contact frostbite. Thirty rats were divided into five groups including three treatment groups with increasing doses of Cs.Cr, a standard drug group receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and a metal bar-induced frostbite group. Frostbite injury was induced by a 3 × 3.5 cm metal bar frozen up to -79°C on shaved skin for continuous 3 minutes. Wounded area percentages were recorded to measure the healing rate in response to Cs.Cr administration. Haematological parameters and malondialdehyde content were also noted. On treatment with Cs.Cr, the healing rate is drastically increased and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Results were compared with frostbite and ASA (standard drug group). These results indicate that Cs.Cr possesses excellent wound-healing properties against frostbite injury and can prove to be a prospective compound in such conditions.","Hassan, Waseem; Buabeid, Manal Ali; Kalsoom, Umme; Bakht, Sahar; Akhtar, Imran; Iqbal, Furqan; Arafa, El-Shaimaa A",Biomed Res Int,,390
318931,Inpatient Use of Metformin and Acarbose Is Associated with Reduced Mortality of COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Elucidation of interactive relation between chemicals and genes is of key relevance not only for discovering new drug leads in drug development but also for repositioning existing drugs to novel therapeutic targets. Recently, biological network-based approaches have been proven to be effective in predicting chemical-gene interactions. RESULTS: We present CGINet, a graph convolutional network-based method for identifying chemical-gene interactions in an integrated multi-relational graph containing three types of nodes: chemicals, genes, and pathways. We investigate two different perspectives on learning node embeddings. One is to view the graph as a whole, and the other is to adopt a subgraph view that initial node embeddings are learned from the binary association subgraphs and then transferred to the multi-interaction subgraph for more focused learning of higher-level target node representations. Besides, we reconstruct the topological structures of target nodes with the latent links captured by the designed substructures. CGINet adopts an end-to-end way that the encoder and the decoder are trained jointly with known chemical-gene interactions. We aim to predict unknown but potential associations between chemicals and genes as well as their interaction types. CONCLUSIONS: We study three model implementations CGINet-1/2/3 with various components and compare them with baseline approaches. As the experimental results suggest, our models exhibit competitive performances on identifying chemical-gene interactions. Besides, the subgraph perspective and the latent link both play positive roles in learning much more informative node embeddings and can lead to improved prediction.","Wang, Wei; Yang, Xi; Wu, Chengkun; Yang, Canqun",BMC Bioinformatics,,390

322042,Appropriateness of intensive care treatments near the end of life during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to cancellation and deferral of many cancer investigations, including CT colonography (CTC). In May 2020, BSGAR and SCoR issued guidelines outlining steps for conduct of CTC in the early recovery phase. We evaluated the implementation of these in four English hospital trusts. METHODS: Ethical permission was not required for this multicentre service evaluation. We identified patients undergoing CTC over a 2-month period from May to July 2020 at four Trusts. We recorded demographics, scan indications, colonic findings, and incidental lung base changes compatible with COVID-19. A subset of patients were contacted via telephone to document new symptoms 2 weeks following their scan. Staff were contacted to determine if any acquired COVID-19 during the period. RESULTS: 224 patients (118 male, 52.7%) were scanned during the period. In 55 patients (24.6%), CTC showed a &#8805;6 mm polyp. 33 of 224 (14.7%) scans showed incidental lung base changes felt unrelated to COVID-19, and only one patient had changes indeterminate for COVID-19; no classic COVID-19 pulmonary changes were found. Of 169 patients with telephone follow-up, none reported any new symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia) within 14 days of CTC. None of the 86 staff contacted developed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found no cases of patients or staff acquiring COVID-19 infection following CTC; and no evidence of significant asymptomatic COVID-19 patients attending for CTC appointments based on lung base changes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our findings suggest that current practice is unlikely to contribute significantly to spread of SARS-nCOV2. Cancer and significant polyp detection rates were high, underlining the importance of maintaining service provision.","Peprah, David; Plumb, Andrew; Corr, Alison; Muckian, Janice; Smith, Kathryn; Sergot, Antoni; Kuah, Jia Ying; Stephenson, James",Br J Radiol,,390

Data suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and to require life support. Vaccination is currently considered the most effective preventive intervention against COVID-19 in the United States. However, the unsurprising exclusion of pregnant women as participants in initial COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials has led to a gap in the scientific data regarding the safety profile and subsequent use of COVID-19 vaccine for women who are pregnant. Experts believe current COVID-19 vaccines developed using either mRNA or viral vector vaccine technologies and authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration are unlikely to pose obstetrical or neonatal risks. Still, current vaccination recommendations for women who are pregnant have been both mixed and contradictory. The need to expeditiously identify, collate, and disseminate available vaccine-related safety data is critical to preventing severe illness while also advancing the health and wellness of an underserved high-risk population subgroup.","Holness, N.

In this review we focus on the role of macrophages in COVID-19, as pathogenesis of the new coronavirus infection, especially in cases complicated by ARDS, largely depends on macrophage phenotypes and functionalities. We describe participation of monocytes, monocyte-derived and resident lung macrophages in SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS and discuss possible utility of cell therapies for its treatment, notably the use of reprogrammed macrophages with stable pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes.","Kosyreva, Anna; Dzhalilova, Dzhuliia; Lokhonina, Anastasia; Vishnyakova, Polina; Fatkhudinov, Timur",Front Immunol,,390
328658,Evaluation of the suitability of 19 pharmacogenomics biomarkers for individualized metformin therapy for type 2 diabetes patients,2020,"NASAs Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) will be the first robotic mission to prospect for water ice near the south pole of the Moon in late 2023 on a 100 Earth-day mission. The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine howthe Moons resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cst of VIPERs rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rovers software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than on board the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rovers software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code rather than following traditional (spir al, waterfall, etc.) development methods and mouse code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPERs rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large opersource software, and the strategie developed to account for use of nonspace flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and clusteanalysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate.","Stukes, S.; Allan, M.; Bajjalieh, G.; Deans, M.; Fong, T.; Hihn, J.; Utz, H.; Ieee,",IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf),,390

329632,"Evaluation of Viruses Associated With Acute Respiratory Infections in Long-Term Care Facilities Using a Novel Method: Wisconsin, 2016‒2019",2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, between March and May 2020, in Italy, people were asked to shelter in place and most had to put their life on hold, while news of the spread of the virus constantly were broadcasted. The change in habits and the potential exposure to a dangerous virus can be categorized as a catastrophic event, which are usually traumatic and therefore have psychological consequences for the people involved. OBJECTIVE: Assuming the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible traumatic event, this study aims to explore the contingent behavioural and psychological impact of COVID-19 spread and related lockdown on the Italian general population, through measuring anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms . METHODS: An ad hoc-survey was set up for the this exploratory research, including the standardized Italian versions of the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) and the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and ad hoc items concerning behavioural reactions due to the pandemic spread and related mass quarantine. Participants were recruited across convenient web-based and mobile app channels using a snowball sampling technique. Data was collected from March 25th to May 1st, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: One-thousand one hundred and ninety-five individuals (851 women and 342 men) completed 60% or more of the survey and were considered for analyses. Mean age was 40 years (s.d. = 14.948). Participants resided in 78 Italian provinces (out of 107 territorial divisions), with 25.7% residing in the Milan province and 9.2% from the Monza and Brianza provinces, closest to the epicentre of the Italian outbreak. RESULTS: During the worst months of the first wave of the Pandemic, the Italian population suffered high level of distress (GAD-7 m = 6.89, s.d. = 5.08; IER-R mean score = 27.86, s.d. 17.46), respectively indicating mild presence of anxiety symptoms, and high levels of PTSD symptoms. Gender seems to be a discriminating variable with women scoring significantly higher than man, both for anxiety symptoms (H (1) = 82.91, p < .001) and all dimensions of PTSD symptoms (intrusion H (1) = 71.23, p < .001, avoidance H (1) = 61.28, p < .001), and hyperarousal (H (1) = 67.348, p < .001). People from Generations Y and Z show to be at higher risk of developing PTSD (V = .746, F (3,1041) =1017.19, p = .001) and GAD symptoms (F (3,1041) = 5.113, p = .002) than older generations. CONCLUSIONS: Gender and generation appeared to be the most consistent risk factor for higher levels of generalized anxiety and PTSD symptoms in the current pandemic. Other variables - such as information seeking behaviours, parental and marriage status, chronic conditions - yielded less consistent evidence. Results indicate the need of including psychological interventions as a standard tool during the emergency management of a catastrophic events such as a pandemic.","Brivio, Eleonora; Oliveri, Serena; Guiddi, Paolo; Pravettoni, Gabriella",BMC Public Health,,390

335373,COVID-19 mimicking dengue fever with the initial manifestation of retro-orbital pain - A Rare Case,2020,"BACKGROUND: In order to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Germany has implemented drastic restrictions on public or social life, while health institutions are invoked to postpone elective procedures. Although urologists are less involved in the direct treatment of COVID-19 patients, the current situation strongly affects the urological work routine. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of work and personal life among urologists in Germany. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 589 urologists in Germany participated in an online survey between March 27 and April 11, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Participants were stratified into subgroups according to professional characteristics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most urologists rated Germany as ""well prepared"" and the increasing restrictions of social life as ""very positive."" Routine operation was more restricted in hospitals than in the outpatient sector (p = 0.046). Moreover, urologists from the outpatient sector felt significantly less prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.001), reported a higher shortage of protective medical equipment (p < 0.001), and described a tendency toward a higher level of threat (p = 0.054). Although restrictions regarding telemedicine approaches were reported by 60% of participants, the outpatient sector used telehealth more frequently than hospitals (25.5% vs 17.0%, p < 0.001). Limitations include the national design and the restricted survey period. CONCLUSIONS: This survey systematically evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and professional aspects of German urologists. We identified several issues, such as a higher shortage of medical protective equipment in the outpatient sector that could trigger specific measures to further improve the quality of urological care in Germany. PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated a potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on professional and personal aspects of the urologists in Germany. Our results suggest that the outpatient sector should receive specific attention as, for example, shortage of protective equipment was more common.","Paffenholz, Pia; Peine, Arne; Fischer, Nicolas; Hellmich, Martin; Pfister, David; Heidenreich, Axel; Loosen, Sven H",Eur Urol Focus,,390
335532,"The Outbreak of COVID-19 and Diabetes in Korea: ""We Will Find a Way as We Have Always Done""",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread with rising new cases and deaths. Patients with cancer represent a uniquely vulnerable population not only with higher susceptibility to COVID-19 but also at increased risk for its complications. This review focuses on the implications of COVID-19 in the cardiovascular health of patients with cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients more susceptible to COVID-19 with increased severity of disease include those with cancer and cardiovascular comorbidities. In addition, the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute myocardial injury, thromboembolism, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericardial disease overlap with many of those encountered during cancer treatment.

337067,"Hunger, malnutrition and persistent COVID-19 lockdowns: A swift approach is required",2021,"The spread of COVID-19 and resulting local and national lockdowns have a host of potential consequences for demographic trends. While impacts on mortality and, to some extent, short-term migration flows are beginning to be documented, it is too early to measure actual consequences for family demography. To gain insight into potential future consequences of the lockdown for family demography, we use cross-national Google Trends search data to explore whether trends in searches for words related to fertility, relationship formation, and relationship dissolution changed following lockdowns compared to average, pre-lockdown levels in Europe and the United States. Because lockdowns were not widely anticipated or simultaneous in timing or intensity, we exploit variability over time and between countries (and U.S. states). We use a panel event-study design and difference-in-differences methods, and account for seasonal trends and average country-level (or state-level) differences in searches. We find statistically significant impacts of lockdown timing on changes in searches for terms such as wedding and those related to condom use, emergency contraception, pregnancy tests, and abortion, but little evidence of changes in searches related to fertility. Impacts for union formation and dissolution tended to only be statistically significant at the start of a lockdown with a return to average-levels about 2 to 3 months after lockdown initiation, particularly in Europe. Compared to Europe, returns to average search levels were less evident for the U.S., even 2 to 3 months after lockdowns were introduced. This may be due to the fact, in the U.S., health and social policy responses were less demarcated than in Europe, such that economic uncertainty was likely of larger magnitude. Such pandemic-related economic uncertainty may therefore have the potential to slightly increase already existing polarization in family formation behaviours in the U.S. Alongside contributing to the wider literature on economic uncertainty and family behaviors, this paper also proposes strategies for efficient use of Google Trends data, such as making relative comparisons and testing sensitivity to outliers, and provides a template and cautions for their use in demographic research when actual demographic trends data are not yet available.","Berger, Lawrence M; Ferrari, Giulia; Leturcq, Marion; Panico, Lidia; Solaz, Anne",PLoS One,,390

339525,Hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus: how not to repurpose a drug during a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy, as an aerosol-generating procedure, is considered as a high-risk surgery for health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Current recommendations are to perform tracheostomy after a period of intubation of > 14 days, with two consecutive negative throat swab tests, to lower the risk of contamination to HCWs. However, specific data for this recommendation are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate viral shedding into the environment, including HCWs, associated with bedside tracheostomy in the intensive care unit. METHODS: Samples obtained from the medical environment immediately after tracheostomy, including those from 19 surfaces, two air samples at 10 and 50 cm from the surgical site, and from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the surgeon and assistant, were tested for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in eight cases of bedside tracheostomy. We evaluated the rate of positive tests from the different samples obtained. RESULTS: Positive samples were identified in only one of the eight cases. These were obtained for the air sample at 10 cm and from the bed handrail and urine bag. There were no positive test results from the PPE samples. The patient with positive samples had undergone early tracheostomy, at 9 days after intubation, due to a comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that delayed tracheostomy, after an extended period of endotracheal intubation, might be a considerably less contagious procedure than early tracheostomy (defined as < 14 days after intubation).","Xu, Kai; Zhang, Xin-Hao; Long, Xiao-Bo; Lu, Xiang; Liu, Zheng",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,390

Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, this manuscript presents a literature review on indoor air sampling methods to detect viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. The review was conducted using the following online databases: Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed, and the Boolean operators ""AND"" and ""OR"" to combine the following keywords: air sampler, coronavirus, COVID-19, indoor, and SARS-CoV-2. This review included 25 published papers reporting sampling and detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments. Most of the papers focused on sampling and analysis of viruses in aerosols present in contaminated areas and potential transmission to adjacent areas. Negative results were found in 10 studies, while 15 papers showed positive results in at least one sample. Overall, papers report several sampling devices and methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, using different approaches for distance, height from the floor, flow rates, and sampled air volumes. Regarding the efficacy of each mechanism as measured by the percentage of investigations with positive samples, the literature review indicates that solid impactors are more effective than liquid impactors, or filters, and the combination of various methods may be recommended. As a final remark, determining the sampling method is not a trivial task, as the samplers and the environment influence the presence and viability of viruses in the samples, and thus a case-by-case assessment is required for the selection of sampling systems.","Borges, João Tito; Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Maniero, Milena Guedes; Guimarães, José Roberto",,,390

This study aims to assess how some conditions, such as storage period, temperature, media or buffer, and sample types, affect the results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-qPCR. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were collected from Boramae Medical Center for 2 months (from May to June 2020) and stored in different media or buffers at different temperatures. RESULTS: As a result of examining confirmed patient samples, RT-qPCR results were not significantly affected by 2°C to 8°C storage until after 7 days. When stored at 20°C to 22°C or above 35°C, the results were affected negatively even after 1 day. Higher storage temperatures resulted in a lower probability of detecting viral nucleic acids because of degradation. Samples stored in pH-controlled media or buffer were more stable than those stored in nonbuffer states. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of storage temperature and media or buffer and performing RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as soon as possible after sample collection.","Kim, Namhee; Kwon, Ahrin; Roh, Eun Youn; Yoon, Jong Hyun; Han, Mi Seon; Park, Sang-Won; Park, Hyunwoong; Shin, Sue",Am. j. clin. pathol,,390

In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.","Morales-Narváez, Eden; Dincer, Can",Biosens Bioelectron,,390

Such complex data structures demand novel analysis methods and tools for exploratory analysis. RESULTS: We propose a method to predict the putative ligand-receptor interactions between cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing data. This is achieved by inferring and incorporating interactions in a multidirectional graph, thereby enabling contextual exploratory analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can detect common and specific interactions between cell types in mouse brain and human tumors, and that these interactions fit with expected outcomes. These interactions also include predictions made with molecular ligands integrating information from several types of genes necessary for ligand production and transport. Our implementation is general and can be appended to any transcriptome analysis pipeline to provide unbiased hypothesis generation regarding ligand to receptor interactions between cell populations or for network analysis in silico.

However, in order to satisfy the needs of citizens, the strictest containment measures can be only executed for short period. This article compares two types of containment strategies: a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period and an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. When to implement the strictest measures is also of interest. A prediction model is proposed and a simple tool is developed for policy makers to compare different containment strategies. As an example, a county with 2.8 million population with initial 200 infectious cases is considered, where about 0.15% people died during the pandemic. Compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and executing the strictest measures earlier will cause less mortality.","Lu, Min",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13997v1.pdf,390

Our study aimed to determine the risk factors of death and severe illness requiring supplemental oxygen therapy based on the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Korea. METHODS: In this study, we used data provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) and analyzed a total of 5,068 patients with COVID-19, excluding 19 pregnant women and 544 individuals with missing data. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine the impact of early symptoms on survival and severe disease. Logistic regression models included sex, age, number of comorbidities, symptoms on admission, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature as explanatory variables, and death and oxygen therapy as outcome variables. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that the male sex, older age (&#8805; 60 years), higher number of comorbidities, presence of symptoms on admission, heart rate &#8805; 120 bpm, and body temperature &#8805; 37.5°C presented with higher risk of in-hospital death and oxygen therapy requirement. Conversely, rhinorrhea and headache were associated with a low risk of death and oxygen therapy requirement. The findings showed that cough, sputum, and fever were the most common symptoms on admission, while 25.3% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with high-risk early symptoms on admission, such as dyspnea and altered mental status, and those without low-risk symptoms of rhinorrhea and headache should be included in priority treatment groups.","Jang, Su Yeon; Seon, Jeong Yeon; Eun, Baik Lin; Koh, Seong Beom; Yoo, Jin Hong; Lee, Woo Yong; Yum, Ho Kee; Yoon, Seok Jun; Oh, In Hwan; Bae, Sang Cheol; Chang, Sung Goo",J Korean Med Sci,,390

Tumor treating fields (TTFields) have emerged as a novel, locoregional, antineoplastic treatment modality with favorable efficacy and safety being demonstrated in the most aggressive type of malignant gliomas, glioblastoma (GBM). In 2 large randomized, controlled phase 3 trials, the addition of TTFields was associated with increased overall survival when combined with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) and comparable overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). TTFields target cancer cells by several mechanisms of action (MoA) including suppression of proliferation, migration and invasion, disruption of DNA repair and angiogenesis, antimitotic effects, and induction of apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Having several MoAs makes TTFields an attractive modality to combine with standard, salvage, and novel treatment regimens (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy). Treatment within the field of malignant gliomas is evolving to emphasize combinatorial approaches that work synergistically to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review the current use of TTFields in GBM, discuss MOA and treatment delivery, and consider the potential for its wider adoption in other gliomas.","Ghiaseddin, Ashley P; Shin, David; Melnick, Kaitlyn; Tran, David D",Curr Treat Options Oncol,,390

Diabetes Care 2020;43:1399-1407,2020,"Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) represent a vulnerable population who have been understudied in COVID-19 research. We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with SCZ and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of SCZ. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50 750 patients were included, of whom 823 were SCZ patients (1.6%). The SCZ patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25.6% vs 21.7%; adjusted OR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.08-1.56], P = .0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23.7% vs 28.4%; adjusted OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62-0.91], P = .0062) compared with controls. Significant interactions between SCZ and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (P = .0006 and P < .0001). SCZ patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7.89%). SCZ patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13.93%) and SCZ patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (-15.44% and -5.93%, respectively). Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between SCZ patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of SCZ patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during, and after hospitalization for reducing health disparities in this vulnerable population.","Fond, Guillaume; Pauly, Vanessa; Leone, Marc; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Orleans, Veronica; Loundou, Anderson; Lancon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Baumstarck, Karine; Boyer, Laurent",Schizophr. bull,,390

359802,Clinical features and origin of cases of parotiditis in an emergency department,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most stressful events of recent times. Among the population, healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are most likely to develop psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study thus aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian healthcare workers. METHODS: The responses of 145 healthcare workers (72 medical doctors and 73 nurses) were included in the final dataset. Participants were asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete: (a) quality of life and health-related Visual Analogue Scales, (b) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1, (c) Beck Depression Inventory, and (d) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. RESULTS: A comparison between healthcare professionals working in COVID-19 wards and other units revealed that the former reported higher levels of both depressive symptoms and PTSS. Moreover, the results of regression analyses showed that in healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, gender and marital status, and gender and age significantly predicted depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Particularly, being female and not in a relationship were found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, whereas being female and older were found to be related to higher levels of PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that specific predisposing factors could identify healthcare workers who are at high risk of developing mental health symptoms when faced with COVID-19 patients.","Di Tella, Marialaura; Romeo, Annunziata; Benfante, Agata; Castelli, Lorys",J Eval Clin Pract,,390

361202,Prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism in ED patients with Suspected COVID-19: The Truth Remains Unknown,2020,"Recently there has been an ongoing discussion about energy security. This has been caused by tensions affecting international relations, and the emergence of new geopolitical threats. As one of the main sources of primary energy, natural gas is an obvious subject of interest in this discussion. In Europe, the natural gas market is rapidly evolving, which has resulted in a lack of clarity regarding who is responsible for the security of the gas supply. It is not clear now how to measure the security of the gas supply in economic estimates and by whom that security should be financed. In this paper, the authors present an approach which can be used for valuation of energy security concerning the security of natural gas storage using stochastic modelling based on the mathematical model of the “Newsvendor problem”. The valuation is made from the point of view of countries and considers their individual attitudes to the risk of disruption of deliveries, which is a novel approach to the problem. The authors believe that the current level of storage capacities, as compared to the demand for natural gas, can show the attitude of each country to the risk and potential cost of stockout. In line with this belief, the target value in the model is not the optimal level of inventory, but the cost of stockout. The results show significant variations in the assessment of the risk. The future of natural gas as an important fuel and source of primary energy in Europe is not clear and unfavorable changes have been sped up by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gas (energy) companies in Europe are turning to decarbonization and green energy, and the pandemic has accelerated these changes. European energy companies used to see the use of natural gas as a transition fuel and a key component of their long-term decarbonization strategies, but now they are switching to multi-energy models through massive investments in renewables and hydrogen. Experts expect that gas will remain an important part of Europe’s energy supply, but it may be gradually replaced by hydrogen and renewables.","Kosowski, Piotr Kosowska Katarzyna",Energies,,390
361656,Distribution of Pediatric Vital Signs in the Emergency Department: A Nationwide Study,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim was to validate the Liverpool Peritonsillar abscess Score (LPS) externally in a new patient cohort. Our secondary aim was to modify the LPS in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic to produce a no-examination variant for use in this instance. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre external validation study. SETTING: Six different secondary care institutions across the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 16 years old who were referred to ENT with any uncomplicated sore throat such a tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess (PTA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for both the original LPS model and the modified model for COVID-19. RESULTS: The LPS model had sensitivity and specificity calculated at 98% and 79%, respectively. The LPS has a high negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was slightly lower at 63%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, including the area under the curve (AUROC), was 0.888 which indicates very good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: External validation of the LPS against an independent geographically diverse population yields high NPV. This may support non-specialist colleagues who may have concerns about mis-diagnosing a PTA. The COVID-19 modification of the LPS has a similar NPV, which may be of use where routine oral examination is to be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Selwyn, David; Yang, Ding; Heward, Elliot; Kerai, Ashwin; Thompson, Elinor; Shommakhi, Abulgasem; Faulkner, Scott; Siau, Richard; Walijee, Hussein; Hampton, Tom; Chudek, Dorota; Singhera, Supriya; Din, Waqas; Lau, Andrew S",Clin Otolaryngol,,390

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pulmonary function test parameters and laboratory parameters in COVID-19. METHOD: A total of 60 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests and laboratory parameters at admission and on day 7 of treatment were analysed. RESULTS: On day 7 of treatment, white blood cell count, CRP, and fibrinogen level were significantly lower than at admission (P = .002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively), while forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values were significantly higher compared with admitting values (P = .001 for both). Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in CRP from admission to day 7 of treatment correlated with the increase in FEV1 (r = 0.616, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.51, P = .01) during the same period. A decrease in the fibrinogen level was also correlated with an increase in FEV1 (r = 0.345, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.357, P = .01). CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen and CRP levels are easily accessible parameters that may help identify improvement or deterioration in pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients during follow-up and discharge while reducing the risk of transmission.","Kerget, Bugra; Aksakal, Alperen; Kerget, Ferhan",Int J Clin Pract,,390

368432,Care of traditional patients in the campaign against COVID-19: casualties of friendly fire,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to have occurred first in Wuhan, China in December 2019, before spreading to over 120 countries in the months that followed. It was declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" by the World Health Organization on January 31, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from human to human is through inhalation of respiratory droplets. Devising protective technologies for stopping the spread of the droplets of aerosol containing the viral particles is a vital requirement to curb the ongoing outbreak. However, the current generations of protective respirator masks in use are noted for their imperfect design and there is a need to develop their more advanced analogues, with higher blockage efficiency and the ability to deactivate the trapped bacteria and viruses. It is likely that one such design will be inspired by nanotechnologies. Here we describe a new design from Egypt, utilizing a reusable, recyclable, customizable, antimicrobial and antiviral respirator facial mask feasible for mass production. The novel design is based on the filtration system composed of a nanofibrous matrix of polylactic acid and cellulose acetate containing copper oxide nanoparticles and graphene oxide nanosheets and produced using the electrospinning technique. Simultaneously, the flat pattern fabricated from a thermoplastic composite material is used to provide a solid fit with the facial anatomy. This design illustrates an effort made in a developing setting to provide innovative solutions for combating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of potentially global significance.","Ahmed, Mohamed K; Afifi, Mohamed; Uskokovic, Vuk",J Infect Public Health,,390

(Special issue on diabetes and COVID-19: the IDF perspective.),2020,"BACKGROUND: The lack of objective data makes it difficult to establish the prognostic value of chemosensitive disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We aimed to prospectively monitor patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to see if the severity of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction associates with subsequent disease severity. METHODS: Multicentre prospective study that recruited 106 COVID-19 subjects at diagnosis. Chemosensitive functions were assessed with psychophysical tests within 4 days of clinical onset, at 10 and 20 days. Daily body temperature and oxygen saturation were recorded as markers of disease severity alongside need for hospitalisation. The correlation between olfactory and gustatory scores and disease severity was assessed with linear regression analysis. RESULTS: At T0, 71 patients (67%) presented with olfactory dysfunction while gustatory impairment was detected in 76 cases (65.6%). Chemosensitive disorders gradually improved over the observation period. No significant correlations were found between T0 chemosensitive scores and final disease severity. The correlation between olfactory scores and fever proved significant at T2 (p = 0.05), while the relationship with gustatory scores was significant at T1 (p = 0.01) and T2 (p < 0.001), however neither was clinically relevant. The correlation between chemosensitive scores and oxygen saturation was significant only for taste at T2 (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis found significant correlations between olfactory impairment severity and need for hospitalization at T2 (OR 3.750, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Initial objective olfactory and gustatory scores do not seem to have a significant prognostic value in predicting the severity of the COVID-19 course; however, persistence of olfactory dysfunction at 20 days, associated with a more severe course. Unfortunately, olfactory and gustatory dysfunction do not seem to hold prognostic value at the time of initial diagnosis.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo; Hopkins, Claire; Petrocelli, Marzia; Lechien, Jerome R; Soma, Damiano; Giovanditto, Federica; Rizzo, Davide; Salzano, Giovanni; Piombino, Pasquale; Saussez, Sven; De Riu, Giacomo",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,390

It is not known whether this is because of changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted. Objective: To describe changing in-hospital mortality rates over time after accounting for individual patient characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective cohort study of 20â¯736 adults with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were included in the US American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry and admitted to 107 acute care hospitals in 31 states from March through November 2020. A multiple mixed-effects logistic regression was then used to estimate the odds of in-hospital death adjusted for patient age, sex, body mass index, and medical history as well as vital signs, use of supplemental oxygen, presence of pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and hospital site. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital death adjusted for exposures for 4 periods in 2020. Results: The registry included 20â¯736 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March through November 2020 (9524 women [45.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [17.9] years); 3271 patients (15.8%) died in the hospital. Mortality rates were 19.1% in March and April, 11.9% in May and June, 11.0% in July and August, and 10.8% in September through November. Compared with March and April, the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital death were significantly lower in May and June (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76; P < .001), July and August (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.69; P < .001), and September through November (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, high rates of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality among registry patients in March and April 2020 decreased by more than one-third by June and remained near that rate through November. This difference in mortality rates between the months of March and April and later months persisted even after adjusting for age, sex, medical history, and COVID-19 disease severity and did not appear to be associated with changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted.","Roth, Gregory A; Emmons-Bell, Sophia; Alger, Heather M; Bradley, Steven M; Das, Sandeep R; de Lemos, James A; Gakidou, Emmanuela; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Hay, Simon; Hall, Jennifer L; Johnson, Catherine O; Morrow, David A; Rodriguez, Fatima; Rutan, Christine; Shakil, Saate; Sorensen, Reed; Stevens, Laura; Wang, Tracy Y; Walchok, Jason; Williams, Joseph; Murray, Christopher",JAMA Netw Open,,390

Till now there are no vaccines and explicit medicines available for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, therefore the initiatives like public health and social measures are helpful in limiting the quantity of contaminations and saving lives. Keeping this in view, an attempt has been made in the present work to identify the barriers which hinder the implementation of these public health and social measures METHODS: The barriers to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19 are identified using systematic literature review and these barriers are then categorized using Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. RESULTS: Results reveal that among ten identified barriers, Lack of resources for implementing public health and social measures is found to be the most influential barrier to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The successful implementation of public health and social measures depends on the adequate availability of resources which include medical equipment, personnel and financial dealings. The outcome of this research work will benefit and motivate the higher authorities to consider and overcome various challenges to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.","Maqbool, Annayath; Khan, Noor Zaman",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,390

However, systematic tracking of a lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been accomplished yet. Here, comprehensive analysis with differential gene expression analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was performed to identify the lncRNA signature for prediction of the overall survival of NSCLC patients. A risk-score model based on a 14-lncRNA signature was identified, which could classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups and show poor and improved outcomes, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the risk-score model has good performance with high AUC value. Multivariate Cox's regression model and stratified analysis indicated that the risk-score was independent of other clinicopathological prognostic factors. Furthermore, the risk-score model was competent for the prediction of metastasis-free survival in NSCLC patients. Moreover, the risk-score model was applicable for prediction of the overall survival in the other 30 caner types of TCGA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the willingness of homeless persons to be vaccinated against COVID-19; secondary aims were to analyze the immunization coverage for other conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and immunization coverage for other conditions were investigated through a form in 112 persons experiencing homelessness referring to the primary care medical services of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica, Holy See. RESULTS: Most subjects, with a male preponderance, were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (64.3%), 3.6% were unsure and 32.1% preferred not to be vaccinated. When answering questions on the immunization coverage for tuberculosis and hepatitis A and B, most subjects reported not to be vaccinated (48.2%, 56.2% and 55.3%, respectively) or did not know (33%, 28.6% and 27.7%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of our sample declared to be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It would be auspicious that the recent statements from several countries on the importance to extend COVID-19 vaccination to fragile populations be followed by the distribution of the vaccine to these populations.","Iacoella, C; Ralli, M; Maggiolini, A; Arcangeli, A; Ercoli, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,390

378053,COVID-19 mass vaccination involves unusual venues,2021,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying the role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor and the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail(REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484, and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417, and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major intermolecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising the activity of the spike protein.","Verkhivker, Gennady M; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yazar; Gupta, Grace",Biochemistry,,390

Several studies from New York, Italy, and China confirm that patients with diabetes are at a much higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19. Besides respiratory illness, COVID-19 increases cardiac injury and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the absence of specific guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 for patients with diabetes, they remain at higher risk and are more susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of basic knowledge on how diabetes affects pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with diabetes, impaired glucose use alters metabolic and consequently biological processes instigating pathological remodeling, which has detrimental effects on cardiovascular systems. A majority of biological processes are regulated by noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate for several diseases. In consideration of the higher risk of mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19, novel diagnostic test and treatment strategy are urgently warranted in post-COVID-19 era. Here, we describe potential roles of miRNA as a biomarker and therapeutic candidate, especially for heart failure, in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.","Mishra, Paras K; Tandon, Ritesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,,390

381015,Diagnostic Stewardship: An Essential Element in a Rapidly Evolving COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"This paper deals with the problem of estimating variables in nonlinear models for the spread of disease and its application to the COVID-19 epidemic. First unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death data are independent of the fatality rate. The methods are applied to public death data from the COVID-19 epidemic.","Oliveira, Mauricio C. de",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08201v1.pdf,390

Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly sensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and automatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest CT images.","Chen, Xiaocong; Yao, Lina; Zhou, Tao; Dong, Jinming; Zhang, Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13276v1.pdf,390

Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery.

OBJECTIVES: To assess reticulo-endothelial activation and its correlation with disease severity and death in patients across the entire spectrum of COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients were studied, with similar number of patients in each disease severity category. Baseline serum ferritin, sCD163 (macrophage activation markers) and plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (endothelial activation marker) levels were studied. Clinical parameters and plasma D-dimer levels were also studied. The study parameters were correlated with COVID-19 severity and survival. RESULTS: The 143 patients (104 males [80%], age 54 [42 - 65] years, median [inter-quartile range]) presented 4 (3-7) days after symptom onset. Thirty-four patients had mild disease, 36 had moderate disease, 36 had severe disease and 37 had critical disease at baseline. With increasing COVID-19 severity, ferritin, sCD163, VWF and D-dimer levels significantly increased at baseline, however, 139 patients had normal sCD163 levels. Of the reticulo-endothelial markers, VWF level independently correlated with COVID-19 severity and with survival. VWF level > 332.6 units/dl correlated with COVID-19 severity (odds ratio [OR]: 2.77 [95% confidence interval (C.I): 1.1 - 6.99], p value: 0.031) and in-hospital death (OR [95% CI]: 29.28 [5.2 - 165], p value < 0.001).

Consequently, clinicians must constantly learn new skills (such as clinical evaluations or image interpretation), stay up to date with the literature and incorporate advances into everyday practice. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinical decision making could reduce inter-rater variation in routine clinical practice and facilitate the extraction of vital information that could improve identification of patients with stroke, prediction of treatment responses and patient outcomes. Such support systems would be ideal for centres that deal with few patients with stroke or for regional hubs, and could assist informed discussions with the patients and their families. Moreover, the use of AI for image processing and interpretation in stroke could provide any clinician with an imaging assessment equivalent to that of an expert. However, any AI-based decision support system should allow for expert clinician interaction to enable identification of errors (for example, in automated image processing).

395748,COVID-19 loosening: We know what we don't know,2020,"Urbanization is progressing rapidly. It can affect soils ecosystem services directly through land management and indirectly through changes in the socioeconomic environment, which eventually leads to an increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil carbon (C) sequestration plays an important role in offsetting the anthropogenic C emissions. However, there is limited knowledge of how urbanization affects the soil C especially that in suburban. In this study, we studied changes in easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) and total organic C (TOC) of suburban soils (0-100 cm) in the rapid urbanising megacity Chengdu, China. The EOC stock and TOC stock decreased from the outer-suburb to the inner-suburb by 17.8-28.2% and 5.4-13.5%, respectively; particularly, the inner-suburb EOC decreased by 31.4-38.6% during the past 10 years. The quotient of EOC/TOC in the soil profile, reflecting the stability of soil C, declined from the outer-suburb (0.78) to the inner-suburb (0.20). Factors that influenced the EOC and TOC included the changes in economics (economic density, industrialization), farmland (cultivated area, farmland structure), urbanization (city size, population growth) and traffic flow. Among which, economic density growth was the primarily driver of the loss in TOC, explaining 31.6% of the variation in soil surface TOC and 16.0% of the variation in subsoil TOC; changes in farmland and urban expansion were the main factors contributing to the loss of subsoil EOC, with 40.4% explanatory ability. In addition, traffic flow also has contribution to the subsoil EOC loss. We concluded that the increasing soil C loss with decreasing distance from the city centre has a continuous contribution to C emission, and the C loss will persist until the suburbs are fully urbanized. The large losses of EOC and TOC caused by urbanization, and their contribution to global warming, necessitate their consideration in future appraisals of climate change and urban planning projects.","Luo, Youlin; Shen, Jie; Chen, Aifang; Tao, Qi; Li, Qiquan; White, Philip J; Li, Tingqiang; Li, Bing; Chen, Lin; Li, Huanxiu; Gao, Xuesong; Xu, Qiang; Wang, Changquan",Sci Total Environ,,390

However, research about the impact of this pandemic on children from ethnical minorities is scarce. We tested the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on psychological aspects and daily routines among Arab Israeli Children. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Arab Israeli parents, including behavioral and emotional aspects questionnaire and questions addressing using of screens, sleep, and physical activities. The results showed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, 55.8% of the children asked to sleep in their parents' bed and 45% expressed fears they did not have before. Most of the children showed increased irritability, constant mood swings and nervousness about limits and messages, and 41.4% showed sleep difficulties. Concerning adaptive behaviors, more than 50% of the parents reported that their child became wiser, lazier, and was able to adapt the limits and restriction of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the children tended to increase their use of screens, used to sleep more time, and were less active physically. The results suggest that children are vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak psychological effects and highlight the need to reduce the psychological burden of this pandemic and the necessity of immediate intervention.","Ghanamah, Rafat; Eghbaria-Ghanamah, Hazar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,390

CoV-2019 can be transmitted directly from person to person by respiratory drops, direct contact and contaminated material. Furthermore, 2019-nCov penetrates cells similarly to the SARS coronavirus, i.e., through the ACE2 receptor. This may promote human-to-human transmission. Patients and dental professionals are exposed daily to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria, which infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. Dental procedures carry the risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to their specificity. Direct transmission regards the distance between operator and patient, exposure to saliva, blood and other body fluids, the use of sharp instruments and ""droplet-generating"" rotating instruments, contact with the conjunctival mucosa, and finally the contact with droplets produced by coughing and nasal secretion of an infected individual without mask at short distance, increasing the biological risk for the operator. In light of the pandemic linked to COVID-19, although there is no clear scientific evidence in the literature, it is necessary to identify protections with regard to clothing, operating protocols, disinfection of environments and management of waiting rooms and front offices. This paper is a basis for operative indications for dentists and other health care professionals in phase 2 post lockdown for both private and public structures.","Gherlone, Enrico Polizzi Elisabetta Tetè Giulia Capparè Paolo",The New Microbiologica,,390

This paper will outline economics pertaining to COVID-19 lockdown, recovery and the inevitable competition that will occur between countries for tourists who will be scarcer and therefore more valuable. Countries are competing with a variety of incentives in order to lure visitors. However, persistent first waves that extend into July will put off tourists, further reducing tourism revenues and accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. The example of Sweden's response to COVID-19 in this regard will be described. Countries that have COVID-19 relatively under control but experience second waves will also manifest negative tourism effects. Governments and public health must act in unison so as to exit lockdown as speedily and as safely as feasible, with COVID-19 rises that are as low and brief as possible in order to better compete in the tourism sector with other countries. Websites are already online comparing not only safety for travellers vis-à-vis COVID-19 but also the incentives offered by different countries in their attempts to woo tourists in this difficult market.","Grech, Victor; Grech, Peter; Fabri, Stephanie",Int J Risk Saf Med,,390

We sought to characterize these reencounters and factors associated with reencounters. We identified the first consecutive 509 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 within an IL hospital network, and examined ACHEs, experienced within 30 days and 4 months of index hospitalization. We identified independent predictors of reencounter using binary logistic regression. Of 509 patients, 466 (91.6%) were discharged alive from index COVID-19 hospitalization. Within 30 days and 4 months, 12.4% and 21.5% of patients, respectively, experienced ACHEs. The median time to first ACHE was 24.2 (IQR 6.5, 55) days. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation was the leading reason for early ACHE (44.8%). Reencounters, both within 30 days and 4 months, were associated with a history of a neurological disorder before COVID-19 (OR 2.78 [95% CI 1.53, 5.03] and OR 2.75 [95% CI 1.67, 4.53], respectively). Older patients and those with diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or organ transplantation tended towards more frequent ACHEs. Steroid treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization demonstrated reduced odds of 30-day reencounter (OR 0.31 [95% CI 0.091, 0.79]). Forty-nine patients had repeat SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing during a reencounter; twelve (24.5%) patients had positive reencounter tests and experienced more frequent reencounters than those testing negative. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation is a leading cause of early ACHE after COVID-19 hospitalization, and steroid use during index hospitalization may reduce early reencounters. Neurologic illness before COVID-19 predicts ACHEs.","Clark, Jeffrey R; Batra, Ayush; Shlobin, Nathan A; Hoffman, Steven C; Orban, Zachary S; Koralnik, Igor J; Liotta, Eric M",Geroscience,,390

398626,Contact Tracing to Manage COVID-19 Spread-Balancing Personal Privacy and Public Health,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chest CT is prognostic in Covid-19 but there is a lack of consensus on how to report the CT findings. A chest CT scoring system, ÖCoS, was implemented in clinical routine on 1 April 2020, in Örebro Region, Sweden. The ÖCoS-severity score measures the extent of lung involvement. The objective of the study was to evaluate the ÖCoS scores as predictors of the clinical course of Covid-19. METHODS: Population based study including data from all hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in Örebro Region during March to July 2020. We evaluated the correlations between CT scores at the time of admission to hospital and intensive care in relation to hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS), intensive care admission and death. C-reactive protein and lymphocyte count were included as covariates in multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: In 381 included patients, the ÖCoS-severity score at admission closely correlated to hospital length of stay, and intensive care admission or death. At admission to intensive care, the ÖCoS-severity score correlated with intensive care length of stay. The ÖCoS-severity score was superior to basic inflammatory biomarkers in predicting clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT visual scoring at admission to hospital predicted the clinical course of Covid-19 pneumonia.","Ahlstrand, Erik; Cajander, Sara; Cajander, Per; Ingberg, Edvin; Löf, Erika; Wegener, Matthias; Lidén, Mats",Infect Dis (Lond),,390

Objective: To compare functional outcomes between early and late intervention for intubation-related laryngeal injury. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study involved 29 patients with laryngeal injury resulting from endotracheal intubation who were evaluated at a tertiary care center between May 1, 2014, and June 1, 2018. Ten patients with intubation injury to the posterior glottis who received early treatment were compared with 19 patients presenting with posterior glottic stenosis who received late treatment. Statistical analysis was performed from May 1 to July 1, 2019. Exposures: Early intervention, defined as a procedure performed 45 days or less after intubation, and late treatment, defined as an intervention performed greater than 45 days after intubation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient-specific and intervention-specific covariates were compared between the 2 groups, absolute differences with 95% CIs were calculated, and time to tracheostomy decannulation was compared using log-rank testing. Results: The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics and a similar burden of comorbid disease. Ten patients who received early intervention (7 women [70%]; median age, 59.7 years [range, 31-72 years]; median, 34.7 days to presentation [IQR, 1.5-44.8 days]) were compared with 19 patients who received late intervention (11 women [58%]; median age, 53.8 years [range, 34-73 years]; median, 341.9 days to presentation [IQR, 132.7-376.3 days]). Nine of 10 patients (90%) who received early intervention and 11 of 19 patients (58%) who received late interventions were decannulated at last follow-up (absolute difference, 32%; 95% CI, -3% to 68%). Patients who received early treatment required fewer total interventions than patients with mature lesions (mean, 2.2 vs 11.5; absolute difference, 9.3; 95% CI, 6.4-12.1). In addition, none of the patients who received early treatment required an open procedure, whereas 17 patients (90%) with mature lesions required open procedures to pursue decannulation. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that early intervention for patients with postintubation laryngeal injury was associated with a decreased duration of tracheostomy dependence, a higher rate of decannulation, and fewer surgical procedures compared with late intervention. Patients who underwent early intervention also avoided open reconstruction. These findings may bear relevance to the management of patients requiring extended durations of endotracheal intubation during recovery for critical illness related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.","Lowery, Anne S; Malenke, Jordan A; Bolduan, Alyssa J; Shinn, Justin; Wootten, Christopher T; Gelbard, Alexander",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,390

The aim is to keep patient safety as the priority, besides, continuing to provide essential healthcare services. METHODS: Situational audit was performed for the services rendered before and during COVID-19 pandemic and the elevation of the disease alert status, and a retrospective analysis of the attendance and procedures performed in the service. RESULTS: We present a methodology for performing a situational audit and generating service modification for hand and reconstructive microsurgery unit in a pandemic. There was no significant difference between the number of patients seen at outpatient clinics. However, there was a reduction in the numbers of total surgeries performed, with a 40% drop in the number of elective surgeries performed. There was also a reduction of cases seen in the emergency department hand clinic. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 pandemic is currently affecting not only the health service but also, other vital services all over the world. The pandemic puts significant challenges to acute surgical services in a hospital system involved in the management of the pandemic. Surgeons need to take proactive and a systematic approach in managing the available resources while maintaining essential surgical services. This paper provides the tools and methodology for doctors to plan their services in a pandemic situation. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to maintain essential surgical services in a pandemic situation through rapid situational audits and generating localised strategies while considering the constraints imposed during the pandemics while maintaining patient and staff safety.","Omar, Usama Farghaly; Pei Yein, Tong; Rajaratnam, Vaikunthan",Postgrad Med J,,390

METHODS AND RESULTS: The heterotrophic bacterial strain in symbiotic association with intertidal macroalga H. valentiae was isolated to homogeneity in a culture-dependent method and screened for bioactivities by spot-over-lawn assay. The bacterial organic extract was purified and characterized by extensive chromatographic and spectroscopic methods, respectively, and was assessed for antibacterial activities with disc diffusion and microtube dilution methods. The macrocyclic polyketide compounds exhibited wide-spectrum of anti-infective potential against clinically significant vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia with minimum inhibitory concentration of about 1-3 µg mL-1 , insomuch as the antibiotics chloramphenicol and ampicillin were active at &#8805; 6.25 µg mL-1 . The studied compounds unveiled Fe3+ chelating activity, which designated that their prospective anti-infective activities against the pathogens could be due to their siderophore mechanism of action. In support of that, the bacterium exhibited siderophore production on bioassay involving the cast upon culture agar plate, and the presence of siderophore biosynthetic gene (&#8776;1000 bp) (MF 981936). In silico molecular modeling with penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) coded by mecA genes of MRSA (docking score 11.68-12.69 kcal mol-1 ) verified their in vitro antibacterial activities. Putative biosynthetic pathway of macrocyclic polyketides through stepwise decarboxylative condensation initiated by malonate-acyl carrier protein further validated their structural and molecular attributes. CONCLUSIONS: The studied siderophore-type macrocyclic polyketides from S. algae MTCC 12715 with significant anti-infective potential could be considered as promising candidates for pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications, especially against emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens.

The spread of COVID-19 in population and regions is a typical geographical process, which is worth discussing from the geographical perspective. This paper focuses on Shandong province, which has a high incidence, though the first Chinese confirmed case was reported from Hubei province. Based on the data of reported confirmed cases and the detailed information of cases collected manually, we used text analysis, mathematical statistics and spatial analysis to reveal the demographic characteristics of confirmed cases and the spatio-temporal evolution process of the epidemic, and to explore the comprehensive mechanism of epidemic evolution and prevention and control. The results show that: (1) the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Shandong is 0.76/100,000. The majority of confirmed cases are old and middle-aged people who are infected by the intra-province diffusion, followed by young and middle-aged people who are infected outside the province. (2) Up to February 5, the number of daily confirmed cases shows a trend of ""rapid increase before slowing down"", among which, the changes of age and gender are closely related to population migration, epidemic characteristics and intervention measures. (3) Affected by the regional economy and population, the spatial distribution of the confirmed cases is obviously unbalanced, with the cluster pattern of ""high-low"" and ""low-high"". (4) The evolution of the migration pattern, affected by the geographical location of Wuhan and Chinese traditional culture, is dominated by ""cross-provincial"" and ""intra-provincial"" direct flow, and generally shows the trend of ""southwest â northeast"". Finally, combined with the targeted countermeasures of ""source-flow-sink"", the comprehensive mechanism of COVID-19 epidemic evolution and prevention and control in Shandong is revealed. External and internal prevention and control measures are also figured out.","Shi, Jinlong; Gao, Xing; Xue, Shuyan; Li, Fengqing; Nie, Qifan; Lv, Yangfan; Wang, Jiaobei; Xu, Tingting; Du, Guoxu; Li, Gang",Sci Rep,,390

412183,Type 2 Diabetes in Youth: the Role of Early Life Exposures,2020,"ObjectiveThe national COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in India, prioritized healthcare workers to be vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). So, we aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. MethodsWe prospectively evaluated the Institutional Covid Vaccination Database to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. ResultsOut of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 -91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96 % when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. ConclusionThere is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.","Issac, Aleena; Kochuparambil, Jose J; Elizabeth, Linu",,,390

415214,COVID-19 control pitfalls and challenges and drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Zimbabwe,2021,"Background: It was not mandatory for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) to screen patients for trauma before November 2019, when CMS initiated Trauma-Informed Care (TIC). With this requirement;however, CMS did not provide specific guidance for implementation. The purpose of TIC was to obtain traumatic experiences, identify approaches to manage reoccurrences of certain triggers, and to prevent re-traumatization thus providing a safer environment and more effective care. Here we communicate the accumulated experiences of the first-year implementation of TIC in one SNF. Methods: Budd Terrace at Wesley Woods, a non-profit, 250 bed long-term care and SNF, providing short-term rehabilitation and long-term placement. Without implementation guidance for TIC, our Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) added TIC questionnaires in the Baseline Care Plan, which is within 48 hours of admission. The admission nurse developed a process to guide the collection upon admission including the creation of a system encompassing a 6-part approach emphasizing the sensitive nature of trauma - Trust, Readiness, safe Atmosphere, Understanding, Minimize exposure, and Accommodation Results: We collected data from 473 new admissions from November 2019 to November 2020. Of these, 4.9% (n=23) reported experiencing trauma. Survivors ranged in age from 25 to 97 years old and reported a broad range of trauma experiences including: sexual assault (43%, all women);complicated grief (13%);COVID-19 (13%);combat-related PTSD (8.7%);intimate partner violence;racial discrimination;emotional abuse;other medical trauma;and accidents (all at 4.3%). The IDT was informed of the survivors' experiences. The social worker created a comprehensive person-centered care plan for the patient, addressing the trauma, goals, and interventions. Based on information gathered from this process we engaged in therapeutic approaches and take measures to prevent re-traumatization while in our care. Conclusions: During this implementation and ongoing pandemic, we recognized the profound importance of TIC in the SNF setting. Our process enabled us to connect better with our patients as their own self, with their own distinct experiences and needs that are often overlooked in medical charts. It has equipped us with a unique and valuable lens to view our patients, through which we can strive to provide a holistic, personalized, and a compassionate based care.","Chozom, T.; Sayed, S.

Data from 6,149 telephone interviews were used, conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020 among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). Social distancing was defined by not having left home in the last seven days. Only 32.8% of study participants did not leave home during the period considered, 36.3% left between one and two times, 15.2% between three and five times and 15.7% left every day. The main reasons for leaving home were to buy medicine or food (74.2%), to work (25.1%), to pay bills (24.5%), for health care (10.5%), to exercise (6.2%), and to meet family or friends (8.8%). Among those who left home, 97.3% always wore face masks and 97.3% always performed hand washing. Women left home less often than men. Men left home more often to work and exercise while women left home more often to seek healthcare. Men (odds ratio - OR = 1.84), those with higher education (OR = 1.48 and 1.95 for 5-8 and 9 years, respectively) and urban residents (OR = 1.54) left home more frequently to perform essential activities, regardless of age or other characteristics. Results show low adherence to social distancing, but high prevalence in the reported use of face masks and hand washing.","Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Mambrini, Juliana Vaz de Melo; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Peixoto, Sérgio William Viana; Macinko, James",Cad Saude Publica,,390

We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed mild/moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. Immunophenotyping of whole-blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n = 25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. RESULTS: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease. Increased counts of CD15+CD16+ neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with emergence of PD-L1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages. COVID-19 alters the frequency and functional phenotypes of granulocyte subsets with emergence of CRTH2 as a disease biomarker.","Vitte, Joana; Diallo, Aïssatou Bailo; Boumaza, Asma; Lopez, Alexandre; Michel, Moïse; Allardet-Servent, Jérôme; Mezouar, Soraya; Sereme, Youssouf; Busnel, Jean-Marc; Miloud, Tewfik; Malergue, Fabrice; Morange, Pierre-Emmanuel; Halfon, Philippe; Olive, Daniel; Leone, Marc; Mege, Jean-Louis",J Infect Dis,,390
418717,Patient factors and temporal trends associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in England: an observational study using administrative data,2021,"While the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the world, much evidence is being gathered regarding its novel pathological mechanisms. It is the authors’ clinical experience that patients in the intensive care unit suffering from COVID-19 are extremely pro-coagulable, with venous and arterial thromboembolism frequently observed, and losses of vascular access lines and filtration circuits to thrombosis now commonplace. Here, we explore the evidence for hypercoagulability in this group, presenting evidence of both a localised pulmonary hypercoagulability, and a systemic hypercoagulability resulting in thrombosis distant to the pulmonary vasculature. Furthermore, we discuss the possible risk factors exacerbated by, or selected for in COVID-19. We review the available evidence for use of plasma D-dimer as a prognostic marker, exploring the possibility that it acts as a marker of a COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability. We review the evidence for a pro-coagulant subtype of disseminated intravascular coagulation, discussing its clinical significance. Finally, we discuss the current evidence surrounding treatment of COVID-19 hypercoagulability, including prophylactic and treatment-dose heparin, thrombolytic agents, antiplatelet agents, and direct thrombin inhibitors, among others. We suggest areas in which further investigation is urgently needed to reduce the startling incidence of thrombosis in this group, a complication no doubt contributing to morbidity and mortality.","Frazer, John Scott; Tyrynis Everden, Angharad Joanna",Trends Anaesth.

In this work, we leverage these techniques, and we propose 3D versions for five different self-supervised methods, in the form of proxy tasks. Our methods facilitate neural network feature learning from unlabeled 3D images, aiming to reduce the required cost for expert annotation. The developed algorithms are 3D Contrastive Predictive Coding, 3D Rotation prediction, 3D Jigsaw puzzles, Relative 3D patch location, and 3D Exemplar networks. Our experiments show that pretraining models with our 3D tasks yields more powerful semantic representations, and enables solving downstream tasks more accurately and efficiently, compared to training the models from scratch and to pretraining them on 2D slices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three downstream tasks from the medical imaging domain: i) Brain Tumor Segmentation from 3D MRI, ii) Pancreas Tumor Segmentation from 3D CT, and iii) Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from 2D Fundus images. In each task, we assess the gains in data-efficiency, performance, and speed of convergence. We achieve results competitive to state-of-the-art solutions at a fraction of the computational expense. We also publish the implementations for the 3D and 2D versions of our algorithms as an open-source library, in an effort to allow other researchers to apply and extend our methods on their datasets.","Taleb, Aiham; Loetzsch, Winfried; Danz, Noel; Severin, Julius; Gaertner, Thomas; Bergner, Benjamin; Lippert, Christoph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03829v1.pdf,390

Since COVID-19 emergence, many therapeutic regimens have been relentlessly explored, and although two vaccines have just received emergency use authorization by different governmental agencies, antiviral therapeutics based neutralizing antibodies and small-drug inhibitors can still be vital viable options to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. The viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is the key molecular player that promotes human host cellular invasion via recognition of and binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2). In this work, we report the results obtained by mutating in silico the 18 ACE2 residues and the 14 S-protein receptor binding domain (S-RBDCoV-2) residues that contribute to the receptor/viral protein binding interface. Specifically, each wild-type protein-protein interface residue was replaced by a hydrophobic (isoleucine), polar (serine and threonine), charged (aspartic acid/glutamic acid and lysine/arginine), and bulky (tryptophan) residue, respectively, in order to study the different effects exerted by nature, shape, and dimensions of the mutant amino acids on the structure and strength of the resulting binding interface. The computational results were next validated a posteriori against the corresponding experimental data, yielding an overall agreement of 92%. Interestingly, a non-negligible number of mis-sense variations were predicted to enhance ACE2/S-RBDCoV-2 binding, including the variants Q24T, T27D/K/W, D30E, H34S7T/K, E35D, Q42K, L79I/W, R357K, and R393K on ACE2 and L455D/W, F456K/W, Q493K, N501T, and Y505W on S-RBDCoV-2, respectively.","Laurini, Erik; Marson, Domenico; Aulic, Suzana; Fermeglia, Alice; Pricl, Sabrina",ACS Nano,,390

Methods: Clinical data from 417 patients were collected retrospectively from the Al Kuwait Hospital, Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP), Dubai, United Arab Emirates, who were admitted between March and June 2020. Patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI). Various clinical outcomes were examined: presenting symptoms, severity, major co-morbidities, ICU admission, death, ventilation, ARDS, septic shock and laboratory parameters. Results: The average BMI was 29 ± 6.2 kg/m2. BMI alone was not associated with the outcomes examined. However, class II obese patients had more co-morbidities compared to other groups. Hypertension was the most significant co-morbidity associated with obesity. Patients with BMI above the average BMI (29 kg/m2) and presence of underlying co-morbidities showed significant increase in admission to ICU compared to patients below 29 kg/m2 and underlying co-morbidities (21.7% Vs. 9.2%), ARDS development (21.7% Vs. 10.53%), need for ventilation (8.3% Vs. 1.3%), and mortality (10% Vs. 1.3%).

425429,Evaluation of Web-Based and In-Person Methods to Recruit Adults with Type 1 Diabetes for a Mobile Exercise Intervention: Prospective Observational Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are still many unanswered questions about the novel coronavirus; however, a largely underutilized source of knowledge is the millions of people who have recovered after contracting the virus. This includes a majority of undocumented cases of COVID-19, which were classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document and glean insights from the experiences of individuals with a first-hand experience in dealing with COVID-19, especially the so-called mild-to-moderate cases that self-resolved while in isolation. METHODS: This web-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States and had tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods, including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, as well as through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured in this study included knowledge of contraction or transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on the road to recovery. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants (female, n=53; male, n=19; age range: 18-73 years; mean age: 41 [SD 14] years) from 22 US states were enrolled in this study. The top known source of how people contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19, was through a family or household member (26/72, 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (13/72, 18%). Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness, such as brain or memory fog, palpitations, ear pain or discomfort, and neurological problems. In addition, 47 of 72 (65%) participants reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-week period even for mild cases of COVID-19. The mean recovery time of the study participants was 4.5 weeks, and exactly one-half of participants (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65 days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 (51%) participants reported that they experienced stigma associated with contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings suggesting that emphasis on family or household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and that there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of illness with the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from COVID-19 survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected by the virus, and guide further research.","Prioleau, Temiloluwa",JMIR Form Res,,390

Coronaviruses are associated with comorbidities, along with the symptoms of it. SARS-CoV-2 is one of the highly pathogenic coronaviruses that causes a high death rate compared to the SARS-CoV and MERS. In this review, we focused on the mechanism of coronavirus with comorbidities and impairment in multi-organ function. The main dysfunction upon coronavirus infection is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. It is associated with the other organ damage such as cardiovascular risk via an increased level of hypertension through ACE2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risks such as chemosis, conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia, cancer risk, venous thromboembolism, tuberculosis, aging, and cardiovascular dysfunction and reproductive risk. Along with this, we have discussed the immunopathology and coronaviruses at a molecular level and therapeutic approaches for the coronavirus infection. The comorbidities and multi-organ failure of COVID-19 have been explained at a molecular level along with the base of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

426684,Ecological fallacy in COVID-19 epidemiological inference: Influenza vaccination rate as an example,2021,"Since the beginning of 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic that also affects ophthalmology. Ophthalmologists can be confronted at any time with potentially COVID-19 associated ocular symptoms or manifestations in patients and also become infected through close patient contact. Even without systemic infection, the ocular surface can come into direct contact with aerosols or liquids containing SARS-CoV-2 particles. A smear infection through hand-to-eye contact is also possible. A purely isolated ocular infection has not yet been shown. Rather, it seems that ocular complications occur in the context of a systemic infection. However, ocular symptoms can also be the first symptom of COVID-19. The most common ocular complication of COVID-19 is mild follicular conjunctivitis. Haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, or retinal involvement can also occur less frequently. There are currently no evidence-based therapy recommendations for COVID-19 associated diseases of the ocular surface. Artificial tears might be helpful for symptom relief. There is no evidence for antiviral, antibiotic, or anti-inflammatory therapies, but these medications might be used in individual cases. Potential intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions and haemorrhages, as well as cotton wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy. Neuro-ophthalmological complications including Miller-Fisher syndrome or infarct-related central blindness can also occur in very rare cases. Knowledge of potential transmission routes and personal protective equipment is just as essential for each ophthalmologist as a basic knowledge of potential ocular symptoms and complications.","Rokohl, Alexander C; Grajewski, Rafael S; Matos, Philomena A Wawer; Kopecky, Adam; Heindl, Ludwig M; Cursiefen, Claus",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,390

Antibodies were screened on HEK293 cells transfected with viral nucleoprotein, S1 subunit and S2 subunit of spike protein and on untransfected cells, as well as a panel of normal tissue. Lung tissue with presence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) was also used. A total of 7 mAbs were tested: (1) mAb 001 (Sino Biological, 40143-R001), (2) mAb 007 (Sino Biological, 40150-R007), (3) mAb 019 (Sino Biological, 40143-R019), (4) mAb 1A9 (GeneTex, GTX632604), (5) mAb ABM19C9 (Abeomics, 10-10007), (6) FIPV3-70 (Santa Cruz, SC-65653), and (7) mAb 6F10 (BioVision, A2060). Only 2 mAbs, clone 001 to the nucleoprotein and clone 1A9 to the S2 subunit spike protein displayed specific immunoreactivity. Both clones showed strong staining in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, mostly in areas of acute diffuse alveolar damage, but were not completely congruent. Viral protein was also found in kidney tubules, endothelia of multiple organs and a nasal swab of a patient with persistent SARS-CoV2 infection. The other tested reagents were either poorly reactive or demonstrated nonspecific staining in tissues and lesions not infected by SARS-CoV2. Our study demonstrates that rigid specificity testing is mandatory for the evaluation of mAbs to SARS-CoV2 and that clones 001 to nucleoprotein and 1A9 to S2 subunit spike protein are useful for the in situ detection of SARS-CoV2.","Szabolcs, Matthias; Sauter, Jennifer L; Frosina, Denise; Geronimo, Jerica A; Hernandez, Enmily; Selbs, Elena; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Rekhtman, Natasha; Baine, Marina K; Jäger, Elke; Travis, William D; Jungbluth, Achim A",Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,,390

The study included 47 patients with AD living in retirement homes and who were already experiencing hallucinations prior to the lockdown. We invited caregivers to rate hallucinatory experiences in these patients during the lockdown, and compared this rating with that provided by the same caregivers prior to the lockdown. Results demonstrated increased hallucinatory experiences in patients with AD during the lockdown, compared with before the lockdown. The decrease in social and physical activities during the lockdown, and especially, the physical separation of residents from family members, might have led to decreased sensory stimulation and increased loneliness, and consequently, to the hallucinatory experiences in patients with AD living in retirement homes during the lockdown. While the restrictive measures were necessary to cope with the spread of Covid-19, these measures have increased hallucinations in patients with AD living in retirement homes, at least in those who were already experiencing hallucinations prior to the lockdown.","El Haj, Mohamad; Larøi, Frank; Gallouj, Karim",Psychiatr. q,,390

431853,"A Three-Step, Single Session Therapy Intervention for COVID-Related Anxiety in a Pediatric Emergency Department",2020,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common lung disorders characterized by alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and dyspnea, which can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses, known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which allegedly originally occurred in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly worldwide. The critically ill patients with ARDS have high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. Previously, the excessive recruitment and activation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]), accompanied by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation were reported being implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. However, the direct visualization of lung epithelial injuries caused by NETs, and the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this damage are still lacking. Additionally, those already reported methods are limited for their neglect of the pathological role exerted by NETs and focusing only on the morphological features of NETosis. Therefore, we established a cell-based assay for detecting NETs during lung epithelial cells-neutrophils co-culture using the xCELLigence system, a recognized real-time, dynamic, label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput apparatus. Our results demonstrated that lung epithelial injuries, reflected by declines in cell index (CI) values, could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated PMNs, or NETs in a time and dose-dependent manner. NETs generation was verified to be the major contributor to the cytotoxicity of activated PMNs; protein components of NETs were the prevailing cytotoxic mediators. Moreover, this cell-based assay identified that PMNs from severe pneumonia patients had a high NETs formative potential. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) were discovered alleviating NETs formation. Thus, this study not only presents a new methodology for detecting the pathophysiologic role of NETs but also lays down a foundation for exploring therapeutic interventions in an effort to cure ALI/ARDS in the clinical setting of severe pneumonia, including the emerging of NCIP.","Lv, Dandan; Xu, Yiming; Cheng, Hongqiang; Ke, Yuehai; Zhang, Xue; Ying, Kejing",Exp Cell Res,,390

Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC).","Douglas, Jordan; Zhang, Rong; Bouckaert, Remco",PLoS Comput Biol,,390

We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination intention (VI) and fear of its adverse effects (FAE) as well as their associated factors in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). METHODS: We conducted a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a database collected by the University of Maryland and Facebook. We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. CONCLUSION: Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FAE. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency. It is necessary to guarantee mass vaccination and support the return of economic activities.","Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Uyen-Cateriano, Angela; Toro-Huamanchumo, Carlos J; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Hernandez, Adrian V; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A",Travel Med Infect Dis,,390

The possible interactions between surfaces of such nanostructured materials with coronaviruses are discussed. The antiviral mechanisms of graphene materials can be related to events such as the inactivation of virus and/or the host cell receptor, electrostatic trapping and physico-chemical destruction of viral species. These effects can be enhanced by functionalization and/or decoration of carbons with species that enhances graphene-virus interactions.

This study aimed to examine: (1) which specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with the presence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) the extent to which participants' hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. METHOD: We administered an online survey to 12,989 adult (16+) participants across Wales from the 9th June to the 13th July 2020. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring the stressors they had experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, their levels of hopelessness over the past two weeks, their levels of resilience, and whether they had experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that: (1) food insecurity, domestic abuse, relationship problems, redundancy, social isolation and financial problems were the COVID-19 related stressors most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) that both hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and suicidal thoughts, such that the relationship between COVID-19 stress and the presence of suicidal thoughts was much stronger for individuals with high hopelessness and low resilience. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are closely related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors and demonstrate the important role that hope for the future and resilience play in protecting individuals against the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.HighlightsStressors caused by the pandemic are linked to increased suicidal thoughts.Hope protects individuals against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Resilience also protects people from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Knowles, James R P; Gray, Nicola S; O039,; Connor, Chris; Pink, Jennifer; Simkiss, Nicola J; Snowden, Robert J",Arch Suicide Res,,390

Although the knowledge on the clinical and epidemiology of COVID-19 in pediatric patients is being accumulated rapidly, relevant comprehensive review on its radiological manifestations is still lacking. The present article reviews the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatrics, based on the previous studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search for published articles by using Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar and Embase online databases. All studies describing CT findings of COVID-19 in pediatrics (<18years) were included. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies with 850 pediatric patients were reviewed. 225 (26.5%) of patients had normal CT findings. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common CT abnormalities (384/625, 61.5%). Other findings were halo sign, interstitial opacities, bronchial wall thickening, and crazy-paving sign. Approximately 55% of patients had unilateral pulmonary findings. Most studies found peripheral and lower-lobe distribution to be a prominent imaging finding. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that imaging findings in children were often milder and more focal than adults, typically as ground-glass opacities and consolidations with unilateral lower-lobe predominance, which have been regressed during the recovery time. A balance must be struck between the risk of radiation and the need for chest CT. If still necessary, low-dose CT is more appropriate in this age group. Albeit, due to the limited number of reported pediatrics with COVID-19, and the lack of consistency in CT descriptors, further work is still needed in this regard.","Katal, Sanaz; Johnston, Sean K; Johnston, Jennifer H; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Acad Radiol,,390

In this study, two new ACR3 genes PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 were cloned from P. vittata and studied in model organism yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and model plant tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Both ACR3s mediated AsIII efflux in yeast, decreasing its As accumulation and enhancing its As tolerance. In addition, PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 were expressed in tobacco plant. Localized on the plasma membrane, PvACR3;2 mediated both AsIII translocation to the shoots and AsIII efflux from the roots in tobacco, resulting in 203 - 258% increase in shoot As after exposing to 5 µM AsIII under hydroponics. In comparison, localized to the vacuolar membrane, PvACR3;3 sequestrated AsIII in tobacco root vacuoles, leading to 18 - 20% higher As in the roots and 15 - 36% lower As in the shoots. Further, based on qRT-PCR, both genes were mainly expressed in P. vittata fronds, indicating PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 may play roles in AsIII translocation and sequestration in the fronds. This study provides not only new insights into the functions of new ACR3 genes in P. vittata, but also important gene resources for manipulating As accumulation in plants for phytoremediation and food safety.","Chen, Jun-Xiu; Cao, Yue; Yan, Xiangjuan; Chen, Yanshan; Ma, Lena Q",J Hazard Mater,,390

Agriculture continues to be most important economic activity in Pakistan and former FATA is no exception. However, agriculture in the semi-arid Khyber District continues to suffer a decline due to excessive reliance on rainfall, which is drastically insufficient. Khyber District have large expanses of fertile land; however, farmers depend on unpredictable rain-fed agriculture, which has low productivity and food insecurity. There are a number of rivers in the region where great prospects exist for irrigated farming. Geographical information systems (GIS)-based multi-criteria analysis can be used to map areas with irrigation potential. The current study focused on different variables including soil texture, perennial rivers, land cover, topography, and dams. For this study, data was collected from diverse sources which include Google earth images, top sheets, land use land cover, soil texture map of FATA, and SRTM 30 Meter. The collected data was analyzed by using multi-criteria analysis in Arc GIS 10.2.2 by using MIF technique. The results of this research indicate that there is great potential for irrigated farming in the study area. Potential land for this purpose were divided into three categories, i.e., highly suitable which consisted of 678 km2, or 26% of the total area; 1044 km2 representing 40% were moderately suitable to irrigation; while the remaining 698 km2 representing 27% were considered least suitable for irrigation. Likewise, 204 km2 representing 7% were deemed unsuitable for irrigated agriculture mostly consisting of barren rocks. The results also illustrate how GIS as a tool can be used in the exploration of water resources in a scientific approach, thus making decision-making easier and more accurate.","Waleed, Muhammad; Ahmad, Sajid Rashid; Javed, Muhammad Asif; Samiullah, Saifullah",,,390

However, the effectiveness of chart rounds in detecting problematic treatment plans is unknown. We performed a prospective blinded study of error detection at chart rounds to clarify the effectiveness of this quality assurance step. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System publications were queried for problematic plans approved for treatment that would be detectable at chart rounds. A resident physician, physicist, and dosimetrist collaboratively generated 20 treatment plans with simulated errors identical in nature to those reported to the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System. These were inserted randomly into weekly chart rounds over 9 weeks, with a median of 2 problematic plans presented per chart rounds (range, 1-4). Data were collected on detection, attendance, length, and number of cases presented at chart rounds. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariable logistic regression with odds ratios. RESULTS: The median length of chart rounds over the study period was 60 minutes (range, 42-79); median number of cases presented per chart rounds was 45 (range, 38-50). The overall detection rate was 55% (11 of 20). Detection rates were higher for cases presented earlier in chart rounds: 75% versus 25% of problematic plans were detected within 30 minutes of start of chart rounds versus after 30 minutes (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.88; P = .037). Detection rates showed a trend toward increase during the study period but this was not significant: 33% in weeks 1 to 5 and 73% during weeks 6 to 9 (5.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-36; P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of clinically significant problematic plans during chart rounds could be significantly improved. Problematic plans are more frequently detected earlier in chart rounds and inserting such plans into chart rounds may enhance detection; however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. A multi-institutional study is planned.","Talcott, Wesley J; Lincoln, Holly; Kelly, Jacqueline R; Tressel, Lauren; Wilson, Lynn D; Decker, Roy H; Ford, Eric; Hartvigson, Pehr E; Pawlicki, Todd; Evans, Suzanne B",Pract Radiat Oncol,,390

457076,COVID-19 fatality prediction in people with diabetes and prediabetes using a simple score upon hospital admission,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused over 95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2 million deaths worldwide. According to current literature data, older adults have higher risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19. It is also known that older adults often do not present typical symptoms of diseases. The aim of the study was to assess if the prevalence of typical COVID-19-related symptoms varies by age group. METHODS: Medical charts of a random sample of COVID-19 patients dying in-hospital were retrieved through an integrated national surveillance system and reviewed by a group of researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health. Detailed information on COVID-19-related symptoms were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: 3241 confirmed cases of COVID-19-related deaths were identified from 4391 reviewed medical charts. The mean number of COVID-19-related symptoms progressively declined with age, from 2.1 in patients aged < 60 years to 1.7 in those aged 90 years or older (p < 0.001). Moreover, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly declined with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults have atypical presentation of symptoms and may be paucisymptomatic. This may lead to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay which aggravates the prognosis of COVID-19. Special attention should be posed when assessing individuals aged 65 years and older with suspected COVID-19.","Unim, Brigid; Palmieri, Luigi; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",Aging Clin Exp Res,,390
457104,High level of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) in patients with covid-19 is a marker of the severity of the infection but not an indicator of previous diabetes mellitus,2020,"Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected health care systems around the world. In many hospitals and health care facilities, services and health care workers have been reorganized and restructured to meet the demands of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists and their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care is currently unknown. Objective: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists working in Malaysia and the implications on how clinical pharmacy is perceived as a health care service. Methods: A qualitative study was designed to meet the research objectives. Nineteen hospital-based clinical pharmacists consented and participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis approach. Results: The experiences and views of the participants were reported. Three main themes were developed: 'Reassignment and other changes in clinical pharmacist roles', 'Adapting clinical pharmacy services to COVID-19', and 'The need for clinical pharmacists in the ward'. The findings indicate that in many cases, clinical pharmacy services were fully or partially withdrawn from the ward to reduce the risk of infection and to conserve the usage of personal protective equipment. Despite this, clinical pharmacists continued to support patient care in hospitals through the use of technology. The withdrawal of clinical pharmacy services, however, raises concern that the role of clinical pharmacists is still poorly recognized. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists in hospitals continue to support patient care despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater support and recognition of their role is required in order to empower and enhance their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care.This article is protected by copyright.

459734,Cohort of Four Thousand Four Hundred Four Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in a New York Hospital and Predictors of ICU Care and Ventilation,2020,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps usually show heterogeneous distributions of B-factors and electron density occupancies and are typically B-factor sharpened to improve their contrast and interpretability at high-resolutions. However, 'over-sharpening' due to the application of a single global B-factor can distort processed maps causing connected densities to appear broken and disconnected. This issue limits the interpretability of cryo-EM maps, i.e. ab initio modelling. In this work, we propose 1) approaches to enhance high-resolution features of cryo-EM maps, while preventing map distortions and 2) methods to obtain local B-factors and electron density occupancy maps. These algorithms have as common link the use of the spiral phase transformation and are called LocSpiral, LocBSharpen, LocBFactor and LocOccupancy. Our results, which include improved maps of recent SARS-CoV-2 structures, show that our methods can improve the interpretability and analysis of obtained reconstructions.","Kaur, Satinder; Gomez-Blanco, Josue; Khalifa, Ahmad A Z; Adinarayanan, Swathi; Sanchez-Garcia, Ruben; Wrapp, Daniel; McLellan, Jason S; Bui, Khanh Huy; Vargas, Javier",Nat Commun,,390
459826,Transmission reduction and prevention with HPV vaccination (TRAP-HPV) study protocol: a randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of HPV vaccination in preventing transmission of HPV infection in heterosexual couples,2020,"Background From January to May 2021 the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 was the most commonly detected variant in the UK, but since then the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first detected in India, has become the predominant variant. The UK COVID-19 vaccination programme started on 8thDecember 2020. Most vaccine effectiveness studies to date have focused on the alpha variant. We therefore aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines in preventing infection with respect to the Delta variant in a UK setting. Methods We used anonymised public health record data linked to infection data (PCR) using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. We then constructed an SIR epidemic model to explain SARS-CoV-2 infection data across the Cheshire and Merseyside region of the UK. Results We determined that the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in reducing susceptibility to infection is 39% (95% credible interval [34,43]) and 64% (95% credible interval [61,67]) for a single dose and a double dose respectively. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the effectiveness is 20% (95% credible interval [10,28]) and 84% (95% credible interval [82,86]) for a single-dose and a double dose respectively. Conclusion Vaccine effectiveness for reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection shows noticeable improvement after receiving two doses of either vaccine. Findings also suggest that a full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech provides the optimal protection against infection with the Delta variant. This would advocate for completing the full course programme to maximise individual protection and reduce transmission.","Pattni, Karan; Hungerford, Dan; Adams, Sarah; Buchan, Iain; Cheyne, Christopher P; García-Fiñana, Marta; Hall, Ian; Hughes, David M; Overton, Christopher; Zhang, Xingna; Sharkey, Kieran J",,,390

463294,Arrêt cardiaque extrahospitalier et pandémie de la COVID-19./ [Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest and COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"African American women with breast cancer generally rely on their spirituality to cope with psychosocial issues encountered during survivorship. However, in order to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19, a potentially deadly disease, it is imperative that community-dwelling older adults physically distance themselves from supportive family, friends, and even traditional faith-based activities. In this report, we explore the ways in which spirituality was used to manage stressors during this pandemic. This is a qualitative descriptive study with content analysis of data from the narratives from 18 African American breast cancer survivors. Participants were interviewed via phone and video conferencing platform and asked to respond to questions of strategies used to manage stressors encountered during this COVID-19 pandemic. Spirituality enabled African American breast cancer survivors to better manage their psychological distress through (1) increased engagement in religious activities; (2) reliance on God for protection when fearful, feeling isolated, and in need of assistance to pay household bills; (3) finding joy and courage from listening to gospel music and reading scripture; and (4) finding meaning through spirituality. These findings suggest that in spite of physical distancing requirements that impose limited access to faith-based institutions during this COVID-19 pandemic, spirituality continues to be a supportive resource to manage emotional stressors.","Hamilton, Jill B; Best, Nakia C; Barney, Tara A; Worthy, Valarie C; Phillips, Nichole R",J. cancer educ,,390

464167,Inpatient Management of COVID-19 Pneumonia: a Practical Approach from the Hospitalist Perspective,2020,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, individuals worldwide have shown different anxiety-related reactions. Several vulnerability factors may play a role in individuals' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors include pathological personality traits which have been shown to contribute to the development of anxiety-related conditions. Consequently, the present study investigated the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms. Using an online data portal, the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms among a mixed university student and community sample (N = 612) were studied. The results showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between all DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that DSM-5 pathological personality domains explained 21% of COVID-19-related anxiety variance. Based on standardized coefficients, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) negative affect domain had the main role in COVID-19-related anxiety. The findings suggest that pathological personality domains can be predictors in the symptoms of anxiety in a viral outbreak. The novel findings add to the literature on individual differences in domains of personality in response to pandemic situations. Implications for future clinical applications and research investigations are discussed.","Zemestani, Mehdi; Babamiri, Mohammad; Griffiths, Mark D; Didehban, Reza",J Addict Dis,,390

Chronic diseases, which are risk factors that increase the case fatality rates, have been the leading cause of death all over the world. This study was aimed at detecting coexisting chronic diseases in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was carried out with data from 229 patients in an intensive care unit, from June 1st through June 30th. 2020. The inclusion criteria of the study was as follows: (1) having a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by PCR test; (2) being hospitalized in the relevant intensive care unit within the dates of the study; and (3) having their data accessible through the hospital automation system. Through literature; chronic diseases of the patients and their effects on the COVID-19 process were evaluated. Statistical analyzes were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: The average age of the patients studied were 61.4 years. While the average symptom duration was 8.2 days; total hospitalization period was 13.1 days. The average length of stay of patients (n = 75) who were sent to intensive care unit was 10.1. The most common chronic disease among patients was hypertension with 47.2%. This was followed by diabetes mellitus (32.8%) and heart disease (27.5%), respectively. In the population studied, cough (59.4%), fever (58.5%) and shortness of breath (45.9%) were found to be the most common symptoms. Leukopenia, impairments in liver and muscle enzymes, abnormal C-reactive protein, ferritin and d-dimer levels were the important biochemical tests. CONCLUSION: Particular attention should be paid to the elderly COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases, especially DM, HT and cancer.","Altuntas, Murat; Yilmaz, Habip; Guner, Abdullah Emre",Virol J,,390

469368,Preventing Type 2 Diabetes among South Asian Americans through community-based lifestyle interventions: a systematic review,2020,"Research background: In determining the prices in road transport, carriers usually use the calculations based on a so-called routes utilisation coefficient, which allows the carrier to also take the possibility of the return rides without load into account. Currently. it is usually used as a constant from the interval from zero to one. Purpose of the article: Considering a different offer of return transport from individual European Union (EU) countries, it can be assumed that the routes utilisation coefficient should have different values because there is a varying level of non-zero probability that the vehicle will return without a load. This study therefore proposes a new approach to determining the value of this coefficient based on transport direction. The study also aims to identify clusters of EU countries, for which the common value of the coefficient should be set. Methods: The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to verify the assumption of the differences among the means of transport offers. Cluster analysis was used to identify the aforementioned groups of countries. This analysis is based on real data on transport offers to Slovakia from 1 different EU countries. Findings & value added: The results of the analysis can also be used in other EU countries because if significant differences in transport offers to Slovakia exist in individual countries, there is a reasonable assumption that this conclusion will also be valid in other countries. The analysis demonstrated that it is more appropriate to use the routes utilisation coefficient with various values, dependent on the transport direction. For the transport companies, implementation of the obtained results into practice is beneficial to increase their competitiveness through the more precise setting of transport prices, but also to the optimisation of the transport price itself with regard to the expected costs.","Poliak, M.; Svabova, L.; Konecny, V.; Zhuravleva, N.

Accordingly, generating protein interactomes has become routine in biological studies, yet interpreting these datasets remains computationally challenging. Here, we introduce Inter-ViSTA (Interaction Visualization in Space and Time Analysis), a web-based platform that quickly builds animated protein interaction networks and automatically synthesizes information on protein abundances, functions, complexes, and subcellular localizations. Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity. At the peroxisome, we show that pUL37x1 activates PEX11ß to regulate fission, a key aspect of virus assembly and spread.","Federspiel, Joel D; Cook, Katelyn C; Kennedy, Michelle A; Venkatesh, Samvida S; Otter, Clayton J; Hofstadter, William A; Jean Beltran, Pierre M; Cristea, Ileana M",Cell Rep,,390

Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6-16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants' level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (&#8805;7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels &#8805;7.5 µM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.","Freedman, Robert; Hunter, Sharon K; Law, Amanda J; D039,; Alessandro, Angelo; Noonan, Kathleen; Wyrwa, Anna; Camille Hoffman, M",J Psychiatr Res,,390

Tracking and analysing the heterogeneity and effectiveness of cities' prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic is essential to design and adjust epidemic prevention and control measures. The number of newly confirmed cases in 25 of China's most-affected cities for the COVID-19 epidemic from January 11 to February 10 was collected. The heterogeneity and effectiveness of these 25 cities' prevention and control measures for COVID-19 were analysed by using an estimated time-varying reproduction number method and a serial correlation method. The results showed that the effective reproduction number (R) in 25 cities showed a downward trend overall, but there was a significant difference in the R change trends among cities, indicating that there was heterogeneity in the spread and control of COVID-19 in cities. Moreover, the COVID-19 control in 21 of 25 cities was effective, and the risk of infection decreased because their R had dropped below 1 by February 10, 2020. In contrast, the cities of Wuhan, Tianmen, Ezhou and Enshi still had difficulty effectively controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in a short period of time because their R was greater than 1.","Cheng, Qing; Liu, Zeyi; Cheng, Guangquan; Huang, Jincai",Sci Rep,,390

478888,Letter to the Editor: D-dimer and Presumptive Diagnosis of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on the challenges and risks faced by frontline healthcare workers (HCW). This study aimed to describe the clinical outcomes and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS: Three databases were surveyed and 328 articles were identified. Of these, 225 articles did not meet inclusion criteria; therefore, 97 full-text article were reviewed. Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI 36.72-40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI 12.4-34.2) of the population of HCW. The percentage of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 was 51.7% (95% CI 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of comorbidities in seven studies was 18.4% (95% CI 15.5-21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI 17.6-40.3) and cough 26.1% (95% CI 18.1-36). The prevalence of hospitalisation was 15.1% (95% CI 5.6-35) in 13 studies and of death was 1.5% (95% CI 0.5-3.9) in 12 studies. Comparisons of HCW with and without infection showed an increased relative risk for COVID-19 related to personal protective equipment, workplace setting, profession, exposure, contacts, and testing. CONCLUSION: A significant number of HCW were reported to be infected with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a prevalence of hospitalisation of 15.1% and mortality of 1.5%. Further data are needed to track the continued risks in HCW as the pandemic evolves and health systems adapt.","Gholami, Mandana; Fawad, Iman; Shadan, Sidra; Rowaiee, Rashed; Ghanem, HedaietAllah; Hassan Khamis, Amar; Ho, Samuel B",Int J Infect Dis,,390
479215,Design and study protocol for a cluster randomized trial of a multi-faceted implementation strategy to increase the uptake of the USPSTF hypertension screening recommendations: the EMBRACE study,2020,"Background Coronavirus disease has spread widely all over the world since the beginning of 2020, and this required rapid adequate management. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has become an initial valuable tool for screening, diagnosis, and assessment of disease severity. This study aimed to assess the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 with HRCT follow-up in discharged patients to predict lung fibrosis after COVID-19 infection in survived patients. Results This study included two-hundred and ten patients who were tested positive for the novel coronavirus by nasopharyngeal swap, admitted to the hospital, and discharged after recovery. Patients with at least a one-time chest CT scan after discharge were enrolled. According to the presence of fibrosis on follow-up CT after discharge, patients were classified into two groups and assigned as the ""non-fibrotic group"" (without evident fibrosis) and ""fibrotic group"" (with evident fibrosis). We compared between these two groups based on the recorded clinical data, patient demographic information (i.e., sex and age), length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, admission to the ICU, laboratory results (peak C-reactive protein [CRP] level, lowest lymphocyte level, serum ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin, d-dimer, administration of steroid), and CT features (CT severity score and CT consolidation/crazy-paving score). CT score includes the CT during the hospital stay with peak opacification and follow-up CT after discharge. The average CT follow-up time after discharge is 41.5 days (range, 20 to 65 days). There was a statistically significant difference between both groups (p &lt;0.001). Further, a multivariate analysis was performed and found that the age of the patients, initial CT severity score, consolidation/crazy-paving score, and ICU admission were independent risk factors associated with the presence of post-COVID-19 fibrosis (p&lt;0.05). Chest CT severity score shows a sensitivity of 86.1%, a specificity of 78%, and an accuracy of 81.9% at a cutoff point of 10.5. Conclusion The residual pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 survivors after discharge depends on many factors with the patient's age, CT severity, consolidation/crazy-paving scores, and ICU admission as independent risk factors associated with the presence of post-COVID-19 fibrosis.","Yasin, R.; Gomaa, A.

481970,COVID-19 Mortality and Stress to the Hospital System from High Patient Load-Reply,2021,"With the deep recession now forecast for the world economy, trade can be expected to fall even more steeply. Agricultural trade will be less significantly affected, being insulated by its relatively low income elasticities of demand. However, a drop in the range of 12 to 20 percent in real trade value should be expected. Canada can be expected to share in this, but, within agricultural exports, cereals will be least affected. This minimal expected impact to cereals stems from the risk of wheat export bans by Russia and Kazakhstan, due to the resulting increase in wheat prices. Livestock, pulses, and horticulture can be expected to face a larger decline in trade prospects and revenues. An equally large threat to falling incomes in our trade partners is their policy responses, particularly the potential increase in import restrictions. These may take the form of more costly inspections, tightened SPS and food safety regulations, and protectionist measures from competing domestic producers. This article is protected by copyright.

482540,4 Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Emergency Department Presentations in an Integrated Health System,2020,"Negative portrayals in the Australian media situate teachers as a problem and teaching as a deficit practice. Society is positioning teachers, especially teachers of literacy, as the reason for poor student performance. In addition, negative media discourse around deficit initial teacher education, especially with regard to the teaching of reading and writing, is adding to the overall assumption that teachers of literacy are failing. This article highlights instances of teacher practice by literacy teachers during the global pandemic of COVID-19 which oppose the 'problem teacher' discourse. Snowball sampling was used to garner seven early years and primary school teachers for interviews, focussing on teacher perceptions of multimodal texts. A Foucaultian lens of governmentality and power and Fairclough's approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) were used as lens and method of analysis. The findings of this study indicate that these participant teachers have been sophisticated practitioners in their planning and practice during the pandemic, despite the institutional barriers and extreme disruptions experienced. On reflection, therefore, the constructed societal discourse around 'problem teachers' needs to be reviewed and adjusted.","Downes, Lynn; Brosseuk, Deb",Aust Educ Res,,390
483393,2BALANCE: a cognitive-motor dual-task protocol for individuals with vestibular dysfunction,2020,"A new viral disease named COVID-19 has recently turned into a pandemic. Compared to a common viral pneumonia it may evolve in an atypical way, causing the rapid death of the patient. For over two centuries, autopsy has been recognized as a fundamental diagnostic technique, particularly for new or little-known diseases. To date, it is often considered obsolete giving the inadequacy to provide samples of a quality appropriate to the sophisticated diagnostic techniques available today. This is probably one of the reasons why during this pandemic autopsies were often requested only in few cases, late and discouraged, if not prohibited, by more than one nation. This is in contrast with our firm conviction: to understand the unknown we must look at it directly and with our own eyes. This has led us to implement an autopsy procedure that allows the beginning of the autopsy shortly after death (within 1-2 h) and its rapid execution, also including sampling for ultrastructural and molecular investigations.

484177,"Knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 among health professionals in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"Introduction: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD) is an entity in which the ventricle fails to fill up properly due to impaired ventricular relaxation and/or decreased compliance. The diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction is based on a variety of parameters in doppler echocardiograpy. However, some parameters like interventricular septal thickness in diastole (IVSd), posterior wall thickness in diastole (PWd), left ventricular internal end diastolic and systolic diameters (LVIDD and LVISD) along with left atrial diameters (LAD) have yet to be evaluated for the diagnostic workup of DD. Methods: A case control study was done in the cardiology department from patient records from 2016 to 2018. Patients were diagnosed as diastolic dysfunction grade II and above by doppler echocardiography. IVSd, PWd, LVIDD, LAD, LVISD were obtained through 2-D echocardiography. Results: Patients with DD had greater LAD, IVSd and PWd and decreased LVIDD and LVISD as compared to control group. Overall, IVSD was the most significant predictor (OR 1.52 95%CI 1.35-1.71) of DD followed by PWd and LAD. Similarly, LAD, IVSd and PWd had higher sensitivity and specificity than LVIDD and LVIDS. Conclusion: IVSd, LAD and PWd showed significant performance in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and hence can be used as a screening and diagnostic tool in diastolic dysfunction of grade ll and above.","Hamza, Muhammad; Fatima, Mishal; Masood, Muhammad; Masood, Hafiz Umar; Tasleem, Ghazal; Ahmed, Hassaan; Nadir, Maha; Satti, Zubair",Afr Health Sci,,390

485540,Electrocardiography in Early Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Complications of COVID-19;a Systematic Literature Review,2021,"Patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infections produce antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against multiple viral proteins. Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.","DiMuzio, Jillian M; Heimbach, Baron C; Howanski, Raymond J; Dowling, John P; Patel, Nirja B; Henriquez, Noeleya; Nicolescu, Chris; Nath, Mitchell; Polley, Antonio; Bingaman, Jamie L; Smith, Todd; Harman, Benjamin C; Robinson, Matthew K; Morin, Michael J; Nikitin, Pavel A",Vaccine X,,390

Recently, the impact of COVID-19 has relegated bats from biomedical darkness to the frontline of public health as bats are the natural reservoir of many viruses, including SARS-Cov-2. Many bat genomes have been sequenced recently, and sequences coding for antimicrobial peptides are available in the public databases. Here we provide a structural analysis of genome-predicted bat cathelicidins as components of their innate immunity. A total of 32 unique protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. Interestingly, some bat species contained more than one cathelicidin. We examined the conserved cysteines within the cathelin-like domain and the peptide portion of each sequence and revealed phylogenetic relationships and structural dissimilarities. The antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity of peptides was examined using bioinformatic tools. The peptides were modeled and subjected to docking analysis with the region binding domain (RBD) region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The appearance of multiple forms of cathelicidins verifies the complex microbial challenges encountered by these species. Learning more about antiviral defenses of bats and how they drive virus evolution will help scientists to investigate the function of antimicrobial peptides in these species.","Pérez de la Lastra, José Manuel; Asensio-Calavia, Patricia; González-Acosta, Sergio; Baca-González, Victoria; Morales-delaNuez, Antonio",Molecules (Basel),,390

In sight of this, there has been growing interest in the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as potential treatments. In this study, we use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) over-expressed cell membrane chromatography (CMC) to study the interaction of CQ and HCQ with ACE2 receptor. Both CQ and HCQ were retained on the ACE2/CMC column. Then we analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by CMC frontal analysis, ionic force investigation and competitive binding experiment. Results showed that CQ and HCQ KD values obtained from the CMC frontal analysis method were 8.22(±0.61) × 10-7 M and 11.70(±2.44) × 10-7 M. Compare to CQ, HCQ has the weaker affinity with ACE2. The action force of CQ, HCQ and ACE2 is mainly ionic force. CQ and HCQ have different degrees of competitive binding relationship with ACE2. Our study revealed the interaction of CQ and HCQ with ACE2 receptor, which provides new insights for the use of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this biomimetic drug screening method is expected to open the door for rapid targeting and separating bioactive ingredients active towards ACE2 receptor.","Fu, Jia; Jia, Qianqian; Zhou, Huaxin; Zhang, Liyang; Wang, Saisai; Liang, Peida; Lv, Yanni; Han, Shengli",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,390

489487,Hard to reach: COVID-19 responses and the complexities of homelessness,2020,"BACKGROUND: Investigating mutation carriers with Dutch-type hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (D-CAA), offers the possibility to identify markers in pre- and symptomatic stages of CAA. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has shown potential to detect retinal changes in several neurodegenerative diseases. We performed an exploratory study on the thickness of retinal layers as possible (early) biomarker in D-CAA mutation carriers. METHODS: D-CAA mutation carriers (n=8 presymptomatic, n=13 symptomatic, median age 50 years) and (n=9, median age 53 years) controls were scanned using Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT). Symptomatic mutation carriers were defined as having a history of &#8805;1 symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. D-CAA mutation carriers and controls were recruited from our D-CAA cohort and a healthy control cohort. Total peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (pRNFL) thickness, six regions of pRNFL, total macular volume (TMV), and individual macular regions thickness were measured and analyzed adjusted for age. RESULTS: The overall median (IQR) thickness of pRNFL was decreased in symptomatic, but not presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers compared with controls (91µm (86-95) versus 99µm (87-108),p=0.006). Both presymptomatic (111µm (93-122) versus 131µm (123-143),p<0.001) and symptomatic carriers (119µm (95-128) versus 131µm (123-143),p=0.034) had a thinner temporal-superior quadrant of the pRNFL versus controls. TMV or individual macular layers thickness did not differ between carriers and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Thinning of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer may be a candidate marker of disease in hereditary CAA. Further studies are needed to determine whether retinal thinning is present in sporadic CAA and estimate its value as marker for disease progression.","van Etten, Ellis S; de Boer, Irene; Steenmeijer, Sylvie R; Al-Nofal, Mays; Wermer, Marieke J H; Notting, Irene C; Terwindt, Gisela M",Eur. j. neurol,,390

In this single-center cohort study, comprising 300 participants, two phone interviews were conducted (2-week and 1-month after hospitalization) and symptoms were queried with a standardized form. This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. The musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue (44.3% of patients reported), back pain (22.7%), arthralgia (22.0%), myalgia (21.0%), low back pain (16.3%), and neck pain (10.3%); the other symptoms were shortness of breath (26.3%), loss of taste (15.0%), cough (14.0%), loss of smell (12.3%), loss of appetite (10.3%), headache (8.7%), sore throat (3.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), dizziness (1.3%), and fever (0.3%) at 1-month. Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month. Nearly three-quarters reported one or more symptoms, with more than half of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at 1 month. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue, followed by back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and neck pain. The persistence of fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia was related to BMI.

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of children with COVID-19 with fatal outcomes in a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged &#8805;10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804;300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death. Increased procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and presepsin levels were found in all fatal cases. One patient met the criteria of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. CONCLUSION: Our work highlights the high mortality rate in paediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. These findings might be related to or co-incided with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to improve understanding of the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in elaborating the mechanisms leading to death in children with comorbidities.","Dewi, Rismala; Kaswandani, Nastiti; Karyanti, Mulya Rahma; Setyanto, Darmawan Budi; Pudjiadi, Antonius Hocky; Hendarto, Aryono; Djer, Mulyadi M; Prayitno, Ari; Yuniar, Irene; Indawati, Wahyuni; Prawira, Yogi; Handryastuti, Setyo; Sjakti, Hikari Ambara; Hidayati, Eka Laksmi; Muktiarti, Dina; Soebadi, Amanda; Puspaningtyas, Niken Wahyu; Muhaimin, Riski; Rahmadhany, Anisa; Octavius, Gilbert Sterling; Puspitasari, Henny Adriani; Jasin, Madeleine Ramdhani; Tartila, Tartila; Putri, Nina Dwi",Int J Infect Dis,,390

This mini-review summarises and discusses previous and recent findings about neuro-COVID. The spectrum of central nervous system disease in COVID-19 patients is much broader than so far anticipated. Peripheral nerves and the skeletal muscle are less predominantly affected. In the vast majority of the cases, there is no direct attack of the virus towards vulnerable structures, which explains why various manifestations of the nervous system manifest favourably to immune suppression or immune modulation. Overall, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of CNS/PNS involvement in COVID-19 is wider than believed. All patients with COVID-19 should be investigated by the neurologist for primary or secondary involvement of the CNS/PNS in the infection. neuro-COVID responds favourably to immune suppressants or immune modulation.","Finsterer, Josef; Scorza, Fulvio A",Mol.

Most African countries, even with their less advanced healthcare systems, continue to experience lower COVID-19 mortality rates. This was the case as the pandemic reached its first peak, plateaued, and declined. It is currently rising again in some countries, though not as rapidly as before. This study aimed to determine the predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate. This may help explain why Africa's COVID-19 mortality rate is, ironically, lower than that of more advanced countries with better health systems. This will also assist various governments in balancing their COVID-19 restrictive and socioeconomic measures. METHODOLOGY: This was an analytical review, which used pre-COVID-19 era population data and current COVID-19 mortality figures to determine predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. Pearson's correlation was used to test the association between some population variables and COVID-19 mortality rates. Next, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant positive predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate included pre-COVID-19 era '65-yr+ mortality %' (R2 = 0.574, B = 2.86, p < 0.001), population mean age (R2 = 0.570, B = 4.77, p = 0.001), and life expectancy (R2 = 0.524, B = 1.67, p = 0.008). Pre-COVID-19 era CVD death rate was a negative predictor of COVID-19 mortality rate (R2 = 0.524, B = -0.584, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Africa's lower COVID-19 mortality rate is due to the lower population mean age, lower life expectancy, lower pre-COVID-19 era '65yr+ mortality rate', and smaller pool of people surviving and living with cardiovascular diseases.","Lawal, Yakubu",Int J Infect Dis,,390
500700,Diabetes Care During Hajj,2020,The current study taught 6 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to increase passive compliance of wearing a facemask across sequentially increasing durations of time. A changing-criterion design embedded within a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a resetting differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) without escape extinction procedure on passive compliance. Terminal probe sessions determined DRO fading intervals. Results showed that 2 participants acquired mastery level passive compliance (30 min) without fading during the initial baseline sessions. The remaining 4 participants acquired mastery level passive compliance following fading intervals within the DRO intervention. Participants' passive compliance generalized across 2 novel settings. This study replicates previous studies and extends empirical support for the use of DRO without escape extinction interventions for increasing passive compliance with medical devices in children with ASD.,"Lillie, Madelynn A; Harman, Michael J; Hurd, Maisie; Smalley, Miranda R",J Appl Behav Anal,,390
500943,The complex combination of COVID-19 and diabetes: pleiotropic changes in glucose metabolism,2021,"While literature reveals the positive perception of e-Learning, this study examined and assessed the impact of e-Learning crack-up perceptions on psychological distress among college students during COVID-19 pandemic. Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) was used to evaluate stress symptoms. This study first conducted an online focus group discussion (OFGD) with the target population to develop the scale of “e-Learning crack-up” and “fear of academic year loss”. Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that “e-Learning crack-up” perception has a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how “e-Learning crack-up” and “Fear of academic year loss” influence college students’ mental health. Theoretically, this study extends and validated the scope of Kessler's psychological distress scale with two new contexts. Practically, this study will help the government and policymakers identify the student's mental well-being and take more appropriate action to address these issues.","Hasan, Najmul; Bao, Yukun",Child.

Studying the common dynamics of adaptive immune response changes can help understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in critical patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytokines concentration and leukocyte subpopulations profiles in the severe COVID-19 (n = 23) and critical (n = 18) COVID-19 group distinguished by the computed tomography (CT) severity score. We observed lower percentage of lymphocyte subpopulation, higher neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and higher IL-6 concentration in critical COVID-19 group than in severe group. CT severity score was negative correlated with proportion of lymphocytes, lymphocytes T, CD4+ cells, Treg cells and NK cells and positive correlated with neutrophils, NLR, and IL-6. In critical group more correlations between cytokines and lymphocytes were observed, mainly between TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß and lymphocyte subpopulations. The collective assessment of the cytokine profile, leukocyte subpopulations and the CT severity score can help to characterize and differentiate patient in advanced COVID-19 than the study of single parameters. We have shown that the interconnection of elements of the adaptive microenvironment can play an important role in critical COVID-19 cases.","Rutkowska, Elzbieta; Kwiecien, Iwona; Zabicka, Magdalena; Maliborski, Artur; Raniszewska, Agata; Klos, Krzysztof; Urbanska, Weronika; Klajnowicz, Izabella; Rzepecki, Piotr; Chcialowski, Andrzej",Viruses,,390

Collectively, 1,060 (79.9%) cats were tested positive for at least one virus in nucleotide detection, and the positive rates of cat exposure to FeLV, FPV, FHV-1, FCV, FIV and FIPV were 59.6%, 19.2%, 16.3%, 14.2%, 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of FHV-1 and FPV was dominant in winter and spring. Cats from north China showed a higher positive rate of viral infection than that of cats from south China. The virus infection is not highly correlated with age, except that FPV is prone to occur within the age of 12 months. In the serological survey, the seroprevalences of 267 vaccinated cats to FPV, FCV and FHV-1 were 83.9%, 58.3% and 44.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, the seroprevalences of 39 unvaccinated cats to FPV, FCV and FHV-1 were 76.9% (30/39), 82.4% (28/34) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively. This study demonstrated that a high prevalence of the six viral diseases in China and the insufficient serological potency of FCV and FHV-1 remind the urgency for more effective vaccines.","Liu, Caihong; Liu, Yuxiu; Qian, Peng; Cao, Yujiao; Wang, Jie; Sun, ChunYan; Huang, Baicheng; Cui, Ningning; Huo, Ningning; Wu, Hongchao; Wang, Lingxiao; Xi, Xiangfeng; Tian, Kegong",,,390

The primary outcome was death during the study period and the secondary outcome was critical disease at hospital admission. The association(s) between clinically relevant, noncollinear variables, and the primary outcome was assessed with uni- and multivariable Logistic regression models. A total of 520 patients were hospitalized of whom 349 (67%) were males with a median age 61 (interquartile range: 50-72). A higher proportion of males presented critically ill when compared to females (30.1% vs. 18.7%, p < .046). Death occurred in 86 (24.6%) males and 27 (15.8%) females (p = .024). In multivariable analysis age (per 10 years more) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.83 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.42-2.35], p < .0001), obesity (AOR: 2.17 [95% CI: 1.10-4.31], p = .026), critical disease at hospital admission (AOR 6.34 [95% CI: 3.50-11.48], p < .0001) were independently associated to higher odds of death whereas gender was not.

The fact that COVID-19 has shown to cause inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs frames the theory of their usage in the treatment of the disease by reducing lung scaring and allowing faster discharge of patients with post-COVID complications. The need for them to change their status from orphans to blockbusters has not happened yet due to fewer data and less research available on them as well as various other economic and patient-related factors. Since COVID-19 is widespread and causes many complications of the lungs that are similar to what these two drugs treat.

Not just yet,2021,"The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX) represents an unprecedented global collaboration facilitating the development and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19. COVAX pools and channels funds from state and non-state actors to promising vaccine candidates, and has started to distribute successful candidates to participating states. The WHO, one of the leaders of COVAX, recognised vaccine doses would initially be scarce, and therefore, prepared a two-staged allocation mechanism they considered fair. In the first stage, vaccine doses are distributed equally among participating countries, while in the second stage vaccine doses will be allocated according to a country's need. Ethicists have questioned whether this is the fairest distribution-they argue a country's need should be taken into account from the start and correspondingly, have proposed a framework that treats individuals with equal moral concern, aims to minimise harm and gives priority to the worst-off. In this paper, we seek to explore these concerns by comparing COVAX's allocation mechanism to a targeted allocation based on need. We consider which distribution would more likely maximise well-being and align with principles of equity. We conclude that although in theory, a targeted distribution in proportion to a country's need would be more morally justifiable, when political realities are taken into account, an equal distribution seems more likely to avert a greater number of deaths and reduce disparities.","Sharma, Siddhanth; Kawa, Nisrine; Gomber, Apoorva",J. med. ethics,,390

Vitamin D is important for reducing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and plays a role in pulmonary epithelial health. While the importance of vitamin D for a healthy immune system has been known for decades, the benefits of magnesium has only recently been elucidated. Indeed, magnesium is important for activating vitamin D and has a protective role against oxidative stress. Magnesium deficiency increases endothelial cell susceptibility to oxidative stress, promotes endothelial dysfunction, reduces fibrinolysis and increases coagulation. Furthermore, magnesium deficient animals and humans have depressed immune responses, which, when supplemented with magnesium, a partial or near full reversal of the immunodeficiency occurs. Moreover, intracellular free magnesium levels in natural killer cells and CD8 killer T cells regulates their cytotoxicity. Considering that magnesium and vitamin D are important for immune function and cellular resilience, a deficiency in either may contribute to cytokine storm in the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection.","DiNicolantonio, James J; O039,; Keefe, James H",Mo Med,,390

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. METHODS: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. RESULTS: We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central-west regions. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. There was also an increase in the national CABG death rate.","Khalil, Kalil Hussein; Sá, Michel Pompeu B O; Vervoort, Dominique; Roever, Leonardo; Pires, Marcos Alfredo de Andrade; Lima, Jaqueline Maria de Oliveira; de Salles, Felipe Borsu; Khalil, Giovana Munhoz; Nicz, Pedro Felipe Gomes; Mejía, Omar Asdrúbal Vilca; Okino, Arnaldo Akio; Lima, Ricardo de Carvalho",J Card Surg,,390

Within the international project covid19-nmr, we distribute the spectroscopic analysis of the viral proteins and RNA. Here, we report NMR chemical shift assignments for the protein nsp7. The 83 amino acid nsp7 protein is an essential cofactor in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The polymerase activity and processivity of nsp12 are greatly enhanced by binding 1 copy of nsp7 and 2 copies of nsp8 to form a 160 kD complex. A separate hexadecameric complex of nsp7 and nsp8 (8 copies of each) forms a large ring-like structure. Thus, nsp7 is an important component of several large protein complexes that are required for replication of the large and complex coronavirus genome. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone and sidechain resonance assignment (1H,13C,15N) of isolated nsp7 from SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Further, we derive the secondary structure and compare it to the previously reported assignments and structure of the SARS-CoV nsp7.","Tonelli, Marco; Rienstra, Chad; Anderson, Thomas K; Kirchdoerfer, Rob; Henzler-Wildman, Katherine",Biomolecular NMR assignments,,390

However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction. © 2021 IEEE.","Rukangu, A.; Tuttle, A.; Johnsen, K.","2021 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops, VRW 2021",,390

In spite of governments implementing various strategies across the globe, the pandemic is still expanding with increasing numbers of positive cases. In addition, countries are reopening and easing lockdown restrictions in order to get their economies back on track, and this has led to an increase in the transmission of novel coronavirus. Therefore, it is essential to regularly review the containment strategies employed in different regions in order to understand the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and to formulate a future course of actions. Objective: The objective of this study is to review the COVID-19 transmission statistics in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and European Union (EU) countries, and to compare these data with the various containment strategies implemented for containing the spread of the virus. Methods: A review method was adopted along with different statistical methods for comparing and analyzing COVID-19 data and containment strategies. Transmission types and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the countries in both regions are used to present the current state of the pandemic. In addition, changes in the number of COVID-19 cases are compared with the mitigation and suppression strategies implemented in both regions and their impact is analyzed. Results: Countries in the EU were slow in reacting to the pandemic, as delays are observed in the implementation of mitigation strategies. However, suppression strategies were implemented soon after mitigation strategies. GCC countries, on the other hand, were quick to react, and they implemented both mitigation and suppression strategies simultaneously, as soon as the pandemic emerged. The CFR was found to be low among GCC countries compared to EU countries. In addition, a second wave of transmission was observed in the EU, whereas in GCC countries there has been no second wave, although a gradual increase in the number of cases is observed. Community transmission was observed among the majority of countries in both GCC and EU countries. Conclusions: With the reopening of markets, the focus of governments should be on developing integrated user-centric preventive strategies, with a blend of awareness creation, motivation, and support.","Alanezi, Fahad; Althumairi, Arwa; Aljaffary, Afnan; Alfayez, Asma; Alsalman, Demah; Alhodaib, Hala; AlShammari, Maha M; Aldossary, Reem; AlThani, Bashair; Alghamedy, Fatemah; Alanzi, Turki M",Inform Med Unlocked,,390

Although all factors that may be associated with disease severity are not yet clear, older age remains a leading risk factor. While age-related immune changes may be at the bottom of severe course of COVID-19, age-related hormonal changes have considerable importance due to their interactions with these immune alterations, and also with endothelial dysfunction and comorbid cardiometabolic disorders.

METHODS: We performed an anonymized cross-sectional survey, conducted from April 16 to May 18, 2020, of VA rheumatology providers. We assessed provider perspective on COVID-19 issues and resilience. RESULTS: Of the 153 eligible VA rheumatologists, 103 (67%) completed the survey. A significant proportion of providers reported &#8805;50% increase related to COVID-19 in visits by: (1) telephone, 53%; (2) video-based VA video connect (VVC), 44%; and (3) clinical video telehealth (CVT) with a facilitator, 29%. A majority of the responders were somewhat or very comfortable with technology for providing healthcare to established patients during COVID-19 pandemic using: (1) telephone, 87%; (2) VA video connect (VVC), 64%; and (3) in-person visits, 54%. A smaller proportion were comfortable with technology providing healthcare to new patients. At least 65% of rheumatologists considered telephone visits appropriate for established patients with gout, osteoporosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, stable rheumatoid arthritis, stable spondyloarthritis, or osteoarthritis; 32% reported a rheumatology medication shortage. Adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, high provider resilience was associated with significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of comfort with technology for telephone (OR, 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-9.7)) and VVC visits for new patients (OR, 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15.7)). CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of COVID-19 rheumatic disease healthcare issues using a health-system approach can better inform providers, improve provider satisfaction and have positive effects on the care of Veterans with rheumatic disease.","Singh, Jasvinder A; Richards, John S; Chang, Elizabeth; Joseph, Amy; Ng, Bernard",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,390

Co-circulating as four different serotypes, DENV poses a unique challenge for vaccine design as immunity to one serotype predisposes a person to severe and potentially lethal disease upon infection from other serotypes. Recent experimental studies suggest that an effective vaccine against DENV should elicit a strong T cell response against all serotypes, which could be achieved by directing T cell responses toward cross-serotypically conserved epitopes while avoiding serotype-specific ones. Here, we used experimentally-determined DENV T cell epitopes and patient-derived DENV sequences to assess the cross-serotypic variability of the epitopes. We reveal a distinct near-binary pattern of epitope conservation across serotypes for a large number of DENV epitopes. Based on the conservation profile, we identify a set of 55 epitopes that are highly conserved in at least 3 serotypes. Most of the highly conserved epitopes lie in functionally important regions of DENV non-structural proteins. By considering the global distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles associated with these DENV epitopes, we identify a potentially robust subset of HLA class I and class II restricted epitopes that can serve as targets for a universal T cell-based vaccine against DENV while covering ~99% of the global population.","Ahmed, Syed Faraz; Quadeer, Ahmed A.; Barton, John P.; McKay, Matthew R.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956362/,390

The detection of MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNAs indicates that the virus is replicative. This study examined the duration for detecting MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA compared with genomic RNA in diverse respiratory specimens. METHODS: Upper and lower respiratory samples were obtained from 17 MERS-CoV-infected patients. MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA was detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and MERS-CoV genomic RNA by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: In sputum and transtracheal aspirate, sub-genomic mRNA was detected for up to 4 weeks after symptoms developed, which correlated with the detection of genomic RNA. In oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens, the detection of sub-genomic mRNA and genomic RNA did not correlate. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MERS-CoV does not replicate well in the upper respiratory tract.","Park, Wan Beom; Poon, Leo L.M.; Choi, Su-Jin; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Bang, Ji Hwan; Kim, Eu Suk; Kim, Hong Bin; Park, Sang Won; Kim, Nam Joong; Peiris, Malik; Oh, Myoung-don",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218344114; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753119/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971218344114,390

We administered an online questionnaire to 488 Chinese police officers who participated in frontline work to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed a U-shaped curvilinear relationship of career calling with physical fatigue, mental fatigue, emotional fatigue, and role overload. Moreover, role overload partially mediated these curvilinear relationships. In addition, COVID-19 event disruption positively moderated the direct curvilinear effect of career calling on role overload, physical fatigue, and emotional fatigue, as well as the first stage of the mediating effect in the relationship between career calling and physical, mental, and emotional fatigue through role overload.

This investigation employed the SST [Formula: see text] model to simulate gasper-induced jet flow with the use of detailed gasper geometry, and validated the simulation results using experimental data. The validated CFD results not only revealed the mixing mechanism of a gasper-induced jet with ambient air, but also enabled the development of two mathematical models for characterizing the jet development along the gasper axis and radial velocity profiles in the downstream region. Furthermore, these models enabled the prediction of the entrainment ratio at different locations along a gasper-induced jet, and this ratio was used to evaluate the impact of the jet on air quality in a passenger’s breathing zone. The performance of the CFD model and mathematical models was evaluated, and the models were compared on the basis of prediction accuracy and computing time.","Shi, Zhu; Chen, Jun; You, Ruoyu; Chen, Chun; Chen, Qingyan",Energy Build,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816305278; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778816305278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288117/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.038,390
600923,Acceptance of Covid-19 vaccine among healthcare personnel in India: A cross-sectional survey during the initial phase of vaccination,2021-03-31,"Summary Background: Uruguay is one of the few countries in the Americas that successfully contained the COVID-19 epidemic during the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, the intensive human mobility across the dry border with Brazil is a major challenge for public health authorities. We aimed to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil as well as to measure the viral flux across this ~1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier. Methods: Using complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Uruguayan-Brazilian bordering region and phylogeographic analyses, we inferred the virus dissemination frequency between Brazil and Uruguay and characterized local outbreak dynamics during the first months (May-July) of the pandemic. Findings: Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the bordering region. The most probable sources of viral strains introduced to Uruguay were the Southeast Brazilian region and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some of the viral strains introduced in Uruguayan border localities between early May and mid-July were able to locally spread and originated the first outbreaks detected outside the metropolitan region. The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan suburban outbreaks were defined by a set of between four and 11 mutations (synonymous and non-synonymous) respect to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil, supporting the notion of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in South America. Interpretation: Although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated bi-national surveillance systems are crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the world.","Mir, D.; Rego, N.; Resende, P.

This has not been reported in Campylobacter jejuni infections. METHODS: A healthy patient with fever, rigors, and an acute diarrheal illness was noted to have a white blood cell count of 2.65 × 10(9)/L and platelet level of 125 × 10(9)/L. Retrospective chart review of all adult C. jejuni stool-positive cases admitted over 1 year revealed leukopenia in 6 of 20 (30%), thrombocytopenia in 5 of 20 (25%), and both in 1 of 20 (5%). RESULTS: Cytopenias were mild, transient, and not associated with prolonged hospital stay or complications. CONCLUSIONS: Acute C. jejuni infections should be added to the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses that may be associated with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.

Firstly on March 2020, this condition was reported to be COVID-19 related to children (MIS-C). Since June 2020, a syndrome similar to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) came to be noticed in adults as well. We reported here a case of 24-year-old young woman who had gone to a hospital with abdominal pain and later developed a severe cough, followed by development of subconjunctival bleeding, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and intra-abdominal fluid that we deemed them to be acute multisystemic clinical symptoms, 47 days after she had undergone a COVID-19 infection of mild clinical severity. It should be kept in mind that a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome along with a delayed immune response during COVID-19 disease can be seen not only in children but also in young adults, and seemingly severe clinical and laboratory findings can improve by controlling the inflammatory process.","Altunisik Toplu, Sibel; Ersoy, Yasemin; Bayindir, Yasar; Kilic, Talat; Bayazit, Volkan",Medeni Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239770/; https://doi.org/10.5222/mmj.2021.95422,390

The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM(2.5)). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of environmental sustainability that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121006332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029545/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121006332?v=s5,390
604387,Innovation Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-06,"In 2020, the world experienced its very first pandemic of the globalized era. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and has rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems and leading a large number of people to death. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas has always been a concern. In a vast and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for inner Brazil, and what can we do to control infection transmission in each of these locations? Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals’ social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones. The model reinforces social distancing as the most efficient method to control disease transmission. Moreover, it also shows that improving the detection and isolation of infected individuals can loosen this mitigation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of control may be different across the country, and understanding it can help set up public health strategies.","Almeida, G. B.; Vilches, T. N.; Ferreira, C.

In 2009, the European Psychiatric Association, the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes published a position paper aimed to improve cardiovascular and diabetes care in patients with severe mental illnesses. However, the initiative did not produce the expected results. Experts in SSD or in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases convened to identify main issues relevant to management of cardiometabolic risk factors in schizophrenia patients and to seek consensus through the Delphi method. METHODS: The steering committee identified four topics: 1) cardiometabolic risk factors in schizophrenia patients; 2) cardiometabolic risk factors related to antipsychotic treatment; 3) differences in antipsychotic cardiometabolic profiles; 4) management of cardiometabolic risk. Twelve key statements were included in a Delphi questionnaire delivered to a panel of expert European psychiatrists. RESULTS: Consensus was reached for all statements with positive agreement higher than 85% in the first round. European psychiatrists agreed on: 1) high cardiometabolic risk in patients with SSD, 2) importance of correct risk management of cardiometabolic diseases, from lifestyle modification to treatment of risk factors, including the choice of antipsychotic drugs with a favourable cardiometabolic profile. The expert panel identified the psychiatrist as the central coordinating figure of management, possibly assisted by other specialists and general practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates high level of agreement among European psychiatrists regarding the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and management in subjects with SSD.","Galderisi, Silvana; De Hert, Marc; Del Prato, Stefano; Fagiolini, Andrea; Gorwood, Philip; Leucht, Stefan; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro; Mucci, Armida; Arango, Celso",Eur Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33413701/,390

Moreover, the effect of SNSs on opinion polarisation is still unclear in terms of pluralistic information access or selective exposure to opinions in an SNS. In this study, we confirmed the steady, highly independent nature of left- and right-leaning ECs, both of which are composed of approximately 250,000 users, from a year-long reply/retweet network of 42 million Japanese Twitter users. We found that both communities have similarly efficient information spreading networks with densely connected and core-periphery structures. Core nodes resonate in the early stages of information cascades, and unilaterally transmit information to peripheral nodes. Each EC has resonant core users who amplify and steadily spread information to a quarter of a million users. In addition, we confirmed the existence of extremely aggressive users of ECs who co-reply/retweet each other. The connection between these users and top influencers suggests that the extreme opinions of the former group affect the entire community through the top influencers.","Asatani, Kimitaka; Yamano, Hiroko; Sakaki, Takeshi; Sakata, Ichiro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820918/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86750-w,390

Scholarly literature, however, often fails to engage complexities of power in understanding socio-environmental interactions in resettlement processes. Addressing Zimbabwe’s Tokwe-Mukosi flood disaster resettlement, we explore hegemonic uses of state power during the pre- and post-flood induced resettlement processes. We examine how state power exercised through local government, financial, and security institutions impacts community vulnerabilities during forced resettlement processes, while furthering capitalist agendas, drawing insights from analysing narratives between 2010 and 2021. Concerns abound that multiple ministries, the police, and the army undermined displaced people’s resilience, including through inadequate compensation, with state institutions neglecting displaced communities during encampment by inadequately meeting physical security, health, educational, and livestock production needs. We explore how forcibly resettling encamped households to a disputed location is not only an ongoing perceived injustice regionally but also a continuing reference point in resettlement discussions countrywide, reflecting concerns that land use and economic reconfigurations in resettlement can undermine subsistence livelihoods while privileging certain values and interests over others. Policy lessons highlight the need for reviewing disaster management legislation, developing compensation guidelines and reviewing encampment practices. Analytically, lessons point to how state power may be studied in relation to perspectives on the destruction of flood survivors’ connections to place, people and livelihoods, underscoring the critical need for theorising the relationships between power dynamics and diverse experiences around displacement.","Mucherera, Blessing; Spiegel, Samuel",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305267/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10471-w,390

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of such an unprecedently connected world. As of 19 November 2020, over 56 million people have been infected with nearly 1.35 million deaths, and the numbers are growing. The state-of-the-art social media analytics for COVID-19-related studies to understand the various phenomena happening in our environment are limited and require many more studies. This paper proposes a software tool comprising a collection of unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) machine learning and other methods for the analysis of Twitter data in Arabic with the aim to detect government pandemic measures and public concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is described in detail, including its architecture, five software components, and algorithms. Using the tool, we collect a dataset comprising 14 million tweets from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the period 1 February 2020 to 1 June 2020. We detect 15 government pandemic measures and public concerns and six macro-concerns (economic sustainability, social sustainability, etc.), and formulate their information-structural, temporal, and spatio-temporal relationships. For example, we are able to detect the timewise progression of events from the public discussions on COVID-19 cases in mid-March to the first curfew on 22 March, financial loan incentives on 22 March, the increased quarantine discussions during March–April, the discussions on the reduced mobility levels from 24 March onwards, the blood donation shortfall late March onwards, the government’s 9 billion SAR (Saudi Riyal) salary incentives on 3 April, lifting the ban on five daily prayers in mosques on 26 May, and finally the return to normal government measures on 29 May 2020.

A central aim of the present report is to obtain a molecularly informed basis for analgesic drug development aimed at peripheral rather than central targets. We compare three key peripheral ganglia: nodose, sympathetic (superior cervical), and dorsal root ganglia in the rat, and focus on their molecular composition using next-gen RNA-Seq, as well as their neuroanatomy using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. We obtained quantitative and anatomical assessments of transmitters, receptors, enzymes and signaling pathways mediating ganglion-specific functions. Distinct ganglionic patterns of expression were observed spanning ion channels, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), transporters, and biosynthetic enzymes. The relationship between ganglionic transcript levels and the corresponding protein was examined using immunohistochemistry for select, highly expressed, ganglion-specific genes. Transcriptomic analyses of spinal dorsal horn and intermediolateral cell column (IML), which form the termination of primary afferent neurons and the origin of preganglionic innervation to the SCG, respectively, disclosed pre- and post-ganglionic molecular-level circuits. These multimodal investigations provide insight into autonomic regulation, nodose transcripts related to pain and satiety, and DRG-spinal cord and IML-SCG communication.

Consequently, vectors are one of the basic elements to optimize gene therapy approaches and protocols in view of the facts that we know that with liposomes less than 10% of cells are transduced, that retrovirus only infect cells in replication, and that adenovirus give rise to an important inflammatory response and a transitory transduction of the therapeutic gene. In addition recent approaches in cancer gene therapy with selective replication virus, suicidal genes, etc., are discussed.","Alemany Bonastre, R.; Barquinero Máñez, J.; Ramón, S.; Agueras, Cajal",Revista Clínica Española,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014256505725224; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014256505725224,390

This study aimed to evaluate the QOL of Chinese patients with stroke during the pandemic and explore the associated variables. A matched-pair, multicenter survey was conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires including the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale, and the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR) were used. A total of 172 matched pairs (344 patients) were recruited in this study. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze variables associated with QOL. Physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS) were higher among the stroke patients during the pandemic (44.20 ± 18.92 and 54.24 ± 19.08) than before the pandemic (37.98 ± 14.52 and 43.50 ± 20.94). Pandemic stress, demographic and clinical characteristics were negative variables associated with PCS and MCS. QPR was positively associated with PCS and MCS. The QOL of Chinese stroke patients was higher during than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic stress aggravated stroke patients’ QOL, while personal recovery could alleviate the detrimental effect of pandemic stress on QOL for stroke patients.","Zhao, Li; Yang, Xiaoshi; Yang, Fengzhi; Sui, Guoyuan; Sui, Yi; Xu, Bing; Qu, Bo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89746-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986426/,390

618366,Is it safe to vaccinate within a tattoo?,2021-07-01,"Since its discovery, more than 37 million people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 with deaths around 1 million worldwide. The prevalence is not known because infected individuals may be asymptomatic. In addition, the use of specific diagnostic tests is not always conclusive, raising doubts about the etiology of the disease. The best diagnostic method and the ideal time of collection remains the subject of study. The gold standard for diagnosing COVID 19 is the RT PCR molecular test, usually using an oropharynx and nasopharynx swab. Its sensitivity is 70% and drops significantly after the second week of symptoms. Serological tests, in turn, have increased sensitivity after 14 days, and can contribute to the diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected, even with negative RT PCR. Our study showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% of the serological test (ELISA method) for cases of viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, suggesting that this test could assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial changes that have not yet been etiologically clarified. We found a greater immune response in men, regardless of the severity of symptoms. The greater the severity, the higher the levels of IgA and IgG, mainly found in patients with multilobar impairment and in need for oxygen. We concluded that the serological test collected around 30 days after the onset of symptoms is the best diagnostic tool in the convalescence phase, not only for epidemiological purposes, but also for the etiological clarification of pulmonary changes that have not yet been diagnosed.","Pereira, J.

L’application d’une stratégie de dépistage efficace s’impose comme moyen de contrôler la diffusion de l’épidémie dans les centres d’hémodialyse. Description Stratégie de dépistage systématique du COVID-19 chez les patients hémodialysés par culture virale sur frottis nasopharyngé et scanner thoracique des patients positifs. Méthodes Le test par rt-PCR a été utilisé comme test diagnostique chez les patients symptomatiques et faute de disposer de tests en suffisance, nous avons réalisé un dépistage hebdomadaire du COVID-19 chez tous nos patients hémodialysés (n =157) par culture virale sur frottis nasopharyngé. Et nous avons réalisé un scanner thoracique chez nos patients positifs à la rt-PCR ou à la culture virale. Résultats Entre la mi-mars 2020 et fin avril, nous avons enregistré 37 patients atteints du COVID-19 soit 23,5 % de notre population. Dix-sept patients asymptomatiques ont été testés positifs, grâce au dépistage systématique par culture virale, soit 46 % de la totalité de nos patients infectés. Parmi les patients infectés mais asymptomatiques, 11 (69 %) présentaient une atteinte pulmonaire au scanner thoracique, pouvant atteindre 20 à 40 % du parenchyme pulmonaire dans 43,7 % des cas. Conclusion Le dépistage systématique chez les patients hémodialysés par culture virale hebdomadaire, est une stratégie proactive de lutte contre l’épidémie COVID-19 permettant de repérer et d’isoler, après scanner thoracique, les patients asymptomatiques mais potentiellement contagieux.

As many countries are engaged in designing vaccines, the harmful second and third waves of COVID-19 have already appeared in many countries. To investigate changes in transmission rates and the effect of social distancing in the USA, we formulate a system of ordinary differential equations using data of confirmed cases and deaths in these states: California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, and Missouri in the USA to be able to investigate changes in transmission rates of the outbreak and effect of social distancing. Our models and the corre- sponding parameter estimations show social distancing reduces the transmission by 60% to 90%, and thus obeying the movement restriction rules plays a crucial rule to reduce the magnitudes of the outbreak waves.

Conceptually we take our cue from Norbert Elias and the way something as physiologically fundamental as coughing becomes the focus of etiquette and technique, touching also on themes central to Mary Douglas’ anthropology of pollution. This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices. Third, coughing is seen to be central to the sonographic soundscape of the healthcare environment whereby people learn to recognise (and sometimes misrecognise) each other through the ‘sound’ of the cough. Finally, coughing properly can be seen to have both a ‘time and a place’ including the retreat of the cough from public space into risky confined spaces.

We conducted a review of literature focusing on complex disasters, entailing natural disasters in combination of outbreaks or endemics of infectious diseases. Using the Google Scholar search engine, we identified and reviewed 24 papers sourced from academia, governments, and concerned organizations, and associated data on such disasters, commencing with the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, which occurred in 1995. In light of our review, we developed a summary of correspondences and problems linked to compound disasters involving conjunctions of outbreaks/endemics and natural disasters that could offer insights for developing measures to deal with natural disasters that occur in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We subsequently attempted to differentiate the characteristics of evacuation measures relating to COVID-19 from those relating to other infectious diseases using three sets of extracted keywords: (1) surveillance and information sharing, (2) evacuation center environment and stockpiled supplies, and (3) community disaster risk reduction and community leadership.

This technique delivers date-stamping strategies for the emergence as well as collapse of explosive bubble episodes and is best suited for practical application to time series. The results reveal that four explosive bubbles are detected over the period of 1980–2019 when copper price deviates from fundamental value. Besides, this finding is in accordance with the asset pricing model (Gürkaynak, 2008), which generally considers both fundamental and bubble components in the presence of asset prices. Based on the empirical results, the multiple emergence and collapse of multiple price bubbles are attributed to speculation, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, an imbalance between supply and demand, and financial crises. Policymakers should actively recognize bubble episodes and monitor their evolution, which could be conducive to achieving the effective stabilization of the international copper price. To reduce excess price fluctuations and explosive copper bubbles, authorities should impose restrictions on excessive speculative behaviors under extreme market conditions.","Su, Chi-Wei; Wang, Xiao-Qing; Zhu, Haotian; Tao, Ran; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia; Lobonţ, Oana-Ramona",Resources Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420719301825; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301420719301825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,390

Despite rapid efforts to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, the disease is still not under control. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are two very promising inhibitors which have shown positive effect in combating the disease in preliminary experimental studies, but their use was reduced due to severe side-effects. Here, we performed a theoretical investigation of the same by studying the binding of the molecules with SARS-COV-2 Spike protein, the complex formed by Spike and ACE2 human receptor and a human serine protease TMPRSS2 which aids in cleavage of the Spike protein to initiate the viral activation in the body. Both the molecules had shown very good docking energies in the range of -6kcal/mol. Subsequently, we did a high throughput screening for other potential quinoline candidates which could be used as inhibitors. From the large pool of ligand candidates, we shortlisted the top three ligands (binding energy -8kcal/mol). We tested the stability of the docked complexes by running Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations where we observed the stability of the quinoline analogues with the Spike-ACE2 and TMPRSS2 nevertheless the quinolines were not stable with the Spike protein alone. Thus, although the inhibitors bond very well with the protein molecules their intrinsic binding affinity depends on the protein dynamics. Moreover, the quinolines were stable when bound to electronegative pockets of Spike-ACE2 or TMPRSS2 but not with Viral Spike protein. We also observed that a Fluoride based compound: 3-[3-(Trifluoromethyl)phenyl]quinoline helps the inhibitor to bind with both Spike-ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with equal probability. The molecular details presented in this study would be very useful for developing quinoline based drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","Sarkar, Neellohit; Thakur, Abhimanyu; Ghadge, Jigisha; Rath, Soumya Lipsa",J Fluor Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022113921001433?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393265/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022113921001433; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfluchem.2021.109865,390

The goal of this study was to characterize these self-reported efforts by the pediatric simulation community. DESIGN: This was a global, multicenter survey developed via a Delphi process. SETTING: International survey study. SUBJECTS: The survey was sent to 555 individual members of the three largest international pediatric simulation societies (The International Pediatric Simulation Society, International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research & Education, and Netzwerk Kindersimulation e.V.) between April 27, 2020, and May 18, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Description of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic simulation-based preparation activities of pediatric acute and critical care healthcare providers. The Delphi process included 20 content experts and required three rounds to reach consensus. The survey was completed by 234 participants (42.2%) from 19 countries. Preparation differed significantly between the geographic regions, with 79.3% of Anglo-American/Anglo-Saxon, 82.6% of Indian, and 47.1% of European participants initiating specifically coronavirus disease 2019-related simulation activities. Frequent modifications to existing simulation programs included the use of telesimulation and virtual reality training. Forty-nine percent of institutions discontinued noncoronavirus disease 2019-related simulation training. CONCLUSIONS: The swift incorporation of disease-specific sessions and the transition of standard education to virtual or hybrid simulation training modes occurred frequently. The approach used, however, depended heavily on local requirements, limitations, and circumstances. In particular, the use of telesimulation allowed education to continue while maintaining social distancing requirements.","Wagner, Michael; Jaki, Christina; Löllgen, Ruth M.; Mileder, Lukas; Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Steinbauer, Philipp; Gottstein, Maximilian; Abulebda, Kamal; Calhoun, Aaron; Gross, Isabel T.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350800/,390

Several studies have shown that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primate models. However, the effect of prior infection on blocking SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not clear. Here, we evaluated the impact of prior infection on protection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in golden hamsters. Our results showed that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, but it was not sterizing immunity. The transmission experiment results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently transmitted from naive hamsters to prior infected hamsters by direct contact and airborne route, but not by indirect contact. Further, the virus was efficiently transmitted from prior infected hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact, but not by airborne route and indirect contact. Surprisingly, the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters by direct contact during a short period of early infection. Taken together, our study demonstrated that prior infected hamsters with good immunity can still be naturally re-infected, and the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters and the naive through different transmission routes, implying the potential possibility of human re-infection and the risk of virus transmission between prior infected population and the healthy. Our study will help to calculate the herd immunity threshold more accurately, make more reasonable public health decisions, formulate an optimized population vaccination program, as well as aid the implementation of appropriate public health and social measures to control COVID-19.","Zhang, Cheng; Guo, Zhendong; Li, Nan; Cui, Huan; Meng, Keyin; Liu, Lina; Zhao, Li; Zhang, Shanshan; Qin, Chengfeng; Liu, Juxiang; Gao, Yuwei; Zhang, Chunmao",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.428920,390

Considering the severity of the disease and the lack of active treatments, 14 patients with Covid-19 and severe lung inflammation received inhaled adenosine in the attempt to therapeutically compensate for the oxygen-related loss of the endogenous adenosine→A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-mediated mitigation of the lung-destructing inflammatory damage. This off label-treatment was based on preclinical studies in mice with LPS-induced ARDS, where inhaled adenosine/A2AR agonists protected oxygenated lungs from the deadly inflammatory damage. The treatment was allowed, considering that adenosine has several clinical applications. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: Fourteen consecutively enrolled patients with Covid19-related interstitial pneumonitis and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio<300 received off-label-treatment with 9 mg inhaled adenosine every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and subsequently, every 24 days for the next 4 days. Fifty-two patients with analogue features and hospitalized between February and April 2020, who did not receive adenosine, were considered as a historical control group. Patients monitoring also included hemodynamic/hematochemical studies, CTscans, and SARS-CoV2-tests. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated with no hemodynamic change and one case of moderate bronchospasm. A significant increase (> 30%) in the PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio was reported in 13 out of 14 patients treated with adenosine compared with that observed in 7 out of52 patients in the control within 15 days. Additionally, we recorded a mean PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio increase (215 ± 45 vs. 464 ± 136, P = 0.0002) in patients receiving adenosine and no change in the control group (210±75 vs. 250±85 at 120 hours, P>0.05). A radiological response was demonstrated in 7 patients who received adenosine, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA load rapidly decreased in 13 cases within 7 days while no changes were recorded in the control group within 15 days. There was one Covid-19 related death in the experimental group and 11in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our short-term analysis suggests the overall safety and beneficial therapeutic effect of inhaled adenosine in patients with Covid-19-inflammatory lung disease suggesting further investigation in controlled clinical trials.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Caracciolo, Massimo; Bilotta, Federico; Conte, Marco; Cuzzola, Maria; Falcone, Carmela; Mangano, Carmelo; Falzea, Antonella Consuelo; Iuliano, Eleonora; Morabito, Antonella; Foti, Giuseppe; Armentano, Antonio; Caraglia, Michele; De Lorenzo, Antonino; Sitkovsky, Michail; Macheda, Sebastiano",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031409/,390
625204,Emergency department bounceback characteristics for patients diagnosed with COVID-19,2021-04-19,"INTRODUCTION: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, disease diagnosis is essential for optimal management and timely isolation of infected cases in order to prevent further spread. The aim of this study was to systematically review the assessment of risk and model the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. Variables associated with hospital mortality using bivariate analysis were included as potential independent predictors associated with mortality at the p <0.05levels. RESULTS: We included 114 studies accounting for 310,494 patients from various parts of the world. For the purpose of this analysis, we set a cutoff point of 10% for the mortality percentages. High mortality rates were defined as higher than 10% of confirmed positive cases and were given a score of two, while low mortality percentage (<10%) was assigned to the score of one. We then analyzed the associations between 72 variables and the observed mortality rates. These variables included a large range of related conditions such as demographics, signs and symptoms and related morbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, imaging studies, underlying diseases, and the status of countries' income based on United Nation's classifications. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that older age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus conferred a significant increased risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19.

625576,Clinical Features of Emergency Department Patients from Early COVID-19 Pandemic that Predict SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Machine-learning Approach,2021-03-04,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consists of a systemic disease that can present many complications. The infection presents broad clinical symptoms and a high rate of transmissibility. In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome, the patients manifest complications beyond the respiratory system. The frequency of liver damage in COVID-19 patients ranges from 14.8% to 53% of patients. One should pay attention to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with COVID-19, especially considering the off-label use of drugs in prophylactic and therapeutic regimens applied on large scales. This review aims to present relevant information on the medication used so far in COVID-19 patients and its possible hepatotoxicity. We reviewed liver damage in patients with COVID-19 on PubMed and Virtual Health Library to investigate DILI cases. Four studies were selected, involving the medicines remdesivir, tocilizumab and a pharmacovigilance analysis study. The hepatotoxicity profile of drugs presented in the literature considers use in accordance to usual posology standards for treatment. However, drugs currently used in the management of COVID-19 follow different dosages and posology than those tested by the pharmaceutical industry. The deficiency of uniformity and standardization in the assessment of hepatotoxicity cases hinders the publication of information and the possibility of comparing information among healthcare professionals. It is suggested that severe liver injury in COVID-19 patients should be reported in pharmacovigilance institutions, and physicians should pay attention to any considerable abnormal liver test elevation as it can demonstrate unknown drug hepatotoxicity. Liver disorders in COVID-19 patients and the use of several concomitant off-label medications — with a potential risk of further damaging the liver - should at least be a warning sign for rapid identification and early intervention, thus preventing liver damage from contributing to severe impairment in patients.","Ortiz, Gabriela Xavier; Lenhart, Gabriele; Becker, Matheus William; Schwambach, Karin Hepp; Tovo, Cristiane Valle; Blatt, Carine Raquel",World J Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630881/; https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v13.i9.1143,390

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that when appropriate strategies are adopted autopsy is a safe procedure with a minimal infection risk for all subjects involved (pathologists, technical personnel, and others) when proper strategies are adopted. We performed 16 autopsies on cadavers of persons who had died with confirmed COVID-19 with different post-mortem intervals (PMI). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, for each autopsy, 2 swabs were sampled from lungs, while to evaluate environmental contamination, 11 swabs were taken at three different times: T0 (before autopsy), T1 (at the end of the autopsy, without removing the corpse), and T2 (after cleaning and disinfecting the autopsy room). Specifically, 2 swabs were sampled on face shields used by each pathologist, and 4 swabs were collected on the autopsy table; 4 swabs were also collected from walls and 1 from floor. Lung swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases. Environmental swabs, collected at T0 and T2 were all negative, while swabs sampled at T1 were shown to be positive. Interestingly, no association was shown between PMI length and environmental contamination.

This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy. We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population.We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a largenumber of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.20188359v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359,390

OBJECTIVE: To study the prognostic value of damage parameters and cytokines as predictors of severity of COVID-19 using an extensive immunologic profiling and unbiased artificial intelligence methods. METHODS: Sixty hospitalized COVID-19 patients (30 moderate and 30 severe) and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. The damage indicators high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), extensive biochemical analyses, a panel of 47 cytokines and chemokines were analyzed at weeks 1, 2 and 7 along with clinical complaints and CT scans of the lungs. Unbiased artificial intelligence (AI) methods (logistic regression and Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms) were applied to investigate the contribution of each parameter to prediction of the severity of the disease. RESULTS: On admission, the severely ill patients had significantly higher levels of LDH, IL-6, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), D-dimer, fibrinogen, glucose than the patients with moderate disease. The levels of macrophage derived cytokine (MDC) were lower in severely ill patients. Based on artificial intelligence analysis, eight parameters (creatinine, glucose, monocyte number, fibrinogen, MDC, MIG, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 have been identified that could predict with an accuracy of 83−87% whether the patient will develop severe disease.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.

630316,Increased Utilization of Virtual Visits and Electronic Approaches in Clinical Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Thereafter,2021-07-05,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute care re-utilization, i.e., hospital readmission and post-discharge Emergency Department (ED) use, is a significant driver of healthcare costs and a marker for healthcare quality. Diabetes is a major contributor to acute care re-utilization and associated costs. The goals of this paper are to (1) review the epidemiology of readmissions among patients with diabetes, (2) describe models that predict readmission risk, and (3) address various strategies for reducing the risk of acute care re-utilization. RECENT FINDINGS: Hospital readmissions and ED visits by diabetes patients are common and costly. Major risk factors for readmission include sociodemographics, comorbidities, insulin use, hospital length of stay (LOS), and history of readmissions, most of which are non-modifiable. Several models for predicting the risk of readmission among diabetes patients have been developed, two of which have reasonable accuracy in external validation. In retrospective studies and mostly small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), interventions such as inpatient diabetes education, inpatient diabetes management services, transition of care support, and outpatient follow-up are generally associated with a reduction in the risk of acute care re-utilization. Data on readmission risk and readmission risk reduction interventions are limited or lacking among patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19. The evidence supporting post-discharge follow-up by telephone is equivocal and also limited. SUMMARY: Acute care re-utilization of patients with diabetes presents an important opportunity to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs. Currently available predictive models are useful for identifying higher risk patients but could be improved. Machine learning models, which are becoming more common, have the potential to generate more accurate acute care re-utilization risk predictions. Tools embedded in electronic health record systems are needed to translate readmission risk prediction models into clinical practice. Several risk reduction interventions hold promise but require testing in multi-site RCTs to prove their generalizability, scalability, and effectiveness.","Rubin, Daniel J.; Shah, Arnav A.",Curr Diab Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-021-01402-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480653/,390

The induction of those membrane-less viral compartments leads inevitably to structural remodeling of the cellular architecture. Recent studies suggested that viral IBs have properties of biomolecular condensates (or liquid organelles), as have previously been shown for other membrane-less cellular compartments like stress granules or P-bodies. Biomolecular condensates are highly dynamic structures formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Key drivers for LLPS in cells are multivalent protein:protein and protein:RNA interactions leading to specialized areas in the cell that recruit molecules with similar properties, while other non-similar molecules are excluded. These typical features of cellular biomolecular condensates are also a common characteristic in the biogenesis of viral inclusion bodies. Viral IBs are predominantly induced by the expression of the viral nucleoprotein (N, NP) and phosphoprotein (P); both are characterized by a special protein architecture containing multiple disordered regions and RNA-binding domains that contribute to different protein functions. P keeps N soluble after expression to allow a concerted binding of N to the viral RNA. This results in the encapsidation of the viral genome by N, while P acts additionally as a cofactor for the viral polymerase, enabling viral transcription and replication. Here, we will review the formation and function of those viral inclusion bodies upon infection with NSVs with respect to their nature as biomolecular condensates.","Dolnik, Olga; Gerresheim, Gesche K.; Biedenkopf, Nadine",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200781/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10061460,390

An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients. In addition, LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via Toll-like receptor 2 in vitro, but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo.","Groeneveld, Geert H; van der Reyden, Tanny J; Joosten, Simone A; Bootsma, Hester J; Cobbaert, Christa M; de Vries, Jutte J C; Kuijper, Ed J; van Dissel, Jaap T",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkz207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106377/,390

In contrast, nanocarrier based therapeutics provide a broad range of opportunities due to their ability to encapsulate substances with different aqueous solubility, transport distinct types of cargo, target therapeutics specifically to the deceased organ, cell, or cellular organelle limiting adverse side effects and increasing the efficacy of therapy. Moreover, many nanotherapeutics can be delivered by inhalation locally to the lungs avoiding systemic circulation. In addition, nanoscale based delivery systems can be multifunctional, simultaneously carrying out several tasks including diagnostics, treatment and suppression of cellular resistance to the treatment. Nanoscale delivery systems improve the clinical efficacy of conventional therapeutics allowing new approaches for the treatment of respiratory diseases which are difficult to treat or possess intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment.

Here, we investigated how complement interacts with the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 specimens, cell-based inhibition studies, and NET/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) cocultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, tissue factor (TF) activity, and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils of patients yielded high TF expression and released NETs carrying active TF. Treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAECs. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. COVID-19 serum induced complement activation in vitro, consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement C3 inhibition with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils.

However, the biosimilar industry faces multiple challenges and obstacles in developing and marketing these complex products. Divergent regulatory framework in emerging countries adds to repetitive trials and increased cost of biosimilar development, delaying the approval process. Due to such roadblocks, healthcare systems and patients are yet to realize the full benefits of biosimilars. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this exploratory study was to specifically identify the challenges faced by the industry in emerging countries including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Turkey and Mexico (BRICS-TM), pertaining to biosimilar development and the regulatory approval process. In particular, this study aims to understand the perceptions of industry on the barriers faced by them in terms of complexity, costs for biosimilar development and time-to-market for biosimilar product. METHODS: A semi-quantitative questionnaire was designed based on secondary research. A total of 93 industry personnel and representatives from 14 trade associations from the BRICS-TM countries with 15-year minimum experience were identified and invited to take part in the study and participate in interviews, which were recorded verbatim. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data. RESULTS: Of the 107 biopharmaceutical industry and trade association representatives invited to participate in the study, respondents from 33 biopharmaceutical companies agreed to take part and underwent the interviews. The industry personnel perceived biosimilar guidelines and approval processes as being protracted and in a state of evolution. The absence of an abridged approval pathway limited effectiveness of the regulatory process. The biggest hurdles in the development of biosimilar dossiers were the sourcing of the reference biological product and expectations around confirmatory clinical trials by the agencies. The non-comprehensive implementation of a stepwise approach resulting in unnecessary toxicity studies was also reported as a major challenge. The authors recommend further primary research with BRICS-TM regulatory agencies in order to propose a simplified pathway for development and approval. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of standardized biosimilar development criteria and regulatory convergence across BRICS-TM agencies has led to challenges in multi-country development programmes for these medicines, in turn impacting the ability of industry to launch newer and more affordable biosimilars.

635870,Practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19,2020-04-23,"Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic disease caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. It starts as a pulmonary infection that can spread to other organs, such as the brain, leading to the most serious occurrence of the disease, meningoencephalitis. The humoral response has already been described in limiting the progression of cryptococcosis where the B-1 cell seems to be responsible for producing natural IgM antibodies, crucial for combating fungal infections. The role of the B-1 cell in C. neoformans infection has been initially described, however the role of the humoral response of B-1 cells has not yet been evaluated during C. gattii infections. In the present study we tried to unravel this issue using XID mice, a murine model deficient in the Btk protein which compromises the development of B-1 lymphocytes. We use the XID mice compared to BALB/c mice that are sufficient for the B-1 population during C. gattii infection. Our model of chronic lung infection revealed that XID mice, unlike the sufficient group of B-1, had early mortality with significant weight loss, in addition to reduced levels of IgM and IgG specific to GXM isolated from the capsule of C. neoformans. In addition to this, we observed an increased fungal load in the blood and in the brain. We described an increase in the capsular size of C. gattii and the predominant presence of cytokines with a Th2 profile was also observed in these animals. Thus, the present study strongly points to a higher susceptibility of the XID mouse to C. gattii, which suggests that the presence of B-1 cells and anti-GXM antibodies is fundamental during the control of infection by C. gattii.","Diniz-Lima, Israel; da Rosa, Pablo Rodrigo; da Silva-Junior, Elias Barbosa; Guimarães-de-Oliveira, Joyce Cristina; de Freitas, Elisangela Oliveira; de Oliveira Nascimento, Danielle; Morrot, Alexandre; Nimrichter, Leonardo; Previato, Jose Osvaldo; Mendonça-Previato, Lucia; Freire-de-Lima, Leonardo; Decote-Ricardo, Debora; Freire-de-Lima, Celio Geraldo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526536/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97041-9,390

However, government agencies have finite resources, so they can't monitor everything all of the time: they have to decide how best to allocate their scarce resources (i.e., budget for antivirals and preventive vaccinations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), ventilators, non-intensive Care Unit (non-ICU), doctors) across a broad range of risk exposures (i.e., geographic spread, routes of transmission, overall poverty, medical preconditions). This paper establishes a comprehensive risk-based emergency management framework that could be used by decision-makers to determine how best to manage medical resources, as well as suggest patient allocation among hospitals and alternative healthcare facilities. A set of risk indexes are proposed by modeling the randomness and uncertainty of allocating resources in a pandemic. The city understudy is modeled as a Euclidean complex network, where depending on the neighborhood influence of allocating a resource in a demand point (i.e., informing citizens, limit social contact, allocate a new hospital) different network configurations are proposed. Finally, a multi-objective risk-based resource allocation (MoRRA) framework is proposed to optimize the allocation of resources in pandemics. The applicability of the framework is shown by the identification of high-risk areas where to prioritize the resource allocation during the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bogota, Colombia.","Prieto, J.; Gomez, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252407v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.24.21252407,390

Myocarditis is an uncommon pathologic diagnosis occurring in 4.5% of highly selected cases undergoing autopsy or endomyocardial biopsy. Although polymerase chain reaction–detectable virus could be found in the lungs of most coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)–infected subjects in our own autopsy registry, in only 2 cases was the virus detected in the heart. It should be appreciated that myocardial inflammation alone by macrophages and T cells can be seen in noninfectious deaths and COVID-19 cases, but the extent of each is different, and in neither case do such findings represent clinically relevant myocarditis. Given its extremely low frequency and unclear therapeutic implications, the authors do not advocate use of endomyocardial biopsy to diagnose myocarditis in the setting of COVID-19.","Kawakami, Rika; Sakamoto, Atsushi; Kawai, Kenji; Gianatti, Andrea; Pellegrini, Dario; Nasr, Ahmed; Kutys, Bob; Guo, Liang; Cornelissen, Anne; Mori, Masayuki; Sato, Yu; Pescetelli, Irene; Brivio, Matteo; Romero, Maria; Guagliumi, Giulio; Virmani, Renu; Finn, Aloke V.",J Am Coll Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720378955; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720378955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478655/,390

We investigate the proposed problem for the derivation of at least one and unique solution in the positive feasible region of non-local solution. For one stationary ergodic distribution, the necessary result of existence is developed by applying the Lyapunov function in the sense of delay-stochastic approach and the condition for the extinction of the disease is also established. Our obtained results show that the effect of Brownian motion and noise terms on the transmission of the epidemic is very high. If the noise is large the infection may decrease or vanish. For validation of our obtained scheme, the results for all the classes of the problem have been numerically simulated.","Khan, Amir; Ikram, Rukhsar; Din, Anwarud; Humphries, Usa Wannasingha; Akgul, Ali",Results Phys,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721008354?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721008354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580624/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104775,390
638396,Allocating scarce intensive care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic: practical challenges to theoretical frameworks,2021-01-12,"Should a government repay its international debts even if this imposes severe hardships on its citizens? Drawing on moral psychology, we investigate when people think a government is morally obligated to pay its debts. Participants read about a government that has to decide whether to default on its debt payments or cut vital programs. Across conditions, we varied the number of jobs at stake and whether a full or partial default is required to save them. Overall, most participants judged that a government should pay its debt even when the damage to the debtor is greater than the benefit to the lender. As the damage to the debtor became extreme, participants increasingly said the government should default, but they still judged that defaulting is morally wrong. In Experiment 2, we find in a national sample of Americans that political conservatives were more opposed to default than liberals. We discuss implications for policy, public opinion, and public welfare during economic downturns.

638987,106 Learning from the Long Term Experiences of Patients Recovering from COVID-19: Utilizing a Novel Approach to a Transition of Care Curriculum to Benefit Students and Patients,2021-08-31,"TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Sinus pause/arrest most commonly occurs in medication toxicity, cardiac ischemia, infiltrative or fibrotic disease of SA node, structural heart disease, PE, sleep apnea, electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalemia), Lyme disease. We present to you a case of sinus pause/arrest in a patient with COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient is a 59 year male who presented to hospital with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. Past medical history was significant for recent COVID-19 infection one week ago. Vital signs and physical examination on presentation were normal. Initial workup including CBC, INR, PTT, CMP, troponin and EKG were normal. Chest x-ray was remarkable for reticular nodular infiltrate in the right perihilar lung field. Patient was started on IV antibiotic for suspected pneumonia. On day 1, patient started experiencing skipped heartbeats. Cardiac telemetry demonstrated multiple sinus pauses with greatest pause duration of about 5 seconds. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST/T wave changes, Recent transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Upon literature review, it was noted that there were cases of severe COVID-19 infection affecting the electrical system of the heart, resulting in sinus pauses. Hence, after ruling out some of the common differential diagnosis for sinus pauses including medications, ischemia, inflammatory, infiltrative or fibrotic disease of the SA node, structural heart disease, PE, OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), electrolyte disturbance (especially hyperkalemia), Lyme disease, patient's sinus pauses were attributed to underlying COVID-19 infection. Patient was discharged with 30 days cardiac event monitor which showed sinus rhythm with no significant pauses. DISCUSSION: SA nodal dysfunction typically results from either abnormality in impulse generation by the P cells or abnormalities in conduction across perinodal transitional (T cells). Hypoxemia, cytokine storm, direct viral infiltration, myocardial inflammation are thought to be responsible for sinus pause in COVID-19 disease, although exact mechanism is not known. Patients are symptomatic when longer episodes of sinus arrest occur resulting in dizziness, syncope, and death. Asymptomatic patients with SA nodal pauses or arrest often do not require treatment. Symptomatic patients are treated with a permanent pacemaker placement. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to severe COVID-19 infection could be an uncommon cause of sinus pauses. However, before attributing COVID-19 as a cause of sinus pauses, common differential diagnosis for sinus pauses including medications toxicity (digoxin, antiarrhythmics-procainamide, quinidine), cardiac ischemia, infiltrative or fibrotic disease of SA node, structural heart disease, PE, sleep apnea, electrolyte disturbance and Lyme disease should be ruled out.

639694,A report on the development of COVID-19 guidelines for rehabilitation professionals in African settings,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Digital contact tracing apps have the potential to augment contact tracing systems and disrupt COVID-19 transmission by rapidly identifying secondary cases prior to the onset of infectiousness and linking them into a system of quarantine, testing, and health care worker case management. The international experience of digital contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates how challenging their design and deployment are. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to derive and summarize best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app. METHODS: A collaborative cross-disciplinary approach was used to derive best practice guidance for designing the ideal digital contact tracing app. A search of the indexed and gray literature was conducted to identify articles describing or evaluating digital contact tracing apps. MEDLINE was searched using a combination of free-text terms and Medical Subject Headings search terms. Gray literature sources searched were the World Health Organization Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publications library, and Google, including the websites of many health protection authorities. Articles that were acceptable for inclusion in this evidence synthesis were peer-reviewed publications, cohort studies, randomized trials, modeling studies, technical reports, white papers, and media reports related to digital contact tracing. RESULTS: Ethical, user experience, privacy and data protection, technical, clinical and societal, and evaluation considerations were identified from the literature. The ideal digital contact tracing app should be voluntary and should be equitably available and accessible. User engagement could be enhanced by small financial incentives, enabling users to tailor aspects of the app to their particular needs and integrating digital contact tracing apps into the wider public health information campaign. Adherence to the principles of good data protection and privacy by design is important to convince target populations to download and use digital contact tracing apps. Bluetooth Low Energy is recommended for a digital contact tracing app's contact event detection, but combining it with ultrasound technology may improve a digital contact tracing app's accuracy. A decentralized privacy-preserving protocol should be followed to enable digital contact tracing app users to exchange and record temporary contact numbers during contact events. The ideal digital contact tracing app should define and risk-stratify contact events according to proximity, duration of contact, and the infectiousness of the case at the time of contact. Evaluating digital contact tracing apps requires data to quantify app downloads, use among COVID-19 cases, successful contact alert generation, contact alert receivers, contact alert receivers that adhere to quarantine and testing recommendations, and the number of contact alert receivers who subsequently are tested positive for COVID-19. The outcomes of digital contact tracing apps' evaluations should be openly reported to allow for the wider public to review the evaluation of the app. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, key considerations and best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app were derived from the literature.","O'Connell, James; Abbas, Manzar; Beecham, Sarah; Buckley, Jim; Chochlov, Muslim; Fitzgerald, Brian; Glynn, Liam; Johnson, Kevin; Laffey, John; McNicholas, Bairbre; Nuseibeh, Bashar; O'Callaghan, Michael; O'Keeffe, Ian; Razzaq, Abdul; Rekanar, Kaavya; Richardson, Ita; Simpkin, Andrew; Storni, Cristiano; Tsvyatkova, Damyanka; Walsh, Jane; Welsh, Thomas; O'Keeffe, Derek",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/27753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003764/,390

639931,Preface: Primary Care during COVID-19 and Beyond,2021-02-15,"The development of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens at an alarming rate has created a great health concern worldwide. Nanotechnology today provides hope as an alternative to antibiotics, in the field of antimicrobial therapy. The diverse structures and small size make the nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unique and remarkable properties, drastically different from its bulk counterparts. Various microorganisms such as actinomycetes, algae, yeast, fungi, and bacteria synthesize inorganic nanoparticles enzymatically, either extracellularly or intracellularly. Various metallic NPs, for example, magnesium, titanium, copper, silver, and gold, are well reported for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. The antimicrobial properties of these NPs may be attributed to its ability to disorganize membrane structure, form pores in the bacterial cell wall, inhibit or disruption biofilm, etc. Most metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO-NPs, exhibit bactericidal properties by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, other NPs like MgO-NPs are effective due to their peculiar physical structure. Nanoparticles can also be fabricated with various bioactive entities. Due to their small and controllable size, functionalized nanoparticles can deliver drugs precisely and safely to the target sites. Thus, microbial mediated production of nanoparticles is gaining substantial interest as a potential solution to the growing need for the development of eco-friendly ways to fight microbial resistance and control diseases.","Busi, Siddhardha; Rajkumari, Jobina",Nanoparticles in Pharmacotherapy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128165041000089; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128165041000089,390

Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. Setting: Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service. Participants: 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results: 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population. We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much is due to disruption to healthcare services, in order to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.","Peach, E.

The functional unit of M(pro) is a homodimer and each subunit contains a His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad. Large amounts of biochemical and structural information are available on M(pro); nevertheless, the mechanism by which monomeric M(pro) is converted into a dimer during maturation still remains poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that a C‐terminal residue, Arg298, interacts with Ser123 of the other monomer in the dimer, and mutation of Arg298 results in a monomeric structure with a collapsed substrate‐binding pocket. Interestingly, the R298A mutant of M(pro) shows a reversible substrate‐induced dimerization that is essential for catalysis. Here, the conformational change that occurs during substrate‐induced dimerization is delineated by X‐ray crystallography. A dimer with a mutual orientation of the monomers that differs from that of the wild‐type protease is present in the asymmetric unit. The presence of a complete substrate‐binding pocket and oxyanion hole in both protomers suggests that they are both catalytically active, while the two domain IIIs show minor reorganization. This structural information offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanism associated with substrate‐induced dimerization and has important implications with respect to the maturation of the enzyme.","Wu, Cheng‐Guo; Cheng, Shu‐Chun; Chen, Shiang‐Chuan; Li, Juo‐Yan; Fang, Yi‐Hsuan; Chen, Yau‐Hung; Chou, Chi‐Yuan",Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444913001315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23633583/,390

Despite the availability of empirically supported psychotherapies, many Veterans remain symptomatic after treatment and/or prefer to seek complementary and integrative health approaches, including yoga, to manage PTSD. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) described herein will evaluate the efficacy of a manualized yoga program as compared to nonaerobic exercise in reducing PTSD severity among Veterans. A secondary aim of this study is to better understand the mechanisms of change. METHODS: Veterans (N = 192) with PTSD will be randomized to hatha yoga or nonaerobic physical activity control; both groups consist of 12 weekly, 60-min group or online training sessions with 15–20 min of daily at-home practice. Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 12-week follow-up. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: This study will evaluate changes in PTSD severity (primary outcome) as well as depression, anxiety, anger, sleep problems, and psychosocial disability (secondary outcomes). We will also use multiple mediation to examine two potential models of the mechanisms of clinical effect: the Attention Model (i.e., yoga increases attentional control, which reduces PTSD symptoms), the Coping Model (i.e., yoga increases distress tolerance, which improves coping, which reduces PTSD symptoms), and the combination of these models. This aspect of the study is innovative and important given the absence of an existing, comprehensive model for understanding yoga's impact on PTSD. Ultimately, we hope to develop guidelines for application of yoga to PTSD recovery.","Lang, Ariel J.; Malaktaris, Anne; Maluf, Katrina S.; Kangas, Julie; Sindel, Selin; Herbert, Matthew; Bomyea, Jessica; Simmons, Alan N.; Weaver, Judy; Velez, Deborah; Liu, Lin",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604485/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100719,390

METHODS: Weekly national survey of paediatricians with an open‐ended questionnaire. RESULTS: During the 6‐week study survey period, the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit received 33 reports about 55 instances where paediatricians believed care may have been compromised, about half (56%) relating to infants aged from birth to 6 weeks. Compromised care was for acute presentations in 75%, acute complications of a chronic illness in 14%, with 11% for chronic conditions. Paediatricians reported the outcome as moderately severe (short‐term morbidity, increased length of stay, higher level of care) in 38 cases (69%) and in a further 4 (7%) as severe (potential to be life‐threatening or result in permanent disability). CONCLUSION: Despite clear messaging, hospital avoidance and reduced access to primary and secondary care were associated with significant potential harm for children in New Zealand during a strict lockdown, with newborn infants disproportionately affected. During the implementation of interventions to eliminate community transmission of COVID‐19, New Zealand paediatricians note the importance of face‐to‐face post‐natal visits for newborns and primary care services for children with acute illness, to avoid preventable harm.","Duncanson, Mavis; Wheeler, Benjamin J; Jelleyman, Timothy; Dalziel, Stuart R; McIntyre, Peter",J Paediatr Child Health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003540/,390

In the month of April of the year 2020, it has certainly taken the pandemic outbreak of approximately 11,16,643 infections confirmed leading to around 59,170 deaths have been recorded world-over. This article studies multiple countries-based pandemic spread for the development of the COVID-19 originated in the China. This paper focuses on forecasting via real-time responses data to inherit an idea about the increase and maximum number of virus-infected cases for the various regions. In addition, it will help to understand the panic that surrounds this nCoV-19 for some intensely affecting states possessing different important demographic characteristics that would be affecting the disease characteristics. This study aims at developing soft-computing hybrid models for calculating the transmissibility of this genome viral. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. A hybrid of wavelet decomposed data into approximations and details then trained & tested through neuronal-fuzzification approach. Wavelet-based forecasting model predicts for shorter time span such as five to ten days advanced number of confirmed, death and recovered cases of China, India and USA. While data-based prediction through interpolation applied through moving average predicts for longer time spans such as 50-60 days ahead with lesser accuracy as compared to that of wavelet-based hybrids. Based on the simulations, the significance level (alpha) ranges from 0.10 to 0.67, MASE varying from 0.06 to 5.76, sMAPE ranges from 0.15 to 1.97, MAE varies from 22.59 to 6024.76, RMSE shows a variation from 3.18 to 8360.29 & R(2) varying through 0.0018 to 0.7149. MASE and sMAPE are relatively lesser applied and novel measures that aimed to achieve increase in accuracy. They eliminated skewness and made the model outlier-free. Estimates of the awaited outburst for regions in this study are India, China and the USA that will help in the improvement of apportionment of healthcare facilities as it can act as an early-warning system for government policy-makers.

Although the coronavirus (CoV) S glycoproteins share membership in this class of envelope glycoproteins, cleavage to generate the respective S1 and S2 subunits appears absent in a subset of CoV species, including that responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein might be important for the newly emerged SARS-CoV, we introduced a furin recognition site at single basic residues within the putative S1–S2 junctional region. We show that furin cleavage at the modified R667 position generates discrete S1 and S2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. This effect on the cell–cell fusion activity by the S glycoprotein is not, however, reflected in the infectivity of pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the cleaved glycoprotein. The lack of effect of furin cleavage on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry.","Follis, Kathryn E.; York, Joanne; Nunberg, Jack H.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206000900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16519916/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206000900,390

For unclear reasons, viral reactivation can cause acute myocarditis, a leading cause of sudden death in the young. Influenza A/H1N1(2009) virus (IAV/H1N1) is known for causing flu/pneumonia, but the heart is rarely involved. Co-infections of cardiotropic viruses are rarely reported and the mechanisms of viral interactions remain unknown. A 5-year old girl had a flu-like syndrome, when she suddenly presented with a respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. At autopsy, the lungs were found haemorrhagic. Lungs’ histology showed severe bronchiolitis, diffuse haemorrhagic necrosis, and mononuclear inflammation. In the heart, a moderate inflammation was found with no necrosis. IAV/H1N1 was detected in nasal and tracheal swabs, lungs, and the heart. The viral load was high in the lungs, but low in the heart. PVB19 was detected in the heart with a high viral load. Viral co-infection increases the risk of severe outcome but the mechanisms of interaction between viruses are poorly understood. In our case, viral loads suggested a reactivated PVB19-induced acute myocarditis during an IAV/H1N1 pneumonia. Viral interactions may involve an IAV/H1N1-induced cytokine storm, with a fulminant fatal outcome.

This study examined whether the separation of public health workers and general practitioners could affect the influenza vaccine uptake and recommendation behaviors among HCWs in China. A survey was conducted from August to October 2019, and HCWs from 10 provinces in China were recruited. A self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was used to assess HCWs’ demographic information, knowledge, and attitudes toward influenza vaccination, as well as vaccine uptake and recommendation behaviors. The primary outcome was HCWs’ vaccination and recommendation status of seasonal influenza vaccine. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the influence factors of influenza vaccine uptake and recommendation among HCWs. Of the 1159 HCWs in this study, 25.3% were vaccinated against influenza in the previous season. “No need to get vaccinated” was the primary reason for both unvaccinated public health workers and general practitioners. Multivariate logistic regression showed that public health workers were more likely to get vaccinated against influenza (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.59–3.05) and recommend influenza vaccination to children (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.57–2.80) and the elderly (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.26–2.25) than general practitioners. Besides, the knowledge and perceived risk of influenza can give rise to HCWs’ vaccination and recommendation behaviors, and HCWs who got vaccinated in the past year were more likely to recommend it to children and the elderly in their work. The influenza vaccine coverage and recommendation among HCWs are still relatively low in China, especially for general practitioners. Further efforts are needed to improve the knowledge and attitudes toward influenza and influenza vaccination among HCWs, and coherent training on immunization for both public health workers and general practitioners might be effective in the face of separated public health and clinical services in China.","Rong, Hongguo; Lai, Xiaozhen; Ma, Xiaochen; Hou, Zhiyuan; Li, Shunping; Jing, Rize; Zhang, Haijun; Peng, Zhibin; Feng, Luzhao; Fang, Hai",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486350/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020265,390

CHOICE OF SOLUTION: Pilot the Unannounced Standardized Patient methodology, which employs an actor trained to present as a standardized, incognito potentially infected patient, to assess clinical readiness for potential COVID-19 patients at an urban, community safety-net clinic. IMPLEMENTATION: The Unannounced Standardized Patient was trained to present at each team’s front desk with the complaint of feeling unwell (reporting a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 24 hours) and exposure to a roommate recently returned from Beijing. The Unannounced Standardized Patient was trained to complete a behaviorally-anchored assessment of the care she received from the clinical system. EVALUATION: There was clear variation in care Unannounced Standardized Patients received; some frontline clerical staff followed best practices; others did not. Signage and information on disease spread prevention publicly available was inconsistent. Qualitative comments shared by the Unannounced Standardized Patients and those gathered during group debrief reinforced the experiences of the Unannounced Standardized Patients and hospital leadership. LESSONS LEARNED: Unannounced Standardized Patients revealed significant variation in care practices within a clinical system. Utilization of this assessment methodology can provide just-in-time clinical information about readiness and safety practices, particularly during emerging outbreaks. Unannounced Standardized Patients will prove especially powerful as clinicians and systems return to outpatient visits while remaining vigilant about potentially infected individuals.","Fisher, Harriet; Re, Cherilyn; Wilhite, Jeffery; Hanley, Kathleen; Altshuler, Lisa; Schmidtburger, James; Gagliardi, Morris; Zabar, Sondra",Int J Qual Health Care,https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991675/,390

METHODS: A non‐experimental, cross‐sectional study was conducted targeting dental hygiene professionals in Saudi Arabia. The online survey consisted of 31 close‐ended questions: 9‐items related to demographics, and 22‐items that are COVID‐19 related. Data were tested at two levels; descriptive and preliminary using Chi‐square test, and significance was set at the 0.05 level. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty‐one responses were received and the final sample included one hundred and eighteen responses as it excluded unemployed dental hygienists with estimated 39.6% response rate. The stress level to return to practice was considered moderate among 65.3% of participants. Over two‐thirds (73.7%) of dental hygienists were not providing any kind of care/treatment during quarantine. Generally, a moderate level of knowledge (57.8%) was demonstrated by participants. For preparedness level to practice during the pandemic, sixty‐four dental hygienists (54.2%) were adequately prepared to provide care. Significant correlations were found between impact and knowledge (p = 0.045), impact and preparedness (p = 0.053), and knowledge and preparedness (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of COVID‐19 protocols, guidelines and scientific literature increased the respondents’ level of knowledge and preparedness to an adequate level. This study indicated that knowledgeable dental hygienists were significantly more prepared to treat patients during the pandemic and that stress positively influenced the COVID‐19 knowledge acquisition.

OBJECTIVES: To explore experiences of eczema, self‐management, and accessing healthcare and advice during the COVID‐19 pandemic among young people with eczema and parents/carers of children with eczema. METHODS: Qualitative semi‐structured interviews were carried out with 36 participants recruited from general practices as part of randomised controlled trials of online eczema resources. RESULTS: Changes to everyday life—Periods of staying at home due to the pandemic alter the burden of eczema, with reports of an improved routine and application of topical treatments for many, but difficulties with handwashing for others. Parents/carers reported improved eczema control due to closures of educational settings. Young people reported higher stress that may have triggered eczema flare‐ups. Changes to access to advice and treatment—There was a reluctance to seek medical appointments in a non‐emergency situation. Participants reported a lack of trust in the outcome of telephone consultations because health professionals were unable to see or feel the skin. Delays or difficulties when obtaining appointments and treatments caused frustration. Access to an online eczema resource was reported to have extra value in the context of the pandemic.

It supports continuous deployment principles; however, it is missing an option to monitor and control the experiment in real-time, which is required for experiment execution under comparable conditions. The paper describes the implementation of the experiment control and monitoring system (EC and MS) as the upgrade of the LOG-a-TEC testbed. EC and MS is implemented within existing infrastructure management and built systems as a new service. The EC and MS is accessible as a new tab in sensor management system portal. It supports several commands, including start, stop and restart application, exit the experiment, flash or reset the target device, and displays the real-time status of the experiment application. When nodes apply Contiki-NG as their operating system, the Contiki-NG shell tool is accessible with the help of the newly developed tool, giving further experiment execution control capabilities to the user. By using the ZeroMQ concurrency framework as a message exchange system, information can be asynchronously sent to one or many devices at the same time, providing a real-time data exchange mechanism. The proposed upgrade does not disrupt any continuous deployment functionality and enables remote control and monitoring of the experiment. To evaluate the EC and MS functionality, two experiments were conducted: the first demonstrated the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localization, while the second analysed interference avoidance in the 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) wireless technology for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).","Morano, Grega; Hrovat, Andrej; Vučnik, Matevž; Puhan, Janez; Gardašević, Gordana; Vasiljević, Dragan; Javornik, Tomaž",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640742/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196422,390

Previously, immunological studies in MS had almost exclusively used the more abundant 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP, which does not does not contain the exon 2 peptide. Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have also focussed on the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform and its peptides. Since EAE is an animal model widely used widly used to study MS, we examined the encephalitogenic potential of exon 2 peptide in the SJL/J mouse. Evidence for increased expression of exon 2-containing isoforms during remyelination in mouse CNS suggested that exon 2-sensitized T cels, with encephalitogenic capacity, might be important in the pertuation of relapsing EAE (rEAE). Our experiments have demonstrated that exon 2 peptide is inherently immunogenic in SJL mice and that EAE could be induced by the adoptive transfer of exon 2-sensitized lymphocytes. Furthermore, the disease could be accentuated by the transfer of short-term exon 2-reactive lines or by a combination of adoptive transfer and antigenic challenge with exon 2 peptide. The immunodominant epitope(s) appeared to localize to the segment bordered by amino acids 59–85.","Segal, Benjamin M.; Raine, Cedric S.; McFarlin, Dale E.; Voskuhl, Rhonda R.; McFarland, Henry F.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7512579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572894901236; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572894901236,390

Influenza A virus, due to its segmented RNA genome, is highly subject to mutation, resulting in rapid formation of variants. During influenza infection, viral proteins interact with host proteins and exploit a variety of cellular pathways for their own benefit. Influenza virus inhibits the synthesis of these cellular proteins and facilitates expression of its own proteins for viral transcription and replication. Infected cell pathways are hijacked by an array of intracellular signaling cascades such as NF-κB signaling, PI3K/Akt pathway, MAPK pathway, PKC/PKR signaling and TLR/RIG-I signaling cascades. This review presents a research update on the subject and discusses the impact of influenza viral infection on these cell signaling pathways.","Gaur, Pratibha; Munjal, Ashok; Lal, Sunil K.",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21629204/,390

A combined approach merging the conventional and computational tools was used for investigating the risk of exposure to toxic elements. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to calculate risks associated with twenty elements. We attempted different probability distribution functions for concentrations because the actual distribution functions are not known, and the only data available are the mean value and standard deviation of concentrations obtained from experiment. Our results indicate that the total non-carcinogenic health risk through exposure to different elements (Hazardous Index, HI) does not strongly depend on the choice of the probability distribution function for the concentrations. We also show that taking into account probability distributions of other variables and parameters such as body weight, exposed skin area, skin adhesion, etc. does not significantly change the main result rather just slightly broadening the final Hazardous Index distribution function. We found that calculated HI is well below unity for all considered samples, i.e., the dermal exposure to toxic elements in the considered facial powders is negligible and the considered face foundation powders are quite safe to use.","Shomar, Basem; Rashkeev, Sergey N.",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311713?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120311713; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038363/,390

We aimed to investigate the WM and myelin alterations in patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with SyMRI. METHODS: Adult patients with isolated unilateral HS and age-matched control subjects (CSs) were included in this study. The SyMRI sequence QRAPMASTER in the coronal plane perpendicular to the hippocampi was obtained from the whole brain. Automatic segmentation of the whole brain was processed by SyMRI Diagnostic software (Version 11.2). Two neuroradiologists also performed quantitative analyses independently from symmetrical 14 ROIs placed in temporal and extratemporal WM, hippocampi, and amygdalae in both hemispheres. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (F/M = 6/10, mean age = 32.5 ± 11.3 years; right/left HS: 8/8) and 10 CSs (F/M = 5/5, mean age = 30.7 ± 7 years) were included. Left HS patients had significantly lower myelin and WM volumes than CSs (p < .05). Myelin was reduced significantly in the ipsilateral temporal lobe of patients than CSs, greater in left HS (p < .05). Histopathological examination including luxol fast blue stain also revealed myelin pallor in all of 6 patients who were operated. Ipsilateral temporal pole and sub-insular WM had significantly reduced myelin than the corresponding contralateral regions in patients (p < .05). No significant difference was found in WM values. GM values were significantly lower in hippocampi in patients than CSs (p < .05). CONCLUSION: SyMRI revealed myelin reduction in the ipsilateral temporal lobe and sub-insular WM of patients with HS. Whether this finding correlates with electrophysiological features and SyMRI could serve as lateralization of temporal lobe epilepsy need to be investigated.

655073,LTB4-Driven Inflammation and Increased Expression of ALOX5/ACE2 During Severe COVID-19 in Individuals With Diabetes.,2021-06-15,"We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site. The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8. The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site.","Cheng, Mary Hongying; Porritt, Rebecca A.; Rivas, Magali Noval; Krieger, James M; Ozdemir, Asli Beyza; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Fries, Bettina C.; Arditi, Moshe; Bahar, Ivet",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.395079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269352/,390

A big dilemma,2021-06-05,"Most of the reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children reported mild-to-moderate disease manifestations. However, recent reports explored a rare pediatric multisystem syndrome possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The study prospectively enrolled 5 patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Their clinical presentation, laboratory, and outcome were described. All patients shared similar clinical presentations such as persistent documented fever for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, and ferritin). Three patients had concurrent positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and the other 2 patients had contact with suspected COVID-19 positive patients. They were all managed in the PICU and received intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroid, and hydroxychloroquine. The hospital stays ranged between 3 and 21 days. One patient died due to severe multiorgan failures and shock, and the other 4 patients were discharged with good conditions. Pediatric patients with SARS–CoV-2 are at risk for MIS-C. MIS-C has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory presentations, and the clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and should initiate its early treatment to avoid unfavorable outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies will be required to explore any sequelae of MIS-C, precisely the cardiovascular complications.","Asseri, Ali A.; AlHelali, Ibrahim; Elbastawisi, Emad; Ali, Abdelwahid S.; Al-Qahtani, Saleh M.; Shati, Ayed A.; Awadalla, Nabil J.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087834/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025919,390

657529,Comment prendre le pas sur le coronavirus dans un pays en développement: questions et actions au Burkina Faso,2020-05-15,"Background Reported mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies substantially, particularly in critically ill patients. So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied. Methods This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. Results Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age >=65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","Rieg, Siegbert; Cube, Maja von; Kalbhenn, Johannes; Utzolino, Stefan; Pernice, Katharina; Bechet, Lena; Baur, Johanna; Lang, Corinna N; Wagner, Dirk; Wolkewitz, Martin; Kern, Winfried V; Biever, Paul",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160127; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.20160127v1?rss=1,390
657725,Fasting Blood Glucose and COVID-19 Severity: Nonlinearity Matters,2020-10-13,"Worldwide population ageing is partly due to advanced standard of care, leading to increased incidence and prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as frailty and disability. Hence, the age at the onset of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) keeps growing as well. Moreover, ageing is a risk factor for both frailty and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Frailty and CVD in the elderly share pathophysiological mechanisms and associated conditions, such as malnutrition, sarcopenia, anemia, polypharmacy and both increased bleeding/thrombotic risk, leading to a negative impact on outcomes. In geriatric populations ACS is associated with an increased frailty degree that has a negative effect on re-hospitalization and mortality outcomes. Frail elderly patients are increasingly referred to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs after ACS; however, plans of care must be tailored on individual’s clinical complexity in terms of functional capacity, nutritional status and comorbidities, cognitive status, socio-economic support. Completing rehabilitative intervention with a reduced frailty degree, disability prevention, improvement in functional state and quality of life and reduction of re-hospitalization are the goals of CR program. Tools for detecting frailty and guidelines for management of frail elderly patients post-ACS are still debated. This review focused on the need of an early identification of frail patients in elderly with ACS and at elaborating personalized plans of care and secondary prevention in CR setting.","Giallauria, Francesco; Di Lorenzo, Anna; Venturini, Elio; Pacileo, Mario; D’Andrea, Antonello; Garofalo, Umberto; De Lucia, Felice; Testa, Crescenzo; Cuomo, Gianluigi; Iannuzzo, Gabriella; Gentile, Marco; Nugara, Cinzia; Sarullo, Filippo M; Marinus, Nastasia; Hansen, Dominique; Vigorito, Carlo",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920796/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10081696,390

Design Prospective Cohort study Setting Public University Hospital (Madrid) Participants and methods 375 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection, admitted to a Public University Hospital (Madrid) between March 1 and March 31, 2020, were included in the Prospective Cohort study. Death was the main outcome. The main variable was disability in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Barthel index. Covariates included sex, age, severity index (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, qSOFA), polypharmacy (>5 drugs in the month before admission), and comorbidity (≥3 diseases). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. Estimated model coefficients served to calculate the expected probability of death for a selected combination of five variables: Barthel, sex, age, comorbidities and severity index (qSOFA). Results Mean age was 66 years (SD 15.33), 207 (55%) males. 74 patients died (19.8%). Mortality was associated to low Barthel index (OR per 5-point decrease 1.11; 95CI 1.03-1.20), male sex (0.23, 0.11-0.47), age (1.07, 1.03-1.10) and comorbidity (2.15; 1.08-4.30) but not to qSOFA (1.29, 0.87-1.93) or polypharmacy (1.54; 0.77-3.08).

658399,Emergency medical services education research priorities during COVID‐19: A modified Delphi study,2021-08-21,"Aspirin is the oldest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and it sometimes causes asthma-like symptoms known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which can be serious. Unwanted effects of aspirin (aspirin intolerance) are also observed in patients with food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, a type I allergy disease, and aspirin-induced urticaria (AIU). However the target and the mechanism of the aspirin intolerance are still unknown. There is no animal or cellular model of AERD, because its pathophysiological mechanism is still unknown, but it is thought that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by causative agents leads to an increase of free arachidonic acid, which is metabolized into cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) that provoke airway smooth muscle constriction and asthma symptoms. As the bed-to-bench approach, to confirm the clinical discussion in experimental cellular models, we have tried to develop a cellular model of AERD using activated RBL-2H3 cells, a rat mast cell like cell line. Indomethacin (another NSAID and also causes AERD), enhances in vitro cysLTs production by RBL-2H3 cells, while there is no induction of cysLTs production in the absence of inflammatory activation. Since this suggests that all inflammatory cells with activation of prostaglandin and cysLT metabolism should respond to NSAIDs, and then I have concluded that aspirin intolerance should be separated from subsequent bronchoconstriction. Evidence about the cellular mechanisms of NSAIDs may be employed for development of in vitro AERD models as the approach from bench-to-bed.","Yamashita, Masamichi",Curr Drug Targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27719658/,390

A key part of this strategy is to counter the anti-vaccination movement that is already promoting hesitancy and resistance. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a tsunami of misinformation and conspiracy theories that have the potential to reduce vaccine uptake. To make matters worse, sections of populations in many countries display low trust in governments and official information about the pandemic and how the officials are tackling it. This paper aims to set out in short form critical guidelines that governments and regional bodies should take to enhance the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination strategy.

A sample of 3,341 college students participated in this study and completed questionnaires regarding positive information of COVID-19, risk perception, intolerance of uncertainty, and anxiety. The results indicated that positive information of COVID-19 was significantly and negatively associated with anxiety and that risk perception partially mediated this relationship. Intolerance of uncertainty further moderated the relationship between positive information of COVID-19 and risk perception. Specifically, the relationship between positive information of COVID-19 and risk perception was significant for college students with low intolerance of uncertainty, while it became weaker for those with high intolerance of uncertainty.","Zhao, Jun; Ye, Baojuan; Ma, Tingting",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413803/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.715929,390

Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures derived from dissociated retinal organoids were generated. To validate the potential entry of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the retina, we showed that hiPSC-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures endogenously express ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) on the mRNA level. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in retinal organoids and monolayer cultures. Furthermore, using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus spike protein with GFP expression system, we found that retinal organoids and monolayer cultures can potentially be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

Specifically, this review seeks to answer: Why is HC aide OSH important? What are the most significant OSH challenges? How can improving HC aide OSH also improve the safety and health of their clients? What implications do the findings have for future research? RECENT FINDINGS: HC is one of the fastest growing US industries. Aides comprise its largest workforce and are increasingly needed to care for the rapidly aging population. There is an aide shortage due in part to instabilities in HC work organization and to serious job-specific hazards, resulting in aides losing work time. Recent social, economic, and technological factors are rapidly changing the nature of HC work, creating OSH hazards similar to those found in nursing homes. At the same time, aides are experiencing social and economic inequities that increase their vulnerability to OSH hazards. These hazards are also a burden on employers who are challenged to recruit, retain, and train aides. OSH injuries and illness interrupt the continuity of care delivery to clients. Many OSH hazards also put HC clients and families at risk. SUMMARY: A new framework and methodologies are needed to assess aide and client safety together in order to guide future HC research, policies, and practices. Government, industry, and labor commitment is needed to fund and coordinate a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program.","Quinn, M. M.; Markkanen, P. K.; Galligan, C. J.; Sama, S.

661262,COVID‐19 in a country with a very high prevalence of diabetes: The impact of admission hyperglycaemia on mortality,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the primary cause of the common cold and are a major trigger for exacerbations of lower airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Although human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) are the natural host for HRV infections, much of our understanding of how HRV replicates and induces host antiviral responses is based on studies using non-airway cell lines (e.g. HeLa cells). The current study examines the replication cycle of HRV, and host cell responses, in highly differentiated cultures of HBE. METHODS: Highly differentiated cultures of HBE were exposed to initial infectious doses ranging from 10(4) to 10(1) 50% tissue culture-infective dose (TCID(50)) of purified HRV-16, and responses were monitored up to 144 h after infection. Viral genomic RNA and negative strand RNA template levels were monitored, along with levels of type I and II interferons and selected antivirals. RESULTS: Regardless of initial infectious dose, relatively constant levels of both genomic and negative strand RNA are generated during replication, with negative strand copy numbers being10,000-fold lower than those of genomic strands. Infections were limited to a small percentage of ciliated cells and did not result in any overt signs of epithelial death. Importantly, regardless of infectious dose, HRV-16 infections were cleared by HBE in the absence of immune cells. Levels of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) varied with initial infectious dose, implying that factors other than levels of double-stranded RNA regulate IFN induction, but the time-course of HRV-16 clearance HBE was the same regardless of levels of IFNs produced. Patterns of antiviral viperin and ISG15 expression suggest they may be generated in an IFN-independent manner during HRV-16 infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge a number of aspects of dogma generated from studies in HeLa cells and emphasize the importance of appropriate cell context when studying HRV infections.","Warner, Stephanie M.; Wiehler, Shahina; Michi, Aubrey N.; Proud, David",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299975/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1120-0,390

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM(2.5), NO(x) and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time–activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.","Ferguson, Lauren; Taylor, Jonathon; Zhou, Ke; Shrubsole, Clive; Symonds, Phil; Davies, Mike; Dimitroulopoulou, Sani",Build Cities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124667/; https://doi.org/10.5334/bc.100,390

RESULTS: In the first 4 months of Israel’s COVID-19 outbreak, just 2060 cases were confirmed in the Arab population, comprising 8.8% of the 23,345 confirmed cases, or 2.38 times less than would be expected relative to the population size. In contrast, the ultra-Orthodox made up 30.1% of confirmed cases yet just 10.1% of the population. Confirmed case rate per 100,000 was twice as high in the general Jewish population compared to the Arab population. The Arab mortality rate was 0.57 per 100,000, compared to 3.37 in the overall population, and to 7.26 in the ultra-Orthodox community. We discuss possible reasons for this low morbidity and mortality including less use of nursing homes, and effective leadership which led to early closure of mosques and high adherence to social distancing measures, even during the month of Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a disproportionate burden of underlying illness, the Arab population did not fulfil initial predictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and maintained low numbers of infections and deaths. This contrasts with reports of increased mortality in ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged populations in other countries, and with high rates of infection in the ultra-Orthodox sector in Israel. Effective leadership and cooperation between individuals and institutions, particularly engagement of community and religious leaders, can reduce a group’s vulnerability and build resilience in an emergency situation such as the current pandemic.","Saban, Mor; Myers, Vicki; Wilf-Miron, Rachel",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907581/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01257-6,390

Global awareness on snakebite was increasing steadily up to 2020, and an increasing number of countries began to acknowledge the issue, when coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to have an unprecedented impact on societies and health systems. To better understand how snakebite incidents, prevention and care are being affected during this global emergency, we collected perspectives of snakebite community- and health system stakeholders in a qualitative key-informant study. An open-ended survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather information on changes in snakebite occurrence and circumstances, community responses, access to care and health outcomes in LMICs since the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty-three informants from 21 countries participated in the study. Based on informants' experiences, in spite of COVID-19 lockdowns, exposure to snakes did not change in many rural agrarian communities, where incidences are usually highest. However, we did find several access to care issues relating to avoidance of formal care, transport barriers, overburdened healthcare systems and -providers, and antivenom manufacturing and supply disruptions, which were unique per context. On a brighter note, ventilator availability had increased in several countries, although not automatically benefitting snakebite patients directly. In conclusion, we found apparent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on snakebite prevention and care, although its severity was highly context- and time-dependent. Interactions between the pandemic effects and snakebite incidents most severely impact remote rural communities, showing the need to invest in community-based prevention and care.","van Oirschot, Janneke; Ooms, Gaby I.; Waldmann, Benjamin; Kadam, Priyanka",Toxicon X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386765/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590171021000114; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590171021000114; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxcx.2021.100075,390

Recently, a homologue of ACE, ACE(2) has been discovered. Both ACE and ACE(2) are emerging as key enzymes of the RAS, where ACE(2) may play a role as negative regulator of ACE. Moreover, ACE(2) appears to be an important enzyme outside the classical RAS, as it hydrolyzes apelins, dynorphin A 1-13, des-Arg-bradykinin and other peptide substrates. The precise interplay between tissue ACE, ACE(2), and their substrates and by-products are presently still unclear. ACE-inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation, but do not inhibit ACE(2) activity. Moreover, ACE-inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue ACE, and it has been suggested that tissue ACE affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial properties of these drugs. ACE-inhibitors also increase nitric oxide availability, and activate several kinases that may regulate protein synthesis by interacting with the nucleus of the cells (outside-in signaling). The outside-in signaling may also be activated by bradykinin itself. Although, the precise significance of the outside-in signaling is still unclear, this new role of ACE-inhibitors may represent a discriminant factor versus angiotensin II receptors antagonists. This mini review will summarize some new aspects concerning the recently discovered biological functions of RAS and in particular of ACE, ACE(2) and ACE-inhibitors in cardiovascular system.","Pagliaro, Pasquale; Penna, Claudia",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15883759/,390

This is the weakest point in biological agent detection capability today. There is intense research for new molecular detection technologies that could be used for very accurate detection of pathogens that would be a concern to first responders. These include the need for sensors for multiple applications as varied as understanding the ecology of pathogenic micro‐organisms, forensics, environmental sampling for detect‐to‐treat applications, biological sensors for ‘detect to warn’ in infrastructure protection, responses to reports of ‘suspicious powders’, and customs and borders enforcement, to cite a few examples.

Very high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and substantial disease severity caused medical care capacity shortage in many countries. Therefore, real-time epidemic forecasting of the COVID-19 is useful to plan public health strategies like country lockdown and healthcare reorganization. We used extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Poland under different scenarios of the lockdown and lockdown removal. We used time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4 to May 22 2020. Our forecast includes the impact of a timeline of preventive measures introduced in Poland. Using eSIR algorithm we estimated the basic reproductive number and a total number of infections under different epidemic trend scenarios. Using eSIR modeling we estimated that the basic reproductive number in Poland concerning different scenarios of the lockdown removal is in a range of 3.91-4.79. The lowest predicted number of infected cases would be 263 900 (0 - 1 734 200, 95%CI) if the strict protective measures were maintained until the end of September. However, under different scenarios of precautions removal, a total number of infected cases may exceed one million within the next year. Relatively early introduction of strong precautions in Poland significantly slowed down epidemic spread in Poland in comparison with other European countries like Italy or Spain. However, early removal of protective measures may result in a significant increase in infection. Data shows that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Poland beyond May 18 is linear what could be a prognosis of a duration of the epidemic exceeding 300 days.","Orzechowska, M.; Bednarek, A.

How might we quickly prepare a large number of ambulatory-based clinicians to care for hospitalized patients using the inpatient workflow of the electronic health record (EHR)? Objectives The aim of the study is to create a successful training intervention which prepares ambulatory-based clinicians as they transition to inpatient services. Methods We created a training guide with embedded videos that describes the workflow of an inpatient clinician. We delivered this intervention via an e-mail hyperlink, a static hyperlink inside of the EHR, and an on-demand hyperlink within the EHR. Results In anticipation of the first peak of inpatients with COVID-19 in April 2020, the training manual was accessed 261 times by 167 unique users as clinicians anticipated being called into service. As our institution has not yet needed to deploy ambulatory-based clinicians for inpatient service, usage data of the training document is still pending. Conclusion We intend that our novel implementation of a multimedia, highly accessible onboarding document with access from points inside and outside of the EHR will improve clinician performance and serve as a helpful example to other organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Altman, Richard L.; Anstett, Tyler; Simpson, Jennifer R.; Del Pino-Jones, Amira; Lin, Chen-Tan; Pell, Jonathan",Appl Clin Inform,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264802/,390

Given the absence of implemented therapies, new analysis, diagnosis, and therapeutics are of great importance. RESULTS: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short persistent DNA/RNA sequences that are absent from the human genome and transcriptome (PmRAWs). For the PmRAWs with length 12, only four exist at the same location in all SARS-CoV-2. At the gene level, we found one PmRAW of size 13 at the Spike glycoprotein coding sequence. This protein is fundamental for binding in human ACE2 and further use as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Applying protein structural prediction, we localized this PmRAW at the surface of the Spike protein, providing a potential targeted vector for diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, we show a new pattern of relative absent words (RAWs), characterized by the progressive increase of GC content (Guanine and Cytosine) according to the decrease of RAWs length, contrarily to the virus and host genome distributions. New analysis shows the same property during the Ebola virus outbreak. At a computational level, we improved the alignment-free method to identify pathogen-specific signatures in balance with GC measures and removed previous size limitations.

The current study aims to compare factors predicting maternal mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in China, Italy, and the Netherlands. METHODS: The sample consisted of 900 Dutch, 641 Italian, and 922 Chinese mothers (age M = 36.74, s.d. = 5.58) who completed an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Ten-fold cross-validation models were applied to explore the predictive performance of related factors for maternal mental health, and also to test similarities and differences between the countries. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress and family conflict are risk factors and resilience is a protective factor in association with maternal mental health in each country. Despite these shared factors, unique best models were identified for each of the three countries. In Italy, maternal age and poor physical health were related to more mental health symptoms, while in the Netherlands maternal high education and unemployment were associated with mental health symptoms. In China, having more than one child, being married, and grandparental support for mothers were important protective factors lowering the risk for mental health symptoms. Moreover, high SES (mother's high education, high family income) and poor physical health were found to relate to high levels of mental health symptoms among Chinese mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are important for the identification of at-risk mothers and the development of mental health promotion programs during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Guo, Jing; De Carli, Pietro; Lodder, Paul; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J.; Riem, Madelon M.

Participants included 213 providers working in rural Pennsylvania. The researchers administered an electronic survey to participants 10 days after the organization issued directives to cancel routine care appointments. Descriptive statistics were used to examine sample characteristics. The researchers used thematic analysis to assess open-ended responses. Correlational analyses were used to examine associations among perceived stress, team culture, job satisfaction, COVID-19 engagement, and team leadership. Most providers reported that the pandemic had the greatest effect on them psychologically, followed by professionally (i.e., changes in workload and conflicts with coworkers) and financially. Statistically significant positive associations were observed among leadership, provider distress, and team culture. Identification of the psychological impact highlights the need to support healthcare providers and address their psychological needs. Moreover, understanding ways in which leaders can effectively lead may help personnel better prepare for a public health crisis.","Terry, Danielle L; Hui, Patricia; Buntoro, Shirley",Journal of healthcare management / American College of Healthcare Executives,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495004/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jhm-d-20-00258,390

So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.","Lin, S.; Huang, J.; He, Z.; Zhan, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.28.20046110v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110,390

The Indian government also issued an order for complete lockdown of the country, with all the nonessential services, including most of the services for nonemergency health issues, being temporarily suspended. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the effect of pandemic lockdown on medical advice-seeking behavior and the medication practices of the non-COVID Indian patients confined to homes, who would have normally visited the outpatient departments (OPDs) for medical advice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study conducted online during the lockdown period. The questions dealt with medical advice-related practices, self-medication, the sources of medical advice, and the need to visit emergency department. Evaluation of data was done as for descriptive studies. RESULTS: A total of 106 people (34%) out of the 312 participants had either old or new health problems. Ninety-six of such people (90.5%) tried to manage their sufferings by either continuing the drugs prescribed earlier or by making phone calls to doctors along with taking the help of home remedies, if needed. Ten (9.5%) of the symptomatic participants did not consult any doctor waiting for natural course of relief. None of the participants practiced self-medication of modern medicine therapy. Only one participant (of the total 312) took hydroxychloroquine as self-medication for assumed prophylactic therapy against the COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Most of the people with medical conditions, confined at home due to national lockdown, are coping with their problems without any irrational self-medication with modern medicines or any misuse of prophylactic therapy against the COVID infection. This seemingly positive trend may also have been due to the strict enforcement of the lockdown rules by the law enforcement agencies.","Tandon, Tanya; Dubey, Ashok Kumar; Dubey, Suparna; Arora, Ekta; Hasan, Md Nazer",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688537/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_481_20,390
680699,OPEN TRACHEOSTOMY FOR COVID19 POSITIVE PATIENTS: A METHOD TO MINIMIZE AEROSOLIZATION AND REDUCE RISK OF EXPOSURE,2020-05-11,"AIMS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a ubiquitous finding in inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)‐related deaths, but recent reports also describe additional atypical findings, including vascular changes. Here, we assess lung autopsy findings in COVID‐19 inpatients and untreated, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)‐positive individuals who died in the community to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we investigate if COVID‐19 represents a unique histologic variant of DAD by comparing the pathologic findings to uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included 4 COVID‐19 inpatients, 4 cases with post‐mortem SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnoses who died in the community, and 8 SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patient who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organization, and “acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia”‐like intraalveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, hemorrhage, and capillaritis were not features of COVID‐19‐related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histologic manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID‐19 patients who die both in the hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxemic mechanical ventilation to the histologic changes. There are no distinctive morphologic features to confidently differentiate COVID‐19‐related DAD from DAD due to other causes.","Konopka, Kristine E.; Nguyen, Teresa; Jentzen, Jeffrey M.; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J.; Wilson, Allecia M.; Farver, Carol F.; Myers, Jeffrey L.",Histopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32542743/; https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14180,390
680790,Real-World Clinical Experience of Semaglutide in Secondary Care Diabetes: A Retrospective Observational Study,2021-02-09,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug–gene or dug–drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra, tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A).

681802,The impact of type 2 diabetes and its management on the prognosis of patients with severe COVID‐19,2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic appeared to vary significantly across populations and geographic regions. We sought to investigate the variability in transmissibility of H1N1 pandemic in different health regions (including urban centres and remote, isolated communities) in the province of Manitoba, Canada. METHODS: The Richards model was used to fit to the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases and estimate transmissibility (referred to as the basic reproduction number, R(0)), doubling times, and turning points of outbreaks in both spring and fall waves of the H1N1 pandemic in several health regions. RESULTS: We observed considerable variation in R(0 )estimates ranging from 1.55 to 2.24, with confidence intervals ranging from 1.45 to 2.88, for an average generation time of 2.9 days, and shorter doubling times in some remote and isolated communities compared to urban centres, suggesting a more rapid spread of disease in these communities during the first wave. For the second wave, R(e), the effective reproduction number, is estimated to be lower for remote and isolated communities; however, outbreaks appear to have been driven by somewhat higher transmissibility in urban centres. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable geographic variation in transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic outbreaks. While highlighting the importance of estimating R(0 )for informing health responses, the findings indicate that projecting the transmissibility for large-scale epidemics may not faithfully characterize the early spread of disease in remote and isolated communities.","Mostaço-Guidolin, Luiz C; Greer, Amy; Sander, Beate; Wu, Jianhong; Moghadas, Seyed M",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166307/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-537,390

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed with the keywords COVID-19 and their synonyms and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. The data selection and extraction was elaborated by two researchers, independently. The results were discussed with a Primary Care physicians clinical group and the results were synthesized using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: A good quality systematic review was found that includes articles with a high risk of bias. And 8 EC launched that will produce results beyond May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conclusions of the systematic review generate a low confidence in the results, and the clinical variables that show benefit are intermediate variables, the side effects are acceptable and could be minimized with the use of QT lengthening risk tools, so it is could make a weak recommendation in favor of the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild-moderate stage COVID-19.","Mayayo-Vicente, S.; Rodriguez Salvanés, F.; Gallego-Arenas, A.; Sánchez-Gómez, L.M.; Ruiz-López, M.; Sierra García, B.; Jurado-López, A.; Arriola-Bolado, P.; Cervera Cano, M.; Novella-Arribas, B.",Semergen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359320302240; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semerg.2020.06.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359320302240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739134/,390

This study retrospectively explored the clinical significance of peripheral lymphocytes, especially the dynamic analysis of T-cell subsets, in determining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and progression. Seventy-nine patients with COVID-19 in the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu from January to February 2020 were included, 59 of which were analyzed for dynamic peripheral T-cell subsets expression. The neutrophil to CD4+ T lymphocyte ratio (N4R) and neutrophil to CD3+ T lymphocyte ratio (N3R) showed clinical significance in differentiating severe or critically-severe COVID-19, with area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.933 and 0.900, respectively (P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients with more baseline peripheral lymphocytes or NK cells were prone to test negative to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after therapy (P < 0.05), and the AUC of NK cells for predicting negative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection after therapy was 0.800. When the number of peripheral CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients continuously increased 6-9 days after baseline, the period of disease exacerbation could be delayed for more than 2 weeks after admission. Baseline N4R and N3R could be potential biomarkers for assisting in differentiating COVID-19 severity, and dynamically monitoring peripheral CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells 6-9 days after baseline could help clinicians to evaluate disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Meng, Liye; Xu, Jiao; Zhang, Junlong; Zhang, Keyi; Shang, Pengcheng; Li, Qingfeng; Li, Yi; Wang, Lanlan; Cai, Bei",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741750/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202701,390
682970,Response: D‐dimer Triage for COVID‐19,2020-07-30,"Telerehabilitation offers a unique solution for continuity of care in pediatric rehabilitation under physical distancing. The major aims of this study were to: (1) describe the development of telerehabilitation usage guidelines in a large hospital in Israel, and to (2) evaluate the implementation of telerehabilitation from the perspectives of healthcare practitioners and families. An expert focus group developed guidelines which were disseminated to multidisciplinary clinicians. Following sessions, clinicians filled The Clinician Evaluation of Telerehabilitation Service (CETS), a custom-built feedback questionnaire on telerehabilitation, and parents completed the client version of the Therapist Presence Inventory (TPI-C) and were asked to rate the effectiveness of sessions on an ordinal scale. Four goals of telerehabilitation sessions were defined: (1) maintenance of therapeutic alliance, (2) provision of parental coping strategies, (3) assistance in maintaining routine, and (4) preventing functional deterioration. Principal Components Analysis was used for the CETS questionnaire and the relationships of CETS and TPI-C with child’s age and the type of session were evaluated using Spearman’s correlations and the Kruskal–Wallis H test. In total, sixty-seven telerehabilitation sessions, with clients aged 11.31 ± 4.8 years, were documented by clinicians. Three components (child, session, parent) explained 71.3% of the variance in CETS. According to therapists, their ability to maintain the therapeutic alliance was generally higher than their ability to achieve other predefined goals (p < 0.01). With younger children, the ability to provide feedback to the child, grade treatment difficulty and provide coping strategies to the parents were diminished. Families perceived the therapist as being highly present in therapy regardless of treatment type.

684223,Blood Glucose Control Strategy for Type 2 Diabetes Patients With COVID-19,2020-10-28,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a shortage of medical resources, including ventilators, personal protective equipment, medical staff, and hospital beds. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage. Furthermore, compared with medical experts, few ALS patients reported that the chance for ALS patients to obtain work was higher due to the increasing availability of remote work. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with increased distress about access to care and work, inducing contradictory responses and potential hopelessness among ALS patients.","Yanagihashi, Masaru; Sugisawa, Tatsuki; Fuchimoto, Masaaki; Saotome, Yuuichi; Onozawa, Keiko; Matsumoto, Yukinori; Bokuda, Kota; Ebina, Junya; Shibukawa, Mari; Hirayama, Takehisa; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Washizawa, Naohiro; Ebihara, Satoru; Kano, Osamu",Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994445/; https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.6810-20,390
685750,"Practice, Outcomes and Complications of Emergent Endotracheal Intubation By Critical Care Practitioners During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021-06-15,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic (C19P) is causing several detrimental effects on cancer care globally. CT are crucial to obtain high quality literature evidence and “poor accrual” is the most common reason for their early discontinuation (ED). At our best knowledge, no data are available on ED of cancer CT after the beginning of C19P. Methods: ClinicalTrial.gov was queried for terminated (T), withdrawn (W) and suspended (S) CT for the following terms: “cancer”, “neoplasm”, and “tumor”. The search was made for all the CT available from the inception to 26th February 2021, without any restrictions. The following characteristics were extracted: reason for ED, study type (interventional [In] vs observational), sponsored (yes vs not). ED rate was compared between CT discontinued for C19P or not (χ2);p<0.05 was set as statistically significant. A multiple linear regression analysis was also conducted to identify independent factors of ED. Results: 9990 CT were identified, but 765 CT were excluded as not related to cancer. Thus, 9225 CT were included (66% was T, 23% was W and 4% was S). Among CT classified as T, W and S, the frequency of In CT was 92%, 88% and 85% respectively, while the frequency of sponsored CT was 46%, 35% and 26% respectively. The most common reasons for ED were: “poor accrual” (29%), “lack of funding” (6%) and “sponsor decision” (5%). No reason for ED was available for 15% of CT. One hundred (1%) CT were discontinued due to C19P (27% was T, 7% was W and 66% was S). Comparing CT discontinued due to C19P with those discontinued due to other reasons, a lower rate of In-CT (73% vs 91%, p<0.05) and sponsored CT (14% vs 42%, p<0.05) was found in the C19P group. At the multiple linear regression analysis, C19P was strongly positively correlated with ED (coefficient 0.59952, p<0.0001) whereas sponsored CT resulted as negatively correlated with ED (coefficient -0.02746, p<0.0001). Conclusions: “Poor accrual” continues to be the main reason for ED of cancer CT, but C19P represents a new additional cause of ED. Sponsored trials showed less risk for ED. Further research is needed to maximize the expected benefit of cancer CT, reducing the anticipated risks. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding.

685911,Mayo Clinic Strategies for COVID-19 Revisiting the Safety of Health Care Workers,2020-07-07,"ABSTRACT The current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge to every health system over the globe. Unfortunately, it is likely that this emergency will not disappear soon. No health system, with its present resources and work flow is ready to deal with a full-blown wave of this pandemic. Rapid acquisition of specific new skills may be fundamental in delivering appropriate health care for our patients. COVID-19 infection is classically diagnosed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and radiological investigations (X-ray or high-resolution computerized tomography). These techniques are not without limitations. Ultrasound has been suggested as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing the lungs in patients with suspected pneumonia. Obstetricians and gynecologists are usually familiar with the use of ultrasound. Lung ultrasound can show specific signs of interstitial pneumonia, which is characteristic of COVID-19 pulmonary infection. We believe that extensive and rapid training of healthcare providers on the application of ultrasound in the detection of characteristic pulmonary signs of COVID-19 infection, in addition to proper care and handling of their ultrasound machines, is feasible and may be critical in order to provide appropriate management especially of the obstetric patient in the coming period. We present a systematic approach to lung examination, simplified to encourage its adoption by obstetricians and gynecologists, together with an example of a recent pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection, in which lung ultrasound was useful in the management.","Youssef, Aly; Serra, Carla; Pilu, Gianluigi",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305391?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305391,390

This review synthesizes the literature on ML methods and their performance for predicting hospital readmission in the US. METHODS This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Statement. The extraction of items was also guided by the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). Electronic databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were systematically searched from January 1, 2015, through December 10, 2019. The articles were imported into COVIDENCE online software for title/abstract screening and full-text eligibility. Observational studies using ML techniques for hospital readmissions among US patients were eligible for inclusion. Articles without a full text available in the English language were excluded. A qualitative synthesis included study characteristics, ML algorithms utilized, and model validation, and quantitative analysis assessed model performance. Model performances in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) were analyzed using R software. Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was used to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. RESULTS Of 522 citations reviewed, 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. A majority of the studies used electronic health records (24, 56%), followed by population-based data sources (15, 35%) and administrative claims data (4, 9%). The most common algorithms were tree-based methods (23, 53%), neural network (NN) (14, 33%), regularized logistic regression (12, 28%), and support vector machine (SVM) (10, 23%). Most of these studies (37, 85%) were of high quality. A majority of these studies (28, 65%) reported ML algorithms with an AUC above 0.70. There was a range of variability within AUC reported by these studies with a median of 0.68 (IQR: 0.64-0.76; range: 0.50-0.90).

687049,Transport of COVID-19 and other highly contagious patients by helicopter and fixed-wing air ambulance: a narrative review and experience of the Swiss air rescue Rega,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND: The leading cause of acute illnesses, respiratory viruses, typically cause self-limited diseases, although severe complications can occur in fragile patients. Rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), and coronaviruses are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens, but because of the lack of reliable animal models, their differential pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare infections by respiratory viruses isolated from clinical specimens using reconstituted human airway epithelia. METHODS: Tissues were infected with RV-A55, RV-A49, RV-B48, RV-C8, and RV-C15; respiratory EV-D68; influenza virus H3N2; RSV-B; and human coronavirus (HCoV)–OC43. Replication kinetics, cell tropism, effect on tissue integrity, and cytokine secretion were compared. Viral adaptation and tissue response were assessed through RNA sequencing. RESULTS: RVs, RSV-B, and HCoV-OC43 infected ciliated cells and caused no major cell death, whereas H3N2 and EV-D68 induced ciliated cell loss and tissue integrity disruption. H3N2 was also detected in rare goblet and basal cells. All viruses, except RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, altered cilia beating and mucociliary clearance. H3N2 was the strongest cytokine inducer, and HCoV-OC43 was the weakest. Persistent infection was observed in all cases. RNA sequencing highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism and induction of a transient but important immune response at 4 days after infection. No majority mutations emerged in the viral population. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of respiratory viruses during the acute infection phase and their ability to persist under immune tolerance. These data help to appreciate the range of disease severity observed in vivo and the occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.","Essaidi-Laziosi, Manel; Brito, Francisco; Benaoudia, Sacha; Royston, Léna; Cagno, Valeria; Fernandes-Rocha, Mélanie; Piuz, Isabelle; Zdobnov, Evgeny; Huang, Song; Constant, Samuel; Boldi, Marc-Olivier; Kaiser, Laurent; Tapparel, Caroline",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917312745; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917312745; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.07.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797733/,390

We investigated racial/ethnic differences by gender in correlates of COVID-19 infection among veterans seeking health care services at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Little is known about gender-specific factors associated with infection among veterans. This study seeks to fill this gap. Methods The sample was veterans with results from a COVID-19 test (polymerase chain reaction) conducted at VHA facilities between March 1, 2020 and August 5, 2020 and linked to CDC Social Vulnerability Index data (39,223 women, 316,380 men). Bivariate, multivariate logistic, and predicted probability analyses were conducted. All analyses were stratified by gender. Results Similar percentages of women and men tested positive for COVID-19 (9.6% vs. 10.0%). In multivariate analysis, compared to non-Hispanic White women, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic women all had significantly higher odds of infection. Similar racial/ethnic differences were found for men. Both older men and women (>40) had lower odds of infection, but the age cut points differed (40 for women, 55 for men). Men 80+ had higher odds than those aged <40. For men, but not for women, being employed (vs. unemployed) was associated with increased odds of infection, and having comorbidities was associated with decreased odds. There were significant differences within and across gender-by-race/ethnicity in infection, after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Black women and men veterans are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 infection.

Sequence and structural analyses of 910-30 and related antibodies explore how class recognition features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer reveal binding interactions and its ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy-chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66-encoded antibodies highlight the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2-binding competition and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We develop paired heavy:light class sequence signatures and determine antibody precursor prevalence to be ∼1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients.

We asked if structured EMR data could be coupled with computerized processing of free-text clinical entries to enhance detection of acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODOLOGY: A manual review of EMR records related to 15,377 outpatient visits uncovered 280 reference cases of ARI. We used logistic regression with backward elimination to determine which among candidate structured EMR parameters (diagnostic codes, vital signs and orders for tests, imaging and medications) contributed to the detection of those reference cases. We also developed a computerized free-text search to identify clinical notes documenting at least two non-negated ARI symptoms. We then used heuristics to build case-detection algorithms that best combined the retained structured EMR parameters with the results of the text analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An adjusted grouping of diagnostic codes identified reference ARI patients with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 32%. Of the 21 additional structured clinical parameters considered, two contributed significantly to ARI detection: new prescriptions for cough remedies and elevations in body temperature to at least 38°C. Together with the diagnostic codes, these parameters increased detection sensitivity to 87%, but specificity and PPV declined to 95% and 25%, respectively. Adding text analysis increased sensitivity to 99%, but PPV dropped further to 14%. Algorithms that required satisfying both a query of structured EMR parameters as well as text analysis disclosed PPVs of 52–68% and retained sensitivities of 69–73%. CONCLUSION: Structured EMR parameters and free-text analyses can be combined into algorithms that can detect ARI cases with new levels of sensitivity or precision. These results highlight potential paths by which repurposed EMR information could facilitate the discovery of epidemics before they cause mass casualties.","DeLisle, Sylvain; South, Brett; Anthony, Jill A.; Kalp, Ericka; Gundlapallli, Adi; Curriero, Frank C.; Glass, Greg E.; Samore, Matthew; Perl, Trish M.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976281/,390

A variety of factors serve to increase the risk for children and adolescents in developing mental health issues during the prolonged stay-at-home period. The primary aim of this study was to examine a complex conceptual model linking daily routines, parent-child conflict, and indices of psychological maladjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Chinese children and adolescents. Participants were N = 1,594 children and adolescents (50.6% girls; Mage = 13.13, SDage = 1.54) and their mothers, from Zhengzhou in Mainland China. Multisource assessments include youth self-reports of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and perceived conflict with parents during the stay-at-home period, as well as maternal reports of their child's daily routines during this time. Among the results, parent-child conflict mediated the relations between daily routines and indices of psychological maladjustment, such that a lack of routine predicted greater parent-child conflict, which in turn was associated with higher levels of loneliness and symptoms of depression. Further, results from multiple group analyses revealed that associations between daily routines and maladjustment were stronger among boys than girls-as well as stronger among primary school children than middle school adolescents. Findings highlighted the importance of maintaining regular routines for children's and adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

689369,A Multicenter Cross-sectional Questionnaire-based Study to Know the Practices and Strategies of Ventilatory Management of COVID-19 Patients among the Treating Physicians,2020-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: Due to a complex set of processes involved with the recording of health information in the Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the truthfulness of EHR diagnosis records is questionable. We present a computational approach to estimate the probability that a single diagnosis record in the EHR reflects the true disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using EHR data on 18 diseases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank, we develop generative classifiers on a small set of disease-agnostic features from EHRs that aim to represent Patients, pRoviders, and their Interactions within the healthcare SysteM (PRISM features). RESULTS: We demonstrate that PRISM features and the generative PRISM classifiers are potent for estimating disease probabilities and exhibit generalizable and transferable distributional characteristics across diseases and patient populations. The joint probabilities we learn about diseases through the PRISM features via PRISM generative models are transferable and generalizable to multiple diseases. DISCUSSION: The Generative Transfer Learning (GTL) approach with PRISM classifiers enables the scalable validation of computable phenotypes in EHRs without the need for domain-specific knowledge about specific disease processes. CONCLUSION: Probabilities computed from the generative PRISM classifier can enhance and accelerate applied Machine Learning research and discoveries with EHR data.","Estiri, Hossein; Vasey, Sebastien; Murphy, Shawn N",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043366/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa215,390
690298,The role of dendritic cells in the pharynx,2002-11-12,"A novel coronavirus, designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FECV), was identified in feces of domestic ferrets clinically diagnosed with epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE). Initially, partial sequences of the polymerase, spike, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid genes were generated using coronavirus consensus PCR assays. Subsequently, the complete sequences of the nucleocapsid gene and the last two open reading frames at the 3′ terminus of the FECV genome were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses based on predicted partial amino acid sequences of the polymerase, spike, and membrane proteins, and full sequence of the nucleocapsid protein showed that FECV is genetically most closely related to group 1 coronaviruses. FECV is more similar to feline coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and canine coronavirus than to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and human coronavirus 229E. Molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with clinical cases of ECE.","Wise, Annabel G.; Kiupel, Matti; Maes, Roger K.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206000365; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206000365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16499943/,390

Due to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the ATS2020 Conference was held online in a series of virtual meetings. In this review, we focus on the breakthroughs in pulmonary hypertension research. We have selected 11 of the best basic science abstracts which were presented at the ATS2020 Assembly on Pulmonary Circulation mini-symposium “What’s New in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Right Ventricular (RV) Signaling: Lessons from the Best Abstracts,” reflecting the current state of the art and associated challenges in PH. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the mechanisms underlying RV failure, the regulation of inflammation, and the novel therapeutic targets that emerged from preclinical research. The pathologic interactions between pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular function and COVID-19 are also discussed.","Potus, Francois; Frump, Andrea L.; Umar, Soban; R.

690454,Anxiety and fear related to coronavirus disease 2019 assessment in the Spanish population: A cross-sectional study.,2021,"Recent pandemic outbreak of the corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised widespread concerns about the importance of the bioaerosols. They are atmospheric aerosol particles of biological origins, mainly including bacteria, fungi, viruses, pollen, and cell debris. Bioaerosols can exert a substantial impact on ecosystems, climate change, air quality, and public health. Here, we review several relevant topics on bioaerosols, including sampling and detection techniques, characterization, effects on health and air quality, and control methods. However, very few studies have focused on the source apportionment and transport of bioaerosols. The knowledge of the sources and transport pathways of bioaerosols is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the role microorganisms play in the atmosphere and control the spread of epidemic diseases associated with them. Therefore, this review comprehensively summarizes the up to date progress on the source characteristics, source identification, and diffusion and transport process of bioaerosols. We intercompare three types of diffusion and transport models, with a special emphasis on a widely used mathematical model. This review also highlights the main factors affecting the source emission and transport process, such as biogeographic regions, land-use types, and environmental factors. Finally, this review outlines future perspectives on bioaerosols.

690578,Future Directions in Research to Improve Care Transitions From Hospital Discharge,2021-07-08,"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with negative long-term outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of the syndrome, the ability to predict outcomes of AKI may be beneficial towards effectively using resources and personalising AKI care. This systematic review will identify, describe and assess current models in the literature for the prediction of outcomes in hospitalised patients with AKI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Relevant literature from a comprehensive search across six databases will be imported into Covidence. Abstract screening and full-text review will be conducted independently by two team members, and any conflicts will be resolved by a third member. Studies to be included are cohort studies and randomised controlled trials with at least 100 subjects, adult hospitalised patients, with AKI. Only those studies evaluating multivariable predictive models reporting a statistical measure of accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve or C-statistic) and predicting resolution of AKI, progression of AKI, subsequent dialysis and mortality will be included. Data extraction will be performed independently by two team members, with a third reviewer available to resolve conflicts. Results will be reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Risk of bias will be assessed using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We are committed to open dissemination of our results through the registration of our systematic review on PROSPERO and future publication. We hope that our review provides a platform for future work in realm of using artificial intelligence to predict outcomes of common diseases.
