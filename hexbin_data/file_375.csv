2816,2816,2816,Ontology-Based Approach to Social Data Sentiment Analysis: Detection of Adolescent Depression Signals,22.243774,5.1221304,2017-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Social networking services (SNSs) contain abundant information about the feelings, thoughts, interests, and patterns of behavior of adolescents that can be obtained by analyzing SNS postings. An ontology that expresses the shared concepts and their relationships in a specific field could be used as a semantic framework for social media data analytics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to refine an adolescent depression ontology and terminology as a framework for analyzing social media data and to evaluate description logics between classes and the applicability of this ontology to sentiment analysis. METHODS: The domain and scope of the ontology were defined using competency questions. The concepts constituting the ontology and terminology were collected from clinical practice guidelines, the literature, and social media postings on adolescent depression. Class concepts, their hierarchy, and the relationships among class concepts were defined. An internal structure of the ontology was designed using the entity-attribute-value (EAV) triplet data model, and superclasses of the ontology were aligned with the upper ontology. Description logics between classes were evaluated by mapping concepts extracted from the answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) onto the ontology concepts derived from description logic queries. The applicability of the ontology was validated by examining the representability of 1358 sentiment phrases using the ontology EAV model and conducting sentiment analyses of social media data using ontology class concepts. RESULTS: We developed an adolescent depression ontology that comprised 443 classes and 60 relationships among the classes; the terminology comprised 1682 synonyms of the 443 classes. In the description logics test, no error in relationships between classes was found, and about 89% (55/62) of the concepts cited in the answers to FAQs mapped onto the ontology class. Regarding applicability, the EAV triplet models of the ontology class represented about 91.4% of the sentiment phrases included in the sentiment dictionary. In the sentiment analyses, “academic stresses” and “suicide” contributed negatively to the sentiment of adolescent depression. CONCLUSIONS: The ontology and terminology developed in this study provide a semantic foundation for analyzing social media data on adolescent depression. To be useful in social media data analysis, the ontology, especially the terminology, needs to be updated constantly to reflect rapidly changing terms used by adolescents in social media postings. In addition, more attributes and value sets reflecting depression-related sentiments should be added to the ontology.","Jung, Hyesil; Park, Hyeoun-Ae; Song, Tae-Min",J Med Internet Res,375,22

However, the emergence of bacterial resistance requires the earliest use of antibiotics with the narrowest possible spectrum. The Unyvero Hospitalized Pneumonia (HPN, Curetis) test is a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) system detecting 21 bacteria and 19 resistance genes on respiratory samples within 5 h. We assessed the performance and the potential impact of the M-PCR on the antibiotic therapy of ICU patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we performed a M-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) samples of patients with ventilated HAP or VAP with Gram-negative bacilli or clustered Gram-positive cocci. This study was conducted in 3 ICUs in a French academic hospital: the medical and infectious diseases ICU, the surgical ICU, and the cardio-surgical ICU. A multidisciplinary expert panel simulated the antibiotic changes they would have made if the M-PCR results had been available. RESULTS: We analyzed 95 clinical samples of ventilated HAP or VAP (72 BAL and 23 PTC) from 85 patients (62 males, median age 64 years). The median turnaround time of the M-PCR was 4.6 h (IQR 4.4–5). A total of 90/112 bacteria were detected by the M-PCR system with a global sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 73–88%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI 99–100). The sensitivity was better for Gram-negative bacteria (90%) than for Gram-positive cocci (62%) (p = 0.005). Moreover, 5/8 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M gene) and 4/4 carbapenemases genes (3 NDM, one oxa-48) were detected. The M-PCR could have led to the earlier initiation of an effective antibiotic in 20/95 patients (21%) and to early de-escalation in 37 patients (39%) but could also have led to one (1%) inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Among 17 empiric antibiotic treatments with carbapenems, 10 could have been de-escalated in the following hours according to the M-PCR results. The M-PCR also led to 2 unexpected diagnosis of severe legionellosis confirmed by culture methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the use of a M-PCR system for respiratory samples of patients with VAP and ventilated HAP could improve empirical antimicrobial therapy and reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.","Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Bouadma, Lila; Mathy, Vincent; Allouche, Kahina; Patrier, Juliette; Reboul, Martin; Montravers, Philippe; Timsit, Jean-François; Armand-Lefevre, Laurence",Crit Care,375,2

This necessary step in sperm maturation includes posttranslational modification of sperm membrane proteins that includes protein processing by proteases. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning this epididymal sperm maturation remains unknown. In this study, we focused on transmembrane serine protease 12 (Tmprss12). Based on multi-tissue expression analysis by PCR, Tmprss12 was specifically expressed in the testis, and its expression started on day 10 postpartum, corresponding to the stage of zygotene spermatocytes. TMPRSS12 was detected in the acrosomal region of spermatozoa by immunostaining. To reveal the physiological function of TMPRSS12, we generated two knockout (KO) mouse lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Both indel and large deletion lines were male sterile showing that TMPRSS12 is essential for male fertility. Although KO males exhibited normal spermatogenesis and sperm morphology, ejaculated spermatozoa failed to migrate from the uterus to the oviduct. Further analysis revealed that a disintegrin and metalloprotease 3 (ADAM3), an essential protein on the sperm membrane surface that is required for sperm migration, was disrupted in KO spermatozoa. Moreover, we found that KO spermatozoa showed reduced sperm motility via computer-assisted sperm analysis, resulting in a low fertilization rate in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TMPRSS12 has dual functions in regulating sperm motility and ADAM3-related sperm migration to the oviduct. Because Tmprss12 is conserved among mammals, including humans, our results may explain some genetic cases of idiopathic male infertility, and TMPRSS12 and its downstream cascade may be novel targets for contraception.","Larasati, Tamara; Noda, Taichi; Fujihara, Yoshitaka; Shimada, Keisuke; Tobita, Tomohiro; Yu, Zhifeng; Matzuk, Martin M; Ikawa, Masahito",Biol Reprod,375,22

Mathematical models of plant-pollinator interactions can help understand key determinants in pollination success. However, most previous models have not addressed pollinator behavior and plant biology combined. Information generated from such a model can inform optimal design of crop orchards and effective utilization of managed pollinators like western honey bees (Apis mellifera), and help generate hypotheses about the effects of management practices and cultivar selection. We expect that the number of honey bees per flower and male to female flower ratio will influence fruit yield. To test the relative importance of these effects, both singly and simultaneously, we utilized a delay differential equation model combined with Latin hypercube sampling for sensitivity analysis. Empirical data obtained from historical records and collected in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) orchards in New Zealand were used to parameterize the model. We found that, at realistic bee densities, the optimal orchard had 65-75% female flowers, and the most benefit was gained from the first 6-8 bees/1000 flowers, with diminishing returns thereafter. While bee density significantly impacted fruit production, plant-based parameters-flower density and male:female flower ratio-were the most influential. The predictive model provides strategies for improving crop management, such as choosing cultivars which have their peak bloom on the same day, increasing the number of flowers with approximately 70% female flowers in the orchard, and placing enough hives to maintain more than 6 bees per 1000 flowers to optimize yield.","Peace, Angela; Pattemore, David; Broussard, Melissa; Fonseka, Dilini; Tomer, Nathan; Bosque-Pérez, Nilsa A.; Crowder, David; Shaw, Allison K.; Jesson, Linley; Howlett, Brad G.; Jochym, Mateusz; Li, Jing",PLoS One,375,22

Besides disease-specific therapy, blood pressure (BP) control is of central importance in Fabry disease to reduce disease progression and improve prognosis. Both Fabry disease and hypertension are characterized by the activation of the innate component of the immune system, with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a common trigger to the inflammatory cascade. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the establishment of low-grade chronic inflammation and redox unbalance that contribute to organ damage in the long term. Besides exploiting the anti-inflammatory effects of RAS blockade and enzyme replacement therapy, targeted therapies acting on the immune system represent an appealing field of research in these conditions. The aim of this narrative review is to examine the issue of hypertension in the setting of Fabry disease, focusing on the possible determinants of their reciprocal relationship, as well as on the related clinical and therapeutic implications.","Del Pinto, Rita; Ferri, Claudio",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,375,17

There are concerns increasing restrictions on entitlement to health services have a detrimental impact on access to services and obstetric outcomes, particularly among undocumented migrant women. The study aimed to investigate the experiences of undocumented migrant women who have been pregnant in England, and factors affecting access to care and health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews June–December 2017 with a purposive sample of migrant women born outside the UK (aged>18) who had experiences of pregnancy and undocumented status (without permission to reside) in the UK, recruited through Doctors of the World (DOTW) UK. Interpreting services were used on request. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval: Imperial College London Research Ethics Committee (ICREC reference: 17IC3924). RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants, 10 of whom had their first antenatal appointment after the national target of 13 weeks, and nine of whom reported complications. Themes defining women's experiences of pregnancy included: restricted agency, intersecting stressors, and an ongoing cycle of precarity, defined by legal status, social isolation, and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence of women's experiences of pregnancy in the UK in the context of increasingly restrictive health policies including charging and data sharing. Six recommendations are made to ensure the UK and other migrant receiving countries work towards reducing inequalities and achieving national and global targets for maternal and child health and universal health coverage.","Nellums, Laura B.; Powis, Jaynaide; Jones, Lucy; Miller, Anna; Rustage, Kieran; Russell, Neal; Friedland, Jon S.; Hargreaves, Sally",Soc Sci Med,375,5

Cancer-specific mobile health apps for patient-related outcomes allow patients to communicate with their clinicians and proactively track their symptoms, which have been shown to improve clinical management and disease outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of LogPAL, a novel iPhone-based mobile health app designed to help HNC survivors track and manage their posttreatment symptoms. METHODS: Patients who completed curative treatment for HNC in the preceding 24 months were recruited from 2 clinical sites within a single institution. Upon enrollment, participants completed a brief sociodemographic survey, downloaded the app onto their iPhone devices, and were asked to complete a series of biweekly questionnaires (based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) via the app for an 8-week study period. The primary feasibility endpoints included retention (retaining >80% of the enrolled participants for the duration of the study period), adherence (>50% of the participants completing 100% of the questionnaires over the study period), and usability (a mean system usability scale [SUS] score >68). Additional postintervention questions were collected to assess perceived usefulness, acceptance, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Between January and October 2019, 38 participants were enrolled in the study. Three participants dropped out, and 3 were classified as nonusers. The remaining 32 (87%) were eligible for analysis. Their mean age was 57.8 (SD 12.3) years (range 24-77 years, 81% [26/32] male).

This relationship is not widely studied among early care and education (ECE) providers, a unique population with important influences on children’s dietary habits. Our study’s objective was to explore how food insecurity affected diet quality and dietary behaviors among ECE providers. METHODS: We used baseline data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial (January 2019−December 2020) on 216 ECE providers under the Pennsylvania Head Start Association. We used radar plots to graph scores for the Healthy Eating Index 2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) 2010 and fitted a multivariate regression model for diet quality measures, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 216 participants, 31.5% were food insecure. ECE providers who were food insecure had a lower AHEI-2010 mean score (mean difference for food insecure vs food secure = −4.8; 95% CI, −7.8 to −1.7; P = .002). After adjusting for covariates, associations remained significant (mean difference = −3.9; 95% CI, −7.5 to −0.4; P = .03). Food insecure ECE providers were less likely to use nutrition labels (22.8% vs 39.1%; P = .046) and more likely to report cost as a perceived barrier to eating fruits and vegetables. CONCLUSION: We found a significant inverse association between food insecurity and the AHEI-2010 diet quality score among ECE providers after adjusting for covariates. More studies are needed to examine the effects of food insecurity on dietary behaviors of ECE providers and their response to nutrition education programs targeting their health.","Mofleh, Dania; Ranjit, Nalini; Chuang, Ru-Jye; Cox, Jill N.; Anthony, Christine; Sharma, Shreela V.",Prev Chronic Dis,375,27

This study was part of a bigger study titled ‘Wideband acoustic immittance in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus’. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to explore current practice of South African audiologists regarding acoustic immittance measures, and to explore their perceived knowledge and views on acoustic immittance advancements. METHOD: A quantitative survey with a cross sectional design was employed. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to participants via professional associations of audiologists. Data was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Most audiologists worked in private practice and conducted tympanometry with 226Hz probe tone and ipsilateral acoustic reflexes. There was no association between clinical setting, levels of qualification, and the use of tympanometry. None of the participants included multifrequency and multicomponent tympanometry (MFT) and/or wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) in their test battery. Most of the participants were not familiar with MFT and WAI. Familiarity with MFT and WAI were only associated with the level of qualification. Limited training and lack of equipment were major barriers to conducting some of the acoustic immittance measures. Most participants believed that they would include MFT and/or WAI in their test battery if they had access to the equipment.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and impact of the typhoid conjugate vaccine Typbar-TCV against S Typhi among children in an outbreak setting of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S Typhi in Pakistan. METHODS: This cohort study was done from Feb 21, 2018, to Dec 31, 2019. A census survey of all households located in the Qasimabad and Latifabad subdistricts of Hyderabad, Pakistan, was done at baseline, and 174 005 households were registered in the census. The Typbar-TCV immunisation campaign was initiated at temporary vaccination centres and 207 000 children aged 6 months to 10 years were vaccinated from Feb 21, 2018, to Dec 31, 2018. Social mobilisers informed parents about the vaccination process. Vaccination records were maintained electronically and linked with the household census surveys. Active surveillance for suspected and blood-culture-confirmed S Typhi was established in hospitals, clinics, and laboratories to assess the following outcomes: cases of suspected typhoid fever, culture-confirmed S Typhi, and antimicrobial resistance. An age-stratified cohort of 1100 vaccinated children was randomly selected from the vaccination registry, tested for Vi-IgG antibodies (data not reported), and followed up fortnightly (via telephone calls or household visits) until Dec 31, 2019, for ascertainment of outcomes during the study period. 20 847 vaccinated and unvaccinated children were randomly selected from the census registry as a quality control cohort and followed up from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2019, for ascertainment of outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness against suspected, culture-confirmed, and XDR S Typhi was calculated. FINDINGS: 23 407 children from the census registry and surveillance system were included in the vaccine effectiveness analysis. 13 436 (57·4%) children were vaccinated, 12 214 (52·2%) were male, and 10 168 (43·4%) were aged 6–59 months. 5378 (23·0%) of 23 407 children had suspected S Typhi, among whom 775 (14·4%) had culture-confirmed S Typhi and 361 (68·6%) of 526 had XDR S Typhi. Vaccine effectiveness was 55% (95% CI 52–57) against suspected S Typhi (regardless of culture confirmation), 95% (93–96) against culture-confirmed S Typhi, and 97% (95–98) against XDR S Typhi. INTERPRETATION: Typbar-TCV is effective in protecting children against S Typhi infection in an outbreak setting, and was able, with moderate deployment, to curtail a major XDR S Typhi outbreak in a densely populated setting. The vaccine shows efficacy against S Typhi irrespective of antimicrobial resistance.

When stakeholders offer divergent input, it can be unclear how to prioritize information for decision aids (DAs) on mammography screening. Objectives. This analysis triangulates perspectives (breast cancer screening experts, primary care providers [PCPs], and patients with limited health literacy [LHL]) to understand areas of divergent and convergent input across stakeholder groups in developing a breast cancer screening DA for younger women with LHL. Design. A modified online Delphi panel of 8 experts rated 57 statements for inclusion in a breast cancer screening DA over three rounds. Individual interviews with 25 patients with LHL and 20 PCPs from a large safety net hospital explored informational needs about mammography decision making. Codes from the qualitative interviews and open-ended responses from the Delphi process were mapped across stakeholders to ascertain areas where stakeholder preferences converged or diverged. Results. Four themes regarding informational needs were identified regarding 1) the benefits and harms of screening, 2) different screening modalities, 3) the experience of mammography, and 4) communication about breast cancer risk. Patients viewed pain as the primary harm, while PCPs and experts emphasized the harm of false positives. Patients, but not PCPs or experts, felt that information about the process of getting a mammogram was important. PCPs believed that mammography was the only evidence-based screening modality, while patients believed breast self-exam was also important for screening.

Chronic diseases and related risk factors such as tobacco use or consuming sugar-sweetened beverages can also increase a person’s risk of periodontitis. Given the linkages between oral health and certain chronic diseases, we conducted a pilot study to facilitate intradepartmental collaborations between state chronic disease and oral health programs. METHODS: State health departments in 6 states (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, and New York) collaborated to develop and implement projects that addressed oral health and the following chronic diseases or risk factors: obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and tobacco use. States developed various projects, including media campaigns, clinical education, and screening and referrals. We used a mixed-methods approach to understand barriers to and facilitators of states’ increasing collaboration and implementation of pilot projects. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 staff (1 from oral health and 1 from chronic disease for each state). We also reviewed state-submitted documents and performance measures. RESULTS: All 6 states increased collaboration between their oral health and chronic disease programs and successfully implemented pilot projects. Collaboration was facilitated by investing in relationships, championing medical–dental integration, and meeting and communicating frequently. Barriers to collaboration included the perception of oral health in chronic disease programs as separate and distinct from other chronic diseases and the structure of funding. The pilot projects were facilitated by partner support, providing technical assistance to clinics, and working early on referral networks. Barriers to implementing the pilot projects included gaining clinician buy-in and establishing referral networks. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that by fostering collaboration, state health departments are able to train dental and medical clinicians, deliver clinical preventive education to patients, implement referral systems, and deliver impressions via media campaigns.","Linabarger, Molly; Brown, Monique; Patel, Nita",Prev Chronic Dis,375,22

The most common setting for patient-nephrologist interactions is during the HD treatment, which is a time pressured setting that lacks privacy. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate effective communication in the hemodialysis (HD) unit, we evaluated the usability of a web application (web app) from both the patient and physician perspective. The main aim of the web app was to support patients in prioritizing their dialysis concerns outside of the clinical HD encounter. DESIGN: Mixed method, parallel arm, multi-site, pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two outpatient Canadian HD centers. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients receiving in-center HD and their attending nephrologists. METHODS: Patients were randomized to either a web application or an active control (paper form) for logging concerns to be addressed at weekly encounters with the nephrologist over 8 weeks. Topics included: HD treatment, symptoms, modality, and medications. The primary outcome was usability, defined as effectiveness (engagement with the tool, frequency of submitted concerns, whether the concern was satisfactorily addressed) and satisfaction with the tool using a priori thresholds and explored in interviews with patients and nephrologists. RESULTS: 77 patients (30 women, median age 61, interquartile range [53,67], median 2 years [1,4] on dialysis) and 19 nephrologists (4 women, median age 46 [36,65]) were enrolled. Patient use of a digital device at baseline was low (20%). Engagement with the tool was 70% (web app) and 100% (paper) with a lower proportion of patients in the web app group submitting at least one concern over 8 weeks compared to the paper form group: 56.7% vs 87.9%. Weekly concerns were satisfactorily addressed in both groups and ≥70% of patients would continue to use the tools. For patients, both tools promoted preparation and participation in the encounter; however, only the web app facilitated greater privacy in relaying concerns. For most nephrologists, the tools were disruptive to their workflow and were perceived as unnecessary given existing processes and familiarity with patients. For future versions of the app, patients suggested more features to facilitate self-management and nephrologists suggested integration with health databases and multidisciplinary teams. LIMITATIONS: Tertiary setting may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Both tools promoted fundamental components of self-management; however, patients in the paper form group submitted concerns more often and this tool was easier to remember to use. Although modifications would likely enhance web app usability, successful future adoption is limited by physician acceptance.

This study assessed this mediating effect in college students. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants consisted of 1236 freshmen recruited at a local university. Symptoms of ADHD, IGD, depression and hopelessness were measured using self-report scales. The effect of ADHD on IGD mediated by depression and hopelessness was analyzed by Haye’s PROCESS macro for SPSS (Model 6) using the bias-corrected percentile bootstrap method with 5000 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS: Symptoms of ADHD, depression and hopelessness were common in college students and were strongly associated with the appearance of IGD symptoms. ADHD symptoms of college students impacted their IGD symptoms directly and indirectly via depressive symptoms and hopelessness. The total effect of ADHD symptoms on IGD symptoms was 0.075 (standard error [SE]: 0.009, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.057, 0.093), with a direct effect of 0.037 (SE: 0.010, 95% CI 0.018, 0.056, effect ratio: 49.3%), and total indirect effect was 0.038 (SE: 0.005, 95% CI 0.029, 0.050, effect ratio: 50.7%). CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms and hopelessness can mediate the relationship between ADHD and IGD symptoms among college students.

The emerging viewpoint of MUSes as the root causes of unsatisfiability has led MUSes to find applications in a wide variety of diagnostic approaches. Recent advances in identification and enumeration of MUSes have motivated researchers to discover applications that can benefit from rich information about the set of MUSes. One such extension is that of counting the number of MUSes. The current best approach for MUS counting is to employ a MUS enumeration algorithm, which often does not scale for the cases with a reasonably large number of MUSes. Motivated by the success of hashing-based techniques in the context of model counting, we design the first approximate MUS counting procedure with [Formula: see text] guarantees, called [Formula: see text]. Our approach avoids exhaustive MUS enumeration by combining the classical technique of universal hashing with advances in QBF solvers along with a novel usage of union and intersection of MUSes to achieve runtime efficiency. Our prototype implementation of [Formula: see text] is shown to scale to instances that were clearly beyond the realm of enumeration-based approaches.","Bendík, Jaroslav; Meel, Kuldeep S.",Computer Aided Verification,375,26

Early diagnosis is key for optimal management as delays in diagnosis are associated with worse outcomes. However, WRA is significantly underreported and the median time to diagnosis is 4 years. The objective of this review is to identify the gaps in awareness and reporting of WRA and identify gaps in current knowledge translation strategies for chronic disease in general, and asthma specifically. This will identify reasons for delays in WRA diagnosis, as well inform suggestions to improve knowledge translation strategies for dissemination and implementation of WRA prevention and management guidelines. METHODS: Non-systematic literature reviews were conducted on PubMed with a focus on work-related asthma screening and diagnosis, and knowledge translation or translational medicine research in asthma and chronic disease. In total, 3571 titles and abstracts were reviewed with no restriction on date published. Of those, 207 were relevant and fully read. Another 37 articles were included and reviewed after citation reviews of articles from the initial search and from suggestions from editors. In total, 63 articles were included in the final review. RESULTS: Patients, employers, and healthcare professionals lack awareness and under-report WRA which contribute to the delayed diagnosis of WRA, primarily through lack of education, stigma associated with WRA, and lack of awareness and screening in primary care. Knowledge translation strategies for asthma research typically involve the creation of guidelines for diagnosis of the disease, asthma care plans and tools for education and management. While there are some prevention programs in place for certain industries, gaps in knowledge translation strategies including lack of screening tools currently available for WRA, poor education of employers and physicians in identifying WRA, and education of patients is often done post-diagnosis and focuses on management rather than prevention or screening. CONCLUSION: Future knowledge translation strategies should focus on educating employees and employers well before potential exposure to agents associated with WRA and screening for WRA in primary care to enable health care providers to recognize and diagnose WRA.","MacKinnon, Madison; To, Teresa; Ramsey, Clare; Lemière, Catherine; Lougheed, M.

This study aimed to assess the US public's initial understanding about the disease and virus to inform public health communication efforts. METHODS We conducted a survey of US households from February 28 through March 2, 2020, using a probability-based web-panel survey of 1021 US residents. To assess knowledge about COVID-19, we asked respondents a series of 16 true/false questions. We conducted descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses to examine differences in knowledge scores based on demographic and background characteristics. RESULTS Knowledge about COVID-19 and the virus was relatively low overall at the beginning of the outbreak, with average scores of 62% on a 16-item knowledge index (ie, answers for 6 of the 16 questions were incorrect or unknown). Knowledge was especially low among people who had low education and income levels, were unemployed, were Hispanic, were non-Hispanic Black, were aged 18-24 and 35-49, indicated having ""other"" health insurance, and had limited exposure to information about the pandemic. Non-Hispanic Black respondents were less knowledgeable about COVID-19 and the virus at every education level compared with non-Hispanic White respondents at higher education levels. Non-Hispanic Black respondents with <high school degree were the least knowledgeable of all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS The findings of our study highlight the need for widespread, ongoing public health education about the virus and COVID-19, especially among certain populations. It is critical to effectively translate complex clinical and epidemiologic evidence into messages that most people can understand and act on during a pandemic, that combat misinformation about the virus and COVID-19, and that consider low levels of health literacy.","McCormack, Lauren A; Squiers, Linda; Frasier, Alicia M; Lynch, Molly; Bann, Carla M; MacDonald, Pia D M",Public health reports,375,1

Furthermore, the immunologic effects of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (MVC), despite approval for clinical use, have not yet been well evaluated for their potential effects on cytotoxic T-cell responses. In this study, we characterized the development and function of CCR5+CD8+ T cells in rhesus macaques with or without Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. We also investigated the effects of the CCR5 antagonist MVC on functional CCR5+CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro. The data show that CCR5+CD8+ T cells have an effector memory phenotype and increase with age in systemic and mucosal lymphoid tissues as a heterogeneous population of polyfunctional CD8 T cells. In addition, CCR5 is highly expressed on SIV gag-specific (CM9+) CD8+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques, yet CCR5+CD8+ T cells are significantly reduced in mucosal lymphoid tissues with disease progression. Furthermore, in vitro MVC treatment reduced activation and cytokine secretion of CD8+ T cells via a CCR5-independent pathway. These findings suggest that surface CCR5 protein plays an important role in differentiation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Although MVC may be helpful in reducing chronic inflammation and activation, it may also inhibit virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus optimal use of CCR5 antagonists either alone or in combination with other drugs should be defined by further investigation.-Wang, X., Russell-Lodrigue, K. E., Ratterree, M. S., Veazey, R.

Outcomes from community based commercial weight management programmes vary, relapse is common and drop out is high. Outcomes could be improved by better understanding experiences on these programmes. The aim of our study was to generate accounts of people's experience on a commercial weight-management program to identify what experiences were perceived as facilitating, and what posed risks, to programme effectiveness and compliance. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with eighteen Caucasian women (mean age 45.4y) who were members of nation-wide UK commercial, fee-paying, community weight management programme. Interview data was analysed via framework analysis. Participants' experiences indicated that the programme helped by triggering several intra- and interpersonal processes that catalysed change across psychological, physiological, dietary and behavioural areas of their life. Risks to program adherence and effectiveness spanned well-known risks such as self-regulation fatigue and the difficulty of recovering from negative self-criticism, as well as new factors such as the confusing nature of weight change, the relatively powerful impact of everyday events, and the difficulty in getting the balance right between personalised support vs. intrusion. The complexity of reported experiences challenges the linear, predictive pathways of change proposed by many health behaviour models of weight management. To improve effectiveness, programmes need to go well beyond behavioural and dietary support. It is recommended that community, commercial programmes educate people about the physiological and psychological tensions they will encounter, why people lose weight at different rates, the likelihood of weight relapse and strategies to manage these, including evidence-based support for managing self-criticism.","Hugh-Jones, Siobhan; Burke, Shaunna; Stubbs, James",Appetite,375,1

Walking represents a popular physical activity that can produce a range of desirable health effects, particularly as people age. Objective To test the hypothesis that counseling by a computer-based virtual advisor is no worse than (ie, noninferior to) counseling by trained human advisors for increasing 12-month walking levels among inactive adults. Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster-randomized, noninferiority parallel trial enrolled 245 adults between July 21, 2014, and July 29, 2016, with follow-up through September 15, 2017. Data analysis was performed from March 15 to December 20, 2018. The evidence-derived noninferiority margin was 30 minutes of walking per week. Participants included inactive adults aged 50 years and older, primarily of Latin American descent and capable of walking without significant limitations, from 10 community centers in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, California. Interventions All participants received similar evidence-based, 12-month physical activity counseling at their local community center, with the 10 centers randomized to a computerized virtual advisor program (virtual) or a previously validated peer advisor program (human). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in walking minutes per week over 12 months using validated interview assessment corroborated with accelerometry. Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results Among the 245 participants randomized, 193 were women (78.8%) and 241 participants (98.4%) were Latino. Mean (SD) age was 62.3 (8.4) years (range, 50-87 years), 107 individuals (43.7%) had high school or less educational level, mean BMI was 32.8 (6.8), and mean years residence in the US was 47.4 (17.0) years. A total of 231 participants (94.3%) completed the study. Mean 12-month change in walking was 153.9 min/wk (95% CI, 126.3 min/wk to infinity) for the virtual cohort (n = 123) and 131.9 min/wk (95% CI, 101.4 min/wk to infinity) for the human cohort (n = 122) (difference, 22.0, with lower limit of 1-sided 95% CI, -20.6 to infinity; P = .02); this finding supports noninferiority. Improvements emerged in both arms for relevant clinical risk factors, sedentary behavior, and well-being measures. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study indicate that a virtual advisor using evidence-based strategies produces significant 12-month walking increases for older, lower-income Latino adults that are no worse than the significant improvements achieved by human advisors. Changes produced by both programs are commensurate with those reported in previous investigations of these behavioral interventions and provide support for broadening the range of light-touch physical activity programs that can be offered to a diverse population.

Sialic acids are a group of nine-carbon acidic α-keto sugars, usually located at the end of glycans of cell surface glycoconjugates and serve as attachment sites for previous HCoVs. It is therefore speculated that sialic acids on the host cell surface could serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry as well. Recent in-silico modeling, molecular modeling predictions and microscopy studies indicate potential sialic acid-binding by SARS-CoV-2 upon cell entry. In particular, a flat sialic acid-binding domain was proposed at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which may lead to the initial contact and interaction of the virus on the epithelium followed by higher affinity binding to ACE2 receptor, likely a two-step attachment fashion. However, recent in vitro and ex vivo studies of sialic acids on ACE2 receptor confirmed an opposite role for SARS-CoV-2 binding. In particular, neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells and ACE2-expressing 293 T cells increased SARS-CoV-2 binding. Further, the ACE2 glycosylation mutants indicate that sialic acids on ACE2 receptor prevent ACE2-spike protein interaction. On the other hand, a most recent study indicates that gangliosides could serve as ligands for receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This Mini-review discusses what has been predicted and known so far about the role of sialic acid for SARS-CoV-2 infection and future research perspective.","Sun, Xue-Long",Glycobiology,375,31

More than 90% of people with mental illness do not get any treatment and tens of thousands of people with psychosis are illegally detained ('pasung') in the family home. Civic engagement, a core part of the recent World Health Organisation global strategy, has the potential to address some of these challenges through the development of person-centered models of care. The aim of the study is to develop a testable systems level, culturally appropriate, civic engagement framework for use in Jakarta and Bogor, Indonesia to strengthen local mental health services. Methods A mixed methods study underpinned by a realist approach will be undertaken across four phases in two study sites in Indonesia (Jakarta and Bogor). Phase 1 will explore the use of civic engagement across South East Asia by conducting a systematic review of existing evidence. By surveying 300 mental health professionals, phase 2 will identify the stakeholders, the sources of collaboration and the evidence used by professionals in decision making within local mental health systems and identify potential opportunities for civic engagement within the system. In order to explore the potential use of civic engagement within Indonesian mental health services and identify priorities for a culturally appropriate framework, phase 3 will undertake two focus groups with participants with experience of psychosis or caring for someone with psychosis (n = 20-30). Professionals and other key decision makers in a range of roles across the system at a national (n = 5) and local level (n = 10-15/site) will also take part in semi-structured interviews. Phase 4 will co-produce a civic engagement framework for use in Indonesia by synthesising evidence from phases 1-3 collaboratively with key stakeholders. Discussion Civic engagement is a potential way in which health services in low and middle income countries can address the burden of mental health conditions through the development of person-centred models of care. However, such approaches are underexplored in Indonesia. This study will work with local stakeholders to design a testable civic engagement framework for use in mental health services in Indonesia.","Brooks, Helen; James, Karen; Irmansyah, I; Keliat, Budi-Anna; Utomo, Bagus; Rose, Diana; Colucci, Erminia; Lovell, Karina",International journal of mental health systems,375,31

However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Liver centers should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplant programs need to consider offering some leniency to patients with AUD/ALD who cannot obtain alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","Da, Ben L; Im, Gene Y; Schiano, Thomas D",Hepatology,375,1

Of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples submitted for RV15 testing, 199 retrospectively collected positive specimens and 283 prospectively collected specimens were further tested with RV16 and xTAG. A true-positive result was defined as a positive result from all three methods or RV16 and xTAG or RV15 and xTAG. For specimens with discrepant results, monoplex PCR and sequencing of the target viruses were performed. In total, 300 virus-positive specimens yielded 386 viruses. When the bocavirus results were excluded, the overall sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and xTAG were 95.2%, 93.3%, and 87.2%, respectively (95% confidence intervals, 93.0 to 97.4%, 90.8 to 95.8%, and 83.8 to 90.6%, respectively). RV16 was more sensitive than xTAG for coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (100% versus 26.1%; P < 0.0001) and adenovirus (100% versus 79.5%; P < 0.01) but was less sensitive than xTAG for rhinovirus/enterovirus (89.4% versus 97.9%; P < 0.05).

Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) is the receptor for IL6. It may be closely connected to the development of lung cancer. This research aims to explore the prognostic value of IL6R and prevent overtreatment of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods In this study, the expression of IL6R in tumor tissues and surrounding tissues was first analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (NTU) cohort. Secondly, we downloaded information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for the TCGA cohort and used this information to explore the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of IL6R. We then used Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, nomogram models, and decision curve analyses to assess the prognostic value of IL6R. In addition, we also analyzed immune cell infiltration and the signaling pathways related to IL6R through Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results Through the data analysis of the NTU cohort and the TCGA cohort, it was found that the expression of IL6R in normal tissues around the tumor was higher than that in tumor tissue, and was positively correlated with the overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. Additionally, low expression of IL6R was found to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis among the patients in these two research cohorts. Next, using GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses, we found that partially infiltrated tumor immune cells might be related to earlier staging and better prognosis of patients with LUAD. Finally, the study of the 3-5-year survival rate of LUAD patients through the nomogram showed that the expression of IL6R could improve the accuracy of prediction to prevent the overtreatment of some LUAD patients. Conclusions In summary, our study indicated that the low expression of IL6R was associated with poor prognosis among LUAD patients and that low expression of IL6R is a potential independent risk factor that could provide a basis for strengthening postoperative classification management of such patients.","Sun, Gaofeng; Wang, Tianyi; Shi, Muqi; Zhou, Hao; Wang, Jinjie; Huang, Zhanghao; Zhang, Haijian; Shi, Jiahai",Annals of translational medicine,375,1

The purpose of this study is to compare the image quality of conventional radiographic views of the traumatized pelvis to virtual radiographs created from pelvic CT scans. METHODS Five patients with acetabular fractures and ten patients with pelvic ring injuries were identified using the orthopedic trauma database at our institution. These fractures were evaluated with both conventional radiographs as well as virtual radiographs generated from a CT scan.

This maneuver is thought to minimize the risk of elevated ICP in the hopes of decreasing cerebral blood and fluid volume and increasing cerebral venous outflow with improvement in jugular venous drainage. However, HOB elevation is based on adult population data due to a current paucity of pediatric TBI studies regarding HOB management. In this prospective study of pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors investigated the role of different head positions on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral venous outflow through the internal jugular veins (IJVs) on postinjury days 2 and 3 because these time periods are considered the peak risk for intracranial hypertension. METHODS Patients younger than 18 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8 after severe TBI were prospectively recruited at a single quaternary pediatric intensive care unit. All patients had an ICP monitor placed, and no other neurosurgical procedure was performed. On the 2nd and 3rd days postinjury, the degree of HOB elevation was varied between 0° (head-flat or horizontal), 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, and 50° while ICP, CPP, and bilateral IJV blood flows were recorded. RESULTS Eighteen pediatric patients with severe TBI were analyzed. On each postinjury day, 13 of the 18 patients had at least 1 optimal HOB position (the position that simultaneously demonstrated the lowest ICP and the highest CPP). Six patients on each postinjury day had 30° as the optimal HOB position, with only 2 being the same patient on both postinjury days. On postinjury day 2, 3 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position, while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. On postinjury day 3, 2 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. Interestingly, 0° (head-flat or horizontal) was the optimal HOB position in 2 patients on postinjury day 2 and 3 patients on postinjury day 3. The optimal HOB position demonstrated lower right IJV blood flow than a nonoptimal position on both postinjury days 2 (p = 0.0023) and 3 (p = 0.0033). There was no significant difference between optimal and nonoptimal HOB positions in the left IJV blood flow. CONCLUSIONS In pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors demonstrated that the optimal HOB position (which decreases ICP and improves CPP) is not always at 30°. Instead, the optimal HOB should be individualized for each pediatric TBI patient on a daily basis.","Lang, Shih-Shan; Valeri, Amber; Zhang, Bingqing; Storm, Phillip B; Heuer, Gregory G; Leavesley, Lauren; Bellah, Richard; Kim, Chong Tae; Griffis, Heather; Kilbaugh, Todd J; Huh, Jimmy W",Journal of neurosurgery.

Liver fibrosis is the major determinant of long-term outcomes in NAFLD. A non-invasive tool that accurately identifies obese patients at elevated risk of liver fibrosis would be of significant value. Fibrosis risk scores in patients with NAFLD have been proposed but have not been validated in obese populations. We aimed to validate established simple fibrosis scores in bariatric surgical patients. METHODS We conducted a prospective study of 107 consecutive high-risk obese patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery. Proposed fibrosis scores (NAFLD fibrosis score; body mass index (BMI), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase ratio (ALT), and diabetes (BARD); Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4); Forn; and AST to platelet ratio index) were calculated and compared hepatic fibrosis determined by histology of intraoperative liver biopsies. Accuracy was determined, and fibrosis score thresholds were optimized. These modified thresholds were then validated in an independent bariatric surgical population. RESULTS Liver biopsies were available in 101 patients. Sixty-eight patients had some degree of fibrosis, with 23 patients (23 %) having significant fibrosis (F2-4). The Forn score best predicted significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.724, p = 0.001). With standard thresholds, the sensitivity for the Forn score for identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4) was 0 %. Using modified thresholds of 3.5, the sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 85.7 and 94.7 %. This threshold was applied to an independent validation cohort with good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Fibrosis risk scores using simple markers have moderate success at delineating obese patients with significant NAFLD-related fibrosis. Thresholds, however, need to be lowered to maximize diagnostic accuracy in this cohort.","Ooi, Geraldine J; Burton, Paul R; Doyle, Lisa; Wentworth, John M; Bhathal, Prithi S; Sikaris, Ken; Cowley, Michael A; Roberts, Stuart K; Kemp, William; O'Brien, Paul E; Brown, Wendy A",Obesity surgery,375,16

This hybrid stent device formed by fractal mesh structures provides a flow-diverting effect and stent-assisted coil embolization. Flow-diverter stents decrease blood flow into an aneurysm to prevent its rupture. In general, the mesh size of a flow-diverter stent needs to be small enough to prevent blood flow into the aneurysm. Conventional flow-diverter stents are not available for stent-assisted coil embolization, which is an effective method for aneurysm occlusion, because the mesh size is too small to insert a micro-catheter for coil embolization. The proposed hybrid stent device is capable of stent-assisted coil embolization while simultaneously providing a flow-diverting effect. The fractal stent device is composed of mesh structures with fine and rough mesh areas. The rough mesh area can be used to insert a micro-catheter for stent-assisted coil embolization. Flow-diverting effects of two fractal stent designs were composed to three commercially available stent designs. Flow-diverting effects were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiment. Based on the CFD and PIV results, the fractal stent devices reduce the flow velocity inside an aneurism just as much as the commercially available flow-diverting stents while allowing stent-assisted coil embolization.","Kojima, Masahiro; Irie, Keiko; Masunaga, Kouhei; Sakai, Yasuhiko; Nakajima, Masahiro; Takeuchi, Masaru; Fukuda, Toshio; Arai, Fumihito; Negoro, Makoto",Medical & biological engineering & computing,375,1

METHODS A nationwide online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Qatar from 15th October 2020 to 15th November 2020 with voluntary participation open to all adult residents. Of the respondents, the population group for this study comprised the 341 pregnant and breastfeeding participants. The survey utilized a composite questionnaire incorporating a validated instrument to measure vaccine attitudes. The responses were recorded and analysed with statistical analysis being performed with SPSS software. Outcome measures included intentions towards vaccination and potential factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (contextual factors, vaccine specific concerns and group/individual influences). RESULTS Perinatal women exhibited a vaccine hesitancy rate of 25% towards COVID-19 immunisation. The main concerns of the group were of infection risks and main factor determining vaccine hesitancy was of vaccine specific safety concerns. Previous vaccine ""acceptors"" showed vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 immunisation. A third of the group cited non availability of the vaccine as a concern. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 vaccine trials amongst pregnant and lactating women have lagged behind those for general populations and this has compounded concerns around safety in this special group. Perinatal women constitute a vulnerable group and play an important role in vaccination of wider family members. This study highlights the need for trials and data for COVID-19 vaccine in this group to be able to achieve appreciable numbers needed for herd immunity and ultimately control of the pandemic.","Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Lindow, Stephen; Alabdulla, Majid",Journal of perinatal medicine,375,16

RESULTS Four overarching themes were identified that included dimensions of health and wellbeing; whanaungatanga (connectedness); whakawhanaungatanga (building relationships); and socio-political health context (colonisation, urbanisation, racism, and marginalisation). Health and wellbeing for Māori is a holistic and relational concept. Building relationships that include whānau (extended family) is a cultural imperative. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance and relevance of relational approaches to engaging Māori and their whānau accessing health services. It signals the necessary foundations for health practitioners to build trust-based relationships with Māori. Key elements for a Māori-centred model of relational care include whakawhanaungatanga (the process of building relationships) using tikanga (cultural protocols and processes) informed by cultural values of aroha (compassion and empathy), manaakitanga (kindness and hospitality), mauri (binding energy), wairua (importance of spiritual wellbeing). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Culturally-based models of health and wellbeing provide indicators of important cultural values, concepts and practices and processes. These can then inform the development of a Māori-centred relational model of care to address inequity.","Wilson, Denise; Moloney, Eleanor; Parr, Jenny M; Aspinall, Cathleen; Slark, Julia",Journal of clinical nursing,375,12

With about 1 million new STIs a day globally, up-to-date evidence is urgently needed. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of mobile health interventions delivered to participants for preventing STIs and promoting preventive behaviour. METHODS We searched seven databases and reference lists of 49 related reviews (January 1990-February 2020) and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials of mobile interventions delivered to adolescents and adults to prevent sexual transmission of STIs. We conducted meta-analyses and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence following Cochrane guidance. RESULTS After double screening 6683 records, we included 22 trials into the systematic review and 20 into meta-analyses; 18 trials used text messages, 3 used smartphone applications and 1 used Facebook messages as delivery modes. The certainty of evidence regarding intervention effects on STI/HIV occurrence and adverse events was low or very low. There was moderate certainty of evidence that in the short/medium-term text messaging interventions had little or no effect on condom use (standardised mean differences (SMD) 0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.14, nine trials), but increased STI/HIV testing (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.36, seven trials), although not if the standard-of-care control already contained an active text messaging component (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47, two trials). Smartphone application messages also increased STI/HIV testing (risk ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.60, subgroup analysis, two trials). The effects on other outcomes or of social media or blended interventions is uncertain due to low or very low certainty evidence. CONCLUSIONS Text messaging interventions probably increase STI/HIV testing but not condom use in the short/medium term. Ongoing trials will report the effects on biological and other outcomes.","Berendes, Sima; Gubijev, Anasztazia; McCarthy, Ona L; Palmer, Melissa J; Wilson, Emma; Free, Caroline",Sexually transmitted infections,375,16

Weight gain and sub-optimal dietary choices are common in young adults, and social media may be a potential tool to facilitate and support healthier choices. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of studies examining social media use for nutrition-related outcomes in young adults. Seven databases [EBscohost, ERIC, ProQuest Central, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Emerald] were systematically searched; 1225 abstracts were screened, and 47 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Study designs included both quantitative, such as experimental and observational studies, and qualitative, such as focus groups and interviews, approaches. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative results were examined separately, and then synthesized. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included although their use of social media was highly variable. The main purpose of social media was to provide information and social support to participants. In the nine randomized controlled trials, social media was used as one aspect of a multi-faceted intervention. Interventions had a positive statistically significant impact on nutritional outcomes in 1/9 trials. Engagement with the social media component of interventions varied, from 3 to 69%. Young adults appear to be open to receiving healthy eating and recipe tips through social media, however, they are reluctant to share personal weight-related information on their online social networks. CONCLUSIONS Information-dissemination is now an acceptable use of social media by young adults. Using social media effectively for social support, either via private groups or public pages, requires careful evaluation as its effectiveness is yet to be demonstrated in experimental designs. Concerns about public social media use may be a contributing factor to poor engagement with social media in research intervention studies aimed at influencing weight. Future research should consider how to best engage with young adults using social media, how to more effectively use social media to support young adults and to facilitate social and peer-to-peer support in making healthier choices.","Klassen, Karen M; Douglass, Caitlin H; Brennan, Linda; Truby, Helen; Lim, Megan S C",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,375,1

There is limited information regarding the toxicity of NEP, however the few published reports suggest that NEP can cause serious toxic effects and sudden death. The purpose of this publication is to describe a validated LC-MS/MS method for seven synthetic cathinones (methylone, ethylone, butylone, dibutylone, α-PVP, pentylone, and NEP) and to present a detailed summary regarding the presence of NEP in postmortem casework at the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner Department. Post-mortem iliac blood, serum, liver, and brain specimens were prepared by solid-phase extraction with analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS). Analyte linearity was established from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/L on a six-point calibration curve. A total of 101 NEP quantitations were performed using this method. Concentrations in postmortem case samples ranged from 0.01 mg/L to 2.7 mg/L. Iliac blood concentrations averaged 0.312 mg/L with a median of 0.137 mg/L (n=72) across all causes and manners of death. Approximately half of the cases were homicides in which the decedent was the victim of gunshot wounds or stabbing. Two of the three highest concentration cases of NEP (2.7 mg/L and 1.7 mg/L) involved 38-year old white males who were tasered by police prior to death. The psychostimulant effect of NEP may result in an excited delirium and/or hallucinogenic state. The concentration of NEP detected in accidental intoxication and polydrug cases overlapped with those attributed to other causes, including homicides and police involved deaths.","Giachetti, Alexander D; Kahl, Joseph H; Zaney, M Elizabeth; Hime, George W; Boland, Diane M",Journal of analytical toxicology,375,1

Racial and ethnic minorities and other medically-underserved populations exhibit lower uptake of cancer screening than non-minorities in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities, has curtailed preventive services including cancer screening in order to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of infection. While there is evidence for a rebound from the pandemic-driven reduction in cancer screening nationally, the return may not be even across all populations, with minority population screening that was already behind becoming further behind as a result of the community ravages from COVID-19. Fear of contracting COVID-19, limited access to safety-net clinics, and personal financial, employment, and transportation issues are concerns that are intensified in medically-underserved communities. Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests, and keeping the COVID-19-induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.","Carethers, John M; Sengupta, Rajarshi; Blakey, Rea; Ribas, Antoni; D'Souza, Gypsyamber",Cancer prevention research,375,13

Knowledge and consensus on this topic are scarce, making quality measurement of P-EMS a high-priority research area. The aim of this review was to identify, describe and evaluate studies of quality measurement in P-EMS. DATA SOURCES The databases of MEDLINE and Embase were searched initially, followed by a search for included article citations in Scopus. STUDY SELECTION The study eligibility criteria were: (1) articles describing the use of one quality indicator (QI) or more in P-EMS, (2) original manuscripts, (3) articles published from 1 January 1968 until 5 October 2016. The literature search identified 4699 records. 4543 were excluded after reviewing title and abstract. An additional 129 were excluded based on a full-text review. The remaining 27 papers were included in the analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using an adapted critical appraisal tool. DATA EXTRACTION The description of used QIs and methods of quality measurement was extracted. Variables describing the involved P-EMSs were extracted as well. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS In the included papers, a common understanding of which QIs to use in P-EMS did not exist. Fifteen papers used only a single QI. The most widely used QIs were 'Adherence to medical protocols', 'Provision of advanced interventions', 'Response time' and 'Adverse events'. CONCLUSION The review demonstrated a lack of shared understanding of which QIs to use in P-EMS. Moreover, papers using only one QI dominated the literature, thus increasing the risk of a narrow perspective in quality measurement. Future quality measurement in P-EMS should rely on a set of consensus-based QIs, ensuring a comprehensive approach to quality measurement.","Haugland, Helge; Uleberg, Oddvar; Klepstad, Pål; Krüger, Andreas; Rehn, Marius",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,375,8

Strong evidence now demonstrates that bariatric procedures markedly improve or cause remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in part through weight-independent mechanisms, and that baseline BMI does not predict surgical benefits on glycemic or cardiovascular outcomes. This impels consideration of such operations as ""metabolic surgery,"" which is used expressly to treat T2DM, including among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2) who constitute the majority of people with diabetes worldwide. Here, we review available evidence to inform that consideration. RESULTS A meta-analysis of the 11 published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) directly comparing bariatric/metabolic surgery versus a variety of medical/lifestyle interventions for T2DM provides level 1A evidence that surgery is superior for T2DM remission, glycemic control, and HbA1c lowering. Importantly, this is equally true for patients whose baseline BMI is below or above 35 kg/m(2). Similar conclusions derive from meta-analyses of high-quality nonrandomized prospective comparisons. Meta-analysis of all pertinent published studies indicates that T2DM remission rates following bariatric/metabolic surgery are comparable above and below the 35 kg/m(2) BMI threshold. The safety, antidiabetes durability, and benefits on other cardiovascular risk factors from bariatric/metabolic surgery appear roughly comparable among patients with a BMI below or above 35 kg/m(2). Further studies are needed to extend long-term findings and measure ""hard"" macrovascular/microvascular outcomes and mortality in RCTs. CONCLUSIONS Extant data, including level 1A evidence from numerous RCTs, support new guidelines from the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit that advocate for the consideration of bariatric/metabolic surgery as one option, along with lifestyle and medical therapy, to treat T2DM among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2).","Cummings, David E; Cohen, Ricardo V",Diabetes care,375,16

Valproic acid (VPA) inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) function and probably promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation; however, the relevant molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, focal demyelinating lesions (FDLs) were generated in mice by two-point stereotactic injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus callosum. Cognitive functions, sensorimotor abilities and histopathological changes were assessed for up to 28 days post-injury with or without VPA treatment. Primary OPCs were harvested and used to study the effect of VPA on OPC differentiation under inflammatory conditions. VPA dose-dependently attenuated learning and memory deficits and robustly protected white matter after FDL induction, as demonstrated by reductions in SMI-32 and increases in myelin basic protein staining. VPA also promoted OPC proliferation and differentiation and increased subsequent remyelination efficiency by day 28 post-FDL induction. VPA treatment did not affect HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC8 expression but reduced HDAC3 protein levels. In vitro, VPA improved the survival of mouse OPCs and promoted their differentiation into oligodendrocytes following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. LPS caused OPCs to overexpress HDAC3, which translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it directly interacted with the nuclear transcription factor PPAR-γ and negatively regulated PPAR-γ expression. VPA decreased the expression of HDAC3 and promoted remyelination and functional neurological recovery after FDL. These findings may support the use of strategies modulating HDAC3-mediated regulation of protein acetylation for the treatment of demyelination-related cognitive dysfunction.","Ding, Lingzhi; Zhou, Jiamin; Ye, Lisa; Sun, Yechao; Jiang, Zhenglin; Gan, Deqiang; Xu, Lihua; Luo, Qianqian; Wang, Guohua",Molecular neurobiology,375,1

BACKGROUND CLI is an advanced form of peripheral arterial disease associated with nonhealing arterial ulcers and high rates of MACCE and major amputation. Although statin medications are recommended for secondary prevention in peripheral arterial disease, their effectiveness in CLI is uncertain. METHODS We reviewed 380 CLI patients who underwent diagnostic angiography or therapeutic endovascular intervention from 2006 through 2012. Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to adjust for baseline differences between patients taking and not taking statins. RESULTS Statins were prescribed for 246 (65%) patients. The mean serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level was lower in patients prescribed statins (75 ± 28 mg/dl vs. 96 ± 40 mg/dl, p < 0.001). Patients prescribed statins had more baseline comorbidities including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, as well as more extensive lower extremity disease (all p values <0.05). After propensity weighting, statin therapy was associated with lower 1-year rates of MACCE (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28 to 0.99), mortality (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.97), and major amputation or death (HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.98). Statin use was also associated with improved lesion patency among patients undergoing infrapopliteal angioplasty. Patients with LDL levels >130 mg/dl had increased HRs of MACCE and mortality compared with patients with lower levels of LDL. CONCLUSIONS Statins are associated with lower rates of mortality and MACCE and increased amputation-free survival in CLI patients.","Westin, Gregory G; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Bang, Heejung; Yeo, Khung-Keong; Anderson, David; Dawson, David L; Pevec, William C; Amsterdam, Ezra A; Laird, John R",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,375,1

Specific stress stimuli prompt dedicated stress kinases to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2) in turn sequesters the eIF2-specific guanine exchange factor eIF2B to block eIF2 recycling, thereby halting translation initiation and reducing global protein synthesis. To circumvent stress-induced translational shutdown, viruses encode ISR antagonists. Those identified so far prevent or reverse eIF2 phosphorylation. We now describe two viral proteins-one from a coronavirus and the other from a picornavirus-that have independently acquired the ability to counteract the ISR at its very core by acting as a competitive inhibitor of p-eIF2-eIF2B interaction. This allows continued formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex and unabated global translation at high p-eIF2 levels that would otherwise cause translational arrest. We conclude that eIF2 and p-eIF2 differ in their interaction with eIF2B to such effect that p-eIF2-eIF2B association can be selectively inhibited.","Rabouw, Huib H; Visser, Linda J; Passchier, Tim C; Langereis, Martijn A; Liu, Fan; Giansanti, Piero; van Vliet, Arno L W; Dekker, José G; van der Grein, Susanne G; Saucedo, Jesús G; Anand, Aditya A; Trellet, Mikael E; Bonvin, Alexandre M J J; Walter, Peter; Heck, Albert J R; de Groot, Raoul J; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Nature microbiology,375,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between August 2011 and February 2013, a total of 387 prostate biopsies were performed. Serum or plasma concentrations of 22 biomarkers (neopterin, IGF-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, sarcosine, endoglin, TGF-β1, periostin, sPLA2-IIa, chromogranin A, ZAG2, clusterin, PSP94, PSP94bp, leptin, cathepsin D, hepsin, KLK11, PSMA, AMACR, CRISP3 and A1AT) were determined. Biomarker levels were correlated with the prostate biopsy results. Several statistical models for PC detection were created. RESULTS A total of 167 of the 373 evaluated patients (44.8%) were diagnosed with PC. None of the tested biomarkers reached statistical significance using the univariate analysis. However, the level of serum clusterin was not associated with any other tested parameter. Several basic models showed a higher positive predictive value than individual parameters. Addition of serum clusterin to the base model with prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal exam and prostate size significantly improved the area under curve value (0.723 vs. 0.716). CONCLUSION Our findings suggested that multiple serum assays based on some promising markers may only have a limited practical benefit for the prediction of PC in the prostate biopsy.","Čapoun, Otakar; Soukup, Viktor; Kalousová, Marta; Sobotka, Roman; Pešl, Michael; Zima, Tomáš; Hanuš, Tomáš",Urologia internationalis,375,31

Discussion centers on implications of these findings as well as the importance of identifying ways to mitigate the effects of these necessary but costly measures on health and wellbeing.","Ford, Máire B",The Journal of general psychology,375,30

We tested the hypothesis that diabetes is a risk factor for poor early outcomes, after adjustment for obesity, among a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used data from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) COVID-19 Data Registry of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020. Primary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, and death within 14 days of presentation to care. Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic characteristics, obesity, and relevant comorbidities. RESULTS Among 450 patients, 178 (39.6%) had diabetes-mostly type 2 diabetes. Among patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, a higher proportion was admitted to the ICU (42.1% vs. 29.8%, respectively, P = 0.007), required mechanical ventilation (37.1% vs. 23.2%, P = 0.001), and died (15.9% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.009). In multivariable logistic regression models, diabetes was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (odds ratio 1.59 [95% CI 1.01-2.52]), mechanical ventilation (1.97 [1.21-3.20]), and death (2.02 [1.01-4.03]) at 14 days. Obesity was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (2.16 [1.20-3.88]) and mechanical ventilation (2.13 [1.14-4.00]) but not with death. CONCLUSIONS Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with poor early outcomes, after adjustment for obesity. These findings can help inform patient-centered care decision making for people with diabetes at risk for COVID-19.","Seiglie, Jacqueline; Platt, Jesse; Cromer, Sara Jane; Bunda, Bridget; Foulkes, Andrea S; Bassett, Ingrid V; Hsu, John; Meigs, James B; Leong, Aaron; Putman, Melissa S; Triant, Virginia A; Wexler, Deborah J; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer",Diabetes care,375,28

However, studies also suggest that insufficient closure of the mesh slit may lead to recurrences. Aim: This report describes a novel technique using AbsorbaTacks (Covidien) to close the mesh slit and refashion an artificial ‘deep ring’ to minimize recurrence. Technique: We report the case of a fit 82-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a recurrent large right indirect inguinoscrotal hernia (8 x 8 × 7 cm with 4 × 4 cm deep inguinal ring). The patient underwent a TAPP repair with a background of unsuccessful open repair by another surgeon previously. Following mesh deployment, the mesh was lifted up by the cord structures, which was under tension due to a large defect. A slit was made in the inferomedial aspect of the mesh. This allowed it to be wrapped around the cord structures. The overlapped trouser flaps were then stapled together encircling the cord, by AbsorbaTacks to create a secure artificial ‘deep ring’. Edges of the mesh were also standardly affixed by AbsorbaTacks to the pectineal ligament and posterior abdominal wall. This creates a secure four-point fixation of the mesh scaffold to prevent ‘windsock’ effect, which happens when the mesh is pushed into the widened deep inguinal ring, leading to early recurrences. The peritoneal incision was also closed with AbsorbaTacks. Conclusion: No complications were registered during the early postoperative period. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged within 20 hours with simple analgesia. No recurrence was reported during the 6 months follow-up period. Clinical significance: The anchoring of a slit mesh with tackers around the cord structures can be used to repair large recurrent inguinal hernias laparoscopically following an open repair. This technique potentially minimizes further recurrences. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers. 2021.","Chong, H. L.; Taib, A.; Wilson, A. N.; Khan, M.

Furthermore, it is evident from scientific literature that the incidence of deaths and hospitalizations has been increasingly more among COVID-19 subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Another emerging significant concern is the varying presentations of COVID-19 and side effects due to the medication used in the management of COVID-19 patients. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the possible association between CVD and COVID-19 with emphasis on the pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations, and impact of medications used for COVID-19 on cardiovascular health. Based on the available literature, we conclude that though CVD could not be reckoned as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, it is evident that pre-existing CVD has an influence on the severity of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. Relevance for Patients Literature suggests that people with pre-existing CVD are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated severity. Consequently, it becomes important to thoroughly gain insights into the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 treatment on the cardiovascular system.","Vudathaneni, Vijaya Krishna Prasad; Nadella, Swetha Bharathi; Lanke, Rama Brahmam; Boyapati, Ramanarayana",Journal of clinical and translational research,375,30

To study the insertion mechanism of this protein, domains potentially involved in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in several ways. Mutant proteins were synthesized in a cell-free translation system in the presence of microsomal membranes, and their integration and topology were determined by alkaline extraction and by protease-protection experiments. By expression in COS-1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells, the topology of the mutant proteins was also analyzed in vivo. Glycosylation was used as a biochemical marker to assess the disposition of the NH2 terminus. An indirect immunofluorescence assay on semi-intact Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells using domain-specific antibodies served to identify the cytoplasmically exposed domains. The results show that each membrane-spanning domain acts independently as an insertion and anchor signal and adopts an intrinsic preferred orientation in the lipid bilayer which corresponds to the disposition of the transmembrane domain in the wild-type assembled protein. These observations provide further insight into the mechanism of membrane integration of multispanning proteins. A model for the insertion of the coronavirus M protein is proposed.","Locker, J K; Rose, J K; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",The Journal of biological chemistry,375,22

The first experiment evaluated the use of the infant mouse test for detection of ST in the feces of calves with naturally occurring diarrhea. Simultaneous identification of bovine enteropathogenic strains of E coli (EEC) and of other infective agents implicated in neonatal calf diarrhea was attempted in these samples. The ST was detected with certainty in only 7 of 41 samples from calves less than or equal to 3 weeks old. Enteropathogenic E coli, however, was detected in 27 samples. In 23 of these 27 samples, EEC was the only recognizable diarrheagenic agent. In a small percentage of the samples, Salmonella, rotavirus, coronavirus, and cryptosporidium were recognized alone, in combination with each other, or with EEC. In the second experiment, 6 calves were fed colostrum from cows inoculated with the bovine EEC strain B44; 6 were given colostrum from cows vaccinated with non-EEC strain 28F, and 4 were given milk from nonvaccinated heifers. Two of the calves that were given colostrum from cows inoculated with strain B44 were challenge exposed with the non-EEC strain 28F. The remaining calves were challenge exposed with the EEc strain B44. Fecal samples were taken from these calves at intervals and were examined for the presence of ST and of the challenge-exposure organism. The ST was detected in approximately one half of the fecal samples obtained, and it was most often detected in the early stages of the induced diarrhea. Calves were observed to shed the challenge-exposure EEC strain for long periods in the absence of diarrhea or detectable amounts of ST in the feces. The ST was detectable in fecal samples when the diarrhea was severe and when the dry matter content of the fecal samples was low.","Acosta-Martinez, F; Gyles, C L; Butler, D G",American journal of veterinary research,375,10

DESIGN Descriptive study. SETTING A tertiary hospital in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS Patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who contracted SARS in Singapore General Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Probable SARS as defined by the World Health Organization. RESULTS The index patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, initially without changes to his chest radiograph. Altogether 24 healthcare workers, 15 patients, and 12 family members and visitors were infected. The incubation period ranged from three to eight days. Only 13 patients were isolated on their dates of onset. CONCLUSIONS Atypical presentation of SARS infection must be taken into consideration when managing patients with a history of contact with SARS patients. The main gap in the containment strategy in this outbreak was the failure to identify the index patient as someone who had been discharged from a ward in another hospital that managed probable SARS cases. Strict infection control measures, a good surveillance system, early introduction of isolation procedures, and vigilant healthcare professionals are essential for controlling outbreaks.","Chow, Khuan Yew; Lee, Chien Earn; Ling, Moi Lin; Heng, Derrick Mok Kwee; Yap, Soon Ghee",BMJ,375,10

Method This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with a total of 1060 participants from Turkey's 65 provinces. The research data were collected through an online questionnaire consisting of three parts: “Personal Information Form”, “The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS)” and “World Health Organization Life Quality Scale-Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF)”. Independent two-group t-test (Student's t-test), and one-way ANOVA test were used to compare the means of groups. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was calculated to determine the level of correlation between two independent continuous variables. A value of p &lt; .05 was accepted as the threshold for statistical significance. Results The fear levels of women, married individuals and primary school graduates were found to be high, while quality of life was low among participants with poor economic status, those with COVID-19 symptoms and subjects who had been in close contact with a COVID-19-positive patient. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between the level of fear related to COVID-19 and quality of life (physical and psychological health).

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific region there are few new cases reported daily.",,,375,1

This raises the question whether a similar policy could control dangerous online 'infodemics' of information, misinformation and disinformation. Here we show, using multi-platform data from the COVID-19 infodemic, that its online spreading instead encompasses a different dynamical regime where communities and users within and across independent platforms, sporadically form temporary active links on similar timescales to the viral spreading. This allows material that might have died out, to evolve and even mutate. This has enabled niche networks that were already successfully spreading hate and anti-vaccination material, to rapidly become global super-spreaders of narratives featuring fake COVID-19 treatments, anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories. We derive new tools that incorporate these coupled social-viral dynamics, including an online $R$, to help prevent infodemic spreading at all scales: from spreading across platforms (e.g. Facebook, 4Chan) to spreading within a given subpopulation, or community, or topic. By accounting for similar social and viral timescales, the same mathematical theory also offers a quantitative description of other unconventional infection profiles such as rumors spreading in financial markets and colds spreading in schools.","Johnson, N.

Methods: An anonymous online survey was issued to Chinese healthcare workers (N=1063) from 31 provinces and autonomous regions between February 13th and February 20th. Mental health was measured by the Chinese Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Medical workplace violence was measured using a single item, whether any type of workplace violence was experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak. Propensity score matching was used to assess the impact of MWV on mental health. Results: Out of 1063, 217 (20.4%) reported experiencing MWV during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Insomnia is common in patients with COVID-19 admitted to mobile cabin hospitals. Insomnia may lead to immune dysfunction, a condition not conducive to recovery from COVID-19. The use of sedative-hypnotic drugs is limited by their inhibitory effect on the respiratory system. A paucity of research is available regarding psychotherapy interventions to improve insomnia symptoms among patients with COVID-19. In the general population, sleep problems are more common in women than in men; insomnia in women patients requires special attention. The aim of this study was to develop simplified-cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (S-CBTI) for patients with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms and to verify its effectiveness through a self-control trial. A second aim was to compare the effectiveness of S-CBTI between acute and chronic insomnia among women with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms in Wuhan Jianghan Cabin Hospital. METHODS: S-CBTI consisted of education on COVID-19 and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and self-suggestion relaxation training over a period of two consecutive weeks. Of 67 women, 66 completed psychological intervention and baseline and post-intervention assessments. There were 31 women with acute insomnia and 35 with chronic insomnia. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and self-compiled sleep data were assessed at baseline and post-intervention, and subjective sleep evaluations were assessed at days 4, 7, 12, and 14. RESULTS: The ISI score, sleep latency, night sleep time, and sleep efficiency were statistically significantlly improved from baseline to post-intervention by paired T-test. After the intervention, the mean ISI score of the acute insomnia group was lower than that of the chronic insomnia group. The reduction of the ISI score and the improvement of sleep time from baseline to post-intervention in the acute insomnia group were greater than those in the chronic insomnia group. Utilization of sedative-hypnotic drugs in the acute insomnia group was less than that in the chronic insomnia group, and the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: S-CBTI can improve the insomnia symptoms of women with COVID-19 in mobile cabin hospitals, especially for stress-related acute insomnia.","He, Jin; Yang, Lei; Pang, Jianyue; Dai, Lingling; Zhu, Jiaojiao; Deng, Yajie; He, Yi; Li, Hengfen",Sleep breath,375,33

Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths. METHODS: COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions. RESULTS: The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission. In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions. CONCLUSIONS: From the data available we propose a ""double-hit hypothesis"": chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression. This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences. High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome.","Frontera, Antonio; Cianfanelli, Lorenzo; Vlachos, Konstantinos; Landoni, Giovanni; Cremona, George",J Infect,375,1

The annual average number of flights taken by adults vary between 0.1 (visiting friends) and 0.8 (going on holiday), and the amount of CO2e emissions generated by each return flight is approximately 1100 kg. This leads to a total of 6 million tonnes CO2e emissions per year. Results of the Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood estimations reveal that the amount of CO2e emissions created is related to socio-demographic, locational and seasonal factors, although mainly for the largest group of travellers: the holiday makers. In this group, individuals with university degrees, young persons (16-24 years) and capital city residents generate the largest amounts of emissions, as opposed to persons with children and large households. Residents of the capital region each quarter cause 64 kg more CO2e emissions than inhabitants of rural areas, persons with university degrees create 74 kg larger emissions than those without degrees and young adults instigate 90 kg more emissions than middle-aged persons. CO2e emissions of holiday flights are highest in the first quarter of the year.

Significant predictors of infection included in-centre hemodialysis versus home dialysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-4.05), living in a long-term care residence (OR 7.67, 95% CI 5.30-11.11), living in the Greater Toronto Area (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.21-4.80), Black ethnicity (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.95-4.77), Indian subcontinent ethnicity (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.81), other non-White ethnicities (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.38-2.97) and lower income quintiles (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15-2.89). INTERPRETATION: Patients undergoing long-term dialysis are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from coronavirus disease 2019. Special attention should be paid to addressing risk factors for infection, and these patients should be prioritized for vaccination.","Taji, Leena; Thomas, Doneal; Oliver, Matthew J; Ip, Jane; Tang, Yiwen; Yeung, Angie; Cooper, Rebecca; House, Andrew A; McFarlane, Phil; Blake, Peter G",CMAJ,375,10

We report three male children who were surgically treated for acute appendicitis and had concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our first patient was a 12-year-old male who presented with symptoms indicative of appendicitis but no respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 (e.g. cough, shortness of breath). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms. Our third patient was a 13-year-old patient who also presented with symptomatic acute appendicitis without apparent COVID-19 manifestations. These cases provide further examples of pediatric patients with concomitant acute appendicitis and COVID-19 infection, namely an unusual presentation of perforated appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19-related pulmonary infection and the more common acute appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.","Worhunsky, David J; Acevedo, Maximo J; Dylan, Steffey; Dillon, Johanne E; Lee, James T",,375,21

Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method. It is also critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","Calvez, Ronan; Taylor, Andrew; Calvo-Bado, Leonides; Fraser, Donald; Fink, Colin G",PLoS One,375,33

In this commentary, we report on data sourced from 243 participants in the Tasmania Project in Australia about their experiences of learning from home during COVID‐19 lockdown. We engage with ideas about boundaries and bounding processes to understand how participants perceived challenges to their children's learning from home. They identified a lack of physical space for children's work to be performed and a lack of time, skill, and confidence to support them. We explore the bounding processes inherent to understanding and constituting education through identity, space, and place making and consider the ways in which these processes were revealed in the challenges identified by respondents. We argue that home learning disrupted known practices associated with education and schooling and challenged accepted categories and socio‐spatial divisions created by institutionalisation. We anticipate that exploring the challenges of home learning during COVID‐19 from the perspectives of parents and caregivers will inform future home–school partnerships.

However, knowledge is limited on how psychosocial support buffers the association. This study aimed to examine this buffering role in the context of China. We utilized cross-sectional data collected online in mid-March 2020, involving 585 respondents. Mental health status was determined through depression symptoms and loneliness. COVID-19 related stressors include three aspects: perceived severity, perceived threat to life and health, and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Psychosocial support included family and social supports. Analyses include ordinary linear regression. The finding showed that psychosocial support buffered the negative effect of loneliness in the context of perceived severity of COVID-19, but appeared to intensify the negative effect of depression symptoms in the context of perceived threat to life and health. However, there was no significant buffering effect on depression or loneliness in the context of the perceived risk of infection. The buffering effect of psychosocial support on COVID-19 related stressors is of mixed patterns. This study contributes to the emerging body of literature trying to understand how the COVID-19 impacts the mental health of individuals.","Wang, Ying; Ariyo, Tolulope; Liu, Huijun; Ma, Chenjuan",Curr Psychol,375,1

As this disease continues to spread worldwide, it has posed enormous challenges on the healthcare of several diseases, especially cancer, because hospital facilities have invested health resources for patients with COVID-19. Indeed, patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable because of their poor baseline lung function and cancer-related treatment. In addition, once infected, they are at an increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Oncologists are thus facing a challenge as how to balance the treatment plans to control the disease while protecting the patients with lung cancer from COVID-19. In fact, it is crucial to provide individualized treatment recommendations to limit the risks during these difficult times. This review highlights the key challenges that oncologists face when diagnosing COVID-19 among patients with lung cancer and examines the current recommendations from available literature, clinical expertise, and expert opinions regarding managing lung cancer in the era of COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional population study was performed with 2,350 people, aged between 55-103 years, registered in the primary health care. Potentially inappropriate medications were defined by updated 2019 Beers criteria. Studied variables were sociodemographic, lifestyle and health, and signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit. Multinomial regression analysis was executed. RESULTS: The frequency of potentially inappropriate medications use was 65.4%. Former and current smokers, regular self-perception of health, polypharmacy, and individuals with signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit were significantly associated with potentially inappropriate medications use. Antiarrhythmics, antihistamines and antiadrenergic agents were the highest potentially inappropriate medications classes used for individuals with signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of use of potentially inappropriate medications is high among middle-aged people, a population that was previously under-researched, as well as among elderly people. Cognitive impairment alone or together with depression symptoms were associated factor for a potentially inappropriate medications use.

It causes flow obstruction and inadequate left ventricular filling, leading to increased left atrial pressure, left atrial and auricle enlargement, pulmonary venous congestion, and left-sided congestive heart failure. Mitral valve stenosis is extremely rare in dogs, and mitral valve stenosis associated with thrombus is even less common in this species. The etiology of thrombus development in mitral valve stenosis in dogs is still not clear. In human beings, mitral valve stenosis associated with thrombus has been related to rheumatic fever. This paper aims to report a case of mitral valve stenosis associated with a left auricle thrombus in a dog.Case: A small mixed-breed, 9-year-old, spayed female dog was received by the emergency service of the veterinary hospital a few hours after a syncopal episode. The dog presented dyspnea, apathy, and appetite loss for a week. At physical examination, the dog had pale and cyanotic mucous membranes, 92 mmHg systolic blood pressure, 7% dehydration, and 36.9°C rectal temperature. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachyarrhythmia and diastolic murmur grade IV/VI on the left cardiac apex. During pulmonary auscultation, bilateral crackles were noted. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with supraventricular tachycardia episodes, increased P wave amplitude and duration, and increased QRS complex duration. Generalized cardiomegaly was noted in thoracic radiography with enlarged left atrium, left cardiac edge bulging, pulmonary hypertension and congestion signs, as well as areas of pulmonary opacification.[...](AU)","Costa, Bruna Natali da; Soares, Andrea Ariane Matias; Oliveira, Simone Tostes; Sousa, Marlos Gonçalves",Acta Sci. vet.,375,32

This paper gives a prospective outlook on how the disruption caused by COVID-19 can act as a catalyst for short-term and long-term changes in plastic waste management practices throughout the world. The impact of the pandemic and epidemic following through the life cycles of various plastic products, particularly those needed for personal protection and healthcare, is assessed. The energy and environmental footprints of these product systems have increased rapidly in response to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, while critical hazardous waste management issues are emerging due to the need to ensure destruction of residual pathogens in household and medical waste. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) is proposed to capture the environmental footprint of a plastic product throughout its entire life cycle. Emerging challenges in waste management during and after the pandemic are discussed from the perspective of novel research and environmental policies. The sudden shift in waste composition and quantity highlights the need for a dynamically reponsive waste management system. Six future research directions are suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of the pandemic on waste management systems.","Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír; Fan, Yee Van; Tan, Raymond R.; Jiang, Peng",Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev,375,16

Any potential drug formulation has to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specific to metastatic brain tumors without causing unacceptable adverse effects. Here, we developed transferrin-functionalized chimeric polymersomes carrying siRNA against polo-like kinase 1 (Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1) for treating brain metastatic MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts in mice. To facilitate the loading of siPLK1, chimaeric polymersomes (CPs) were designed with spermine in the watery core and transferrin-binding peptide (TBP) at the surface, enabling attachment of transferrin after the siRNA loading step and thereby circumventing interference of transferrin with siRNA loading. Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 encapsulating 3.8 wt% siRNA had a mean size of about 50 nm and a neutral zeta potential in phosphate buffer (PB). By virtue of the presence of transferrin, Tf@TBP-CPs demonstrated greatly (ca. 5-fold) enhanced internalization in MDA-MB 231 cells and transcytosis in the endothelial (bEnd.3) monolayer model in vitro as well as markedly improved accumulation in the orthotopically xenografted MDA-MB 231 tumor in the brain in vivo compared with control CPs lacking transferrin, supporting that transferrin mediates efficient BBB penetration and high specificity towards MDA-MB 231 cells.

Antibody titers and rates of seroconversion following vaccination are lower among patients with chronic kidney disease and those taking immunosuppressants compared with controls. Data are lacking regarding their humoral response to vaccination to prevent COVID-19. Methods This investigation of early serological response after COVID-19 vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine included 78 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 74 kidney transplant recipients, and 7 healthy controls. We recorded data from the medical file for various clinical parameters, including response to hepatitis B vaccination, and measured antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at 0, 14, 28, 36 and 58 days after the first injection. Results In controls, we detected antibodies at a positive level (>13 arbitrary units per milliliter [AU/ml]) at day 14 postinjection, which increased progressively to peak at day 36 (1082 AU/ml; interquartile range [IQR], 735.0-1662.0]). Patients undergoing hemodialysis had lower titers that peaked at day 58 (276 AU/ml [IQR, 83.4-526.0]. We detected a positive antibody level in only three transplant recipients at day 36. In hemodialysis patients, those younger than 75 years had a higher antibody response versus those older than 75 years and serum albumin and Kt/V were positively correlated with serological response (P< 0.043 and P<0.019, respectively); nonresponders to HBV vaccine had the lowest anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. Conclusions Our results suggest that the postvaccination humoral response is strongly inhibited by immunosuppressant therapy in kidney transplant recipients and is reduced by the uremic condition in patients undergoing hemodialysis.","Danthu, Clément; Hantz, Sébastien; Dahlem, Arthur; Duval, Marion; Ba, Bacary; Guibbert, Manon; El Ouafi, Zhour; Ponsard, Séverine; Berrahal, Insaf; Achard, Jean Michel; Bocquentin, Frédérique; Allot, Vincent; Rerolle, Jean Philippe; Alain, Sophie; Toure, Fatouma",J.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development.","Bhattarai, Keshav; Yousef, Mahmoud; Greife, Alice; Naraharisetti, S.

Re-Du-Ning injection (RDN) is a tradition Chinese medicine preparation which has been clinically used for treatment of respiratory diseases including COVID-19. PURPOSE: To elucidate the potential mechanisms of RDN for the treatment of ALI. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were used to establish ALI model by intraperitoneal injection 10 mg/kg LPS, and RDN injection was intraperitoneally administered with the dose of 5 and 10 ml/kg. The cytokines were measured by ELISA and qPCR. The data related to NETs were analyzed by ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and network pharmacological approach. RESULTS: RDN robustly alleviated LPS-induced ALI. Meanwhile, RDN downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-&#945;. Specifically, RDN treatment inhibited the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and remarkably suppressed the protein of PAD4. The active compound from RDN decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that RDN ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through suppressing MAPK pathway to inhibit the formation of NETs.","Yang, Chenxi; Song, Chenglin; Liu, Yitong; Qu, Jiao; Li, Haibo; Xiao, Wei; Kong, Lingdong; Ge, Huiming; Sun, Yang; Lv, Wen",Phytomedicine,375,16

Researchers have been working to find a new drug to combat the virus since the outbreak started in late 2019, but there are currently no successful drugs to control the SARS-CoV-2, which makes the situation riskier. Very recently, new variant of SARS-CoV-2 is identified in many countries which make the situation very critical. No successful treatment has yet been shown although enormous international commitment to combat this pandemic and the start of different clinical trials. Nanomedicine has outstanding potential to solve several specific health issues, like viruses, which are regarded a significant medical issue.

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support or positive airway pressure for ARDS who presented to our tertiary-care center from March through November, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 232 patients who required heated high-flow nasal cannula, continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure were assigned to non-invasive group. The remaining 121 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and were assigned to invasive group. Of the total 353 patients, 32 patients (65.6% males) with a mean age of 63 ± 11 years developed barotrauma in the form of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. The incidence of barotrauma was 4.74% (11/232) and 17.35% (21/121) in the non-invasive group and invasive group, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 22 (15.7 -33.0) days with an overall mortality of 62.5% (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 ARDS have a high incidence of barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma should be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who exhibit worsening of their respiratory disease as it is likely associated with a high mortality risk. Utilizing lung-protective ventilation strategies may reduce the risk of barotrauma.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Spanel, Alan J; McMillan, Sean; Lahan, Shubham; Boer, Brian; Birge, Justin; Thi, Meilinh",J Intensive Care Med,375,33

Methods: This is a retrospective study. Serum samples were collected from 284 patients including outpatients and inpatients in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20 to February 17 in 2020. Among them 205 cases were 2019-nCoV infected patients, including 186 cases confirmed with nucleic acid test and 19 cases diagnosed by clinical symptoms and CT characteristics according to ""the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Control Protocol (5th edition)"". A total of 79 subjects with other diseases but negative to 2019-nCoV infection were recruited as control group. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were measured with fully automated immunoassay technology for all subjects. Statistical significance between 2019-nCoV antibodies test and 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was determined using the χ 2tests. Results: The sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were 70.24%(144/205) and 96.10%(197/205) respectively and the specificity were 96.20%(76/79) and 92.41%(73/79) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV antibodies were 95.63%(197/206) and 91.03% (71/78) respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were 100%(186/186) and 80.61%(79/98) respectively. The total coincidence rate of diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection between antibody tests and nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV were 88.03%(250/284). Conclusion: Joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV is an effective screening and diagnostic indicators for 2019-nCoV infection, and an effective complement to the false negative results to nucleic acid test.","Xu, Wanzhou; Li, Juan; He, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Caiqing; Mei, Siqing; Li, Congrong; Li, Yan; Cheng, Shaohua; Zhang, Ping039; an,",Chinese J.

Although these drugs are ""old"", their pharmacological and toxicological profile in SARS-CoV-2 - infected patients are still unknown. Thus, by using in silico toxicogenomic data-mining approach, we aimed to assess both risks and benefits of the COVID-19 treatment with the most promising candidate drugs combinations: lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite portal (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) served as a foundation in our research. Our results have demonstrated that lopinavir/ritonavir increased the expression of the genes involved in immune response and lipid metabolism (IL6, ICAM1, CCL2, TNF, APOA1, etc.). Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin interacted with 6 genes (CCL2, CTSB, CXCL8, IL1B, IL6 and TNF), whereas chloroquine and azithromycin affected two additional genes (BCL2L1 and CYP3A4), which might be a reason behind a greater number of consequential diseases. In contrast to lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin downregulated the expression of TNF and IL6. As expected, inflammation, cardiotoxicity, and dyslipidaemias were revealed as the main risks of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, while chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin therapy was additionally linked to gastrointestinal and skin diseases. According to our results, these drug combinations should be administrated with caution to patients suffering from cardiovascular problems, autoimmune diseases, or acquired and hereditary lipid disorders.","Baralic, Katarina; Jorgovanovic, Dragica; Zivancevic, Katarina; Antonijevic Miljakovic, Evica; Antonijevic, Biljana; Buha Djordjevic, Aleksandra; Curcic, Marijana; Dukic-Cosic, Danijela",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,375,27

Certain authors have argued that the consumption of wildlife, or human contact with bats was responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Others argue that a range of anthropogenic environmental degradations have played a vital role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonoses. In this opinion piece, I argue that these divergent viewpoints stem, in part, from different foundational conceptual frameworks - biomedical individualist and eco-social frameworks, respectively. Based on the fact that the eco-social framework provides a more complete account of the different types of causal factors underpinning the emergence of zoonoses, I propose that the COVID-19 pandemic provides an additional reason for the health sciences to ground its theory of health and disease in an eco-social conceptual framework.","Kenyon, Chris",Epidemics,375,20

Most of the countries have taken protective measures by the nationwide lockdown. The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of lockdown on air pollutants and to analyze pre-monsoon (April and May) cloud-to-ground and inter-cloud lightning activity in relation to air pollutants i.e. suspended Particulate matter (PM10), Nitrogen dioxides (NO2) Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3) and Aerosol concentration (AC) in a polluted tropical urban megacities like Kolkata. After the strict lockdown the pollutants rate has reduced by more than 40% from the pre-lockdown period in the Kolkata megacity. So, decreases of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and AC have a greater effect on cloud lightning flashes in the pre-monsoon period. In the previous year (2019), the pre-monsoon average result shows a strong positive relation between the lightning and air pollutants; PM10 (R2 = 0.63), NO2 (R2 = 0.63), SO2 (R2 = 0.76), O3 (R2 = 0.68) and AC (R2 = 0.83). The association was relatively low during the lock-down period (pre-monsoon 2020) and the R2 values were 0.62, 0.60, 0.71, 0.64 and 0.80 respectively. Another thing is that the pre-monsoon (2020) lightning strikes decreased by 49.16% compared to the average of previous years (2010 to 2019). The overall study shows that the reduction of surface pollution in the thunderstorm environment is strongly related to the reduction of lightning activity where PM10 and AC are the key pollutants in the Kolkata megacity.","Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Saha, Asish; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Ghosh, Manoranjan; Roy, Paramita",Sci Total Environ,375,20

In the present study, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining revealed the morphological differences of JE between wild-type (WT) and Runx2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. We speculated that these changes were related to the down-regulation of E-cadherin (E-cad), junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1), and integrin ß6 (ITGB6) in JE. Moreover, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to assess the expressions of these proteins. To verify the relationship between Runx2 and the three above-mentioned proteins, human gingival epithelial cells (HGEs) were cultured for in vitro experiment. The expression of Runx2 in HEGs was depleted by lentivirus. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis were adopted to analyze the differences in mRNA and protein expressions.

We recently showed that Mitofilin knockdown in H9c2 myoblasts induces mitochondrial structural damage resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction that is responsible for cell death via apoptosis. Here, we investigated the role of Mitofilin regulation in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and studied the relationship between Mitofilin and Cyclophilin (CypD), a key regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. C57Bl6 male mice hearts were subjected to different ischemia times (15, 30, or 45 min) followed by a 2h reperfusion period, or 45 min ischemia followed by 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min reperfusion to determine the impact of ischemia or reperfusion times on Mitofilin levels and its interaction with CypD. We found that the increase in myocardial infarct size and the reduction of mitochondrial calcium retention capacity were concomitant with Mitofilin reduction as a function of ischemic duration. We also found that 15 min reperfusion after 45 min ischemia was sufficient to cause a reduction of Mitofilin levels compared to sham, while 45 min ischemia alone was not enough to cause a significant decrease of Mitofilin. We revealed that the c-terminus coiled-coiled domain of Mitofilin is important for its interaction with CypD and the deletion of this identified sequence resulted in a loss of Mitofilin-CypD link, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in cell death. A decrease of the levels of Mitofilin was also associated with mitochondrial structural integrity damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and calpain activity. Our results indicate that Mitofilin physically binds to CypD in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the disruption of this interaction may play a critical role in the increase of mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of myocytes' death after I/R injury.","Tombo, Nathalie; Imam Aliagan, Abdulhafiz D; Feng, Yansheng; Singh, Harpreet; Bopassa, Jean C",Free radic. biol. med,375,29

RESULTS: Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody &#8805;160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (&#8804;28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.","Wendel, Silvano; Kutner, Jose Mauro; Machado, Rafael; Fontão-Wendel, Rita; Bub, Carolina; Fachini, Roberta; Yokoyama, Ana; Candelaria, Gabriela; Sakashita, Araci; Achkar, Ruth; Hamerschlak, Nelson; Scuracchio, Patricia; Amaral, Marcelo; Dal Ben, Mirian; Araujo, Danielle; Soares, Camila; Camargo, Anamaria; Kallás, Esper; Durigon, Edison; Reis, Luiz Fernando; Rizzo, Luiz Vicente",Transfusion,375,16

The new synthesis method is environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and can be implemented on a larger scale. This method showed the cellulose capacity as a reducing and stabilizing agent for synthetizing Cellulose–Copper nanoparticles (CCuNP). Nanocomposites based on CCuNP were characterized by XRD, TGA, FTIR and DSC. Functional groups present in the CCuNP were identified by FTIR analysis, and XRD patterns disclosed that nanoparticles correspond to pure metallic Cu°, and their sizes are at a range of 13–35 nm. Results demonstrated that CuNPs produced by the new method were homogeneously distributed on the entire surface of the textile fiber, obtaining CCuNP nanocomposites with different copper wt%. Thus, CuNPs obtained by this method are very stable to oxidation and can be stored for months. Characterization studies disclose that the cellulose crystallinity index (CI) is modified in relation to the reaction conditions, and its chemical structure is destroyed when nanocomposites with high copper contents are synthesized. The formation of CuO nanoparticles was confirmed as a by-product, through UV spectroscopy, in the absorbance range of 300–350 nm.","Pérez-Alvarez, Marissa Cadenas-Pliego Gregorio Pérez-Camacho Odilia Comparán-Padilla Víctor E.; Cabello-Alvarado, Christian J.; Saucedo-Salazar, Esmeralda",Polymers,375,33

The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and delabelling virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are probably inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations, this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Rambaut, Andrew; Holmes, Edward C; O039,; Toole, Áine; Hill, Verity; McCrone, John T; Ruis, Christopher; du Plessis, Louis; Pybus, Oliver G",Nat Microbiol,375,16

Methods: Two authors (working independently) comprehensively reviewed six databases (PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar) from their dates of inception until November 2020. Patient-reported symptoms, including otolaryngologic and general symptoms, were evaluated for their predictive values in adults who underwent testing for COVID-19. True-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative data were extracted from each study. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (ver. 2). Results: Twenty-eight prospective and retrospective studies were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of a change in olfaction and/or taste was 10.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.43; 12.34). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8.

Some studies found that COVID-19 appears to be more lethal in patients with lung cancer than in other cancer patients. In order to take appropriate measures to balance a delay in lung cancer treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, we first need to know whether patients with lung cancer have special risks. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine differences in terms of presentation and outcomes between patients with lung cancer as opposed to other solid organ cancer after infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of published original research studies will be performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, WangFangData, CQVIP, COMPENDEX and CNKI. The medRxiv preprint server will also be searched for applicable studies (grey literature). Original research studies will be included if they include patients with: (A) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and (B) confirmed solid cancer, and (C) measurable clinical presentation or outcome, such as mortality rate, intensive care unit admission rate, incidence of pneumonia. One author will conduct the electronic database searches, two authors will independently screen studies, two will extract data and two will assess study quality. If I² exceeds 60% for the pooled analysis, we will explore sources of heterogeneity in subgroups of studies. We will use fixed-effect, random-effects or mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk or OR. If the data reporting allows, a subgroup analysis between non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer patients will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The proposed study will not collect individual-level data and, therefore, does not require ethical approval. We will submit our findings to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and will disseminate results through presentations at international scientific conferences.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the chronological histopathological alterations in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: The first 22 consecutive COVID-19 deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Lung biopsies and histopathological analyses were performed in deceased patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. Clinical data and patient course were evaluated. RESULTS: The median patient age was 66 [63-74] years; 73% were males. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17 [8-24] days. COVID-19 induced pulmonary injury was characterized by an exudative phase in the first week of the disease, followed by a proliferative/organizing phase in the second and third weeks, and finally an end-stage fibrosis phase after the third week. Viral RNA and proteins were detected in pneumocytes and macrophages in a very early stage of the disease, and were no longer detected after the second week. LIMITATION: Limited sample size.

The disease had spread quickly throughout the world causing extensive, widespread morbidity, over two million deaths, and economical and social devastation over the entire world. Researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the globe have been racing to develop potent and safe vaccines for the disease. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine followed by Moderna COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine were the first to receive FDA approval. These vaccines are based on messenger RNA novel technology and considered efficient in preventing contagion ensuring safety. Known side effects for this vaccine have been reported as very similar to those known for other vaccines. Specifically, lymphadenopathy has not been considered a common manifestation of COVID-19 vaccination. Israel has been cited as leading in the introduction of these vaccines, which are available for every citizen older than 16 years. Here, we present the cases of three patients who developed lymphadenopathy after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Time elapsed from the injection until the appearance of the enlarged nodes, clinical symptoms, and sonographic features differed between the patients, but in all cases gradual regression was noted in the enlarged nodes until complete resolution.

Therefore, early risk identification of critically ill patients remains crucial. AIM: To develop predictive rules at the time of admission to identify COVID-19 patients who might require intensive care unit (ICU) care. METHODS: This retrospective study included a total of 361 patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction between January 19, 2020, and March 14, 2020 in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to develop the predictive model. The performance of the predictive model was externally validated and evaluated based on a dataset involving 126 patients from the Wuhan Asia General Hospital between December 2019 and March 2020, by area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), goodness-of-fit and the performance matrix including the sensitivity, specificity, and precision. A nomogram was also used to visualize the model. RESULTS: Among the patients in the derivation and validation datasets, 38 and 9 participants (10.5% and 2.54%, respectively) developed severe COVID-19, respectively.

Initially, infection presented with a broad spectrum of symptoms which typically included muscle aches, fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE2 receptors which are abundant throughout the respiratory tract. However, there is evidence that these receptors are abundant throughout the body, and just as abundant in cholangiocytes as alveolar cells, posing the question of possible direct liver injury. While liver enzymes and function tests do seem to be deranged in some patients, it is questionable if the injury is due to direct viral damage, drug-induced liver injury, hypoxia, or microthromboses. Likely, the injury is multifactoral, and management of infected patients with pre-existing liver disease should be taken into consideration. Ultimately, a vaccine is needed to aid in reducing cases of SARS-CoV-2 and providing immunity to the general population.

BACKGROUND: To prevent falls during patients' hospitalisation, it is essential for them to accurately perceive their risk of falling. DESIGN: This methodological study was performed to develop a fall risk perception questionnaire. METHODS: After generating a preliminary questionnaire, two rounds of content validity testing were performed with nine experts. Following a pilot test, a convenience sample of 236 participants was recruited from an acute care hospital between 2 May 2018 and 15 December 2019. Construct, convergent and known-group validity of the questionnaire was evaluated, and reliability was estimated by calculating the internal consistency reliability coefficients. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution with 27 items. The questionnaire showed statistically significant positive correlation with the Korean Falls Efficacy Scale-International and the Morse Fall Scale, thus establishing convergent validity. For known-group comparison, Morse Fall Scale scores were categorised into two groups by cut-off score. The risk for falls group had a significantly higher perceived fall risk than the no risk for falls group, thus establishing known-group validity. Cronbach's alpha values indicated good to excellent reliability for the overall questionnaire with 27 items and for each of the three subfactors. CONCLUSIONS: The fall risk perception questionnaire demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity in an acute care hospital setting. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Because understanding patients' perceptions of their fall risk is essential for preventing falls, it is necessary to regularly assess patients' fall risk perception using tools with established reliability and validity.","Choi, Jieun; Choi, Se Min; Lee, Jeong Sin; Seo, Soon Seok; Kim, Ja Yeon; Kim, Hye Young; Kim, Sung Reul",J. clin. nurs,375,33

Particularly, why would some citizens ignore scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists' opposition to scientific and political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy beliefs that is independent of political ideology. These findings have important implications for elite communication regarding virus mitigation.

We conducted an online survey to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among 342 sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals who had attended collective sex venues (CSV) in New York City (NYC) in the prior year. Almost 1 in 10 (9.9%) participants reported having received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies. Although a minority (27.5%) of participants reported being comfortable attending a CSV during the COVID-19 pandemic, multivariable ordinal logistic regression found that willingness was higher among participants who had taken the survey later in the pandemic (aOR = 2.90, CI95% 1.90 to 4.43), who attended CSV at higher frequencies (aOR = 1.94, CI95% 1.26 to 2.99), who used substances at CSV (aOR = 1.98, CI95% 1.22 to 3.23), and who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies (aOR = 2.27, CI95% 1.17 to 4.39). In open survey answers, participants described reasons for or against attending CSV during the pandemic, as well as risk reduction strategies that would make them more comfortable attending (e.g., screening for test results, doing temperature checks, holding outdoor events, or restricting events to lower risk sexual practices). SGM individuals who attend CSV might be at increased risk for COVID-19. Public health officials should provide CSV organizers and attendees with guidelines on how to prevent or minimize transmission risk in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19.","Meunier, Étienne; Sundelson, Anne E; Tellone, Stephen; Alohan, Daniel; Fisher, Celia B; Grov, Christian",J. urban health,375,20

METHODS: A telephone interview study was conducted at the end of April 2020. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen to identify themes and concepts and a semi-structured interview guide was developed. The analysis was structured according to constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, including attitudes to breast cancer screening, norms and motivations to comply with breast cancer screening, perceived control and anticipated regret. RESULTS: Interviews were carried out with 33 women aged 50-69 (mean 62) years. The women felt that screening was of secondary importance during the height of the pandemic and they felt low perceived control over transportation to the screening clinic and over the screening situation itself, where social distancing was impossible. They perceived messages from the authorities as conflicting regarding the request for social distancing and a lack of recommendations about using face masks at the screening clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Women who postponed or cancelled breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic felt that public recommendations appeared contradictory. Uncertainty about the 'new norm(al)' of COVID-19 made them stay at home, although the screening clinics remained open. The findings point to the importance of addressing perceived inconsistency between recommendations from the World Health Organization and the national management of these recommendations, and to secure univocal information from the authorities about the recommended use of healthcare services in a time of crisis.","Kirkegaard, Pia; Edwards, Adrian; Andersen, Berit",Scand J Public Health,375,29

The haemostasis parameters we observed, including increased levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, point towards a relevant involvement of endothelial cells in patients with severe COVID-19. We suggest that it is possible to hypothesise a spectrum of secondarily acquired, prothrombotic coagulopathy mediated by the endothelial interaction with SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of mortality in a subset of patients with a complicated clinical course of COVID-19. We support the recommendation of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis for inpatients with COVID-19 as a very minimum in the absence of strict contraindications, while recognising that pulmonary thrombotic complications can occur under standard thromboprophylaxis. We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed. Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation are obligatory where new evidence of a macrovascular thrombotic complication has been documented. More research to delineate the macro- and microvascular thrombotic complications of COVID-19, and the therapeutic implications for this patient group is required.","Breakey, Neal; Escher, Robert",Swiss Med Wkly,375,1

This is particularly important for COVID-19, where many individuals are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms but can still spread the disease. Current systems for controlling transmission rely on patients to report their symptoms to medical professionals and be able to recall and trace all their contacts from the previous few days. This is unrealistic in the modern world. However, existing smartphone-based GPS and social media technology may provide a suitable alternative. We, therefore, developed a mini-program within the app WeChat. This analyzes data from all users and traces close contacts of all patients. This permits early tracing and quarantine of potential sources of infection. Data from the mini-program can also be merged with other data to predict epidemic trends, calculate individual and population risks, and provide recommendations for individual and population protection action. It may also improve our understanding of how the disease spreads. However, there are a number of unresolved questions about the use of smartphone data for health surveillance, including how to protect individual privacy and provide safeguards against data breaches.","Wang, Shaoxiong; Ding, Shuizi; Xiong, Li",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,375,24

Methods: A total of 294 children and 92 adults with CHB infection who were treated at four hospitals in Chongqing from 2011 to 2018 were collected. The BCP / PC region of HBV was amplified by PCR and sequenced directly to comparatively analyze the gene mutation conditions in this region. The two sample means were compared by the t-test, and the nonparametric data was compared by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. &#967;2 test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the data rates of the two groups. Results: Children and adult patients were dominated by genotype B; accounting for 76.9% and 71.7%, respectively, and genotype C accounted for 23.1% and 28.3%, respectively. In the children group, the mutation rates of ten nucleotide sites containing nt 1679, 1721, 1753, 1757, 1758, 1762, 1764, 1775, 1856 and 1858 of the genotype C samples was significantly higher than that of genotype B samples. The mutation rates of G1721a, C1856t and T1858c of genotype C samples were 30.9%, 16.2% and 30.9%, respectively, while the mutation rates of genotype B samples were 0.4%, 0, 0, P < 0.001, respectively. In the adult group, the only three sites containing nt 1679, 1758, and 1775 of the genotype C sample had a higher mutation rate than the genotype B samples. The combined mutations pattern were only detected in children with genotype C samples, but not in children and adult with genotype B samples. Further analysis showed that the age of G1721A/A1775G/T1858C containing combined mutation group was significantly lower than that of the non-mutation group [(4.58 ± 2.53) years vs. (6.53 ± 4.02) years, P = 0.012]. Serum HBV DNA titer was significantly higher in combined mutation group than that of the non-mutation group [(7.57 ± 2.03) log10 copies / ml vs. (6.61 ± 2.11) log10 copies / ml, P = 0.045]. Conclusion: The frequencies of mutations in the BCP/PC region of HBV-infected children in genotype C samples were significantly higher than that of genotype B samples. Genotype-related combined site mutations were only found in children with genotype C samples, and were also associated with younger patients and high HBV-DNA titers.","Bai, J X; Deng, H J; Huang, Y",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,375,21

While the role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood, precise data on the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is required to determine the risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces. METHODS: This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-CoV-2, suspended in a standard ASTM E2197 matrix, on several common surface types. All experiments were carried out in the dark, to negate any effects of UV light. Inoculated surfaces were incubated at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C and sampled at various time points. RESULTS: Survival rates of SARS-CoV-2 were determined at different temperatures and D-values, Z-values and half-life were calculated. We obtained half lives of between 1.7 and 2.7 days at 20 °C, reducing to a few hours when temperature was elevated to 40 °C. With initial viral loads broadly equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients, viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 °C from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel and both paper and polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less than 24 h at 40 °C on some surfaces. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible. These results could be used to inform improved risk mitigation procedures to prevent the fomite spread of COVID-19.","Riddell, Shane; Goldie, Sarah; Hill, Andrew; Eagles, Debbie; Drew, Trevor W",Virol J,375,6

However, there are no large population-based data evaluating potential causal associations between alcohol consumption and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a Mendelian randomization study using data from UK Biobank to explore the association between alcohol consumption and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. A total of 12,937 participants aged 50-83 who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 16 March to 27 July 2020 (12.1% tested positive) were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was alcohol consumption. Main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and death in COVID-19 patients. We generated allele scores using three genetic variants (rs1229984 (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1B, ADH1B), rs1260326 (Glucokinase Regulator, GCKR), and rs13107325 (Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 8, SLC39A8)) and applied the allele scores as the instrumental variables to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes. Analyses were conducted separately for white participants with and without obesity. RESULTS: Of the 12,937 participants, 4496 were never or infrequent drinkers and 8441 were frequent drinkers. Both logistic regression and Mendelian randomization analyses found no evidence that alcohol consumption was associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants either with or without obesity (All q > 0.10). However, frequent drinking, especially heavy drinking (HR = 2.07, 95%CI 1.24-3.47; q = 0.054), was associated with higher risk of death in patients with obesity and COVID-19, but not in patients without obesity. Notably, the risk of death in frequent drinkers with obesity increased slightly with the average amount of alcohol consumed weekly (All q < 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has adverse effects on the progression of COVID-19 in white participants with obesity, but was not associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fan, Xiude; Liu, Zhengwen; Poulsen, Kyle L; Wu, Xiaoqin; Miyata, Tatsunori; Dasarathy, Srinivasan; Rotroff, Daniel M; Nagy, Laura E",Nutrients,375,24

This review aims to describe the large, randomized controlled studies leading to the modern use of rTMS for MDD. It also includes a special section briefly discussing the use of these technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings: Several new approaches and technologies are emerging in this field, including novel approaches to reduce treatment time and potentially yield new approaches to optimize and maximize clinical outcomes. Of these, theta burst TMS now has evidence indicating it is non-inferior to standard TMS and provides significant advantages in administration. Recent studies also indicate that neuroimaging and related approaches may be able to improve TMS targeting methods and potentially identify those patients most likely to respond to stimulation. Summary: While new data is promising, significant research remains to be done to individualize and optimize TMS procedures. Emerging new approaches, such as accelerated TMS and advanced targeting methods, require additional replication and demonstration of real-world clinical utility. Cautious administration of TMS during the pandemic is possible with careful attention to safety procedures.","Cosmo, Camila; Zandvakili, Amin; Petrosino, Nicholas J; Berlow, Yosef A; Philip, Noah S",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,375,7

Across the European Reference Network on Pediatric Transplantation (ERN TransplantChild), we conducted a survey to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on pediatric transplant activity and healthcare practices in both solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The replies of 30 professionals from 18 centers in Europe were collected. Twelve of 18 centers (67%) showed a reduction in their usual transplant activity. Additionally, outpatient visits have been modified and restricted to selected ones, and the use of telemedicine tools has increased. Additionally, a total of 14 COVID-19 pediatric transplanted patients were identified at the time of the survey, including eight transplant recipients and six candidates for transplantation. Only two moderate-severe cases were reported, both in HSCT setting. These survey results demonstrate the limitations in healthcare resources for pediatric transplantation patients during early stages of this pandemic. COVID-19 disease is a major worldwide challenge for the field of pediatric transplantation, where there will be a need for systematic data collection, encouraging regular discussions to address the long-term consequences for pediatric transplantation candidates, recipients, and their families.","Doná, Daniele; Torres Canizales, Juan; Benetti, Elisa; Cananzi, Mara; De Corti, Federica; Calore, Elisabetta; Hierro, Loreto; Ramos Boluda, Esther; Melgosa Hijosa, Marta; Garcia Guereta, Luis; Pérez Martínez, Antonio; Barrios, Maribel; Costa Reis, Patricia; Teixeira, Ana; Lopes, Maria Francelina; Kalicinski, Piotr; Branchereau, Sophie; Boyer, Olivia; Debray, Dominque; Sciveres, Marco; Wennberg, Lars; Fischler, Björn; Barany, Peter; Baker, Alastair; Baumann, Ulrich; Schwerk, Nicolaus; Nicastro, Emanuele; Candusso, Manila; Toporski, Jacek; Sokal, Etienne; Stephenne, Xavier; Lindemans, Caroline; Miglinas, Marius; Rascon, Jelena; Jara, Paloma",Clin Transplant,375,1

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, and prospective study of pediatric patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at 8 sites in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. RESULTS: We identified 281 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and divided them into 3 groups based on clinical features. Overall, 143 (51%) had respiratory disease, 69 (25%) had MIS-C, and 69 (25%) had other manifestations including gastrointestinal illness or fever. Patients with MIS-C were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic black compared with patients with respiratory disease (35% vs 18%, P = .02). Seven patients (2%) died and 114 (41%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. In multivariable analyses, obesity (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.26-9.10, P = .02) and hypoxia on admission (OR 4.01; 95% CI 1.14-14.15; P = .03) were predictive of severe respiratory disease. Lower absolute lymphocyte count (OR 8.33 per unit decrease in 109 cells/L, 95% CI 2.32-33.33, P = .001) and greater C-reactive protein (OR 1.06 per unit increase in mg/dL, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, P = .017) were predictive of severe MIS-C. Race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status were not predictive of disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified variables at the time of hospitalization that may help predict the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations in children and youth.

It is estimated that over 50% of women quit smoking during pregnancy but 90% relapse by one year. Safe and effective postpartum relapse prevention strategies are urgently needed. In an attempt to address this deficit, we will investigate the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a smoking relapse prevention aid in postpartum women. The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a relapse prevention tool. Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300 mg/day) or placebo medication for 12 weeks. To respond to safety concerns associated with participant and staff exposure to COVID-19, we revised our original protocol and present procedures which allow our trial to be conducted entirely remotely. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post-randomization. The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks. Results of this work have the potential to positively impact women and their children by promoting lifelong cessation, eliminating secondhand smoke exposure, and modelling of abstinence to children.","Allen, Sharon; Thomas, Janet; Harrison, Katherine; Emery, Rebecca L; Petersen, Ashley; Winickoff, Jonathan P; Japuntich, Sandra",Contemp Clin Trials,375,21

Many triage policies exist that fall under the legal protections afforded by ""crisis standards of care,"" but they have key differences. We critically appraise one of the most fundamental differences among policies, namely the use of criteria to categorically exclude certain patients from eligibility for otherwise standard medical services. We examine these categorical exclusion criteria from ethical, legal, disability, and implementation perspectives. Focusing our analysis on the most common type of exclusion criteria, which are disease-specific, we conclude that optimal policies for critical care resource allocation and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not use categorical exclusions. We argue that the avoidance of categorical exclusions is often practically feasible, consistent with public health norms, and mitigates discrimination against persons with disabilities.","Auriemma, Catherine L; Molinero, Ashli M; Houtrow, Amy J; Persad, Govind; White, Douglas B; Halpern, Scott D",Am J Bioeth,375,33

As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged &#8805;65 years and particularly those aged &#8805;85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5).

QAC already are commonly found in wastewaters, and their concentration could increase, since QAC are recommended to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Exposure of bacteria to QAC can lead to proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In particular, O2-based membrane biofilm reactors (O2-MBfRs) achieved excellent CTAB biodegradation, but ARG increased in their biofilms. Here, we applied meta-transcriptomic analyses to assess the impacts of CTAB exposure and operating conditions on microbial community's composition and ARG expression in the O2-MBfRs. Two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, dominated the microbial communities and were associated with the presence of ARG. Operating conditions that imposed stress on the biofilms, i.e., limited supplies of O2 and nitrogen or a high loading of CTAB, led to large increases in ARG expression, particularly for genes conferring antibiotic-target protection. Important within the efflux pumps was the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, which may have been active in exporting CTAB from cells. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key factor that triggered ARG proliferation by selecting intrinsically resistant species and accentuating the expression of ARG. Our findings suggest that means to mitigate the spread of ARG, such as shown here in a O2-based membrane biofilm reactor, need to consider the impacts of stressors, including QAC exposure and stressful operating conditions.","Luo, Yi-Hao; Lai, YenJung Sean; Zheng, Chenwei; Ilhan, Zehra Esra; Ontiveros-Valencia, Aura; Long, Xiangxing; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa; Rittmann, Bruce E",Sci Total Environ,375,10

However, coverage amongst at-risk adults for recommended vaccines continues to be suboptimal. This study examined the perceptions of middle and older aged Australian adults towards hospital-based immunization programs and their previous exposures to receiving vaccines via tertiary care. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45 years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. RESULTS: Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (&#8804;65 years (low-risk): 52.9%, &#8804;65 years (high-risk): 18.3%, >65 years: 15.1%; p < 0.001) and pneumococcal (&#8804;65 years (low-risk): 79.1%, &#8804;65 years (high-risk): 52.4%, >65 years: 44%; p < 0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge. Considering the need for high levels of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, hospitals may need to be considered to opportunistically capture those not accessing the vaccine in other settings.","McFadden, Kathleen; Heywood, Anita; Dyda, Amalie; Kaufman, Jessica; Seale, Holly",Vaccine,375,24

This study evaluates the status of knowledge, perception, and confidence about COVID-19 preventive measures during the first wave of the COVID'19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Egypt. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in July 2020, in Egypt. An-online-based questionnaire was used to collect data. It included items to record demographic data, and an assessment of knowledge, the perception of healthcare facilities preparedness, and HCW confidence about applying infection prevention measures. Results A total of 465 responses were analyzed. HCWs' mean age was 36.76 ± 9.57 years, 94.2% (n=438) had an adequate level of knowledge, 31% (n=144) had an adequate perception level, and 39.4% (n=183) had an adequate confidence level. The main source of information was international organizations' websites 46.5% (n=216). The main barriers to applying preventive measures were the overcrowding of patient care areas 73.1% (n=339), and limited infection control supplies 68% (n=316). Factors associated with COVID-19 among HCWs were COVID-19 infected family members (OR: 5.86), inability to protect themselves and their families (OR: 5.73), uncertainty about the available hand hygiene supplies (OR: 3.76), male gender (OR: 3.07), and single HCWs (OR: 2.88). Conclusions Although the majority reported an adequate knowledge level, lower rates of adequate perception and confidence were observed. Revision of preparedness plans in different facilities should be further studied. Psychological support and gender differences should be considered in response programs.","Elgibaly, Omaima Daef Enas Elghazally Shimaa A.; Hassan, Hebatallah M.; ElsaidTash, Rehab M.; Bahgat, Shereen M.; Elantouny, Neveen G.; Zarzour, Amro A.; Othman, Marwa M.

This perspective is of broad clinical and public health importance because the US has the highest population of long-term users of prescription opioids, a sequel of a decade-long practice of opioid overprescribing in the US. For long-term opioid users who are hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians face clinical challenges arising from the suppressive effects of opioids on the respiratory and immune functions, as well as the potential for adverse drug-drug interaction when opioids have to be continued in long-term users.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S -palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx&#934; motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, Guoli; Kenney, Adam D; Kudryashova, Elena; Zhang, Lizhi; Hall-Stoodley, Luanne; Robinson, Richard T; Kudryashov, Dmitri S; Compton, Alex A; Yount, Jacob S",,375,5

With benevolent ageism, older adults are also viewed as warm. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained resources and prompted debates about priority for older adults versus other groups. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: College students completed an online survey of how much priority should be given to older adults in three relevant healthcare-related scenarios and three relevant employment scenarios. RESULTS: Benevolent ageism significantly predicted higher priority for older adults to receive healthcare (triage, COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 testing) and employment resources (retention of job, working from home) while greater endorsement of hostile ageism significantly predicted lower priority ratings. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings replicate and extend past work. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on healthcare and employment resources, this study sheds light on one factor -- benevolent and hostile ageism -- that contributes to a greater understanding of prioritization views toward a vulnerable segment of the population.","Apriceno, MaryBeth; Lytle, Ashley; Monahan, Caitlin; Macdonald, Jamie; Levy, Sheri R",GerontologistGerontologist,375,0

In Study 1 (N = 564), participants completed explicit measures of psychopathic traits and of life history strategy. To attenuate common method biases, Study 2 (N = 267) employed an alternative measure of psychopathy and an indirect measure of life history strategy, namely, future-discounting. Across two studies, we found consistent and significant evidence that participants from Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the pandemic, evidenced a faster life history strategy and a markedly higher level of psychopathic traits than did participants from Chongqing, which was less affected by the virus. Furthermore, a consistent pattern of correlation between life history strategy and psychopathy was observed across different groups of participants. We also replicated some previously reported studies but found that not all sex effects were consistent with life history in Chinese populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals may show a high degree of variation in life history speed and psychopathic traits in response to unpredictable and adverse environments, which provide support for extended life history plasticity.","Li, Heng; Cao, Yu",Curr Psychol,375,3

A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries. METHODS: In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: 790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3% to 24% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0·76, 95% CI 0·58-1·00); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11% to 25% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1·24, 95% CI 1·00-1·52) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1·25, 1·03-1·51); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6-9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14-20]) following relaxation to observe 60% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0·71 (95% CI 0·55-0·93) on day 28, decreasing to 0·62 (0·47-0·82) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0·58 (0·41-0·81) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0·48 (0·32-0·71) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added. INTERPRETATION: Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1-3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.

An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which engages with host ACE2 receptor for entry. Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput-imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also developed a focus-reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3. Comparing the neutralizing activities of various antibodies and ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays revealed a high degree of concordance. These assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Computed tomography (CT) findings, such as a spot sign have been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome. We have recently encountered a succession of ICH patients who presented with a peculiar imaging finding, which we term the spot on a string sign. This is a rare imaging finding, and interestingly, all these patients presented to our institution over the last few weeks. METHODS: This was a single high-volume center series of patients who presented to our institution between 1 April and 21 May 2020. All patients underwent initial non-contrast CT brain and subsequent CT angiography (CTA). We also present laboratory and clinical data. Our primary measure was the presence of the spot on a string sign on the CTA. We also report the clinical course of these patients. RESULTS: In this study seven large-volume ICH patients with this imaging sign were identified, with a median age of 48 years (range 30-68 years). All had tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: We have described an unusual imaging finding in a cohort of younger patients with large-volume ICH, all of whom presented in a 2-month period to a high-volume neurovascular unit. The cause of these ICH presentations and associated imaging findings are unclear, but we encourage other clinicians to be aware of and vigilant for this rare phenomenon, especially in younger patients with such a bleeding pattern.","Nicholson, Patrick; Gao, Meah; Radovanovic, Ivan; Mendes-Pereira, Vitor; Hodaie, Mojgan; Pikula, Aleksandra; Krings, Timo","Clin. neuroradiol.

The emergence of this virus in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and its worldwide spread to reach the pandemic stage has raised concerns about the possible risk that it might be transmissible by transfusion. This theoretical risk is further supported by reports of the detection of viral RNA in the blood of some infected individuals. To further address this risk, a thorough PubMed literature search was performed to systematically identify studies reporting data on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood or its components. Complementary searches were done to identify articles reporting data on the in vitro infectivity of blood components. At least 23 articles presenting data on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood, plasma, or serum were identified. Of these, three studies reported on blood donors with COVID-19 infection identified after donation, and no cases of transfusion transmission were identified. A few studies mentioned results of in vitro infectivity assays of blood components in permissive cell lines, none of which were able to detect infectious virus in blood or its components. Complementary searches have identified reports demonstrating that the correlation between the presence of viral RNA in a biologic sample and infectivity requires a minimal RNA load, which is rarely, if ever, observed in blood components. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by transfusion remains theoretical.","Leblanc, Jean-François; Germain, Marc; Delage, Gilles; OÊ¼Brien, Sheila; Drews, Steven J; Lewin, Antoine",Transfusion,375,16

The strategy's effectiveness critically depends on high between-person variability in close-range contacts. We analyze population survey data showing that indeed the frequency of close-range contacts across individuals is characterized by a small fraction of people reporting very high frequencies of close-range contacts. We simulate a population with empirical contact distributions coming out of lockdown. Simulations show that targeting a small fraction of high-degree individuals dramatically improves containment.

In the Philippines, where stringent lockdown rules have been implemented, households living in poverty have had to rely largely on food aid in the form of food packs distributed by local governments and private donors. An evaluation of the commonly distributed food items reveals a diet that addresses acute hunger but does not contain sufficient nutrients to promote and maintain health. Such a diet puts low-income households at a greater risk of acute and chronic disease. The negative health impact of commonly distributed food packs on food aid-dependent households shine a light on how the COVID-19 pandemic and public health policies exacerbate health inequities. A primary care perspective is essential in creating food security policies that can effectively address acute hunger and malnutrition without contributing to the long-term deleterious effects of inadequate nutrition on the health of indigent communities.","Ong, Madeline Mae; Ong, Ronnah Marie; Reyes, Gladys Kaye; Sumpaico-Tanchanco, Lourdes Bernadette",J Prim Care Community Health,375,3

Countries that have been severely hit by the pandemic are using pharmacists to help triage patients. In order to ensure the continuity of these services, it is of paramount importance that pharmacists be formally involved and engaged in the management of this pandemic. In response to the underlying knowledge deficit, this study was undertaken as the first of its kind in the entirety of Saudi Arabia. Methods: This study is a questionnaire based cross-sectional study that was carried out for a period of five months from March 2020 to July 2020 to assess the role of working pharmacists in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic under different health care settings across Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 398 responses were recorded, in which 51.1% of the respondents were not involved in any learning or awareness activities involving health care providers (HCPs) or patients. The majority of respondents (62.9%) were not involved in creating or evaluating therapeutic plans for COVID19 patients, and 55% were not involved in therapeutic mentoring of COVID19 patients. Only a very low percentage of respondents were participating in COVID19-related research within their institution. Only 37% of respondents reported being satisfied with their role and contribution in the management of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study reveals that pharmacists are underutilized in the management of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. As such, the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing the role and contribution of pharmacists in patient care management across all hospitals and especially under health care crisis conditions. The establishment of a crisis standard of care guideline for all HCPs, including pharmacists, would help in improving patient overall care under crisis conditions like the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Assiri, Abdullah; Iqbal, Mir Javid; Gramish, Jawaher; Assiri, Ahmed; Meraya, Abdulkarim; Alhossan, Abdulaziz; Khobrani, Moteb",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,375,20

Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. METHODS: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. RESULTS: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.","Lebel, Catherine; MacKinnon, Anna; Bagshawe, Mercedes; Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne; Giesbrecht, Gerald",J Affect Disord,375,2

Palsy of the third cranial nerve is very rare in patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We describe the case of a patient with an incomplete palsy of the left third cranial nerve sparing the pupils in the context of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19, which presented with acute onset of diplopia and strabismus of the left eye that occurred 3 days after the start of general symptoms. The patient had no significant medical history. Based on detailed ophthalmic and neurological examination, acute painless incomplete palsy of the third cranial nerve was suspected. Oculo-cerebral magnetic resonance angiography was unremarkable. Blood tests revealed mild normocytic regenerative anemia. According to the Moroccan recommendations, chloroquine and azithromycin were started. After what, a quick improvement of exotropia and diplopia was observed, and complete recovery was obtained by the sixth day of treatment. No adverse effects of the treatment were noted. CONCLUSIONS Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause neurological complications such as cranial nerve palsy. The pathological mechanism remains unclear. Full recovery of the ocular motricity is possible, and prognosis depends on the severity of the respiratory illness.","Belghmaidi, Sarah; Nassih, Houda; Boutgayout, Saloua; El Fakiri, Karima; El Qadiry, Rabiy; Hajji, Ibtissam; Bourrahouate, Aicha; Moutaouakil, Abdeljalil",Am J Case Rep,375,29

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women were divided into two groups based on status at admission, symptomatic or asymptomatic. All testing was done by nasopharyngeal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery. Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [n = 60] or exposure only [n = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic). In total, there were 46 symptomatic women and 22 asymptomatic women (tested based on exposure only [n = 12] or as part of universal screening [n = 10]) with confirmed COVID-19. Of symptomatic women (n = 46), 27.3% had preterm delivery and 26.1% needed respiratory support while none of the asymptomatic women (n = 22) had preterm delivery or need of respiratory support (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women. It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.

A case study on remdesivir was illustrated for the clinical application of such a novel design and analysis. METHODS: A Bayesian synthesis design was applied to integrating the empirical evidence on the one-arm compassion study and the two-arm ACTT-1 trial for COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. A multistate model was developed to model the dynamics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from three transient states of low, medium-, and high-risk until the two outcomes of recovery and death. The outcome measures for clinical efficacy comprised high-risk state, death, and discharge. RESULTS: The efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the risk of death and enhancing the odds of recovery were estimated as 31% (95% CI, 18-44%) and 10% (95% CI, 1-18%), respectively. Remdesivir therapy for patients with low-risk state showed the efficacy in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state and death by 26% (relative rate (RR), 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93) and 62% (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48), respectively. Less but still statistically significant efficacy in mortality reduction was noted for the medium- and high-risk patients.

Here, we propose the putative role of enhanced neutrophil infiltration and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, complement activation and vascular thrombosis during necroinflammation in COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrophilic inflammation contributes to the higher mortality of COVID-19 in patients with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This perspective highlights neutrophils as a putative target for the immunopathologic complications of severely ill COVID-19 patients.

We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities. FINDINGS: Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05-1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04-1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09-1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08-1·10] in 20-39 years age group vs 80-100 years group 1·01 [1·00-1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06-1·08] vs 1·04 [1·04-1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities. INTERPRETATION: At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

The impact of Bt crops on bacterial communities has only been assessed under short-term, and results have been contradictory. Here, we analyzed the bacterial communities in three niches, rhizosphere soil (RS), root endosphere (RE) and leaf endosphere (LE), of three Bt rice and their non-Bt parental lines for three consecutive years by high-throughput sequencing. In principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and PERMANOVA (Adonis) analysis, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered primarily by niche type and differed significantly in the RE and LE but not in the RS between each of three Bt lines compared with the non-Bt rice line, and not in each respective niche among the three Bt rice lines. The bacterial communities in the RS of different rice lines over the 3 years were clustered mainly by year rather than by lines. The differential bacterial taxa among the lines did not overlap between years, presumably because Cry proteins are rapidly degraded in the soil. A network analysis of RS bacterial communities showed that the network complexity and density for the three Bt rice lines did not decrease compared with those for the non-Bt line. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that bacterial communities differed significantly in RE and LE between Bt and non-Bt rice lines, but the differences were mild and transient, and had no adverse impact on RS over the 3 years. This study provides favorable evidence in support of the commercialization of Bt rice.","Wu, Nan; Shi, Wencong; Liu, Wenwen; Gao, Zheng; Han, Lanzhi; Wang, Xifeng",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,375,1

It offers many advantages such as a high temporal resolution and flexibility in body positioning. Many clinical studies have reported the feasibility of DXR and its characteristic findings in pulmonary diseases. DXR may serve as an alternative to pulmonary function tests in patients requiring contact inhibition, including patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other infectious diseases. Thus, DXR has a great potential to play an important role in the clinical setting.

The current study used molecular docking, molecular dynamics and protein-protein interaction simulations to predict drugs from the Drug Bank that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacting surface on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The study predicted a number of peptide-based drugs, including Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P and BV2, that might bind sufficiently to the hACE2 receptor to modulate the protein-protein interaction required for infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such drugs could be validated in vitro or in vivo as potential inhibitors of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in the airway. Exploration of the proposed and current pharmacological indications of the peptide drugs predicted as potential inhibitors of the interaction between the spike protein and hACE2 receptor revealed that some of the predicted peptide drugs have been investigated for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), viral infection, inflammation and angioedema, and to stimulate the immune system, and potentiate antiviral agents against influenza virus. Furthermore, these predicted drug hits may be used as a basis to design new peptide or peptidomimetic drugs with better affinity and specificity for the hACE2 receptor that may prevent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 that is prerequisite to the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Egieyeh, Samuel; Egieyeh, Elizabeth; Malan, Sarel; Christofells, Alan; Fielding, Burtram",PLoS One,375,12

We found that bacterial coinfections were present in <4% of patients upon admission and the yield of routine diagnostic tests for pneumonia was low. When bacterial coinfections did occur, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens and atypical bacteria were rare. Although uncommon upon admission, bacterial infections frequently occurred in patients with prolonged hospitalization, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and S. aureus were common pathogens.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with its emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) and reducing high-risk contacts, was the catalyst needed to bring telemedicine into mainstream consciousness and acceptance. OBJECTIVES: We first review some of the key factors that precipitated this abrupt alteration of the perception of telemedicine. We then detail the creation of a department-wide telemedicine network using off-the-shelf consumer products. Our goal was to very rapidly install a system that was familiar to end-users for the purpose of reducing high-risk contacts and conserving PPE. Sourcing from the consumer realm proved to be advantageous over enterprise-level equipment when these goals were desired. DISCUSSION: After a rollout of 1.5 weeks from zero to fully operational, we showed an immediate decrease in high-risk contacts and PPE use. All 80 rooms plus all triage areas in our department were outfitted with Apple iPads running Zoom. User adoption was high and telemedicine use increased from â¼17 to â¼90 instances a day, a 429% increase. We saw a decrease in high-risk contacts of about 75%, with a concomitant cost savings in PPE. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the use of consumer products sourced from local vendors is a viable solution for telemedicine systems focusing on speed, reducing costs, and ease of deployment. Future work will focus on studying its performance characteristics vs. other systems in an evolving landscape.","Lowe, Jason; Shen, Sam",J Emerg Med,375,16

We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (nâ¯=â¯3). COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils. No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent. These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin. In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined. In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state. It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.","Magro, Cynthia; Mulvey, J Justin; Berlin, David; Nuovo, Gerard; Salvatore, Steven; Harp, Joanna; Baxter-Stoltzfus, Amelia; Laurence, Jeffrey",Transl Res,375,29

Thus, the role of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may play a critical role in the severity or outcome of disease. Also, the effect of ACE inhibitors varies with the polymorphism in ACE2 receptors present in the individuals.

This study examined trends in health insurance coverage among trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences in demographics and clinical characteristics by insurance type. METHODS: This was a retrospective study on adult patients admitted to six level 1 trauma centers between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2020. The primary exposure was hospital admission date: January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (Period 1), January 1, 2019 to March 15, 2020 (Period 2), and March 16, 2020 to June 30, 2020 (Period 3). Covariates included demographic and clinical variables. χ² tests examined whether the rates of patients covered by each insurance type differed between the pandemic and earlier periods. Mann-Whiney U and χ² tests investigated whether patient demographics or clinical characteristics differed within each insurance type across the study periods. RESULTS: A total of 31 225 trauma patients admitted between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 were included. Forty-one per cent (n=12 651) were admitted in Period 1, 49% (n=15 258) were from Period 2, and 11% (n=3288) were from Period 3. Percentages of uninsured patients increased significantly across the three periods (Periods 1 to 3: 15%, 16%, 21%) (p(trend)=0.02); however, there was no accompanying decrease in the percentages of commercial/privately insured patients (Periods 1 to 3: 40%, 39%, 39%) (p(trend)=0.27). There was a significant decrease in the percentage of patients on Medicare during the pandemic period (Periods 1 to 3: 39%, 39%, 34%) (p<0.01). DISCUSSION: This study found that job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increases of uninsured trauma patients. However, there was not a corresponding decrease in commercial/privately insured patients, as may have been expected; rather, a decrease in Medicare patients was observed. These findings may be attributable to a growing workforce during the study period, in combination with a younger overall patient population during the pandemic.

All patients were non-smokers, six (86%) were male and median age was 56.7 (50–64) years. They had failed approaches including therapeutic anticoagulation, prone ventilation (n = 4), inhaled nitric oxide (n = 5) and nebulised epoprostenol (n = 2). The median duration of mechanical ventilation prior to thrombolysis was seven (5–11) days. Systemic alteplase was administered to six patients (50 mg or 90 mg bolus over 120 min) at 16 (10–22) days after symptom onset. All received therapeutic heparin pre- and post-thrombolysis, without intracranial haemorrhage or other major bleeding. Alteplase improved PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (from 97.0 (86.3–118.6) to 135.6 (100.7–171.4), p = 0.03) and ventilatory ratio (from 2.76 (2.09–3.49) to 2.36 (1.82–3.05), p = 0.011) at 24 h.

In the investigated period (from 2016 to 2020), 333 works about sustainable materials are found and grouped in one of the following categories: chemicals (33%), composites (11%), novel materials for pollutants sequestration (8%), bio-based and food-based materials (10%), materials for green building (8%), and materials for energy (29%). This review contributes to increasing the awareness of several of the issues concerning sustainable materials but also to encouraging the researchers to focus on SDGs’ interconnections. Indeed, the mapping of the achievements can be relevant to the decision-makers to identify the opportunities that materials can offer to achieve the final goals. In this frame, a “Sustainable Materials Partnership for SDGs” is envisaged for more suitable resource management in the future.","Bontempi, Elza; Sorrentino, Giampiero P.; Zanoletti, Alessandra; Alessandri, Ivano; Depero, Laura E.; Caneschi, Andrea",Molecules,375,20

Classifying MAS using the immunological disease continuum model, with strict boundaries that define the limits of innate and adaptive immunity, at one boundary is MAS with loss of immune function, as occurs in the ‘perforinopathies’ and some cases of sJIA–AOSD. Conversely, at the other boundary, immune hypersensitivity with gain of immune function in MHC class II-associated sJIA–AOSD and with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy also triggers MAS. This provides a benchmark for evaluating severe inflammation in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which cripples primary type I interferon immunity and usually culminates in a lung-centric ‘second wave’ cytokine-driven alveolitis with associated immunothrombosis; this phenomenon is generally distinct from MAS but can share features with the proposed ‘loss of immune function’ MAS variant. This loss and gain of function MAS model offers immune cartography for a novel mechanistic classification of MAS with therapeutic implications.","McGonagle, Dennis; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V.; Bridgewood, Charlie",Nat Rev Rheumatol,375,10

As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are highly valued and critically acclaimed in their campaign to contain and tackle the epidemic, they can achieve considerable effects for both suspected cases under medical observation period, and confirmed individuals with serious underlying diseases or critical conditions. Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19. The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research. With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials. This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.","Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Bing; Lv, Jin-Tao; Sa, Ri-Na; Zhang, Xiao-Meng; Lin, Zhi-Jian",Pharmacol Res,375,20

Preliminary molecular dynamics simulations on the apo form of M(pro) were performed taking into account both the hydrogen donor and acceptor natures of the Nδ and Nε of His41, a member of the catalytic dyad. The potential energy surfaces for the formation of the Se–S covalent bond mediated by EBS and EBS-OH on M(pro) are discussed in detail. The EBS-OH shows a distinctive behavior with respect to EBS in the formation of the noncovalent complex. Due to the presence of canonical H-bonds and noncanonical ones involving less electronegative atoms, such as sulfur and selenium, the influence on the energy barriers and reaction energy of the Minnesota hybrid meta-GGA functionals M06, M06-2X and M08HX, and the more recent range-separated hybrid functional wB97X were also considered.

Our objective was to compare the prevalence of skin symptoms and the condition of skin barrier between them at the end of vocational training. We recruited 101 hairdressing and 76 beautician apprentices (overall median age 17 years), who reported their history of skin symptoms through the Croatian translation of the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) and had their hand skin clinically examined and evaluated with the Osnabrück Hand Eczema Severity Index (OHSI). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured following the standard procedure. Hairdressing apprentices reported significantly higher prevalence of hand/wrist eczema or urticaria than beautician apprentices (35 % vs 25 %, respectively; P=0.041) and higher severity of current hand eczema [median (range) 1.5 (0–8) vs 0.5 (0–4), respectively; P<0.001] and had higher hand TEWL values in those who washed their hands >20 times a day [median (interquartile range): 24.4 (19.7–33.7) vs 18.8 (15.4–23.2) g/ m(2)/h, respectively; P<0.001). Hairdressing apprentices had more severe clinical symptoms on the hands, and 83 % of those who reported eczema also reported that exacerbation occurred during practical training in comparison to 38 % of beautician apprentices. Our study is the first to report occupational hand and forearm skin issues in the beautician apprentices and also suggests that more effort is needed to improve training about safety at work, which should be specifically tailored for these two trades.","Babić, Željka; Samardžić, Tea; Macan, Jelena",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,375,16

We investigated the influence of stem 1 length on the frameshift process by measuring the frameshift efficiency in vitro of a series of IBV-based pseudoknots whose stem 1 length was varied from 4 to 13 bp in single base-pair increments. Efficient frameshifting depended upon the presence of a minimum of 11 bp; pseudoknots with a shorter stem 1 were either non-functional or had reduced frameshift efficiency, despite the fact that a number of them had a stem 1 with a predicted stability equal to or greater than that of the wild-type IBV pseudoknot. An upper limit for stem 1 length was not determined, but pseudoknots containing a 12 or 13 bp stem 1 were fully functional. Structure probing analysis was carried out on RNAs containing either a ten or 11 bp stem 1; these experiments confirmed that both RNAs formed pseudoknots and appeared to be indistinguishable in conformation. Thus the difference in frameshifting efficiency seen with the two structures was not simply due to an inability of the 10 bp stem 1 construct to fold into a pseudoknot. In an attempt to identify other parameters which could account for the poor functionality of the shorter stem 1-containing pseudoknots, we investigated, in the context of the 10 bp stem 1 construct, the influence on frameshifting of altering the slippery sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance, loop 2 length, and the number of G residues at the bottom of the 5′-arm of stem 1. For each parameter, it was possible to find a condition where a modest stimulation of frameshifting was observable (about twofold, from seven to a maximal 17 %), but we were unable to find a situation where frameshifting approached the levels seen with 11 bp stem 1 constructs (48-57 %). Furthermore, in the next smaller construct (9 bp stem 1), changing the bottom four base-pairs to G·C (the optimal base composition) only stimulated frameshifting from 3 to 6 %, an efficiency about tenfold lower than seen with the 11 bp construct. Thus stem 1 length is a major factor in determining the functionality of this class of pseudoknot and this has implications for models of the frameshift process.","Napthine, Sawsan; Liphardt, Jan; Bloys, Alison; Routledge, Samantha; Brierley, Ian",J Mol Biol,375,1

Despite the vulnerability of all ages from the pandemic, evidence showed that elder people are at high-risk for adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease-19. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of high-risk age groups to coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among high-risk age groups from April 2 to May 9/2020 in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. A total of 422 study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Multivariable analysis was done using linear regression after checking collinearity, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 419 study participants were included in the study with a response rate of 99.3%. Overall, about 37.7%, 43.4%, and 52.5% of participants had poor knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control, respectively. Being elder (≥80) years, with no formal education, and having low-income status were among the significantly associated factors. About 76.1% of the respondents did not use hand-rub-based alcohol or sanitizer, and 88.8% did not use any mask in crowding area. CONCLUSION: Generally, the knowledge about coronavirus disease-19 in elders was roughly appropriate but the preventive practices and attitude towards coronavirus disease-19 were found less and inappropriate. Since no proven medicine is invented yet, so maximizing knowledge, increasing behavioral change, and strengthening preventive practices towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control is the appropriate solution.","Adhena, Girmay; Hidru, Hagos Degefa",Infect Drug Resist,375,20

METHODS: COVID-19 test samples (positive or negative results) from patients who attended a single hospital were evaluated. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised according to the severity of the disease. Data were submitted to exploratory analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) to detect outlier samples, recognise patterns, and identify important variables. Based on patients’ laboratory tests results, machine learning models were implemented to predict disease positivity and severity. Artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and K nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN) models were used. The four models were validated based on the accuracy (area under the ROC curve). RESULTS: The first subset of data had 5,643 patient samples (5,086 negatives and 557 positives for COVID-19). The second subset included 557 COVID-19 positive patients. The ANN, DT, PLS-DA, and KNN models allowed the classification of negative and positive samples with >84% accuracy. It was also possible to classify patients with severe and non-severe disease with an accuracy >86%. The following were associated with the prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and severity: hyperferritinaemia, hypocalcaemia, pulmonary hypoxia, hypoxemia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, low urinary pH, and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that all the models could assist in the diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19 severity.","Cobre, Alexandre de Fátima; Stremel, Dile Pontarolo; Noleto, Guilhermina Rodrigues; Fachi, Mariana Millan; Surek, Monica; Wiens, Astrid; Tonin, Fernanda Stumpf; Pontarolo, Roberto",Comput Biol Med,375,1

This often creates local disconnectedness that energizes the current populist backlash against MNE activities. We develop approaches to new IB theory, addressing the interdependencies of MNEs and city-regions that we propose as a crucial avenue for future research. We contrast two generic MNE strategies. The first is the traditional one: the ‘global orchestration’ of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call ‘local spawning,’ involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events. Addressing disconnections requires MNEs to re-orient their strategies while dealing with disruptions requires undertaking risk mitigation. We present empirical evidence from city-regions around the world to illustrate our theory.","Lorenzen, Mark; Mudambi, Ram; Schotter, Andreas",J Int Bus Stud,375,24

In total, 55 BC women at stages I-IIIA were enrolled. They were randomly assigned either to Control group, receiving general lifestyle advice (n = 28) or the CDSS group (n = 27), to whom the CDSS provided personalised dietary plans based on the Mediterranean diet (MD) together with physical activity guidelines. Food data, anthropometry, blood markers and quality of life were evaluated. At 3 months, higher adherence to MD was recorded in the CDSS group, accompanied by lower body weight (kg) and body fat mass percentage compared to control (p < 0.001). In the CDSS arm, global health/quality of life was significantly improved at the trial endpoint (p < 0.05). Fasting blood glucose and lipid levels (i.e., cholesterol, LDL, triacylglycerols) of the CDSS arm remained unchanged (p > 0.05) but were elevated in the control arm at 3 months (p < 0.05).

We searched online databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest) for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2002 and October 2020. Eligible studies reported either quantitative or qualitative accounts of pandemic-related discrimination from the perspectives of racially minoritized peoples in high-income contexts. Two authors screened 30% of titles/abstracts, and all full-text articles. Each article included for extraction underwent a quality assessment by two reviewers. Data were extracted and categorized thematically using NVivo 12, followed by a secondary analysis informed by critical race theory. Of the 1289 articles screened, 16 articles from five countries met the inclusion criteria. Racial discrimination is heightened during pandemic periods, due to the social association of specific racial groups with pandemic diseases including COVID-19, SARS (Asian), H1N1 (Hispanic) and Ebola (African). Fear based responses to racially minoritized peoples during pandemic periods included verbal/physical abuse, hypersurveillance, and avoidance, often occurring in public spaces. Pandemic-related racism had subsequent impacts on mental health and health care accessibility. Various coping strategies, including community support, avoidance, and problem solving, were documented in response to racial discrimination. Racialized discrimination and violence is a serious threat to the health and wellbeing of racially minoritized peoples, particularly due to its increase during pandemic periods. Racism must be recognized as a public health issue, and efforts to address its increased impact in pandemic contexts should be made, including ensuring that adequate representation of racially minoritized groups is present in policy, planning, and implementation.","Yashadhana, Aryati; Derbas, Alexia; Biles, Jessica; Grant, Julian",Health Promot Int,375,1

The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS) was designed to assess and mitigate adverse short and long-term physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on New York's health care workforce. Here we report selected baseline results. Methods. Online survey of New York State physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants registered with the New York State Department of Health. Survey-weighted descriptive results were analyzed using frequencies, proportions, and means, with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios were calculated for association using survey-weighted logistic regression. Results. Approximately 51.5% (95% CI 49.1, 54.0) of the survey-weighted respondents reported having worked directly or in close physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Of those tested for COVID-19, 27.3% (95% CI 22.5, 32.2) were positive. Having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was associated with reporting a subsequent positive COVID-19 test (OR=14.0, 95% CI 5.7, 34.7). Over half of the respondents, (57.6%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 efforts on their mental health. Respondents who indicated that they were redeployed or required to do different functions than usual in response to COVID-19 were more likely to report negative mental health impacts (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6).

Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with prolonged hospital stay, and represent a significant risk factor for neurological development problems and death. Improving HCAI control is a priority for NICUs. Many factors contribute to the occurrence of HCAIs in neonates such as poor hand hygiene, low nurse–infant ratios, environmental contamination and unnecessary use of antibiotics. Prevention is based on improving neonatal management, avoiding unnecessary use of central venous catheters, restricting use of antibiotics and H2 blockers, and introducing antifungal prophylaxis if necessary. Quality improvement interventions to reduce HCAIs in neonates seem to be the cornerstone of infection control.","Legeay, C.; Bourigault, C.; Lepelletier, D.; Zahar, J.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 30 December 2019 to 12 May 2020. RESULTS: We identified 113 studies conducted in 17 countries. The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus. CONCLUSION: There is a relatively consistent trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the course of COVID-19 from respiratory tract samples, however the duration of infectivity remains uncertain.","Walsh, Kieran A.; Jordan, Karen; Clyne, Barbara; Rohde, Daniela; Drummond, Linda; Byrne, Paula; Ahern, Susan; Carty, Paul G.; O'Brien, Kirsty K.; O'Murchu, Eamon; O'Neill, Michelle; Smith, Susan M.; Ryan, Máirín; Harrington, Patricia",J Infect,375,1

The secondary objective was to compare the characteristics of these ADRs in 2020 with those notified during the same calendar period a year previously Material and methods: We analyzed ADRs recorded in the FPVD between March 15th and May 31st, 2020 vs. the same dates in 2019. Only ADRs linked to self-medication were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to obtain an overview of the types and characteristics of these ADRs. Results Of 3114 ADRs notified to the FPVD during the COVID-19 period in 2020, 114 (3.7%) were linked to self-medication. The equivalent proportion in 2019 was 1.6% (113 out of 7097). Half of the ADRs notified in 2020 were “serious”. The median age of affected patients was 30.5, and 22% of the ADRs concerned children. Of the 114 ADRs linked to self-medication, 107 (66%) were for prescription-only drugs. The three mostly frequently suspected ATC classes were analgesics, psycholeptics, and antibacterials for systemic use. The most frequent ADRs were general disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and nervous system disorders. The main difference between the non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period was the higher proportion of medication errors during the latter. Conclusion The present study is the first to have reported on ADRs linked to self-medication and notified during a COVID-19 outbreak. Further studies of self-medication patterns and their consequences in a pandemic context are mandatory and effective information on medication use (including self-medication and its dangers) during a pandemic is essential.","Gras, Marion; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Moragny, Julien; Delaunay, Paul; Laugier, Delphine; Masmoudi, Kamel; Liabeuf, Sophie",Ann Pharm Fr,375,16

The research employs a model of the laboratory's testing process, created after interviewing of PCR laboratories and studying their operations. The limitations and operational characteristics of this model were applied in a simulation of the testing process with different pool-testing strategies managed by a computer program developed in the LOMT project. The efficiency indicators assessed are the number of assays needed to obtain results of a batch of specimens, the number of specimens identified after the first analysis, and total time to obtain all results. Depending on prevalence, constraints of testing, and priorities of optimization, different pool-testing strategies provide the best operational efficiency. The binary splitting algorithm provides the maximum reduction of the number of assays: from 1.99x reduction for a high prevalence (10%) to 25x reduction for a low prevalence (0.1%), while other algorithms provide the least amount of time to obtain results or the maximum number of the specimens classified after the first analysis.","Vechera, K.",,375,20

Systemic side effects in the form of fatigue (52%), myalgia (44%), headache (42%), and fever (35%) prevailed mainly after the first dose. These were significantly associated with AZ vaccine, and age ≤ 45 years (p = 0.000 and 0.01, respectively). No serious SE were reported. Conclusions We can conclude that SE of COVID-19 vaccines distributed in Jordan are within the common range known so far for these vaccines. Further studies are needed to include larger sample size and longer follow-up period to monitor possible serious and long-term SE of the vaccines.","Abu-Hammad, Osama; Alduraidi, Hamza; Abu-Hammad, Shaden; Alnazzawi, Ahmed; Babkair, Hamzah; Abu-Hammad, Abdalla; Nourwali, Ibrahim; Qasem, Farah; Dar-Odeh, Najla",Vaccines (Basel),375,3

In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. METHODS: Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006–16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. FINDINGS: The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose–response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. INTERPRETATION: People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

It is well-established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulated immune responses. Arginase-1 (Arg1), which has a pivotal role in immune cells, can be expressed in most of the myeloid cells, e.g., neutrophils and macrophages. Arg1 has been associated with the suppression of antiviral immune responses. Methods: Whole blood was taken from 21 COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy individuals, and after RNA extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, gene expression of Arg1 was measured by real-time PCR. Results: The qPCR results showed that the expression of Arg1 was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.01). The relative expression analysis demonstrated there were approximately 2.3 times increased Arg1 expression in the whole blood of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a considerable diagnostic value for Arg1 expression in COVID-19 (p = 0.0002 and AUC = 0.8401). Conclusion: Arg1 might be a promising marker in the pathogenesis of the disease, and it could be a valuable diagnostic tool.","Derakhshani, Afshin; Hemmat, Nima; Asadzadeh, Zahra; Ghaseminia, Moslem; Shadbad, Mahdi Abdoli; Jadideslam, Golamreza; Silvestris, Nicola; Racanelli, Vito; Baradaran, Behzad",J Clin Med,375,2

The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Therefore, during the epidemic, patients with similar symptoms will be tested for multiple pathogens at the same time. In order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China has taken many measures. Under this special situation, have the types and epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses changed? The nucleic acid test results of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as the antibody test results of 8 common respiratory viruses of Jinan Central Hospital were collected before and after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and age distribution and time distribution characteristics were statisticed. Furthermore the epidemiological characteristics of this new virus before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was compared. In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid test samples were large, and the positive rate of the three viruses was high. After that, the sample size and positive rate decreased significantly. No co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was found in our hospital. The sample size before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was larger than that after the outbreak, but the positive rate of the outbreak was lower than that after the outbreak. And the infection rate of children decreased in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. This is because since January 23, in order to prevent the spread of the new crown epidemic, my country has adopted measures such as wearing masks, not gathering together, and quarantining at home. This not only prevents the spread of the new crown virus, but also prevents the common respiratory tract. The spread of the virus has reduced the incidence of residents.","Yang, Weihua; Chen, Jian; Xu, Mingjie; Wang, Jun; Li, Huanjie; Wang, Yunshan",,375,16

The mortality rate for patients with ESRD in the United States has been declining since 2001 (2). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients are at high risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, which is due, in part, to weakened immune systems and presence of multiple comorbidities (3-5). The ESRD National Coordinating Center (ESRD NCC) supports the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the ESRD Networks†,§ through analysis of data, dissemination of best practices, and creation of educational materials. ESRD NCC analyzed deaths reported to the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb), a system that facilitates the collection of data and maintenance of information about ESRD patients on chronic dialysis or receiving a kidney transplant who are treated in Medicare-certified dialysis facilities and kidney transplant centers in the United States. Excess death estimates were obtained by comparing observed and predicted monthly numbers of deaths during February 1-August 31, 2020; predicted deaths were modeled based on data from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. The analysis estimated 8.7-12.9 excess deaths per 1,000 ESRD patients, or a total of 6,953-10,316 excess deaths in a population of 798,611 ESRD patients during February 1-August 31, 2020. These findings suggest that deaths among ESRD patients during the early phase of the pandemic exceeded those that would have been expected based on previous years' data. Geographic and temporal patterns of excess mortality, including those among persons with ESRD, should be considered during planning and implementation of interventions, such as COVID-19 vaccination, infection control guidance, and patient education. These findings underscore the importance of data-driven technical assistance and further analyses of the causes and patterns of excess deaths in ESRD patients.","Ziemba, Robert; Campbell, Kyle N.; Yang, Tsu-Hsuan; Schaeffer, Sara Eve; Mayo, Kelly M.; McGann, Paul; Quinn, Shalon; Roach, Jesse; Huff, Edwin D.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,375,20

It is suggested that COVID-19 associated PE represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism, although the origin of thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of PE in 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute PE before the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, RV/LV diameter ratio, pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load (according to Qanadli) were measured and compared. RESULTS: We observed that all thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19. Also, the thrombus load was lower in COVID-19 patients (Qanadli score −8%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] −16 to −0.36%) as was the prevalence of the most proximal PE in the main/lobar pulmonary artery (17% versus 47%; −30%, 95%CI −44% to −8.2). Moreover, the mean RV/LV ratio (mean difference −0.23, 95%CI −0.39 to −0.07) and the prevalence of RV/LV ratio >1.0 (prevalence difference −23%, 95%CI −41 to −0.86%) were lower in the COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings therefore suggest that the phenotype of COVID-19 associated PE indeed differs from PE in patients without COVID-19, fuelling the discussion on its pathophysiology.","van Dam, L.F.; Kroft, L.J.M.; van der Wal, L.I.; Cannegieter, S.C.; Eikenboom, J.; de Jonge, E.; Huisman, M.V.; Klok, F.A.",Thromb Res,375,30

Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19. Methods: Blood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays. Results: ILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the potential role of ILCs in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19.","Garcia, M.; Kokkinou, E.; Carrasco Garcia, A.; Parrot, T.; Palma Medina, L.

Most cases presented with mild respiratory symptoms and required only supportive care with instructions to self-quarantine at home. Others had more severe symptoms that became complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required hospitalization.

The patient was managed for DKA on presentation with insulin protocol and acidosis management. However, it became evident that he had underlying respiratory complications, which later presented as ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that clinicians be aware of this potentially fatal complication in all patients with pre-existing diabetes. Simultaneously, a low threshold for intubation should be advocated for patients with concurrent COVID-19 and type I diabetes mellitus since the potential for poor clinical outcomes from respiratory demise may be lessened by early respiratory intervention.","Singh, Sukhdev; Foster, Allison; Khan, Zohaib; Siddiqui, Aisha; Atere, Muhammed; Nfonoyim, Jay M.",Am J Case Rep,375,1

Advax™ is a novel adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles that enhances immunity with a minimal inflammatory profile and has entered human trials to protect against viral pathogens. In this report we determined if Advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with M. tuberculosis. The fusion protein CysVac2, comprising the M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85B (Rv1886c) and CysD (Rv1285) formulated with Advax provided significant protection in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Protection was associated with the generation of CysVac2-specific multifunctional CD4(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+)TNF(+)IL-2(+)). Addition to Advax of the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide (Advax(CpG)), improved both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CysVac2. Immunisation with CysVac2/Advax(CpG) resulted in heightened release of the chemoattractants, CXCL1, CCL3, and TNF, and rapid influx of monocytes and neutrophils to the site of vaccination, with pronounced early priming of CysVac2-specific CD4(+) T cells. As delta inulin adjuvants have shown an excellent safety and tolerability profile in humans, CysVac2/Advax(CpG) is a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation for progression to human trials.","Counoupas, Claudio; Pinto, Rachel; Nagalingam, Gayathri; Britton, Warwick J.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Triccas, James A.",Sci Rep,375,12

METHODS: A total of 28 UCPP patients underwent Skype video consultations. Pain intensity was assessed with Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS‐21) were used to assess catastrophizing and psychological status. RESULTS: During SARS‐CoV‐2, UCPP patients showed higher intensity of pain than before (mean ± SD PNRS score: 7.25 ± 0.9 vs. 5.4 ± 0.7; p < .0001), with pain exacerbation in 75%; they showed higher PCS and DASS‐21 scores as compared to before the pandemic (mean ± SD PCS total score: 32.4 ± 1.2 vs. 23.7 ± 3.5; mean ± SD DASS‐21 total score: 42.03 ± 4.5 vs. 34.4 ± 2.2; p < .001 and p < .001, respectively).

Approximately 1,100 evacuees from the fire sought emergency shelter. On November 10, acute gastroenteritis (AGE) was reported in two evacuation shelters; norovirus illness was suspected, because it is commonly detected in shelter-associated AGE outbreaks. Norovirus is highly contagious and resistant to several disinfectants. Butte County Public Health Department (BCPHD), assisted by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), initiated active surveillance to identify cases, confirm the etiology, and assess shelter infection prevention and control (IPC) practices to guide recommendations. During November 8-30, a total of 292 patients with AGE were identified among nine evacuation shelters; norovirus was detected in 16 of 17 unique patient stool specimens. Shelter IPC assessments revealed gaps in illness surveillance, isolation practices, cleaning, disinfection, and handwashing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission also suppress the circulation of other contagious microorganisms. The primary objective is to compare the number and incidence of KD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, and the secondary objective is to investigate temporal association between the KD epidemiology and activities of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral and bacterial infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 in Kobe, Japan. We collected information of hospitalised KD children in Kobe. Child population was identified through the resident registry system. Activity of COVID-19 and 11 other infectious diseases was derived from a public health monitoring system. Monthly change of KD incidence was analysed using a difference-in-difference regression model. RESULTS: Throughout the study period, 1027 KD children were identified. KD had begun to decline in April 2020, coinciding with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of KD cases (n=66) between April and December 2020 was 40% of the average in the same period in 2016–2019 (165/year). Annual KD incidence was 315, 300, 353, 347 and 188/100 000 children aged 0–4 years in 2016–2020, respectively. The difference-in-difference value of KD incidence was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter in 2020 (−15.8, 95% CI −28.0 to −3.5), compared with that in 2016–2019. Sentinel surveillance showed a marked decrease of all infectious diseases except exanthema subitum after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 86 COVID-19 cases aged <10 years and no KD children associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the number and incidence of KD was dramatically reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. This change was temporally associated with decreased activities of various infectious diseases other than COVID-19, supporting the hypothesis of infection-triggered pathogenesis in KD.","Iio, Kyohei; Matsubara, Kousaku; Miyakoshi, Chisato; Ota, Kunitaka; Yamaoka, Rika; Eguchi, Junji; Matsumura, Osamu; Okutani, Takahiro; Ueda, Ikuyo; Nishiyama, Masahiro",BMJ Paediatr Open,375,20

B.1.1.7 is a recently emerged variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has several mutations in the gene encoding for the spike-protein. To assess the potential effect these mutations could have on the neutralising efficacy of antibodies, we evaluated 96 serum samples from convalescent plasma donors collected before the first occurrence of B.1.1.7 and tested their neutralising effect on wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7. We found that B.1.1.7 is more resistant to neutralisation by convalescent plasma from patients infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with an overall decrease in neutralising activity of 47.7%. Thus, the neutralising effect of convalescent plasma should be determined against the major circulating virus clades whenever possible to ensure the best possible therapeutic effect.","Müller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; Giebl, Andreas; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Bugert, Joachim J.; Gruetzner, Stefanie; Wölfel, Roman",J Clin Virol,375,24

The aim of this study was to describe the associations between phase angle (PhA) indicators obtained by BIA with length of hospital stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and 60‐day mortality in critically ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We assessed nutrition risk and body composition with BIA within 48 h from intensive care unit admission. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between variables and clinical outcomes. Survival analysis by PhA value was performed using Kaplan‐Meier curves. RESULTS: Sixty‐seven patients were included. PhA (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; P = .002), standardized PhA (SPA) (OR, 0.45; P = .001), and extracellular water/total body water ratio (OR, 3.25; P = .002) were significant predictors of 60‐day mortality. PhA <3.85° in females and <5.25° in males showed good and fair discrimination, respectively, for mortality prediction. Using cutoff values, low PhA was associated with a significantly increased risk of 60‐day mortality (hazard ratio, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.12–8.41; P = .02). No association was detected for SPA. CONCLUSION: Low PhA values could be a predictor of 60‐day mortality in critically ill patients with COVID‐19. This biological marker could be incorporated as part of nutrition and mortality risk assessment in this population.","Osuna‐Padilla, Iván Armando; Rodríguez‐Moguel, Nadia Carolina; Rodríguez‐Llamazares, Sebastián; Aguilar‐Vargas, Adriana; Casas‐Aparicio, Gustavo Alejandro; Ríos‐Ayala, Martin Armando; Hernández‐Cardenas, Carmen Margarita",JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,375,22

The relentless spread and pathogenicity of the virus have become a global public health emergency. One of the striking features of this pandemic is the pronounced impact on specific regions and ethnic groups. In particular, compared with East Asia, where the virus first emerged, SARS-CoV-2 has caused high rates of morbidity and mortality in Europe. This has not been experienced in past global viral infections, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and is unique to SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, we investigated the involvement of genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related genes, because ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ACE1 II genotype frequency in a population was significantly negatively correlated with the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Similarly, the ACE1 II genotype was negatively correlated with the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest that the ACE1 II genotype may influence the prevalence and clinical outcome of COVID-19 and serve as a predictive marker for COVID-19 risk and severity.","Yamamoto, Naoki; Ariumi, Yasuo; Nishida, Nao; Yamamoto, Rain; Bauer, Georg; Gojobori, Takashi; Shimotohno, Kunitada; Mizokami, Masashi",Gene,375,16

The WHO released certain guidelines for safety, but they were only precautionary measures. The use of information technology with a focus on fields such as data Science and machine learning can help in the fight against this pandemic. It is important to have early warning methods through which one can forecast how much the disease will affect society, on the basis of which the government can take necessary actions without affecting its economy. In this chapter, we include methods for forecasting future cases based on existing data. Machine learning approaches are used and two solutions, one for predicting the chance of being infected and other for forecasting the number of positive cases, are discussed. A trial was done for different algorithms, and the algorithm that gave results with the best accuracy are covered in the chapter. The chapter discusses autoregressive integrated moving average time series for forecasting confirmed cases for various states of India. Two classifiers, random forest and extra tree classifiers, were selected; both have an accuracy of more than 90%. Of the two, the extra tree classifier has 93.62% accuracy.

Among them, the Crosswise Model (CM) has gained considerable attention. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed empirical applications of CM and addressed a gap for quality assessment of indirect estimation models. Guided by the PRISMA protocol, we identified 45 empirical studies from electronic database and reference searches. Thirty of these were comparative validation studies (CVS) comparing CM and direct question (DQ) estimates. Six prevalence studies exclusively used CM. One was a qualitative study. Behavior investigated were substance use and misuse (k = 13), academic misconduct (k = 8), and corruption, tax evasion, and theft (k = 7) among others. Majority of studies (k = 39) applied the “more is better” hypothesis. Thirty-five studies relied on birthday distribution and 22 of these used P = 0.25 for the non-sensitive item. Overall, 11 studies were assessed as high-, 31 as moderate-, and two as low quality (excluding the qualitative study). The effect of non-compliance was assessed in eight studies. From mixed CVS results, the meta-analysis indicates that CM outperforms DQ on the “more is better” validation criterion, and increasingly so with higher behavior sensitivity. However, little difference was observed between DQ and CM estimates for items with DQ prevalence estimate around 50%. Based on empirical evidence available to date, our study provides support for the superiority of CM to DQ in assessing sensitive/transgressive behavior. Despite some limitations, CM is a valuable and promising tool for population level investigation.","Sagoe, Dominic; Cruyff, Maarten; Spendiff, Owen; Chegeni, Razieh; de Hon, Olivier; Saugy, Martial; van der Heijden, Peter G.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative care has received unprecedented levels of societal attention. Unfortunately, this has not been enough to prevent patients dying alone, relatives not being able to say goodbye and palliative care being used instead of intensive care due to resource limitations. Yet global guidance was available. In 2018, the WHO released a guide on ‘Integrating palliative care and symptom relief into the response to humanitarian emergencies and crises’—the first guidance on the topic by an international body. AIMS: This paper argues that while a landmark document, the WHO guide took a narrowly clinical bioethics perspective and missed crucial moral dilemmas. We argue for adding a population-level bioethics lens, which draws forth complex moral dilemmas arising from the fact that groups having differential innate and acquired resources in the context of social and historical determinants of health. We discuss dilemmas concerning: limitations of material and human resources; patient prioritisation; euthanasia; and legacy inequalities, discrimination and power imbalances. IMPLICATIONS: In parts of the world where opportunity for preparation still exists, and as countries emerge from COVID-19, planners must consider care for the dying. Immediate steps to support better resolutions to ethical dilemmas of the provision of palliative care in humanitarian and emergency contexts will require honest debate; concerted research effort; and international, national and local ethical guidance.","Wynne, Keona Jeane; Petrova, Mila; Coghlan, Rachel",J Med Ethics,375,5

This study elaborates Taiwan's epidemiological characteristics from the 2020 to 2021 COVID-19 pandemic from human, temporal, and geographical dimensions. Big data for cases were obtained from a public database from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in April 2021. The data were analyzed and used to compare differences, correlations, and trends for human, temporal, and geographical characteristics for imported and domestic COVID-19 cases. During the study period, 1030 cases were confirmed and the mortality rate of 1.0%. The epidemiological features indicated that most cases (953/1030, 92.5%) were imported. A comparison of the domestic confirmed and imported cases revealed the following findings: No significant difference of COVID-19 between males and females for sex was observed; For age, the risk of domestic transmission was significantly lower for 20 to 29 years old, higher for 50 to 59 years old, and >60 years old with odds ratios (ORs) (P value < .05) of 0.36, 3.37, and 2.50, respectively; For the month of infection, the ORs (P value < .05) of domestic confirmed cases during January and February 2020 were 22.428; and in terms of area of residence, the ORs (P value < .05) for domestic confirmed cases in northern and southern Taiwan were 4.473 and 0.033, respectively. Thus, the increase in domestic cases may have been caused by international travelers transmitting the virus in March 2020 and December 2020, respectively. Taiwan has been implementing effective screening and quarantine measures at airports. Moreover, Taiwan has implemented and maintained stringent interventions such as large-scale epidemiological investigation, rapid diagnosis, wearing masks, washing hands frequently, safe social distancing, and prompt clinical classifications for severe patients who were given appropriate medical measures. This is the first report comparing imported and domestic cases of COVID-19 from surveillance data from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control during January 2020 and March 2021. It illustrates that individuals infected during overseas travel are the main risk factors for the spread of COVID-19 in Taiwan. The study also highlights the importance of longitudinal and geographically extended studies in understanding the implications of COVID-19 transmission for Taiwan's population.","Wu, Chun-Han; Chou, Yu-Ching; Lin, Fu-Huang; Hsieh, Chi-Jeng; Wu, Ding-Chung; Peng, Chung-Kan; Yu, Chia-Peng",Medicine (Baltimore),375,1

With the increasing number of deaths, early identification of disease severity and interpretation of pathogenesis are very important. Aiming to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19, 75 COVID-19 patients, 34 healthy controls and 23 patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) were recruited in this study. Using liquid chip technology, 48 cytokines and chemokines were examined, among which 33 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. HGF and IL-1β were strongly associated with APACHE II score in the first week after disease onset. IP-10, HGF and IL-10 were correlated positively with virus titers. Cytokines were significantly correlated with creatinine, troponin I, international normalized ratio and procalcitonin within two weeks after disease onset. Univariate analyses were carried out, and 6 cytokines including G-CSF, HGF, IL-10, IL-18, M-CSF and SCGF-β were found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. 11 kinds of cytokines could predict the severity of COVID-19, among which IP-10 and M-CSF were excellent predictors for disease severity. In conclusion, the levels of cytokines in COVID-19 were significantly correlated with the severity of the disease in the early stage, and serum cytokines could be used as warning indicators of the severity and progression of COVID-19.

Microarray binding experiments, using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library, showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. A hexasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units was identified as the minimal binding epitope. Surface plasmon resonance showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with a much higher affinity to heparin (K(D) = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (K(D) = 1 μM) alone. It was also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. However, exogenous administered heparin or a highly sulfated HS oligosaccharide inhibited RBD binding to cells. Furthermore, an enzymatic removal of HS proteoglycan from physiological relevant tissue resulted in a loss of RBD binding. The data support a model in which HS functions as the point of initial attachment allowing the virus to travel through the glycocalyx by low-affinity high-avidity interactions to reach the cell membrane, where it can engage with ACE2 for cell entry. Microarray binding experiments showed that ACE2 and HS can simultaneously engage with the RBD, and it is likely no dissociation between HS and RBD is required for binding to ACE2. The results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a starting material for therapeutic agent development.","Liu, Lin; Chopra, Pradeep; Li, Xiuru; Bouwman, Kim M.; Tompkins, S.

These inhibitors have revealed that APN is able to modulate bioactive peptide responses (pain management, vasopressin release) and to influence immune functions and major biological events (cell proliferation, secretion, invasion, angiogenesis). Therefore, inhibition of APN/CD13 may lead to the development of anti‐cancer and anti‐inflammatory drugs. This review provides an update on the biological and pharmacological profiles of known natural and synthetic APN inhibitors. Current status on their potential use as therapeutic agents is discussed with regard to toxicity and specificity. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It has been observed that despite massive spread of the contagion in India particularly during the second wave, the overall case fatality rates remain low. This prompted us to look into dietary factors that can possibly modulate the viral impact and/or host response. In silico studies were carried out on forty-two commonly used spices and their 637 known active compounds with an aim of identifying such compounds that may have propensity to reduce viral impact or boost host immune response. We chose to study SARS-Cov-2 helicase on account of its functional importance in maintaining viral load within the host, and the human tank binding protein (TBK1) for its important role in host immunity. We carried out in silico virtual screening, docking studies with 637 phytochemical against these two proteins, using in silico methods. Upon assessing the strength of the ligand-target interactions and post simulation binding energy profile, our study identifies procyanidin-B4 from bay leaf, fenugreekine from fenugreek seed and gallotannin from pomegranate seed as active interactors that docked to viral helicase. Similarly, we identified eruboside B from garlic, gallotannin from pomegranate seed, as strong interacting partners to human TBK1. Our studies thus present dietary spice constituents as potential protagonists for further experimentation to understand how spices in the diet might help the hosts in countering the viral assault and mount a robust protective response against COVID and other infections.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this study, antioxidant potential of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) in dogs infected with canine parvovirus with a nonblinded randomized clinical trial has been carried out. A total 18 parvo‐infected dogs were randomly divided into two groups: nine parvo‐infected dogs were treated with supportive treatment and nine parvo‐infected dogs were treated with NAC along with supportive treatment. Simultaneously, nine healthy dogs were kept as healthy control. In parvo‐infected dogs, marked hemoconcentration, leucopenia, neutropenia and oxidative stress were noticed compared to healthy dogs. The NAC treatment progressively improved the leukocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts over the time in parvovirus‐infected dogs compared to dogs that received only supportive treatment. In addition, NAC treatment significantly improved glutathione S‐transferase (GST) activity and decreased nitrite plus nitrate (NOx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations on day 3 and 5 compared to supportive treatment in parvo‐infected dogs. However, supportive treatment alone failed to ameliorate oxidative stress in the infected dogs till day 5. The results of this study suggest that NAC represents a potential additional treatment option that could be considered to improve the health condition and minimize the duration of hospitalization in case of canine parvoviral diarrhea.","Gaykwad, C.; Garkhal, J.; Chethan, G.

We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003. Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane. The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate. By using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU. In addition, heparin (100 μg/mL) inhibited infection of Vero cells by 50%. Overall, the molecular and biologic characteristics of the strain HSR1 provide evidence that SARS-CoV forms a fourth genetic coronavirus group with distinct genomic and biologic features.","Vicenzi, Elisa; Canducci, Filippo; Pinna, Debora; Mancini, Nicasio; Carletti, Silvia; Lazzarin, Adriano; Bordignon, Claudio; Poli, Guido; Clementi, Massimo",Emerg Infect Dis,375,16

We hoped to find if patient compliance could be maintained and to determine the anatomical and functional consequences of consistent mask wear. While this study was ongoing, COVID-19 impacted on normal eye clinic practice, allowing an unexpected analysis of the effects of this disruption to the clinical system on mask wear and disease progress. Throughout the whole study, outcomes were positive, with a high level of consistent patient use of the mask, above 74% up to and beyond 1 year. Even during the COVID-19 1st lockdown in England, the patients maintained a 65% nightly light mask compliance. Statistically significant improvements in maculopathy, including cyst reduction (56.4% of eyes with cysts exhibited cyst shrinkage), and visual acuity (VA) improvement (42/48 eyes gained 5 letters or more) were observed and maintained to the end of the study. Anatomical improvement or stability was recorded in all but one study eye. This investigation shows that given that there is appropriate interaction with patients who are self-treating in home environment, a high level of patient compliance can be maintained, even while there are disruptions to the normal hospital clinic setup.","Meyer-Bothling, Ulrich; Meyer-Bothling, Oliver; Pinney, Marika",J Ophthalmol,375,24

Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13% to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with pre-symptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates than symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection sub-populations have reproductive numbers lower than 3. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of SARS-Cov-2 should be reconsidered.","Subramanian, R.; He, Q.; Pascual, M.",,375,1

Design Multimethod study. Setting : Cancer Centre. Participants Adult cancer survivors and oncology health care providers. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Framework-driven categorization of program modifications, qualitative interviews with patients and providers, and a comparison of process outcomes with the previous 90 days of in-person care via referrals, completed visits and attendance, method of delivery, weekly capacities, and wait times. Results The majority of program visits could be adapted to virtual delivery, with format, setting, and content modifications. Virtual care demonstrated an increase or maintenance in the number of completed visits by appointment type compared to in-person care, with attendance ranging from 80-93%. For most appointment types, capacities increased, while wait times decreased slightly. Overall, 168 patients (11% of all assessments and follow-ups) assessed virtually were identified by providers as requiring an in-person appointment due to re-assessment of musculoskeletal and/or neurological impairment (n=109, 65%) and lymphedema (n=59, 35%). The interviews (n=24) revealed that virtual care was an acceptable alternative in some circumstances, with the ability to: 1) increase access to care; 2) provide a sense of reassurance during a time of isolation; and 3) provide confidence in learning skills to self-manage impairments. Conclusions Many appointments can be successfully adapted to virtual formats to deliver cancer rehabilitation programming. Based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations that can be implemented by providers and programs to facilitate the adoption and delivery of virtual care.","Lopez, Christian J.; Edwards, Beth; Langelier, David M.; Chang, Eugene K.; Chafranskaia, Aleksandra; Jones, Jennifer M.",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,375,16

Disadvantaged parents face specific challenges creating a smoke-free home, often caring for children in accommodation without access to outdoor garden space. Existing smoke-free home interventions largely fail to accommodate these constraints. Innovative approaches are required to address this inequality. In this two-phase study, we engaged with parents living in disadvantaged areas of Edinburgh, Scotland, to explore tailored approaches to creating a smoke-free home and develop and pilot-test an intervention based on their views and preferences. In Phase 1, qualitative interviews with 17 parents recruited from Early Years Centres explored alternative approaches to smoke-free home interventions. In Phase 2, an intervention based on parents’ views and preferences was pilot-tested with parents recruited through Early Years and Family Nurse Partnership centres. Seventeen parents took part in an interview to share their views/experiences of the intervention. Data from both study phases were thematically analysed. Phase 1 findings suggested that parents associated nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with quit attempts but supported the idea of NRT use for temporary abstinence to create a smoke-free home, viewing this as a safer option than using e-cigarettes indoors. In Phase 2, 54 parents expressed an interest in accessing NRT to create a smoke-free home, 32 discussed NRT product choice during a home visit from a smoking adviser, and 20 collected their free NRT prescription from the pharmacy. NRT was used for up to 12 weeks in the home, with ongoing advice available from pharmacy staff. During qualitative interviews (n = 17), parents self-reported successfully creating a smoke-free home, quitting smoking, and reduced cigarette consumption, often exceeding their expectations regarding changes made. The intervention was acceptable to parents, but the multi-step process used to access NRT was cumbersome. Some participants were lost to this process. Parents living in disadvantaged circumstances may benefit from access to NRT for temporary abstinence in the home to assist them to protect their children from SHS exposure. Further research using a more streamlined approach to NRT access is required to determine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this approach.","O’Donnell, Rachel; Lewis, Grace; Lumsdaine, Colin; Di Tano, Giovanna; Swanston, Liz; Amos, Gillian; Finnie, Anne; Rowa-Dewar, Neneh",Int J Environ Res Public Health,375,17

In response, most affected countries have enacted measures involving compulsory confinement and restrictions on free movement, which likely influence citizens' lifestyles. This study investigates changes in health risk behaviors (HRBs) with duration of confinement. An online cross-sectional survey served to collect data about the Spanish adult population regarding health behaviors during the first 3 weeks of confinement. A large sample of participants (N = 2,741) (51.8% women; mean age 34.2 years [SD 13.0]) from all Spanish regions completed the survey. Binomial logistic regressions adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, civil status, education, and occupation), body mass index (BMI), previous HRBs, and confinement context (i.e., solitude and exposure to COVID-19) were conducted to investigate associations between the number of weeks confined and a set of six HRBs (physical activity, alcohol consumption, fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours). When adjusted, we observed significantly lower odds of experiencing a higher number of HRBs than before confinement overall in a time-dependent fashion: OR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49–0.81 for the second and OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36–0.61 for the third week of confinement. These results were equally consistent in all age and gender subgroup analyses. The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each HRB except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of COVID-19 confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.","López-Bueno, Rubén; Calatayud, Joaquín; Casaña, José; Casajús, José A.; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark A.; Andersen, Lars L.; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.",Front Psychol,375,16

It is well known that the SARS-CoV-2 gene mutates relatively slowly as compared to other viruses but still may create hurdles in developing vaccines. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative routes for its management and treatment of COVID-19. Based on the severity of viral infection in COVID-19 patients, critically ill patients (∼5%, with old age, and comorbidities) are at high risk of morbidities. The reason for this severity in such patients is attributed to “misleading cytokine storm”, which produces ARDS and results in the deaths of critically ill patients. In this connection, ethyl pyruvate (EP) controls these cytokines/chemokines, is an anti-inflammatory agent, and possesses a protective effect on the lungs, brain, heart, and mitochondria against various injuries. Considering these facts, we propose that the site-selective EP formulations (especially aerosols) could be the ultimate adjuvant therapy for the regulation of misleading cytokine storm in severely affected COVID-19 patients and could reduce the mortalities.","Tanwar, Omprakash; Soni, Aastha; Prajapat, Pawan; Shivhare, Tanu; Pandey, Pooja; Samaiya, Puneet Kumar; Pandey, Sharad Prakash; Kar, Parimal",ACS Omega,375,14

Here, we report a method for detecting novel coronaviruses with high sensitivity by using nanopores together with artificial intelligence, a relatively simple procedure that does not require RNA extraction. Our final platform, which we call the artificially intelligent nanopore, consists of machine learning software on a server, a portable high-speed and high-precision current measuring instrument, and scalable, cost-effective semiconducting nanopore modules. We show that artificially intelligent nanopores are successful in accurately identifying four types of coronaviruses similar in size, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
