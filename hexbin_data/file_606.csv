10866,"Sans-abri, sans-papiers et confinés ?",2020-05-12,"The ambient temperature–health relationship is of growing interest as the climate changes. Previous studies have examined the association between ambient temperature and mortality or morbidity, however, there is little literature available on the ambient temperature effects on year of life lost (YLL). Thus, we aimed to quantify the YLL attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature. We obtained data from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 of 70 counties in Hunan, China. In order to combine the effects of each county, we used YLL rate as a health outcome indicator. The YLL rate was equal to the total YLL divided by the population of each county, and multiplied by 100,000. We estimated the associations between ambient temperature and YLL with a distributed lag non-linear model (DNLM) in a single county, and then pooled them in a multivariate meta-regression. The daily mean YLL rates were 22.62 y/(p·100,000), 10.14 y/(p·100,000) and 2.33 y/(p·100,000) within the study period for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease death. Ambient temperature was responsible for advancing a substantial fraction of YLL, with attributable fractions of 10.73% (4.36–17.09%) and 16.44% (9.09–23.79%) for non-accidental and cardiovascular disease death, respectively. However, the ambient temperature effect was not significantly for respiratory disease death, corresponding to 5.47% (−2.65–13.60%). Most of the YLL burden was caused by a cold temperature than the optimum temperature, with an overall estimate of 10.27% (4.52–16.03%) and 15.94% (8.82–23.05%) for non-accidental and cardiovascular disease death, respectively. Cold and heat temperature-related YLLs were higher in the elderly and females than the young and males. Extreme cold temperature had an effect on all age groups in different kinds of disease-caused death. This study highlights that general preventative measures could be important for moderate temperatures, whereas quick and effective measures should be provided for extreme temperatures.","Lv, Ling-Shuang; Jin, Dong-Hui; Ma, Wen-Jun; Liu, Tao; Xu, Yi-Qing; Zhang, Xing-E; Zhou, Chun-Liang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215980/,606

32733,COVID-19: For national and European research coordination,2020-05-21,"Nursing students report chronic stress, and burnout is common. One factor related to lower burnout is resilience, though little research has studied resilience interventions in nursing students. This study had two objectives: 1) to examine the effects of a pilot resilience intervention, and 2) to investigate student attitudes about the intervention. This was a randomized controlled trial that took place from January 2017 – June 2017 at a Midwest university in the United States. First-year nursing students (N = 27) were randomly assigned to the intervention (N = 14) or control (N = 13) group. The intervention group participated in a five-week resilience intervention. Both groups completed three online surveys (before, immediately after the intervention, and three months later). Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare pre- and post-intervention scores, neither group reported significant changes in resilience or the burnout facet of cynicism. The burnout facets of exhaustion and professional efficacy significantly decreased in the intervention group, but not the control group. Participants reported satisfaction with the intervention, though most wanted more hands-on activities. This resilience intervention may be valuable for reducing burnout in nursing students, but interventions should first conduct a needs assessment.","Lanz, Julie J.",Int J Appl Posit Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223822/,606

Especially in dynamic and evolving domains, the amount of relevant sources is constantly increasing, updating and overruling previous methods and approaches. For instance, the digital transformation of manufacturing systems, called Industry 4.0, currently faces an overwhelming amount of standardization efforts and reference initiatives, resulting in a sophisticated information environment. We propose a structured dataset in the form of a semantically annotated knowledge graph for Industry 4.0 related standards, norms and reference frameworks. The graph provides a Linked Data-conform collection of annotated, classified reference guidelines supporting newcomers and experts alike in understanding how to implement Industry 4.0 systems. We illustrate the suitability of the graph for various use cases, its already existing applications, present the maintenance process and evaluate its quality.","Bader, Sebastian R.; Grangel-Gonzalez, Irlan; Nanjappa, Priyanka; Vidal, Maria-Esther; Maleshkova, Maria",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250593/,606
33134,Telemedicine applied to cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases during containment,2020-05-23,"Entity summarization is the problem of computing an optimal compact summary for an entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples from RDF data. Entity summarization supports a multiplicity of applications and has led to fruitful research. However, there is a lack of evaluation efforts that cover the broad spectrum of existing systems. One reason is a lack of benchmarks for evaluation. Some benchmarks are no longer available, while others are small and have limitations. In this paper, we create an Entity Summarization BenchMark (ESBM) which overcomes the limitations of existing benchmarks and meets standard desiderata for a benchmark. Using this largest available benchmark for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers, we perform the most extensive experiment to date where 9 existing systems are compared. Considering that all of these systems are unsupervised, we also implement and evaluate a supervised learning based system for reference.","Liu, Qingxia; Cheng, Gong; Gunaratna, Kalpa; Qu, Yuzhong",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250596/,606
33137,Resumption of leisure sports after release from containment,2020-05-22,"Executing aggregate queries on the web of data allows to compute useful statistics ranging from the number of properties per class in a dataset to the average life of famous scientists per country. However, processing aggregate queries on public SPARQL endpoints is challenging, mainly due to quotas enforcement that prevents queries to deliver complete results. Existing distributed query engines allow to go beyond quota limitations, but their data transfer and execution times are clearly prohibitive when processing aggregate queries. Following the web preemption model, we define a new preemptable aggregation operator that allows to suspend and resume aggregate queries. Web preemption allows to continue query execution beyond quota limits and server-side aggregation drastically reduces data transfer and execution time of aggregate queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches by orders of magnitude in terms of execution time and the amount of transferred data.","Grall, Arnaud; Minier, Thomas; Skaf-Molli, Hala; Molli, Pascal",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250599/,606

RESULTS: Transdermal drug delivery systems have increased in importance since the late 1970s when their use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They appeared to be an alternative resource for the administration of many potent drugs. The first transdermal drug delivery system used for biomolecules was for the treatment of hormonal disorders. Biomolecules have been used primarily in many treatments for cancer and diabetes, vaccines, hormonal disorders, and contraception. CONCLUSIONS: The latest technologies that have used such transdermal biomolecule transporters include electrical methods (physical penetration enhancers), some chemical penetration enhancers and nanocarriers. All of them allow the maintenance of the physical and chemical properties of the main proteins and peptides through these clinical treatments, allowing their efficient storage, transport, and release and ensuring the achievement of their target and better results in the treatment of many diseases.

We find that firms with high financial flexibility within an industry experience a stock price drop that is 26%, or 9.7 percentage points, lower than those with low financial flexibility. This differential return persists as stock prices rebound. Firms more exposed to the COVID-19 shock benefit more from cash holdings. No evidence suggests that recent payouts worsened the average firm’s drop in stock price.

However, the biologic properties of SARS-CoV-2 in minks are largely unknown. Here, we investigated and found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and transmits efficiently in minks via respiratory droplets; pulmonary lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 in minks are similar to those seen in humans with COVID-19. We further found that a spike protein-based subunit vaccine largely prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks. Our study indicates that minks are a useful animal model for evaluating the efficacy of drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 and that vaccination is a potential strategy to prevent minks from transmitting SARS-CoV-2.","Shuai, Lei; Zhong, Gongxun; Yuan, Quan; Wen, Zhiyuan; Wang, Chong; He, Xijun; Liu, Renqiang; Wang, Jinliang; Zhao, Qinjian; Liu, Yuxiu; Huo, Ningning; Deng, Junhua; Bai, Jingjing; Wu, Hongchao; Guan, Yuntao; Shi, Jianzhong; Tian, Kegong; Xia, Ningshao; Chen, Hualan; Bu, Zhigao",Natl Sci Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798852/,606

Therefore, we conducted this study to assess lithium toxicity-related publications using bibliometric approaches from a health point of view to assess global research trends in the lithium toxicity field to offer guidance to future research in this field. The data were retrieved from the online version of Scopus database on 6 August 2016. All records with the term 'lithium' in the title were retrieved, and those related to lithium toxicity were evaluated. There were a total of 1241 publications related to lithium toxicity published from 1913 to 2016. Articles (971 or 78.2%) were the most common type, followed by letters (179 or 14.4%) and reviews (61 or 4.9%). The annual publication of articles increased slightly after 1950 and the total number of publications related to lithium toxicity fluctuated with three peaks occurred in 1978, 1985 and 2014. The USA was the predominant country (25.38%), followed by the UK (7.82%), France (6.85%) and Canada (3.55%). Denmark had the highest productivity of publication after standardization by gross domestic product and population size. The average number of citations per article was 9.24, and the h-index for all publications in the field of lithium toxicity was 46. The highest h-index value was achieved by the USA (31) followed by the UK (21) and Canada (13). The Lancet was the highest ranked journal with 27 articles, followed by American Journal of Psychiatry with 23 articles. This study provides a bibliometric analysis on the global research trends in lithium toxicity studies during 1913-2015. There has been a progressive increase in the number of publications related to lithium toxicity published in the last decade, and most of the studies related to lithium toxicity arose from the USA and the UK.","Zyoud, Sa'ed H; Waring, W Stephen; Sweileh, Waleed M; Al-Jabi, Samah W",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.12755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28064463/,606

Methods Seventy-two patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV from multiple medical centers in western China were retrospectively analyzed, including epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and HRCT chest features. Results All patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on HRCT scans, which were mostly multifocal in both lungs and asymmetric in all patients, and were mostly in the peripheral or subpleural lung regions in 52 patients (72.22%), in the central lung regions in 16 patients (22.22%), and in both lungs with ""white lung"" manifestations in 4 patients (5.56%). Subpleural multifocal consolidation was a predominant abnormality in 38 patients (52.78%). Ground-glass opacity was seen in 34 patients (47.22%). Interlobular septal thickening was found in 18 patients, 8 of whom had only generally mild thickening with no zonal predominance. Reticulation was seen in 8 patients (11.11%), and was mild and randomly distributed. In addition, both lungs of 28 patients had 2 or 3 CT imaging features. Out of these 72 patients, 36 were diagnosed as early stage, 32 patients as progressive stage, and 4 patient as severe stage pneumonia. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of HRCT features combined with epidemiological history was not significantly different from the detection of viral nucleic acid (all P >0.05). Conclusions The HRCT features of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are characteristic to a certain degree, which when combined with epidemiological history yield high clinical value in the early detection and diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","Li, Hong-Wei; Zhuo, Li-Hua; Yan, Gao-Wu; Wang, Ji-Sheng; Huang, Guo-Ping; Li, Jia-Bing; Long, Yong-Jun; Zhang, Fang; Jiang, Yi-Shan; Deng, Li-Hua; Su, Li-Ping; Yao, Hong-Chao; Wu, Jun-Lin; Das, Sushant-Kumar; Yang, Guo-Qing; Li, Yong; Yang, Han-Feng; Du, Yong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241007/,606
208306,For the opening of COVID-19 hotels,2020,"PROBLEM: Suicide incidences among adolescents and youths during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns have been reported across the world. However, no studies have been carried out to investigate cumulative nature, patterns, and causative factors of such suicide incidences. METHODS: A purposive sampling of Google news between 15 February and 6 July was performed. After excluding duplicate reports, the final list comprised a total of 37-suicide cases across 11 countries. FINDINGS: More male suicides were reported (21-cases, i.e., 56.76%), and the mean age of the total victims was 16.6 ± 2.7 years (out of a total of 29 cases). About two-thirds of the suicides were from three countries named India (11-cases), UK (8-cases), and the USA (6-cases). Out of 23-student victims, 14 were school-going students. Hanging was the most common suicide method accounting in 51.4% of cases. The most common suicide causalities were related to mental sufferings such as depression, loneliness, psychological distress, and so forth, whereas either online schooling or overwhelming academic distress was placed as the second most suicide stressors followed by TikTok addiction-related psychological distress, and tested with the COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the temporal distribution of suicides concerning lockdowns may help in exploring and evolving public measures to prevent/decrease pandemic-related suicides in young people.","Manzar, Md Dilshad; Albougami, Abdulrhman; Usman, Norina; Mamun, Mohammed A",J Child Adolesc Psychiatr Nurs,,606
228826,Vitamin D and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence and rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major challenge to health services, and has disrupted social and economic activities worldwide. In Spain, the first pandemic wave started in mid-March 2020 and lasted for 3 months, requiring home confinement and strict lockdown. Following relaxation of the measures during the summer, a second wave commenced in mid-September 2020 and extended until Christmas 2020. METHODS: The two pandemic waves were compared using information collected from rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction assays at one university clinic in Madrid, the epicentre of the pandemic in Spain. RESULTS: In total, 1569 individuals (968 during the first wave and 601 during the second wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using fingerprick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antigen using either oral swabs or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time-tested individuals was 12.6% during the first wave and 7.7% during the second wave (P < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions within 6 months occurred at low rates, both below 5%. During the second wave, 3.5% of tested individuals were SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive, with two cases considered as re-infections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion of cases during the first wave compared with the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of 2020 was approximately 20%. Seroreversions within 6 months occurred in 4% of cases. Seroconversions and re-infections were clinically less severe during the second wave than during the first wave. Hypothetically, a lower viral inoculum as a result of social distancing, increased use of face masks, promotion of outdoor activities and restrictions on gatherings may have contributed to this lower pathogenicity.","Soriano, Vicente; Ganado-Pinilla, Pilar; Sanchez-Santos, Miguel; Gómez-Gallego, Felix; Barreiro, Pablo; de Mendoza, Carmen; Corral, Octavio",Int J Infect Dis,,606

238187,How to maintain a vital surgical activity in the event of a serious health crisis? The example of transplant in adults,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the current analysis, we searched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the human genome. To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol. These analogs might be valuable in the treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H",In Vivo,,606

To obtain the unknown data, we use an iterative method in the Gompertz model, whose formulation is well known in the field of biology. Based on data collected from the Ministry of Health from February 26, 2020, to July 2, 2020, we predict, from July 3 to 9 and at the end of the epidemic, the number of infected and killed for the whole country and for the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We estimate, until July 9, 2020, a total of 1,709,755 cases and 65,384 deaths in Brazil, 331,718 cases and 15,621 deaths in Sao Paulo, 134,454 cases and 11,574 deaths in Rio de Janeiro.

273405,Resumption of work in the building and public works sector,2020,"As countries turn wealthier, some health indicators, such as child mortality, seem to have well-defined trends. However, others, including cardiovascular conditions, do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development. Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity. This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics, such as COVID-19. To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure, we analyzed time-series for the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of men's population (mmHg) and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC) for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearson's correlation (r). Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted-U shaped curve, or a ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’. There is a positive correlation (increase GDPPC, increase SBP) in low-income countries, and a negative correlation in high-income countries (increase GDPPC, decrease SBP). As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education, which affects blood pressure. However, the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income. Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop, and therefore, avoiding the ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’ and its economic and human impacts.","Nagano, Hitoshi; Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Barros, Allan Kardec; Costa Junior, Altair da Silva",World Dev.,,606

287700,Allaitement et COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 pandemic caused a shortage of disposable N95 respirators, prompting healthcare entities to extend the use of these masks beyond their intended single-use manufacturer recommendation with a paucity of supporting research. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of ED healthcare workers (HCW) (""subjects"") required to use respirators at an academic, Level I trauma center. Subjects had been previously fit tested and assigned an appropriately sized N95 mask per hospital protocol. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts and on multiple shifts over the eight-week study period. Data points collected included the age of the mask, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. We analyzed the data using Fisher's exact test, and calculated odds ratios (OR) to determine the failure rate of disposable N95 masks following reuse. RESULTS: A total of 130 HCWs underwent fit testing and 127 were included for analysis. Mask failure rate climbed after day 2 of use, with 33.3% of masks failing at day 3, 42.9% at day 4, and 50% at &#8805; day 5. Categorizing the masks into those being used for two or fewer days vs those in use for three or more, failure was more common on day 3 of use or older compared to those in the first two days of use (41.8% vs 8.3%, P < 0.0001) with an OR of failure with an older mask of 7.9 (confidence interval [CI], 2.8-22.3). The healthcare workers' assessment of poor seal was 33.3% sensitive (CI, 18.6-51.9) and 95.7% specific (CI, 88.8-98.6) for fit test failure. CONCLUSION: Disposable N95 masks have significant failure rates following reuse in clinical practice. Healthcare personnel also performed poorly in assessing the integrity of the seal of their disposable respirators.","Check, Ronald; Kelly, Brian; McMahon, Kathleen; Balakrishnan, Vamsi; Rivard, Leah; Pester, Johnathan; Jeanmonod, Donald; Jeanmonod, Rebecca K",West J Emerg Med,,606

An evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment in near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool ( http://www.covira.info ) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world.

PURPOSE: The objectives and strategies used by an ambulatory care pharmacy team operating within a large health system's pharmacy incident command structure during the initial response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are discussed. SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, a pharmacy ""ambulatory action team"" was formed to provide ambulatory clinical pharmacy expertise and meet an immediate and ongoing need to limit nonemergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. By building a strong communication infrastructure and partnership with ambulatory care providers, clinic medical and operational leaderships, clinical laboratory staff, and infusion centers, the team was able to swiftly execute solutions and respond to new issues and requests. Ambulatory care pharmacy practice continued to advance through provision of services to vulnerable patient populations with chronic conditions that were anticipated to experience gaps in care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts resulted in expansion of pharmacists' involvement in collaborative drug therapy management, support of patients' transition from in-clinic injection to home self-administration, provision of medication assistance support, and management of 1,300 patients via protocol-based warfarin management. Additionally, ambulatory pharmacy services in 15 primary care, anticoagulation, and specialty clinic sites were transitioned to telehealth. The ambulatory action team also implemented several strategies to manage medication therapy associated with COVID-19-related shortages and implemented electronic decision support to guide prescribing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. CONCLUSION: Building a strong communication infrastructure and a pharmacy ambulatory action team were essential to respond to a crisis and continue ambulatory clinical pharmacy services expansion.","Do, Tina; Luon, Steph; Boothe, Kimberly; Stutsky, Martha; Renauer, Marie",,,606

The purpose of this study was to explore the value of CT in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, especially for patients who have negative initial results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent chest CT and swab RT-PCR tests within 3 days. Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results. The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated. Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study. The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%). Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle. The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%). Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results. Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.","Chen, Dandan; Jiang, Xinqing; Hong, Yong; Wen, Zhihui; Wei, Shuquan; Peng, Guangming; Wei, Xinhua",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,606

Development of efficacious means to assist individuals in effectively managing their during the pandemic and beyond is an imperative. We outline how stress reappraisal interventions offer a potentially efficacious, cost effective strategy to manage pandemic-related stress and minimize deleterious health consequences. Specifically, we advocate two stress management strategies: stress reappraisal, which involves prompting individuals to appraise stress as challenging and to be approached rather than threatening and to be avoided, and stress mindsets, which involves highlighting the enhancing nature of stress.

396900,Hygiene at home: A bulwark against COVID-19 to be protect from SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) first appeared in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China. Since its emergence, the COVID-19-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, has been rapidly transmitted around the globe, overwhelming the medical care systems in many countries and leading to more than 3.3 million deaths. Identification of immunological epitopes on the virus would be highly useful for the development of diagnostic tools and vaccines that will be critical to limiting further spread of COVID-19. METHODS: To find disease-specific B-cell epitopes that correspond to or mimic natural epitopes, we used phage display technology to determine the targets of specific antibodies present in the sera of immune-responsive COVID-19 patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were further applied to assess competitive antibody binding and serological detection. VaxiJen, BepiPred-2.0 and DiscoTope 2.0 were utilized for B-cell epitope prediction. PyMOL was used for protein structural analysis. RESULTS: 36 enriched peptides were identified by biopanning with antibodies from two COVID-19 patients; the peptides 4 motifs with consensus residues corresponding to two potential B-cell epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) facing COVID-19 pandemic represented an at-risk population for new psychosocial COVID-19 strain and consequent mental health symptoms. The aim of the present study was to identify the possible impact of working contextual and personal variables (age, gender, working position, years of experience, proximity to infected patients) on professional quality of life, represented by compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout, and secondary traumatization (ST), in HCWs facing COVID-19 emergency. Further, two multivariable linear regression analyses were fitted to explore the association of mental health selected outcomes, anxiety and depression, with some personal and working characteristics that are COVID-19-related. A sample of 265 HCWs of a major university hospital in central Italy was consecutively recruited at the outpatient service of the Occupational Health Department during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were assessed by Professional Quality of Life-5 (ProQOL-5), the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Seven-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) to evaluate, respectively, CS, burnout, ST, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Females showed higher ST than males, while frontline staff and healthcare assistants reported higher CS rather than second-line staff and physicians, respectively. Burnout and ST, besides some work or personal variables, were associated to depressive or anxiety scores. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent burnout and ST to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.","Buselli, Rodolfo; Corsi, Martina; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Chiumiento, Martina; Del Lupo, Elena; Dell039,; Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Massimetti, Gabriele; Osso, Liliana; Cristaudo, Alfonso; Carmassi, Claudia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,606

420010,COVID-19 and surgical activities,2020,"Introduction: Diagnostic haematuria services have been reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compromising patient care, and necessitating a more pragmatic pathway. Method: The IDENTIFY study was an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study of over 11,000 patients referred to secondary care for investigation of haematuria. Using this data, we developed strategies using combinations of imaging and cytology as triage tests to maximise cancer detection within a pragmatic pathway. Results: 8112 patients (74 4%) received an ultrasound or a CT urogram, with or without cytology. 5737 (70 7%) patients had visible haematuria (VH) and 2375 (29 3%) had non-visible haematuria (NVH). Diagnostic test performance was used to determine optimal age cut-offs for four proposed strategies. We recommended proceeding directly to transurethral resection of bladder tumour for patients of any age with positive triage tests for cancer. Patients with negative triage tests under 35-years-old with VH, or under 50-years-old with NVH can safely be discharged without undergoing flexible cystoscopy. The remaining patients may undergo flexible cystoscopy, with a greater priority for older patients to capture high risk bladder cancer. Conclusions: We suggest diagnostic strategies in patients with haematuria, which focus on detection of bladder cancer, whilst reducing the burden to healthcare services in a resource-limited setting.","Khadhouri, S.; Gallagher, K.; MacKenzie, K.; Shah, T.; Gao, C.; Moore, S.; Zimmermann, E.; Edison, E.; Jefferies, M.; Nambiar, A.; Mannas, M.; Lee, T.; Marra, G.; Marcq, G.; Gomez Rivas, J.; Assmus, M.; Ucar, T.; Claps, F.; Boltri, M.; La Montagna, G.; Nkwam, N.; Burnhope, T.; Austin, T.; Boxall, N.; Downey, A.; Sukhu, T.; Anton-Juanilla, M.; Rai, S.; Chin, Y.

We studied the physiological effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS: Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and face-shield (FS); N95 FFR, SM and FS; and powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous EKG frequency-based heart rate variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing a SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS: Ten of 12 (83%) gastroenterologists reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine (75%) of these gastroenterologists had associated significant heart rate elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2)=7.543, p=0.004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratio and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effect in the N95 FFR stage. PAPR use was better tolerated but associated with headache and elevated heart rate in 4 (33%) gastroenterologists.

435655,Hygiène à la maison : un rempart contre le COVID-19 pour se protéger du SARS-CoV-2,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the largest pandemic of the twenty-first century (COVID-19), threatening the life and economy of all countries in the world. The identification of novel therapies and vaccines that can mitigate or control this global health threat is among the most important challenges facing biomedical sciences. To construct a long-term strategy to fight both SARS-CoV-2 and other possible future threats from coronaviruses, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus action. The viral entry and associated infectivity stems from the formation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complex with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein molecule can be used to elucidate the molecular pathways that can be targeted with allosteric drugs to weaken the spike-ACE2 interaction and, thus, reduce viral infectivity. In this study, we present the results of the application of different computational methods aimed at detecting allosteric sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The adopted tools consisted of the protein contact networks (PCNs), SEPAS (Affinity by Flexibility), and perturbation response scanning (PRS) based on elastic network modes. All of these methods were applied to the ACE2 complex with both the SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins. All of the adopted analyses converged toward a specific region (allosteric modulation region [AMR]), present in both complexes and predicted to act as an allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein with ACE2. Preliminary results on hepcidin (a molecule with strong structural and sequence with AMR) indicated an inhibitory effect on the binding affinity of the spike protein toward the ACE2 protein.","Di Paola, Luisa; Hadi-Alijanvand, Hamid; Song, Xingyu; Hu, Guang; Giuliani, Alessandro",J Proteome Res,,606

455850,Breastfeeding and COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: Co-infections in hospitalized patients are associated with higher mortality. The rate of co-infection in COVID-19 at the time of hospitalization is estimated at around 10%, but the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system following the initial infectious period is unknown. Here we describe the case of a previously healthy patient hospitalized with coccidioides pulmonary infection following mild COVID-19 disease. Case: A 52-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to the hospital with worsening non-productive cough, left-sided pleuritic chest pain, fevers, chills and sweats. Four weeks prior to presentation, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. He experienced respiratory symptoms for 7 days and then made a full recovery. Ten days later, he developed a new cough. He was found to have a new infiltrate on chest radiograph and was treated with two courses of oral antibiotics without improvement. CT chest was done and found to be concerning for a ""fungal ball"" and he subsequently presented to Jacobs Medical Center. He denied occupational exposures or smoking history. He was born in Ohio, and moved to California at age 3. Chest CT showed a left lower lobe mass-like consolidation with central necrosis, trace pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis to 17 that was neutrophil predominant. Over the next 5 days, his absolute eosinophil count climbed from 400 to 1100. COVID-19 PCR testing at the time of admission was negative. During bronchoscopy, there were two submucosal nodules in the distal trachea and left mainstem bronchus and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained from the left lower lobe. Cytopathic review of the BAL fluid revealed acute inflammation and spherules consistent with Coccidioides immitis. The BAL cell count revealed 21% eosinophils and fungal cultures grew coccidioides. Coccidioides IgM was positive, while IgG was negative. He was initiated on fluconazole therapy with rapid resolution of fevers and improvement in his cough and pleuritic chest pain. Discussion: This is a classic presentation of acute coccidioidomycosis infection involving a lobar necrotizing pneumonia, peripheral and BAL eosinophilia, bronchial submucosal nodules, positive serum IgM antibodies, fungal cultures, and cytopathologic exam. This case highlights the possibility that patients with COVID-19 infection are at increased risk of developing subsequent infections. It will be important for providers to remain vigilant for opportunistic infections at the time of presentation and in the period following COVID-19 infection.","Luoma, K.; Crouch, D.

466180,For a veterinary help to the Covid-19 diagnosis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant burden since December 2019 that has negatively impacted the global economy owing to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is fast-transmitting and highly contagious. Efforts have been taken to minimize the impact through strict screening measures in country borders in order to isolate potential virus carriers. Effective fast-screening methods are thus needed to identify infected individuals. The standard diagnostic methods for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus have always been to perform nucleic acid-based and serological tests. However, with each having drawbacks on producing false results at very early or later stage after symptoms onset, supplementary techniques are needed to back up these tests. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a detection technique has continuously advanced throughout the years in terms of sensitivity and capability to detect ultralow concentration of analytes ranging from single molecule to pathogens, to present as a highly potential alternative to known sensing methods. SERS technology as a candidate for an alternative and supplementary diagnostic method for the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 virus is presented, comparing its pros and cons to the standard methods and what other aspects it could offer that the other methods are not capable of. Factors that contribute to the detection effectivity of SERS is also discussed to show the advantages and limitations of this technique. Despite its promising capabilities, challenges like sources of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations, reliable SERS spectra, mass production of SERS-active substrates, and compliance to regulations for wide-scale testing scenario are highlighted.","Sitjar, Jaya; Liao, Jiunn-Der; Lee, Han; Tsai, Huey-Pin; Wang, Jen-Ren; Liu, Ping-Yen",Biosens Bioelectron,,606

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 disease on urological activity in Tunisia. To assess the differences in the management of urological conditions between the private and the public field. Methods: a survey was addressed to all certified urologists working in Tunisia in both the public and private sectors (n=194) using the national database of active urologists available and updated. We either called them or looked them up through email or social media. The form was open from March the 28th to April the 3rd. Results were obtained via spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS 23.0. Results: one hundred and twenty urologists have filled in the form. Consultations at the outpatient office were restricted to urgent cases in 66% (n=79). Telemedicine was more used by urologists in private than in public fields p=0.03. Urologists in private sector followed more the sterilization protocol of the hospital/clinic and used more disposable materials whenever possible p=0.011. Elective surgical activity has completely stopped in 85% of the responders (n=102). Elective surgery requiring transfusion or intensive care unit was performed in 38% (n=46) and 26% (n=31) if there was a risk of disease progression.

481718,Masks and COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: Perfusion MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents is useful for diagnosis and treatment response evaluation of brain tumors. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors. METHODS: One hundred nine brain-tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (&#961; = 0.87, P < .05 and &#961; = 0.86, P < .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (&#961; = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval of ±0.47. CONCLUSION: Realistic rCBV maps can be synthesized from DCE MRI and contain quantitative information, enabling robust brain-tumor perfusion imaging of DSC and DCE parameters with a single gadolinium-based contrast agent administration.","Sanders, Jeremiah W; Chen, Henry Szu-Meng; Johnson, Jason M; Schomer, Donald F; Jimenez, Jorge E; Ma, Jingfei; Liu, Ho-Ling",Magn.

Our parameter spectrum was reduced to the essential analyses in agreement with our clinical colleagues. So far the system works well. In model calculations, the system is robust to maintain essential laboratory functionality even when incidence of COVID-19 is higher than that currently observed in the most severely hit countries. We outline a cohort-based emergency planning to maintain essential functionality of a clinical laboratory while minimizing the risk of spreading infection with COVID-19 among our workforce during the COVID-19 epidemic faced in 2020.","Pütz, Gerhard; Müller, Manuela; Winkler, Karl",J.

DESIGN: We used an abbreviated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures preprinted or published by 1 June 2020. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled. Thirteen studies investigated international measures, while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Wuhan measures reduced the number of cases exported internationally by 70%-80% and led to important reductions in transmission within Mainland China. Additional travel measures, including flight restrictions to and from China, may have led to additional reductions in the number of exported cases. Few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures did not account for domestic travel measures thus likely leading to biased estimates. CONCLUSION: Travel measures played an important role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps and also a need to review how evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.","Grépin, Karen Ann; Ho, Tsi-Lok; Liu, Zhihan; Marion, Summer; Piper, Julianne; Worsnop, Catherine Z; Lee, Kelley",,,606

METHODS: The validation, in addition to the evaluation of precision and accuracy, included the analysis of the effects of the main procedures that are currently being used for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in saliva and a pilot study to evaluate the possible changes in salivary tADA and isoenzymes in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The automated assay proved to be accurate and precise, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation below 8.2%, linearity under dilution linear regression with R2 close to 1, and recovery percentage between 80 and 120% in all cases. This assay was affected when the sample is treated with heat or SDS for virus inactivation but tolerated Triton X-100 and NP-40. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=71) and who recovered from infection (n=11) had higher mean values of activity of tADA and its isoenzymes than healthy individuals (n=35). CONCLUSIONS: tADA and its isoenzymes ADA1 and ADA2 can be measured accurately and precisely in saliva samples in a rapid, economical, and reproducible way and can be analyzed after chemical inactivation with Triton X-100 and NP-40. Besides, the changes observed in tADA and isoenzymes in individuals with COVID-19 open the possibility of their potential use as non-invasive biomarkers in this disease.","Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Tecles, Fernando; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Bernal, Enrique; San Lázaro, Indra; Alcaraz, María José; Vicente-Romero, María R; Lamy, Elsa; Sánchez-Resalt, Cristina; Rubio, Camila P; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Cerón, José J",Clin. chem. lab. med,,606

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of completeness in case detection and contact tracing and speed of isolation and quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0: 2.5, generation time: 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes in the proportion of cases detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Results from this model also indicate that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of the impact of test-trace-isolate are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history and adherence to isolation and quarantine, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the ""test"" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","Grantz, Kyra H; Lee, Elizabeth C; D039,; Agostino McGowan, Lucy; Lee, Kyu Han; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Gurley, Emily S; Lessler, Justin",PLoS Med,,606

Molecular assays are the preferred method to detect a broad range of viral pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, can be hindered by resource availability or technical constraints. We present a screening strategy that is easily scaled up to support a sustained large volume of testing over long periods of time. This non-adaptive pooled-sample screening protocol employs Bayesian inference to yield a reportable outcome for each individual sample in a single testing step (no confirmation of positive results required). The proposed method is validated using clinical specimens tested using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. This screening protocol has substantial advantages for its implementation, including higher sample throughput, faster time to results, no need to retrieve previously screened samples from storage to undergo retesting, and excellent performance of the algorithm's sensitivity and specificity compared with the individual test's metrics.","Sobczyk, Juliana; Pyne, Michael T.; Barker, Adam; Mayer, Jeanmarie; Hanson, Kimberly E.; Samore, Matthew H.; Noriega, Rodrigo","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129787/,606

Materials and Methods: Following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), three electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, PEDro), along with the addition of grey literature, were used to collect information. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing tele-rehabilitation (TR) to office-based-rehabilitation (OB) were critically appraised using the 2005 University of Oxford Standard. A total of 139 articles (PubMed = 132, CINAHL = 5, PEDro = 0, grey literature = 2) were acquired. Results: After the screening, three RCTs were included in our review. Their results show no statistically significant differences between TR and OB intervention. Furthermore, their results showed an overall reduction in pain in both groups from the baseline to the end of the study. However, each intervention’s clinical efficiency was dependent on the exercise protocol itself and not on the method of delivery. There is a potential ceiling effect to the amount of therapy a patient can receive in which additional therapy would no longer lead to improved recovery. Conclusions: Our review suggests evidence that TR’s efficacy is similar to that of OB for improvement of WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score parameters in patients suffering from knee OA.","Latif-Zade, Tamila; Tucci, Brian; Verbovetskaya, Danna; Bialkin, Elizabeth; Ng, Brian; Heddon, Stephan; Berteau, Jean-Philippe",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440970/,606

A six-year-old male European short-hair cat from Austria presented poor general condition, lethargy, anorexia, icterus, a painful abdomen, fever, ruffled hair and a tick infestation, and it had never left Austria. Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased serum levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and bilirubin. In May Grünwald-Giemsa-stained blood smears, structures resembling Hepatozoon gamonts were observed inside neutrophil granulocytes. A PCR targeting a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. and DNA sequencing allowed the diagnosis of H. felis-DNA in blood samples. The cat was treated with imidocarb dipropionate (6 mg/kg body weight, repeated after 14 days) and doxycycline monohydrate (5 mg/kg body weight twice a day, p.o., for four weeks) and recovered completely. A broad haematological and biochemical laboratory control after six months showed all evaluated parameters under normal ranges. Coinfection with other feline pathogens (i.e. feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline Coronavirus, Leishmania and Dirofilaria immitis) could not be detected.

The example of transplant in adults,2020-07-12,"BACKGROUND: The interferon-inducible transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) is a protein that restricts multiple pathogenic viruses such as influenza virus. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C, which is rare in Caucasian populations, but much more common in the Han Chinese population, has been found in much higher homozygous frequency in patients with severe acute influenza. Until now, there has been no study on the effect of this genetic variant on the clinical control of other viral infections. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes on primary HIV-1 infection progression in an acute HIV-1-infected cohort in Beijing (PRIMO), China. DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes of 178 acute HIV-1-infected patients and 196 HIV-negative candidates from the PRIMO cohort. HIV-1 viral load and CD4(+) T-cell counts were monitored at multiple time points during the first year of infection, and the association between IFITM3-rs12252 genotype and disease progression was evaluated. RESULTS: The current study shows that the IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variant affects the progression of HIV-1 infection, but not the acquisition. A significantly higher frequency of the CC/CT genotypes was found in rapid progressors compared to nonprogressors. Patients with CC/CT genotypes showed an elevated peak viremia level and significantly lower CD4(+) T-cell count at multiple time points during the first year of primary infection, and a significantly higher risk of rapid decline of the CD4(+) T-cell count to below 350 cells/μl. CONCLUSION: A novel association between IFITM3 gene polymorphism and rapid disease progression is reported in an acute HIV-1-infected MSM cohort in China.","Zhang, Yonghong; Makvandi-Nejad, Shokouh; Qin, Ling; Zhao, Yan; Zhang, Tong; Wang, Lili; Repapi, Emmanouela; Taylor, Stephen; McMichael, Andrew; Li, Ning; Dong, Tao; Wu, Hao",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25784441/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000000632,606

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective analysis of international asymptomatic travellers entering Alberta, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were required to receive a PCR COVID-19 test on arrival. If negative, participants could leave quarantine but were required to have a second test 6 or 7 days after arrival. If the arrival test was positive, participants were required to remain in quarantine for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion and rate of participants testing positive for COVID-19; number of cases of secondary transmission. RESULTS: The analysis included 9535 international travellers entering Alberta by air (N=8398) or land (N=1137) that voluntarily enrolled in the Alberta Border Testing Pilot Programme (a subset of all travellers); most (83.1%) were Canadian citizens. Among the 9310 participants who received at least one test, 200 (21.5 per 1000, 95% CI 18.6 to 24.6) tested positive. Sixty-nine per cent (138/200) of positive tests were detected on arrival (14.8 per 1000 travellers, 95% CI 12.5 to 17.5). 62 cases (6.7 per 1000 travellers, 95% CI 5.1 to 8.5; 31.0% of positive cases) were identified among participants that had been released from quarantine following a negative test result on arrival. Of 192 participants who developed symptoms, 51 (26.6%) tested positive after arrival. Among participants with positive tests, four (2.0%) were hospitalised for COVID-19; none required critical care or died. Contact tracing among participants who tested positive identified 200 contacts; of 88 contacts tested, 22 were cases of secondary transmission (14 from those testing positive on arrival and 8 from those testing positive thereafter).

Due to the high adaptation of the virus, COVID-19 demonstrated a high transmission and infectivity potentials. Several studies demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induce deleterious neurological manifestations through interacting with the central nervous system (CNS). MAIN BODY: The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to its fatal behavior. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this novel neuropathogen might contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The manifestations of neural damage in COVID-19 patients ranged from headache to severe encephalopathy and progression of preexisting neural disorders, it is speculated that neuroinvasion is strongly linked to the fatal respiratory dysfunction. The underlying neuropathological impact of emerging pneumonia (COVID-19) is still unclear. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated the urgent need to understand the neuropathology of COVID-19, to manage the current borderless viral outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and its comorbidities. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 could be regarded as an opportunistic neuropathogen that affects several vital functions in the human body.","Ibrahim Fouad, Ghadha",Bull Natl Res Cent,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-020-00478-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456304/,606
628582,Resumption of work in the building and public works sector,2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very contagious. Cases appear faster than the available Polymerase Chain Reaction test kits in many countries. Recently, lung computerized tomography (CT) has been used as an auxiliary COVID-19 testing approach. Automatic analysis of the lung CT images is needed to increase the diagnostic efficiency and release the human participant. Deep learning is successful in automatically solving computer vision problems. Thus, it can be introduced to the automatic and rapid COVID-19 CT diagnosis. Many advanced deep learning-based computer vison techniques were developed to increase the model performance but have not been introduced to medical image analysis. METHODS: In this study, we propose a self-supervised two-stage deep learning model to segment COVID-19 lesions (ground-glass opacity and consolidation) from chest CT images to support rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed deep learning model integrates several advanced computer vision techniques such as generative adversarial image inpainting, focal loss, and lookahead optimizer. Two real-life datasets were used to evaluate the model’s performance compared to the previous related works. To explore the clinical and biological mechanism of the predicted lesion segments, we extract some engineered features from the predicted lung lesions. We evaluate their mediation effects on the relationship of age with COVID-19 severity, as well as the relationship of underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity using statistic mediation analysis. RESULTS: The best overall F1 score is observed in the proposed self-supervised two-stage segmentation model (0.63) compared to the two related baseline models (0.55, 0.49). We also identified several CT image phenotypes that mediate the potential causal relationship between underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity as well as the potential causal relationship between age with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributes a promising COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation model and provides predicted lesion segments with potential clinical interpretability. The model could automatically segment the COVID-19 lesions from the raw CT images with higher accuracy than related works. The features of these lesions are associated with COVID-19 severity through mediating the known causal of the COVID-19 severity (age and underlying diseases).

Although progression risks have been extensively researched for numbers of diseases, other crucial indicators that reflect patients’ economic and time costs have not been systematically studied. To address the problems, we developed an automatic deep learning based Auto Triage Management (ATM) Framework capable of accurately modelling patients’ disease progression risk and health economic evaluation. Based on them, we can first discover the relationship between disease progression and medical system cost, find potential features that can more precisely aid patient triage in resource allocation, and allow treatment plan searching that has cured patients. Applying ATM in COVID-19, we built a joint model to predict patients’ risk, the total length of stay (LoS) and cost when at-admission, and remaining LoS and cost at a given hospitalized time point, with C-index 0.930 and 0.869 for risk prediction, mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.61 and 5.90 days for total LoS prediction in internal and external validation data.

Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Frontline clinicians, as well as nurse, methodologist, evidence based-medicine researcher, and staff from the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry participated by video conference to vote. Results: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS include clinical outcomes (recovery/improvement/progression/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (Pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), symptoms (clinical symptom score).

METHODS: The databases were searched for comparative randomized controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients. The mortality outcome was pooled as a risk difference (RD) with 95% CI. The virological cure, radiological improvement and adverse events were pooled as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. All outcomes were pooled using the Mantle-Hanzle method random effect model. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) test. RESULTS: Out of 82 full text assessed, seven studies were included in the analysis. The included studies had five different control interventions: supportive care (n = 4), umifenovir (arbidol) (n = 2), navaferon (recombinant anti-tumour and anti-virus protein) (n = 1), lopinavir-ritonavir + novaferon (n = 1) and lopinavir-ritonavir + interferon beta 1b + ribavirin (n = 1).

Although metformin has been recommended as a host‐directed therapy for COVID‐19, there are some opposite views. And the effect of metformin on the disease severity of COVID‐19 patients with diabetes during hospitalization remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of metformin on disease severity. We enrolled 110 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients with diabetes under either metformin or non‐metformin hypoglycemic treatment for a case‐control study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of life‐threatening complications. There were no differences between the two groups in age, gender, comorbidities, and clinical severity at admission. Blood glucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of the metformin group were higher than those of the non‐metformin group at admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. Strikingly, the percentage of cases who experienced life‐threatening complications was significantly higher in the metformin group (28.6% (16/56) versus 7.4% (4/54), P = 0.004). Antidiabetic therapy with metformin was associated with a higher risk of disease progression in COVID‐19 patients with diabetes during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 3.964, 95%CI 1.034‐15.194, P = 0.045).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate limitations in hearing and communication when using a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) system to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and to assess the benefit of a headset. METHODS: Acoustic properties of the PAPR system were measured using a head and torso simulator. Audiological tests (tone audiometry, Freiburg speech test, Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA)) were performed in normal-hearing subjects (n = 10) to assess hearing with PAPR. The audiological test setup also included simulation of conditions in which the target speaker used either a PAPR, a filtering face piece (FFP) 3 respirator, or a surgical face mask. RESULTS: Audiological measurements revealed that sound insulation by the PAPR headtop and noise, generated by the blower-assisted respiratory protection system, resulted in significantly deteriorated hearing thresholds (4.0 ± 7.2 dB hearing level (HL) vs. 49.2 ± 11.0 dB HL, p < 0.001) and speech recognition scores in quiet (100.0 ± 0.0% vs. 2.5 ± 4.2%, p < 0.001; OLSA: 20.8 ± 1.8 dB vs. 61.0 ± 3.3 dB SPL, p < 0.001) when compared to hearing without PAPR. Hearing with PAPR was significantly improved when the subjects were equipped with an in-ear headset (p < 0.001). Sound attenuation by FFP3 respirators and surgical face masks had no clinically relevant impact on speech perception.

Signs of genetic change have been recorded, but it remains unclear whether there is any impact on clinical disease. How camels came to carry the virus remains academic to the control of MERS. To date, human-to-human transmission has been inefficient, but virus surveillance, characterisation, and reporting are key to responding to any future change. MERS-CoV is not currently a pandemic threat; it is spread mainly with the aid of human habit and error.","Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v9120369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207494/,606
676668,"COVID-19 : dépister plus, dépister mieux",2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND: As a complement to the clinical development of new anticancer molecules, innovations in therapeutic vectorization aim at solving issues related to tumor specificity and associated toxicities. Nanomedicine is a rapidly evolving field that offers various solutions to increase clinical efficacy and safety. MAIN: Here are presented the recent advances for different types of nanovectors of chemical and biological nature, to identify the best suited for translational research projects. These nanovectors include different types of chemically engineered nanoparticles that now come in many different flavors of ‘smart’ drug delivery systems. Alternatives with enhanced biocompatibility and a better adaptability to new types of therapeutic molecules are the cell-derived extracellular vesicles and micro-organism-derived oncolytic viruses, virus-like particles and bacterial minicells. In the first part of the review, we describe their main physical, chemical and biological properties and their potential for personalized modifications. The second part focuses on presenting the recent literature on the use of the different families of nanovectors to deliver anticancer molecules for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, nucleic acid-based therapy, modulation of the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review will help the readers to better appreciate the complexity of available nanovectors and to identify the most fitting “type” for efficient and specific delivery of diverse anticancer therapies.","Briolay, Tina; Petithomme, Tacien; Fouet, Morgane; Nguyen-Pham, Nelly; Blanquart, Christophe; Boisgerault, Nicolas",Mol Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-021-01346-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761944/,606
677359,COVID-19 et activités chirurgicales,2020-05-19,"Respiratory protection provided by a particulate respirator is a function of particle penetration through filter media and through faceseal leakage. Faceseal leakage largely contributes to the penetration of particles through a respirator and compromises protection. When faceseal leaks arise, filter penetration is assumed to be negligible. The contribution of filter penetration and faceseal leakage to total inward leakage (TIL) of submicron-size bioaerosols is not well studied. To address this issue, TIL values for two N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) models and two surgical mask (SM) models sealed to a manikin were measured at 8 L and 40 L breathing minute volumes with different artificial leak sizes. TIL values for different size (20–800 nm, electrical mobility diameter) NaCl particles representing submicron-size bioaerosols were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Efficiency of filtering devices was assessed by measuring the penetration against NaCl aerosol similar to the method used for NIOSH particulate filter certification. Results showed that the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) was ~45 nm for both N95 FFR models and one of the two SM models, and ~350 nm for the other SM model at sealed condition with no leaks as well as with different leak sizes. TIL values increased with increasing leak sizes and breathing minute volumes. Relatively, higher efficiency N95 and SM models showed lower TIL values. Filter efficiency of FFRs and SMs influenced the TIL at different flow rates and leak sizes. Overall, the data indicate that good fitting higher-efficiency FFRs may offer higher protection against submicron-size bioaerosols.","Rengasamy, Samy; Eimer, Benjamin C.; Szalajda, Jonathan",Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4589201?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275016/; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2013.866715,606
678141,Maladies émergentes: médecins et vétérinaires en première ligne pour une seule santé,2020-09-17,"Research, collaboration and knowledge exchange are critical to global efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Different healthcare economies are faced with different challenges in implementing effective strategies to address AMR. Building effective capacity for research to inform AMR related strategies and policies AMR is recognised as an important contributor to success. Interdisciplinary, inter-sector, as well as inter-country collaboration is needed to span AMR efforts from the global to local. Developing reciprocal, long-term, partnerships between collaborators in high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) needs to be built on principles of capacity building. Using case-studies spanning local to international research collaborations to co-design, implement and evaluate strategies to tackle AMR, we evaluate and build upon the ESSENCE criteria for capacity building in LMICs. The first case-study describes the local co-design and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in the state of Kerala in India. The second case-study describes an international research collaboration investigating AMR across surgical pathways in India, UK and South Africa. We describe the steps undertaken to develop robust, agile, and flexible antimicrobial stewardship research and implementation teams. Notably, investing in capacity building ensured that the programmes described in these case-studies were sustained through the current severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus pandemic. Describing the strategies adopted by a local and an international collaboration to tackle AMR, we provide a model for capacity building in LMICs that can support sustainable and agile antimicrobial stewardship programmes.","Veepanattu, P.; Singh, S.; Mendelson, M.; Nampoothiri, V.; Edathadatil, F.; Surendran, S.; Bonaconsa, C.; Mbamalu, O.; Ahuja, S.; Birgand, G.; Tarrant, C.; Sevdalis, N.; Castro-Sánchez, E.; Ahmad, R.; Holmes, A.; Charani, E.",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.057; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030686X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860949/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030686X,606
680579,Ne pas attendre une deuxième vague,2020-10-16,"The highly infectious and pathogenic novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, has emerged causing a global pandemic. Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, evidence indicates a multisystem disease which is frequently severe and often results in death. Long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are unknown, but evidence from previous CoV outbreaks demonstrates impaired pulmonary and physical function, reduced quality of life and emotional distress. Many COVID-19 survivors who require critical care may develop psychological, physical and cognitive impairments. There is a clear need for guidance on the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors. This consensus statement was developed by an expert panel in the fields of rehabilitation, sport and exercise medicine (SEM), rheumatology, psychiatry, general practice, psychology and specialist pain, working at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Stanford Hall, UK. Seven teams appraised evidence for the following domains relating to COVID-19 rehabilitation requirements: pulmonary, cardiac, SEM, psychological, musculoskeletal, neurorehabilitation and general medical. A chair combined recommendations generated within teams. A writing committee prepared the consensus statement in accordance with the appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation criteria, grading all recommendations with levels of evidence. Authors scored their level of agreement with each recommendation on a scale of 0–10. Substantial agreement (range 7.5–10) was reached for 36 recommendations following a chaired agreement meeting that was attended by all authors. This consensus statement provides an overarching framework assimilating evidence and likely requirements of multidisciplinary rehabilitation post COVID-19 illness, for a target population of active individuals, including military personnel and athletes.","Barker-Davies, Robert M; O'Sullivan, Oliver; Senaratne, Kahawalage Pumi Prathima; Baker, Polly; Cranley, Mark; Dharm-Datta, Shreshth; Ellis, Henrietta; Goodall, Duncan; Gough, Michael; Lewis, Sarah; Norman, Jonathan; Papadopoulou, Theodora; Roscoe, David; Sherwood, Daniel; Turner, Philippa; Walker, Tammy; Mistlin, Alan; Phillip, Rhodri; Nicol, Alastair M; Bennett, Alexander N; Bahadur, Sardar",Br J Sports Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-102596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475821/,606
680713,COVID-19: Let's not forget Africa!,2020-05-23,"In December 2019, a new type of pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and has been discovered in many countries around the world. ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of SARS-Cov-2 into human cells. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicated that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD) domain and ACE2 of RPTEC/SerC cell-binding assays confirmed that SARS-Cov-2 can bind to ACE2 on the surface of these cells. Our results suggest that ACE2 expression could contribute to kidney and testis infection after COVID-19 infection. Renal function evaluation and special care should be performed during clinical work. Clinicians should also pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.","Fan, Caibin; Lu, Wei; Li, Kai; Ding, Yanhong; Wang, Jianqing",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521006/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.563893,606
