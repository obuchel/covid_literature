73871,"Comments on: ""Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy"".",2021-02-08,"OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to obtain an updated overview of regression, persistence, and progression rates of conservatively managed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1)/CIN 2/CIN 3. METHODS Data sources were MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane (January 1, 1973-April 14, 2020). Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. To estimate outcome rates, we pooled proportions of the individual study results using random-effects meta-analysis, resulting in point estimates and corresponding 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was quantified by the I2 and τ2 measures. RESULTS Eighty-nine studies were included, 63 studies on CIN 1 (n = 6,080-8,767), 42 on CIN 2 (n = 2,909-3,830), and 7 on CIN 3 (n = 245-351). The overall regression, persistence, and progression to CIN 2 or worse and CIN 3 or worse rates for women with conservatively managed CIN 1 were 60% (95% CI = 55-65, I2 = 92%), 25% (95% CI = 20-30, I2 = 94%), 11% (95% CI = 8-13, I2 = 89%), and 2% (95% CI = 1-3, I2 = 82%), respectively. The overall regression, persistence, and progression rates for CIN 2 were 55% (95% CI = 50-60, I2 = 85%), 23% (95% CI = 19-28, I2 = 83%), and 19% (95% CI = 15-23, I2 = 88%), respectively. Finally, for CIN 3, these were 28% (95% CI = 17-41, I2 = 68%), 67% (95% CI = 36-91, I2 = 84%), and 2% (95% CI = 0-25, I2 = 95%), respectively. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 regression was significantly higher in women 30 years or younger and high-risk human papillomavirus-negative women (66%, 95% CI = 62-70, I2 = 76%; 94%, 95% CI = 84-99, I2 = 60%). Only 2/7,180 (0.03%) and 10/3,037 (0.3%) of the CIN 1 and CIN 2 cases progressed to cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS Most CIN 1/CIN 2 will regress spontaneously in less than 24 months, with the highest rates in high-risk human papillomavirus-negative and young women, whereas progression to cancer is less than 0.5%. Conservative management should be considered, especially in fertile women and with expected high compliance. Given the heterogeneity in regression rates of high-grade histology, this should be classified as CIN 2 or CIN 3 to guide management.","Loopik, Diede L; Bentley, Heidi A; Eijgenraam, Maria N; IntHout, Joanna; Bekkers, Ruud L M; Bentley, James R",Journal of lower genital tract disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/lgt.0000000000000604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176914/,892
85537,Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.,2021-03-12,"UNLABELLED Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) is a gammaherpesvirus of rhesus macaque (RM) monkeys that is closely related to human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)/Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and it is capable of inducing diseases in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected RM that are similar to those seen in humans coinfected with HIV and HHV-8. Both HHV-8 and RRV encode viral CD200 (vCD200) molecules that are homologues of cellular CD200, a membrane glycoprotein that regulates immune responses and helps maintain immune homeostasis via interactions with the CD200 receptor (CD200R). Though the functions of RRV and HHV-8 vCD200 molecules have been examined in vitro, the precise roles that these viral proteins play during in vivo infection remain unknown. Thus, to address the contributions of RRV vCD200 to immune regulation and disease in vivo, we generated a form of RRV that lacked expression of vCD200 for use in infection studies in RM. Our data indicated that RRV vCD200 expression limits immune responses against RRV at early times postinfection and also impacts viral loads, but it does not appear to have significant effects on disease development. Further, examination of the distribution pattern of CD200R in RM indicated that this receptor is expressed on a majority of cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including B and T cells, suggesting potentially wider regulatory capabilities for both vCD200 and CD200 that are not strictly limited to myeloid lineage cells. In addition, we also demonstrate that RRV infection affects CD200R expression levels in vivo, although vCD200 expression does not play a role in this phenomenon. IMPORTANCE Cellular CD200 and its receptor, CD200R, compose a pathway that is important in regulating immune responses and is known to play a role in a variety of human diseases. A number of pathogens have been found to modulate the CD200-CD200R pathway during infection, including human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell neoplasms in AIDS patients, and a closely related primate virus, rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV), which infects and induces disease in rhesus macaque monkeys. HHV-8 and RRV encode homologues of CD200, termed vCD200, which are thought to play a role in preventing immune responses against these viruses. However, neither molecule has been studied in an in vivo model of infection to address their actual contributions to immunoregulation and disease. Here we report findings from our studies in which we analyzed the properties of a mutant form of RRV that lacks vCD200 expression in infected rhesus macaques.","Estep, Ryan D; Rawlings, Stephanie D; Li, Helen; Manoharan, Minsha; Blaine, Elizabeth T; O'Connor, Megan A; Messaoudi, Ilhem; Axthelm, Michael K; Wong, Scott W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01276-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991004/,892

Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritised or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines1 , is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarises evidence for the role of subcutaneous (SC) insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

131783,Scalable and robust SARS-CoV-2 testing in an academic center.,2020-06-18,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to develop a more flexible system of laparoscopic surgery training with demonstrated effectiveness and construct validity. HYPOTHESES A personal, portable, durable laparoscopic trainer can be designed at low cost. The evaluation of expert surgeons on this device will reveal technical superiority over novices. With practice, novice surgeons can improve their performance significantly as measured by scores derived from performing skills with this training device. DESIGN Prospective trial with observation and intervention components. The first aspect was observational comparison of novice and expert performance. The second was a prospective static-group comparison with pretest/posttest single-sample design. SETTING Tertiary-care academic medical center with affiliated general surgery residency. PARTICIPANTS A total of 21 junior surgical residents and 5 experienced operators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Performance was assessed by the 5 tasks in the McGill Inanimate System for Training and Evaluation of Laparoscopic Skills (MISTELS): pegboard transfer, pattern cutting, placement of ligating loop, extracorporeal knotting, and intracorporeal knotting. Each task was assessed for accuracy and speed. RESULTS Expert surgeons scored significantly higher than novices on total score and 4 of the 5 MISTELS tasks (peg transfer, pattern cut, extracorporeal knot, and intracorporeal knot). After 4 months of home-based training, the novices improved in total score and 3 of the 5 tasks (peg transfer, pattern cut, and extracorporeal knot). CONCLUSIONS A low-cost personal laparoscopic training device can be built by individual residents. With their use, residents can significantly improve performance in important surgical skills. Evaluation of the system supports its validity.","Kobayashi, Sow Alfred; Jamshidi, Ramin; O'Sullivan, Patricia; Palmer, Barnard; Hirose, Shinjiro; Stewart, Lygia; Kim, Edward Hyung",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2010.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338965/,892

However, due to the nature of contact tracing, public concern on privacy issues has been a bottleneck to the existing solutions, which is significantly affecting the uptake of contact tracing applications across the globe. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt blockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize the user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract tracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the additional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible. Results show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and mobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public, the proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities, companies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy effective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic soon. Meanwhile, the open initiative of BeepTrace allows worldwide collaborations, integrate existing tracing and positioning solutions with the help of blockchain technology.","Xu, Hao; Zhang, Lei; Onireti, Oluwakayode; Fang, Yang; Buchanan, William Bill; Imran, Muhammad Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10103v2.pdf,892

However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins. We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus-Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.

Children and their families came from four different countries- – mainland China, Hong Kong, Israel, Spain, and the U.S. Of interest in all but one of the studies, was the nature of young children’s home learning environment, parents’ engagement with their children’s learning, and factors that improved what occurred at home. Parents’ stress levels and limited access to technology were negative predictors of children’s engagement in home learning activities. Parents’ education and income and teacher support were positive predictors as was children’s ease of use of technology. Parents also reported that they did not receive sufficient training to engage in virtual instruction and did not have sufficient time to do so. Other concerns were raised about whether virtual learning was appropriate for young children given their limited attention spans and the need for a better means of fostering social/emotional development. The special section concludes with an article demonstrating a successful means of virtual instruction the summer before children began formal schooling.","Sonnenschein, Susan Stites Michele L.",Early Education and Development,https://doi.org/10.1080/10409289.2021.1953311,892
167413,Rapid spread of a SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a frameshift deletion in ORF7a,2021-08-21,"BACKGROUND: The first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019 and soon spread to all corners of the world in early 2020. As the number of case increases, healthcare workers who come into contact with COVID-19 patients are to provide care under unprecedented physical and psychological pressure. Several studies have shown that such gravity lead healthcare workers to experience depression, anxiety and stress disorders. METHODS: Data collection was carried out on July 13–July 31, 2020, when participants – resident doctors at the Faculty of Medicine, Andalas University, Indonesia – could download and complete the online questionnaire uploaded on the Google form application. It reveals demographic characteristics and assessing the level of depression, anxiety and stress using the “Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-42.” RESULTS: Out of 494 residents in total who are in training and based in Dr. M. Djamil Hospital Padang, Indonesia, 448 residents (90.7%) agreed to participate in this research. In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, majority of the residents – 355 people (79.2%) from 12 branches of specialization – were assigned to man the emergency unit. The analysis of the collected data shows that 57 residents suffer from mild-moderate depression (12.7%) and 19 residents (4.2%) struggle with severe-very severe depression. The other 58 residents (12.9%) experience mild-moderate anxiety while 12 residents (2.7%) labor under severe-very severe anxiety. Mild-moderate stress affects 89 residents (19.9%) and severe-very severe stress impact 20 residents (4.5%). CONCLUSION: This study finds that residents experience mild-moderate depression, anxiety and stress as well as severe-very severe due to working in a pandemic situation.","Yaunin, Y.; Liza, R.

Accurately predicting an individual’s LOS can have a significant impact on a healthcare provider’s ability to care for individuals by allowing them to properly prepare and manage resources. A hospital’s productivity requires a delicate balance of maintaining enough staffing and resources without being overly equipped or wasteful. This has become even more important in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, during which emergency departments around the globe have been inundated with patients and are struggling to manage their resources. In this study, the authors focus on the prediction of LOS at the time of admission in emergency departments at Rhode Island hospitals through discharge data obtained from the Rhode Island Department of Health over the time period of 2012 and 2013.

Transformational change is required to avoid further catastrophes caused by the three environmental crises that human actions have caused: climate crisis;nature crisis;and pollution and waste crisis. Evaluation can contribute to finding durable solutions based on sound science and experiences from the field, but to do so evaluation must broaden its vision. Theory-based approaches will remain central, but they must be open to the full human and natural systems in which the intervention that is the evaluand operates. Evaluations must also pay attention to unintended consequences of all interventions to the environment, to social and power relations, to women, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools and community organizations were able to serve meals through federal summer meals programs (SMP) to reach kids in need who were not in school. It is important to understand how access to these programs may have been impacted across sociodemographic characteristics to prevent exacerbation of health disparities in future public health emergencies. To examine the geospatial characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic SMP distribution sites in North Carolina. Cross-sectional study of COVID-19 SMP distribution sites (n = 2,567) in North Carolina during the 2019-2020 school year. GIS was used to conduct a geospatial analysis. Pandemic SMP sites were mapped and spatially joined to US Census sociodemographic data and USDA Food Desert Atlas data, including designated census tracts. SMP site service areas were created for rural (10-mile) and urban sites (3-mile), and sociodemographic data aggregated within these areas to understand reach. Summary sociodemographic and food environment characteristics of meal sites were generated, and bivariate analysis used to assess group differences. There was a school meal site in 71% (267/368) of Food Desert Census Tracts. Census Tracts with meal sites had significantly higher levels of percent poverty (18.8% vs 13.2%) (P &lt; 0.001), percent minority population (34.7% vs 25.7%) (P &lt; 0.001), and a higher number of housing units without vehicle count beyond 1 mile from supermarket (56.3% vs 36.0%) (P &lt; 0.001) compared to Census Tracts without SMP sites. In North Carolina, meal sites were generally well placed to serve those in the most need. Future work should try to understand factors determining SMP location. The use of geospatial analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and use of spatial location-allocation modeling to inform meal distribution sites should be further explored to prevent future exacerbation of health disparities.

The lack of relief commodities, especially life-saving items, is a life-threatening loss to victims and must be considered when making emergency supply allocation and transportation decisions, even in the pre-disaster prepositioning phase. This paper proposes a scenario-based stochastic program that integrates the decisions of prepositioning facility locations, quantities of stocked emergency supplies, and service allocations in each scenario in the same modeling framework. The estimation of victims’ losses for waiting for emergency supplies is measured in the typical deprivation cost function and treated as one of the main bases of decision making, besides traditional transportation costs, in determining the service allocation strategies in each scenario. Specifically, a case study with data from the hurricane threat in the Gulf Coast area of the US was conducted to demonstrate the application of this model and the significance of considering victims’ welfare loss in humanitarian relief logistics.

Most megaprojects turn out to be a burden on economy when constructions are completed. Authorities, meanwhile, continue to promote the advancement of megaprojects with overly optimistic public messages on expected socio-economic benefits. A combination of expertise in the topic, in-depth literature analysis, independent cost-benefit reassessment, and empirical survey of related documentation of three EU transport megaprojects shows political implications to be the essential causes of information asymmetries in megaproject management. Socio-economic over-estimations imply to be useful for obtaining and securing funding commitments at the political level, but then the real project value is often omitted from the assessment. This work takes a wider, strategic approach beyond the usual socio-economic reasoning. The article argues that socio-economic assessment practice is too narrow to grasp the full potential impact of a megaproject. Therefore, a strategic assessment should be performed by public authorities along with an appropriate funding mechanism.

Classic SIR models take a mean-field assumption, such that a susceptible individual has an equal chance of catching the disease from any infected individual in the population. In reality, spatial and social structure will drive most instances of disease transmission. Here we explore the impacts of including spatial structure in a simple SIR model. In particular we assume individuals live on a square lattice and that contacts can be 'local' (neighour-to-neighbour) or 'global' or a mix of the two. We combine an approximate mathematical model (using a pair approximation) and stochastic simulations to consider the impact of increasingly local interactions on the epidemic. We find that there is a strongly non-linear response, with small degrees of local interaction having little impact, but epidemics with susbtantially lower and later epidemics once interactions are predominantly local. We also show how intervention strategies to impose local interactions on a population must be introduced early if significant impacts are to be seen.","Wren, L.; Best, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20237651v1?rss=1,892

Since the onset of the pandemic, we have faced a challenge: providing medical care for HCT patients while preventing environmental exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our HCT team started performing telehealth care using a HIPAA-compliant Google Meet-based institutional platform and telephone calls in March/2020. To evaluate this strategy as a permanent tool, we sent out a survey to patients in order to better understand their opinion on and early experience with telehealth. Methods: We sent out a questionnaire on Google Forms containing a few questions regarding barriers to commute to hospital, internet access, feelings about the use of telehealth at our outpatient clinic and their incipient experience with it. Participants were instructed to answer the questions from the patient's perspective, regardless if the survey was filled out by the patients themselves or caregivers. The questionnaire was anonymous, written in Portuguese, and remained open from August 3rd to 9th, 2020.

During this period, all patients provided a contact number that could reached through Whatsapp, either on their own or a caregiver's smartphone. Of these, 133 patients answered the survey. The total time to go to and come back from hospital was <30 min for 5%, 30-60 min for 23%, 60-90 min for 20%, 90-120 min for 14% and >120 min for 38%. Total cost to commute to and from hospital (for both the patient and an eventual caregiver) was > US$ 10.00 for 42% (equivalent to 5% of the minimum wage per month). Thirty-two percent of participants reported any degree of mobility disability. Thirty-three and 29% of patients complained of long waiting times for in-person doctor and pharmacy appointments, respectively. In terms of technology, 97% had a personal cell phone or smartphone. Ninety-five percent of patients had access to internet on a smartphone, and 32% through a personal computer (some had both). Sixty-six percent reported no difficulty using a cell phone, 23% some difficulty and 9% significant difficulty. Ninety-five percent regularly used social media apps. Approximately half of the patients had at least one previous interaction via telehealth with our center during the COVID-19 pandemic, of whom 92% considered it a good or very good experience. When inquired if they would like to start receiving or continue to receive telehealth care, 83% answered yes, 10% expressed some interest and 7% declared no interest. When asked about their opinion on widening telehealth use at the HCFMUSP HCT Outpatient Clinic following the pandemic, 43% answered they would certainly use it, 45% thought it could be good, 5% had concerns, 4% were indifferent, and 3% did not approve the idea. Conclusions: In-person appointments seem to be both cost and time-consuming and represent a relevant burden on this limited-resource population. Despite being a public health institution from a middle-income country, most of our patients have personal cell phones with easy internet access. Among those who had an incipient experience with telehealth, the impression was overall positive. We cannot rule out selection bias towards participants who were more familiar with technology and thus more inclined to appreciate telehealth. Taken together, although not always fit for all clinical scenarios, our findings suggest telehealth may be efficient and complementary to in-person interactions with HCT patients, and prompt wider implementation of this health care modality. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts f interest to declare.","Cordeiro, A.; Fatobene, G.; Mariano, L. C. B.; Musqueira, P.; Rego, E. M.; Rocha, V.",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-143288,892

Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a global search for the discovery of antiviral candidates capable of treating the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, none of them has shown proved efficacy and low toxicity for an effective dose. In view of this, research with plants based in natural products has been highlighted by the low toxicity of its metabolites and reduced side effects, since plants have been used for millennia in the treatment of various diseases. In this review, we highlight some plant species and plant metabolites belonging to the structural class of phenolic, alkaloids and terpenes with promising antiviral potential against coronavirus that could be explored as potential candidates for drug prototypes in the treatment of COVID-19.","Lima, N.

Although Nigeria adopted lockdown measures, no defined strategies were used in setting the distance threshold for these lockdowns. Hence, understanding the drivers of COVID-19 is pivotal to an informed decision for containment measures in the absence of vaccines. Spatial and temporal analyses are crucial drivers to apprehending the pattern of diseases over space and time. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the significance of distance to the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using the Geographic Information System. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to analyze datasets of each month in ArcGIS. March, April, May, and June exhibited patterns with no significant peaks, while July and August exhibited patterns with two statistically significant peaks. The first and second peaks of July were 301,338.39 and 365,947.83 meters, respectively, while August was 301,338.39 and 336,128.09 meters, respectively. Therefore, a significant difference in the clustering of COVID-19 over distances between July and August was established. This indicated that progression in the spread of the virus increased the virus's spatial coverage while the distance of risk of exposure decreased. This study's findings could be utilized to establish maximum movement restriction areas to contain the spread of COVID-19.

HIV-associated TB is often the result of recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) followed by rapid progression to disease. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first cells of the innate immune system that engage Mtb, but how HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) impact on the anti-mycobacterial response of AM is not known. To investigate the impact of HIV and ART on the transcriptomic and epigenetic response of AM to Mtb, we obtained AM by bronchoalveolar lavage from 20 PLWH receiving ART, 16 control subjects who were HIV-free (HC), and 14 subjects who received ART as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. Following in-vitro challenge with Mtb, AM from each group displayed overlapping but distinct profiles of significantly up- and down-regulated genes in response to Mtb. Compared to HC subjects, AM isolated from PLWH and PrEP subjects presented a substantially weaker transcriptional response. Further investigation of chromatin structure revealed that AM from control subjects challenged with Mtb responded with pronounced accessibility changes in over ten thousand regions. In stark contrast, AM obtained from PLWH and PrEP subjects displayed no significant changes in their chromatin state in response to Mtb. Collectively, these results revealed a previously unknown adverse effect of ART on the epigenetic landscape and transcriptional responsiveness of AM.","Correa-Macedo, W.; Fava, V.

Objective: We assessed vaccine response in a national sample of maintenance dialysis patients and identified predictors of response. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: 130 Dialysis Clinic, Inc (DCI) facilities Participants: Maintenance dialysis patients without known prior COVID-19 or a positive baseline antibody titer Exposure(s): Vaccine type and clinical characteristics Main Outcome(s): Using a semi-quantitative assay for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, vaccine response was defined as at least one titer [≥]1 U/L between 14 and 74 days after completion of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. Regression analysis was used to identify characteristics associated with response. Results: Among 1528 patients, 437 received BNT162b2/Pfizer vaccine, 766 received mRNA-1273/Moderna, and 325 received Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen. Serologic response differed significantly by vaccine type: 381/437 (87%) among BNT162b2/Pfizer recipients, 736/766 (96%) among mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients, and 119/325 (37%) among Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen recipients. Vaccine type, older age, immune-modulating medication, history of transplantation, and lower serum albumin were associated with vaccine non-response. Conclusions and Relevance: Serologic response to mRNA vaccines is robust among maintenance dialysis patients.

192835,[Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus by Reverse-transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification].,2015,"BACKGROUND The Lancet recently sponsored a commission examining the role of surgery in global health. There is a paucity of published information on the cost-effectiveness of surgery in low- and middle-income countries, a key metric in the prioritisation of limited resources. METHODS All patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, elective and emergency inguinal hernia repair, elective and emergency caesarean section, amputation, fracture manipulation, or fracture fixation over a 3 months period in a single district African hospital were assessed. World Health Organisation global burden of disease (GBD) methodology was used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved for each patient (using global and local life expectancy). Fully loaded costs were calculated for each patient’s care and providing the overall surgical service. Cost-effectiveness was calculated in year 2012 US$ per DALY saved for each procedure and overall. RESULTS A total of 428 patients were included, with an overall cost-effectiveness of $10.70 per DALY averted. The cost-effectiveness of individual procedures (global life expectancy) was: Amputation—$17.66; Emergency caesarean section—$7.42; Elective caesarean section—$20.50; Emergency laparotomy—$8.62; Elective hernia repair—$15.26; Emergency hernia repair—$4.36; Fracture/dislocation reduction—$69.03; Fracture/dislocation fixation—$225.89. CONCLUSIONS Surgery is a highly cost-effective healthcare measure in the setting of an African district hospital. The presented outcomes demonstrate that surgery is on a par with better-recognised and funded interventions such as HIV anti-retrovirals, malaria prevention and diarrhoea treatment. There are recognised limitations with the GBD methodology used here; however, this remains the best way to investigate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions. This study provides useful information on an, at present, under-studied field.","Roberts, Geoffrey; Roberts, Charlotte; Jamieson, Amy; Grimes, Caris; Conn, Gemma; Bleichrodt, Robert",World journal of surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26470700/,892

207747,Rapid vaccination and partial lockdown minimizes 4th waves from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly identified ß-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a dire health problem, causing a massive crisis for global health. Primary method of transmission was firstly thought to be animal to human transmission. However, it has been observed that the virus is transmitted from human to human via respiratory droplets. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from patient stools, suggesting a possible gastrointestinal (GI) involvement. Most commonly reported clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Interestingly, a small percentage of patients experience GI symptoms with the most common being anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The presence of viral RNA in stools is also common and fecal tests can be positive even after negative respiratory samples. The exact incidence of digestive symptoms is a matter of debate. The distribution of Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptors in multiple organs in the body provides a possible explanation for the digestive symptoms' mechanism. Cases with solely GI symptoms have been reported in both adults and children. Viral RNA has also been detected in stool and blood samples, indicating the possibility of liver damage, which has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The presence of chronic liver disease appears to be a risk factor for severe complications and a poorer prognosis, however data from these cases is lacking. The aim of this review is firstly, to briefly update what is known about the origin and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but mainly to focus on the manifestations of the GI tract and their pathophysiological background, so that physicians on the one hand, not to underestimate or disregard digestive symptoms due to the small number of patients exhibiting exclusively this symptomatology and on the other, to have SARS-CoV-2 on their mind when the ""gastroenteritis"" type symptoms predominate.","Galanopoulos, Michail; Gkeros, Filippos; Doukatas, Aris; Karianakis, Grigorios; Pontas, Christos; Tsoukalas, Nikolaos; Viazis, Nikos; Liatsos, Christos; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J",World J Gastroenterol,,892

Several US states have made strong commitments to this effort through legislation and dedicated funds. However, it is not known if these efforts have resulted in population-level increments in HPV awareness overtime. Using the Health Information National Trends Survey data, we examined the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine in the US, between 2008 and 2018. Prevalence estimates and confidence intervals were calculated for HPV and HPV vaccine awareness. Further, we assessed awareness after stratifying by key sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined over time. The lowest awareness was among racial minorities, rural residents, male respondents, those aged 65 years and older, as well as those with the lowest educational and socioeconomic standing. Between 2013 and 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined by almost 10% among males, those with a high school level of education or lower, and those who earned less than USD 35,000 per annum. In 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine was highest among non-Hispanic whites (65.8% and 66.5%) and female adults (70.5% and 71.4%); however, these figures represented declines of about 5% from rates observed in 2008. Amidst a background of sub-optimal HPV vaccination uptake and a growing incidence of HPV-associated cancers in the US, HPV-related awareness within the general US population has declined over time. This calls for stricter enforcement of legislation aimed at boosting HPV awareness, as well as frequent evaluation of government-funded HPV awareness programs.","Chido-Amajuoyi, Onyema Greg; Jackson, Inimfon; Yu, Robert; Shete, Sanjay",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,892

DICs are usually staffed by pharmacists and/or clinical pharmacists/pharmacologists. DICs are a reliable source of current and unbiased information on COVID-19 and its associated complications, including management options for healthcare professionals and the public. In addition to health and drug information, pharmacists working in the DICs can be involved in the management of the patients' health by providing information on home care and safety, medication management of patients with chronic comorbid illnesses, and psychological advice.

About half of people who develop DFD experience a recurrence within one year. Long-term medical management to reduce the risk of recurrence is therefore important to reduce the global DFD burden. This review describes research assessing the value of sensors, wearables and telehealth in preventing DFD. Sensors and wearables have been developed to monitor foot temperature, plantar pressures, glucose, blood pressure and lipids. The monitoring of these risk factors along with telehealth consultations has promise as a method for remotely managing people who are at risk of DFD. This approach can potentially avoid or reduce the need for face-to-face consultations. Home foot temperature monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring and telehealth consultations are the approaches for which the most highly developed and user-friendly technology has been developed. A number of clinical studies in people at risk of DFD have demonstrated benefits when using one of these remote monitoring methods. Further development and evidence are needed for some of the other approaches, such as home plantar pressure and footwear adherence monitoring. As yet, no composite remote management program incorporating remote monitoring and the management of all the key risk factors for DFD has been developed and implemented. Further research assessing the feasibility and value of combining these remote monitoring approaches as a holistic way of preventing DFD is needed.","Golledge, Jonathan; Fernando, Malindu; Lazzarini, Peter; Najafi, Bijan; G Armstrong, David",,,892

232277,EXPRESSION OF CONCERN: Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy,2021,"Patients with cardiovascular disease and, namely, heart failure are more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have a more severe clinical course once infected. Heart failure and myocardial damage, shown by increased troponin plasma levels, occur in at least 10% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with higher percentages, 25% to 35% or more, when patients critically ill or with concomitant cardiac disease are considered. Myocardial injury may be elicited by multiple mechanisms, including those occurring with all severe infections, such as fever, tachycardia, adrenergic stimulation, as well as those caused by an exaggerated inflammatory response, endotheliitis and, in some cases, myocarditis that have been shown in patients with COVID-19. A key role may be that of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, which has vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effects. Virus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 may increase angiotensin II stimulation and contribute to the deleterious hyper-inflammatory reaction of COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2 may be up-regulated in patients with cardiac disease and treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE2 up-regulation may increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 but may be also protective vs. angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and inflammatory activation. Recent data show the lack of untoward effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for COVID-19 infection and severity. Prospective trials are needed to ascertain whether these drugs may have protective effects.","Tomasoni, Daniela; Italia, Leonardo; Adamo, Marianna; Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lombardi, Carlo M; Solomon, Scott D; Metra, Marco",Eur J Heart Fail,,892

Many countries have imposed traveling restrictions to reduce people’s movement in order to avoid infection transmission. Traveling restrictions have jeopardized the tourism industry around the globe. If the situation persists, it will become challenging for the nations to open tourism. For this reason, the digitalization of tourism is a viable solution for this situation. However, it is essential to map whether digital technologies can provide alternative solutions to the situation and whether digital tourism can replace conventional tourism? With that backdrop, this study has two objectives: (a) to find the future of digital tourism development beyond the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and (b) to find collaborative research work among nations to develop digital tourism after the current pandemic crisis. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a systematic literature review of past research on the development of digital tourism from 2016–2020. The study applies the PRISMA-2015 statement to select and synthesize 60 articles from Scopus and ‘Web of Science’ databases. Content analysis was performed to analyze the underlying clusters of research on digital tourism and, later, bibliometric analysis was conducted to examine collaborative research between different countries. The findings highlighted three major research clusters namely;virtual reality tourism, virtual tourism, and augmented reality. In addition, the research finding shows that virtual tourism is a practical and valuable option for mass tourism during the COVID-19 outbreak and can replace mass tourism after the pandemic. Although virtual tourism does not feel like a visit to a natural destination, it is still getting attention from tourists. Virtual spaces must develop more features and value additions to achieve tourist satisfaction in the future.","Akhtar, Nadeem Khan Nohman Mahroof Khan Muhammad Ashraf Shagufta Hashmi Muhammad Saim Khan Muhammad Muddassar Hishan Sanil S.",Sustainability,,892

This study used in-depth interviews to assess the impact of the restricted regime. Design/methodology/approach: This was a cross-sectional qualitative study using an adapted regional survey to record people’s experiences of COVID-19 isolation on entry into prison. This study began in April 2020 and continued to run over eight months. A weekly capture of people’s stories was conducted using a convenience sample. A total of 168 people participated in the study, with in-depth interviews conducted by the health-care team. Content conceptual analysis was used to quantify and analyse the themes of impact of COVID-19 isolation. This information was then used to shape iterative health-care service development. Findings: A number of key themes have emerged from the experiences of COVID-19 isolation, including connection, communication and support. Stories highlighted how isolation had exacerbated depression, anxiety or feelings of self-harm. This was amplified by the uncertainty of the pandemic and lack of information about accessing services in the altered prison regime. A priority for people in COVID-19 isolation was contact with family. Telephone calls and virtual visits were cited as mitigating the mental health impact of social isolation. People who felt supported by health-care or prison staff reported coping with their time in isolation better. Timely, accessible information was pivotal in support, leading to development of Engagement Lead check-ins on the isolation landings. It is crucial that a public health approach is core to the COVID-19 response in prisons. The thematic analysis of the experiences has enabled a focused understanding of the impact of COVID-19 isolation and an accountability of care provision through organisational collaboration and iterative improvements to service delivery.

The assay has two components: fluorescent polystyrene particles covalently coated with RBD, termed virion-particles (v-particles), and fluorescently-labeled hACE2 (hACE2F) that binds the v-particles. When incubated with an inhibitor, v-particle - hACE2F binding is diminished, resulting in a reduction in the fluorescent signal of bound hACE2F relative to the non-inhibitor control, which can be measured via flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. We determine the amount of RBD needed for v-particle preparation, v-particle incubation time with hACE2F, hACE2F detection limit, and specificity of v-particle binding to hACE2F. We measure the dose response of the v-particles to a known inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that RNA-hACE2F granules trap v-particles effectively, providing a basis for potential RNA-hACE2F therapeutics.","Kikuchi, Nanami; Willinger, Or; Granik, Naor; Navon, Noa; Ackerman, Shanny; Samuel, Ella; Antman, Tomer; Katz, Noa; Goldberg, Sarah; Amit, Roee",,,892

Since then, the search for a vaccine or drug for COVID-19 treatment has started worldwide. In this regard, a fast approach is the repurposing of drugs, primarily antiviral drugs. Herein, we performed a virtual screening using 22 antiviral drugs retrieved from the DrugBank repository, azithromycin (antibiotic), ivermectin (antinematode), and seven non-structural proteins (Nsps) of SARS-CoV-2, which are considered important targets for drugs, via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Drug-receptor binding energy was employed as the main descriptor. Based on the results, paritaprevir was predicted as a promising multi-target drug that favorably bound to all tested Nsps, mainly adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) (-36.2 kcal mol-1) and coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro) (-32.2 kcal mol-1). Moreover, the results suggest that simeprevir is a strong inhibitor of Mpro (-37.2 kcal mol-1), which is an interesting finding because Mpro plays an important role in viral replication. In addition to drug-receptor affinity, hot spot residues were characterized to facilitate the design of new drug derivatives with improved biological responses.","Nunes, Vinicius S; Paschoal, Diego F S; Costa, Luiz Antônio S; Santos, Hélio F Dos",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,892

BIT extract showed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging between 0.48 and 1.95 mug/ml with Bacillus subtilis was the most susceptible to the BIT effect. It showed a notable antimycobacterial and anti-Helicobacter pylori activity with MIC values of 100 and 80 mug/ml, respectively. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was more sensitive to the antiviral activity of BIT comparable to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), showing 48.38 and 41.85% inhibition of the viral replication at a dose of 50 mug/ml for VSV and HSV-1, respectively. In silico molecular docking of the isolated compounds revealed that caffeic acid 2) showed the highest fitting within the active sites of DNA-gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and SARS-CoV-2 M&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt;.

287131,Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,2021,"Isatin (1H-indole-2,3-dione)-containing compounds have been shown to possess several remarkable biological activities. We had previously explored a few isatin-based imidazole derivatives for their predicted dual activity against both inflammation and cancer. We explored 47 different isatin-based derivatives (IBDs) for other potential biological activities using in silico tools and found them to possess anti-viral activity. Using AutoDock tools, the binding site, binding energy, inhibitory constant/K i and receptor-ligand interactions for each of the compounds were analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The partition coefficient (logP) values were predicted using MedChem Designer tool. Based on the best K i, binding energy and the ideal range of logP (between 1.0 and 3.0), 10 out of total 47 compounds were deemed to be prospective RdRp inhibitors. Some of these compounds gave better K i, binding energy and logP values when compared to standard RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (REM) (K i = 15.61 µM, logP = 2.2; binding energy = -6.95), a clinically approved RdRp inhibitor and nine other RdRp inhibitors. The results showed that the 10 selected IBDs could be further explored. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) showed that the selected RdRp-IBD complexes were highly stable compared to the native RdRp and RdRp-REM complex during 100 ns time periods. DFT studies were performed for the compounds 16a, 24a, 28a, 38a and 40a, to evaluate the charge transfer mechanism for the interactions between the IBDs and the RdRp residues. Among these, ADME profiling revealed that 28a is a possible lead compound which can be explored further for anti-RdRp activity in vitro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

292680,SARS-CoV-2 safety: Guidelines for shielding frontline nurses,2021,"During malignant transformation and cancer progression, tumor cells face both intrinsic and extrinsic stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in particular. To survive and proliferate, tumor cells use multiple stress response pathways to mitigate ER stress, promoting disease aggression and treatment resistance. Among the stress response pathways is ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which consists of multiple components and steps working together to ensure protein quality and quantity. In addition to its established role in stress responses and tumor cell survival, ERAD has recently been shown to regulate tumor immunity. Here we summarize current knowledge on how ERAD promotes protein degradation, regulates immune cell development and function, participates in antigen presentation, exerts paradoxical roles on tumorigenesis and immunity, and thus impacts current cancer therapy. Collectively, ERAD is a critical protein homeostasis pathway intertwined with cancer development and tumor immunity. Of particular importance is the need to further unveil ERAD's enigmatic roles in tumor immunity to develop effective targeted and combination therapy for successful treatment of cancer.","Qin, Xiaodan; Denton, William D; Huiting, Leah N; Smith, Kaylee S; Feng, Hui",Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,,892

This article describes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Rapid Naloxone Initiative, which aims to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans through (1) opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to VHA patients at risk for opioid overdose, (2) VA Police naloxone, and (3) select automated external defibrillator (AED) cabinet naloxone. METHODS: VHA has taken a multifaceted, theory-based approach to ensuring the rapid availability of naloxone to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Strategies targeted at multiple levels (for example, patient, provider, health care system) have enabled synergies to speed diffusion of this lifesaving practice. RESULTS: As of April 2021, 285,279 VHA patients had received naloxone from 31,730 unique prescribers, with 1,880 reported opioid overdose reversals with naloxone; 129 VHA facilities had equipped 3,552 VA Police officers with naloxone, with 136 reported opioid overdose reversals with VA Police naloxone; and 77 VHA facilities had equipped 1,095 AED cabinets with naloxone, with 10 reported opioid overdose reversals with AED cabinet naloxone. Remarkably, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on naloxone dispensing to VHA patients. CONCLUSION: The VHA Rapid Naloxone Initiative saves lives.

We investigated anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin (IgT) antibody seroprevalence and in vitro sero-neutralization in Nancy, France, in spring 2020. Individuals were randomly sampled from electoral lists and invited with household members over 5 years old to be tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgT, i.e., IgA/IgG/IgM) antibodies by ELISA (Bio-rad); the sero-neutralization activity was evaluated on Vero CCL-81 cells. Among 2006 individuals, the raw seroprevalence was 2.1% (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.9), was highest for 20- to 34-year-old participants (4.7% (2.3 to 8.4)), within than out of socially deprived area (2.5% vs. 1%, p = 0.02) and with than without intra-family infection (p < 10-6). Moreover, 25% of participants presented at least one COVID-19 symptom associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p < 10-13), with highly discriminant anosmia or ageusia (odds ratio 27.8 [13.9 to 54.5]); 16.3% (6.8 to 30.7) of seropositive individuals were asymptomatic. Positive sero-neutralization was demonstrated in vitro for 31/43 seropositive subjects. Regarding the very low seroprevalence, a preventive effect of the lockdown in March 2020 can be assumed for the summer, but a second COVID-19 wave, as expected, could be subsequently observed in this poorly immunized population.","Gégout Petit, Anne; Jeulin, Hélène; Legrand, Karine; Jay, Nicolas; Bochnakian, Agathe; Vallois, Pierre; Schvoerer, Evelyne; Guillemin, Francis",Viruses,,892

As such, community pharmacists can play a vital role in a country's response to various preventative and public health measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the essential nature of community pharmacy as a health service, community pharmacies are unlikely to shut down in any foreseeable lockdown scenario. It is therefore important to assess the preventative measure directives for community pharmacies that are in place to safeguard community pharmacy personnel from SARS-CoV-2 in the various parts of the world. Upon reviewing the recommendations of 15 selected countries across five continents (Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and Africa) on social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in community pharmacies, we found inconsistencies in the recommended social distance to be practiced within the community pharmacies. There were also varying recommendations on the use of PPE by the pharmacy personnel. Despite the differences in the recommendations, maintaining recommended social distance and the wearing of appropriate PPE is of utmost importance for healthcare workers, including community pharmacy personnel dealing with day-to-day patient care activities, though full PPE should be worn when dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,892

Those with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) make up less than 10% of individuals, but account for the majority of fatalities.(1) Exploring characteristics of those extubated, strategies for treatment and resource allocation can be potentially implemented. METHODS A retrospective review of the initial 33 adult patients positive for COVID19 admitted to EHC, with respiratory failure and extubated from 3/8/2020 to 5/8/2020 was performed. Clinical characteristics were evaluated descriptively. RESULTS Successfully extubated patients averaged 56 years of age, males made up 91% of the population. Average BMI was 28.2 and hemoglobin A1C was 6.26. The mean maximum creatinine was 4.39 and max procalcitonin was 26. Mean admission and maximum D-dimer levels were 5,349 and 12,450 respectively, while mean admission CRP was 204. The mean days on nasal cannula, non-rebreather and CPAP prior to intubation were 5, 4, and 3, respectively, with overall mean time to intubation of 11.9 days and average length of stay of 20.6 days. The mean minimum PaO2 was 57.7 (most often on 100% FiO2) and max mean PEEP was 12.7. Total sedation days and total pressors days were calculated giving each pressor or sedative used the equivalence of 1 to provide an estimate of sedative and pressor requirements. The mean number of pressor days was 9.8;with a mean number of sedative days as 28. Survival after extubation at time of analyses was (21/33) 63%. CONCLUSION These results signal that these initial extubated patients were quite hypoxic and ventilated with a low PEEP strategy deviating from those suggested by surviving sepsis guidelines. They were in a hyperinflammatory state with moderate renal failure and propensity for infection, however, perhaps the BMI, low A1C scores, relatively fast decline in D dimers and ventilation with low PEEP strategy allowed them to be mechanically liberated. Classifying patient demographics and disease severity early can help identify patients likely to achieve successful extubation. The duration of preintubation oxygen support, duration of intubation, ideal vent settings, and realistic sedative requirements should be explored to optimize successful MV and extubation strategies.","Davila-Molina, M.

The molecular machinery behind the viral entry and thus infectivity is based on the formation of the complex of virus spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein can trace the path to develop allosteric drugs to weaken the strength of the spike-ACE2 interface and, thus, reduce the viral infectivity. In this work we present results of the application of the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm to the complex SARS-CoV spike - ACE2 relative to both 2003 SARS and the recent 2019 - CoV. Results point to a specific region, present in both structures, that is predicted to act as allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein with ACE2.","Paola, Luisa Di; Giuliani, Alessandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05200v1.pdf,892

In e-cigarettes, tobacco combustion is replaced by e-liquid heating, leading some manufacturers to propose that e-cigarettes have less harmful respiratory effects than tobacco consumption. Other innovative features such as the adjustment of nicotine content and the choice of pleasant flavours have won over many users. Nevertheless, the safety of e-cigarette consumption and its potential as a smoking cessation method remain controversial due to limited evidence. Moreover, it has been reported that the heating process itself can lead to the formation of new decomposition compounds of questionable toxicity. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to better understand the impact of these new inhalable compounds on human health. Results of toxicological analyses suggest that e-cigarettes can be safer than conventional cigarettes, although harmful effects from short-term e-cigarette use have been described. Worryingly, the potential long-term effects of e-cigarette consumption have been scarcely investigated.

Identifying these variables that influence such costs are essential to an organization's financial viability. To enable the U.S. healthcare system to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic CMS issued blanket waivers that permit enhanced flexibility, extension, and other emergency declaration changes to ACO reporting requirements through the unforeseen future. This relaxation and even pausing of reporting requirements encouraged the researchers to conduct a systematic review and identify variables that have influenced costs incurred by ambulatory care organizations participating in ACOs prior to the emergency declaration. The research findings identified ACO-ambulatory care variables (enhanced patient care management, health information technology improvements, and organizational ownership/reimbursement models) that helped to reduce costs to the ambulatory care organization. Additional variables (social determinants of health/environmental conditions, lack of integration/standardization, and misalignment of financial incentives) were also identified in the literature as having influenced costs for ambulatory care organizations while participating in an ACO initiative with CMS. Findings can assist ambulatory care organizations to focus on new and optimized strategies as they begin to prepare for the post-pandemic resumption of ACO quality reporting requirements once the emergency declaration is eventually lifted.","Lieneck, Cristian; Weaver, Eric; Maryon, Thomas",,,892

This was a retrospective study into potential ethnic disparity in the presentation and outcomes of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) between New Zealand (NZ) Polynesian and European patients. Data were analysed for patients treated at Auckland City Hospital (ACH; n = 55) and recorded in the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR; n = 173), both for the period 2000-2017. We found that Polynesian patients treated at ACH presented at a younger age than European (P = 0.005), showed higher blast counts (P = 0.033), and a marginally higher prothrombin ratio (P = 0.02). Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was started faster in Polynesian patients than European (P = 0.021), suggesting Polynesians were sicker at presentation but were managed accordingly. There were no differences in bleeding events, transfusion requirements and early deaths during the first month of treatment. Long-term survival was also similar. Data extracted from the NZCR confirmed NZ Polynesian patients with APL were younger than European (P < 0.001), but long-term survival was similar (P = 0.920). In summary, this study indicates a discrepancy in the presentation and severity of APL between NZ Polynesian and European patients but treatment initiation was rapid with no difference in outcomes. The distinctive features of APL in NZ Polynesians raise the possibility of a predisposing genetic factor or a different risk factor profile, elucidation of which is important for all patients with APL.","Varghese, Chris; Liu, Valery Yizhuo; Immanuel, Tracey; Chien, Nicole; Green, Taryn; Chan, George; Theakston, Edward; Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie",Hematology,,892

Ophthalmologists can be confronted at any time with potentially COVID-19 associated ocular symptoms or manifestations in patients and also become infected through close patient contact. Even without systemic infection, the ocular surface can come into direct contact with aerosols or liquids containing SARS-CoV-2 particles. A smear infection through hand-to-eye contact is also possible. A purely isolated ocular infection has not yet been shown. Rather, it seems that ocular complications occur in the context of a systemic infection. However, ocular symptoms can also be the first symptom of COVID-19. The most common ocular complication of COVID-19 is mild follicular conjunctivitis. Haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, or retinal involvement can also occur less frequently. There are currently no evidence-based therapy recommendations for COVID-19 associated diseases of the ocular surface. Artificial tears might be helpful for symptom relief. There is no evidence for antiviral, antibiotic, or anti-inflammatory therapies, but these medications might be used in individual cases. Potential intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions and haemorrhages, as well as cotton wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy. Neuro-ophthalmological complications including Miller-Fisher syndrome or infarct-related central blindness can also occur in very rare cases. Knowledge of potential transmission routes and personal protective equipment is just as essential for each ophthalmologist as a basic knowledge of potential ocular symptoms and complications.","Rokohl, Alexander C; Grajewski, Rafael S; Matos, Philomena A Wawer; Kopecky, Adam; Heindl, Ludwig M; Cursiefen, Claus",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,892

In addition, this method can be applied to a wide variety of pathogens including bacteria, phage, and human viruses. Using the bead transfer method, we demonstrate that an engineered micropattern limits transfer of Staphylococcus aureus by 97.8% and T4 bacteriophage by 93.0% on silicone surfaces.

METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2019, we retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with stage I NSCLC treated with proton beam therapy. The initially intended dose regimen was 60 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) in 4 fractions; however, sequentially modified dose regimens were used when the dose-volume constraints could not be met. The median total dose was 50 CGE (range 50-70 CGE), while the corresponding median biologically effective dose using [Formula: see text]= 10 (BED10) was 112.5 CGE (range 96-150 CGE). RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 40 months (interquartile range 32-48 months). Among the 42 treated patients, 33 had pathologically proven cancers of which most were adenocarcinoma (n = 21, 64%). The 3-year overall survival rate was 71.8%. The estimated rates of local control and progression free survival at 3 years were 91.5% and 66.9%, respectively. Thirteen patients experienced disease progression consisting of three local, six regional, and nine distant failures. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed. CONCLUSION: Passive scattering proton beam therapy for stage I NSCLC using SABR or hypofractionated RT was safe and showed high LC rates.","Bayasgalan, Unurjargal; Moon, Sung Ho; Jeong, Jong Hwi; Kim, Tae Hyun; Cho, Kwan Ho; Suh, Yang-Gun",Radiat Oncol,,892

Subjects in the laser group were irradiated with diode laser (980 nm, 0.3 W) in six spots bilaterally distributed along the MPS for 10 s during the active phase of treatment and after overcorrection (passive phase of RPE). Control group received sham irradiations with the laser in standby mode to characterize the placebo effect. Digital occlusal radiographs were performed at different time-points for bone formation evaluation in both groups. The effects of laser irradiation on pain were assessed by the visual analog scale (Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale). Bone formation between groups was not significantly different (p = 0.2273). At 3 months, bone formation was not yet complete in both groups. Pain sensation was similar between groups (p = 0.3940). However, pain was significantly higher for the first 7 days of treatment compared with the 14th day. PBMT did not accelerate bone regeneration in the MPS and pain sensation was similar.","Matos, Denise Souza; Palma-Dibb, Regina Guenka; de Oliveira Santos, Christiano; da Conceição Pereira Saraiva, Maria; Marques, Fernanda Vicioni; Matsumoto, Mírian Aiko Nakane; Romano, Fábio Lourenço",Lasers med. sci,,892
441373,Development of a multiplex RT-qPCR using the drop out strategy to screen the SARS-CoV-2 South African 501Y.V2 variant,2021,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of susceptibility to COVID-19 are being investigated by many scientists all over the world. The ABO blood group antigens are the most frequently studied genetic markers. Reports from China and USA have shown that people with blood group A are more susceptible to COVID- 19 while those with blood group O are least susceptible. METHODS: The ABO blood group of 51 patients with COVID-19 admitted at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Nigeria was determined and compared with the ABO blood group distribution in the general population. RESULTS: Out of the 51 patients, 39 (76.5%) were males and 12 (23.5%) were females, giving a male: female ratio of 3.25:1. Out of the 51 patients, 29 (56.9%) had blood group O, 12 (23.5%) had blood group A, 10 (19.6%) had blood group B and none (0%) had blood group AB. This blood group distribution was comparable to the blood group distribution in the general population. CONCLUSION: Preliminary analysis of the blood group distribution of COVID-19 patients being managed at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Nigeria found no relationship between COVID-19 and ABO blood group. More studies are needed particularly in Africa to determine if ABO blood group can be a biomarker of susceptibility to COVID-19 among Africans.","Kwaghe, V. G.; Habib, Z. G.; Bawa, A.; Adebayo, F.

We assessed the impact of this ship's stranding on a population of the gastropod Plicopurpura pansa. Toxic elements, hydrocarbons, shell deformities, presence of tumors, imposex, and morphological relationships were analyzed. Two years after the stranding occurred, high cyanide concentrations (0.0363 mg/l) and Ni concentrations above permissible limits (3.35 mg/l) were found in surface seawater. Hydrocarbon concentrations were high in the aft zone of the ship and decreased towards the bow area of the freighter. The P. pansa specimens collected closest to the ship structure presented a high prevalence of tumorations in the structure of the foot and morphological anomalies in the shell structure; imposex was 32% and there was evidence of effects on the growth indicator. The evidence presented here supports the existence of a significant impact from the grounding of the ship on a protected gastropod species associated with the rocky intertidal zone on the coast of Colima. The potential of P. pansa as a bioindicator species of pollution caused by toxic elements and hydrocarbons associated with stranding events in the tropical Pacific is documented.","Liñán-Cabello, Marco A; Liñán-Rico, Viridiana; Ortega-Ortíz, Christian; Verduzco-Zapata, Manuel",,,892

449506,Potential utilities of mask-wearing and instant hand hygiene for fighting SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Although platelets are traditionally recognized for their central role in hemostasis, the presence of chemotactic factors, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules in their granules and membranes indicates that they may play an immunomodulatory role in the immune response, flanking their capacity to trigger blood coagulation and inflammation. Indeed, platelets play a role not only in the innate immune response, through the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and release of inflammatory cytokines, but also in the adaptive immune response, through expression of key costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules capable to activate T cells. Moreover, platelets release huge amounts of extracellular vesicles capable to interact with multiple immune players. The function of platelets thus extends beyond aggregation and implies a multifaceted interplay between hemostasis, inflammation, and the immune response, leading to the amplification of the body's defense processes on one hand, but also potentially degenerating into life-threatening pathological processes on the other. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge and the most recent updates on platelet immune functions and interactions with infectious agents, with a particular focus on their involvement in COVID-19, whose pathogenesis involves a dysregulation of hemostatic and immune processes in which platelets may be determinant causative agents.","Rolla, Roberta; Puricelli, Chiara; Bertoni, Alessandra; Boggio, Elena; Gigliotti, Casimiro Luca; Chiocchetti, Annalisa; Cappellano, Giuseppe; Dianzani, Umberto",Int. j. lab. hematol,,892

However, IBD patients and patients taking immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from clinical phase III vaccine trials, complicating the assessment of effectiveness of these new vaccines. From past experience we know that adapted vaccination strategies may be appropriate in some IBD patients to optimize immunogenicity. We review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relevant to IBD patients, including immune responses from humoral to cellular, emerging data on new variants and off-label vaccination schemes. We also identify clinical and scientific knowledge gaps that can be translated into both large-scale population-based studies and targeted vaccine studies to describe the precise immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in IBD patients. We strongly endorse the recommendation of vaccinating IBD patients to ensure maximal protection from COVID-19 both for the individual and the community.","Wellens, Judith; Colombel, Jean-Frédéric; Satsangi, Jack J; Wong, Serre-Yu",J. crohns. colitis,,892

This rapid pace in sensor development has been accentuated by vast improvements in data analysis methods in the form of machine learning and artificial intelligence that, together, promise fantastic opportunities in chronic sensing of biosignals to enable preventative screening, automated diagnosis, and tools for personalized treatment strategies. At the same time, the importance of widely accessible personal monitoring has become evident by recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Progress in fully integrated and chronic sensing solutions is therefore increasingly important. Chronic operation, however, is not truly possible with tethered approaches or bulky, battery-powered systems that require frequent user interaction. A solution for this integration challenge is offered by wireless and battery-free platforms that enable continuous collection of biosignals. This review summarizes current approaches to realize such device architectures and discusses their building blocks. Specifically, power supplies, wireless communication methods and compatible sensing modalities in the context of most prevalent implementations in target organ systems. Additionally, we highlight examples of current embodiments that quantitively expand sensing capabilities because of their use of wireless and battery-free architectures.","Stuart, Tucker; Cai, Le; Burton, Alex; Gutruf, Philipp",Biosens Bioelectron,,892

These models are based on evidence that primarily originates from investigations in high-income countries, but it may be impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for microbiology and laboratory testing, imaging, and the use of diagnostic and prognostic models in patients with severe COVID-19 in LMICs. For diagnostic testing, where reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) testing is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper or lower respiratory specimens and suggest using lower respiratory samples for patients suspected of having COVID-19 but have negative RT-PCR results for upper respiratory tract samples. We recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but, because false-negative testing can occur, recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19. We suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, until there is better evidence for its usefulness. Where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR, only if strict quality control measures are guaranteed. For laboratory testing, we recommend a baseline white blood cell differential platelet count and hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver function tests and suggest a baseline C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, prothrombin time (or other coagulation test), and D-dimer, where such testing capabilities are available. For imaging, where availability of standard thoracic imaging is limited, we suggest using lung ultrasound to identify patients with possible COVID-19, but recommend against its use to exclude COVID-19. We suggest using lung ultrasound in combination with clinical parameters to monitor progress of the disease and responses to therapy in COVID-19 patients. We currently suggest against using diagnostic and prognostic models as these models require extensive laboratory testing and imaging, which often are limited in LMICs","Schultz, M.

Abiding by the government regulations, several educational institutions including those in healthcare, postponed or cancelled several academic activities to curb the spread of the virus (2). Considering the high risk of infection transmission, several academic research projects involving human participants were paused. This has posed serious challenges in managing academic tasks such as teaching and learning activities related to research, participant examination and follow-up, field work for data collection, face-to-face discussion with colleagues, students and supervisors. Many academic healthcare research activities involve human subjects as research participants; but because of the lockdown, final year post-graduate students may not be able to complete their research projects within the stipulated time frame. Healthcare students are in a vulnerable situation because of the pressure to submit their research projects for the successful completion of the courses. Given this situation, it is probable that students may resort to unethical or fraudulent research activities such as data manipulation or fabrication to complete their research projects before the existing deadline.

OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to actively assess public interest changes and the reasons underlying these shifts. METHODS: Using Amazons' Mechanical Turk, we crowdsourced public opinions regarding aesthetic interventions from April 30 to May 3, 2020. The survey assessed prior experience with and interest in 6 aesthetic interventions before and during the pandemic and reasons for changing interest. United States residents aged 18 years and over who passed the attention check were included. RESULTS: We included 704 of 838 total responses. One-half of respondents were female; the median age group was 25 to 34 years. During the pandemic, 21% of respondents had increased and 33% decreased interest in at least one intervention. Non-invasive procedures (7.3%), facial aesthetic surgery (6.6%), and medical-grade skincare (5.9%) elicited the greatest interest increase. Seeing themselves in the mirror more often (43.2%), desire to look better after the crisis (41.8%), and increased time on social media (40.4%) were the top reasons for increased interest. The most common reasons for decreased interest were changing spending priorities (58%), focusing on other health aspects (49.8%), and worrying about infection in medical facilities (46.3%). Almost one-half of respondents considered virtual consultations for interventions of increased interest. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected interest in medical aesthetics. Offering telemedicine and discussing detailed COVID-19 infection control policies with patients will be critical to address patient needs and concerns. These findings can be used to improve patient outreach, advertisement, and counseling as practices focus on reopening.","Jenny, Hillary E; Chandawarkar, Akash; Kim, Roy",Aesthet. surg. j,,892

GSI was calculated considering nine metrics such as school and work closures, stay-at-home requirements, among others types of social distancing and isolation measures. Population data from the United Nations Population Fund and number of deaths data was collected from the dashboard of the World Health Organization (WHO). We performed an analysis of the period March-December using a mixed linear model approach. Peru, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador had the highest death rates with an increasing trend over time, while Suriname, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay and Guyana had the lowest ones, which remained steady. GSI in most countries followed the same pattern during the analyzed months. i.e., high indices at the beginning of the pandemic and lower ones in the last evaluated months, while the number of deaths increased over the whole period. Almost no country kept its GSI high for much time, especially from October to December. Time and GSI as well as their interaction were highly significant. As their interaction increases, death rate decreases.

Among the several explanations proposed, an early and large testing of the population was put forward. Most current debates on COVID-19 focus on the differences among countries, but little attention has been given to regional differences and diet. The low-death rate European countries (e.g. Austria, Baltic States, Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Poland, Slovakia) have used different quarantine and/or confinement times and methods and none have performed as many early tests as Germany. Among other factors that may be significant are the dietary habits. It seems that some foods largely used in these countries may reduce angiotensin-converting enzyme activity or are anti-oxidants. Among the many possible areas of research, it might be important to understand diet and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) levels in populations with different COVID-19 death rates since dietary interventions may be of great benefit.","Bousquet, Jean; Anto, Josep M.; Iaccarino, Guido; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Haahtela, Tari; Anto, Aram; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Blain, Hubert; Canonica, G.

METHODS: We examined each of the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins for their cytotoxicity in HEK 293 T cells and their subcellular localization in COS-7 cells. We also used Mass-Spec Affinity purification to identify the host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 protein and tested a drug that could inhibit a specific Orf6 and host protein interaction. RESULTS: We found that Orf6, Nsp6 and Orf7a induced the highest toxicity when over-expressed in human 293 T cells. All three proteins showed membrane localization in COS-7 cells. We focused on Orf6, which was most cytotoxic and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome and lysosomal membranes. Proteomics revealed Orf6 interacts with nucleopore proteins (RAE1, XPO1, RANBP2 and nucleoporins). Treatment with Selinexor, an FDA-approved inhibitor for XPO1, attenuated Orf6-induced cellular toxicity in human 293 T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed Orf6 as a highly pathogenic protein from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identified its key host interacting proteins, and Selinexor as a drug candidate for directly targeting Orf6 host protein interaction that leads to cytotoxicity.

617249,Author Correction: Scalable and robust SARS-CoV-2 testing in an academic center,2020-07-17,"As emerging countries, China, Russia, and South Africa are establishing and/or improving their trauma systems. China has recently established a trauma system named “the Chinese Regional Trauma Care System” and covered over 200 million populations. It includes paramedic-staffed pre-hospital care, in-hospital care in certified trauma centers, trauma registry, quality assurance, continuous improvement and ongoing coverage of the entire Chinese territory. The Russian trauma system was formed in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Pre-hospital care is region-based, with a regional coordination center that determines which team will go to the scene and the nearest hospital where the victim should be transported. Physician-staffed ambulances are organized according to three levels of trauma severity corresponding to three levels of trauma centers where in-hospital care is managed by a trauma team. No national trauma registry exists in Russia. Improvements to the Russian trauma system have been scheduled. There is no unified trauma system in South Africa, and trauma care is organized by public and private emergency medical service in each province. During the pre-hospital care, paramedics provide basic or advanced life support services and transport the patients to the nearest hospital because of the limited number of trauma centers. In-hospital care is inclusive with a limited number of accredited trauma centers. In-hospital care is managed by emergency medicine with multidisciplinary care by the various specialties. There is no national trauma registry in South Africa. The South African trauma system is facing multiple challenges. An increase in financial support, training for primary emergency trauma care, and coordination of private sector, need to be planned.

629543,A SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant outbreak on airplane: Vaccinated air passengers are more protected than unvaccinated.,2021-10-05,"Study Objective: Monoclonal antibody therapy (MOAB) has recently emerged as a treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19, potentially preventing those with underlying conditions from progressing to severe illness and hospitalization. While MOAB administration has commonly been restricted to infusion centers or inpatient settings, the infection prevention needs of patients with acute COVID-19 and the ambulatory nature of the therapy make the emergency department (ED) a useful setting to offer this treatment. Further, as EDs are the primary point of health care access for many at-risk individuals, offering MOAB in the ED may increase availability of treatment options for patients from traditionally underserved communities. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients 12 years and above who received treatment in our urban, academic, community hospital. A multidisciplinary group comprised of stakeholders in emergency medicine, pediatrics, infectious disease, nursing, informatics, and pharmacy developed a comprehensive ED-based MOAB program. Patients 12 years and older were screened for eligibility during ED visits or during follow-up calls providing positive test results. Staff was trained on specific consent, infusion, monitoring, and documentation procedures adherent to MOAB administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. Patients were contacted following MOAB and queried regarding symptom resolution and health care utilization. Data regarding patient demographics, ED course, and 7-day unscheduled visits were collected. Results: In this ongoing quality improvement initiative, from December 2020 to March 2021, there were 26,229 patient encounters at the pilot ED site. 84 patients were provided MOAB, 87% Bamlanivimab and 13% Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab. Patients had a mean age of 52.3 years (SD 24.4);21% were 12-17 years of age and 37% were >65 years old. 52% were male. 33% self-reported as Caucasian, 19% Black, 18% Asian/Pacific Islander, 21% as other, and 9% were unknown. 17% identified as Latinx. 19% of patients were insured by Medicaid, 36% Medicare, 39% commercially insured, and 6% were uninsured. Patients had symptoms a median of 3 days prior to MOAB. After age (46%), the most commonly reported eligibility criteria was obesity (20%), followed by hypertension (11%) and immunocompromised state (11%). 74% of infusions were administered during nights and weekends. No infusion reactions occurred. 8% returned to an ED within 7 days of MOAB, 5% were hospitalized. No patients required ICU admission or died. Conclusion: ED-based MOAB has been safely implemented and may be an effective treatment for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Health-system-wide expansion of this program may provide opportunities to offer this life-saving therapy to underserved populations with poor access to care.","Lim, C.; Eiting, E.; O'Neill, A.; Farraj, R.; Koshy, S.; Simms, C.; Devlin, A.; Nunez, J.; Calderon, Y.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421005916; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421005916; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.032,892

To describe excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guatemala during 2020 by week, age, sex, and place of death. Methods. We used mortality data from 2015 to 2020, gathered through the vital registration system of Guatemala. We calculated weekly mortality rates, overall and stratified by age, sex, and place of death. We fitted a generalized additive model to calculate excess deaths, adjusting for seasonality and secular trends and compared excess deaths to the official COVID-19 mortality count. Results. We found an initial decline of 26% in mortality rates during the first weeks of the pandemic in 2020, compared with 2015 to 2019. These declines were sustained through October 2020 for the population younger than 20 years and for deaths in public spaces and returned to normal from July onward in the population aged 20 to 39 years. We found a peak of 73% excess mortality in mid-July, especially in the population aged 40 years or older. We estimated a total of 8036 excess deaths (95% confidence interval = 7935, 8137) in 2020, 46% higher than the official COVID-19 mortality count. Conclusions.

636399,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the pediatric population of the United States,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: A search for new anti-coronaviral drugs to treat coronaviral infections was motivated by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). OBJECTIVES: In order to find drugs that treat coronavirus infections, including SARS, we screened traditional medicinal herbal extracts and evaluated their antiviral activities on coronavirus replication. STUDY DESIGN: We employed a plaque assay to evaluate the effect of 22 medicinal herbal extracts on virus replication. We determined the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each extract that was necessary to inhibit the replication of mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59); we also determined 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC(50)) for each extract. Northern and Western blot analyzes were performed to investigate antiviral activity in MHV-infected DBT cells, including virus entry, viral RNA and protein expression, and virus release. Coronavirus specific inhibition was also demonstrated using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). RESULTS: Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, Phellodendron cortex and Sophora subprostrata radix decreased the MHV production and the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression with EC(50) values ranging from 2.0 to 27.5 μg/ml. These extracts also significantly decreased PEDV production and less dramatically decreased vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) production in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts selected strongly inhibited MHV replication and could be potential candidates for new anti-coronavirus drugs.","Kim, Hye-Young; Shin, Hyun-Soo; Park, Hyun; Kim, Youn-Chul; Yun, Yong Gab; Park, Sun; Shin, Ho-Joon; Kim, Kyongmin",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653207003733; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653207003733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18036887/,892

Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.","Vasudevan, Harish N.; Xu, Peng; Servellita, Venice; Miller, Steve; Liu, Leqian; Gopez, Allan; Chiu, Charles Y.; Abate, Adam R.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436939/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80715-1,892

All samples exhibited significant specific IgA reactivity to the full Spike, while 80% exhibited significant IgA and secretory (s)Ab binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Additionally, 67% of samples exhibited IgG and/or IgM binding to RBD. IgA and sAb titers were highly correlated, indicating most IgA to be sIgA. Overall, these data indicate that a robust sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in human milk after infection should be expected in a significant majority of individuals. Further research is highly warranted to determine Ab functionality, and the potential for exploiting extracted milk sIgA for therapeutic use.","Fox, Alisa; Marino, Jessica; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Hahn-Holbrook, Jennifer; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Powell, Rebecca L.",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101735; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220309329; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220309329?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134887/,892

Some specific statistical attributes of the GLET-GTII are investigated, such as quantiles, uncertainty measures, survival function, moments, reliability, and hazard function etc. We describe two methods of parametric estimations of GLET-GTII discussed by using maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian paradigm. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that estimators are consistent. Two real life implementations are performed to scrutinize the suitability of our current strategy. These real life data is related to Infectious diseases (COVID-19).

In this article, we examine the roles of two psychological constructs – originally put forth in the behavioral decision sciences – in predicting interindividual differences in fear responses: general risk aversion (GRA) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). We first provide a review of these constructs and illustrate why they may play important roles in shaping anxiety-related disorders. Thereafter we present an empirical study that collected survey data from 550 U.S. residents, comprising self-assessments of dispositions towards risk and uncertainty, anxiety- and depression levels, as well as demographic variables – to thus test the extent to which these psychological constructs are predictive of strong fear responses related to COVID-19 (i.e., mortal fear, racing heart). The results from Bayesian multi-model inference analyses showed that GRA and IU were more powerful predictors of fear responses than demographic variables. Moreover, the predictive power of these constructs was independent of general anxiety- and depression levels. Subsequent mediation analyses showed that the effects of GRA and IU were both direct and indirect via anxiety. We conclude by discussing possible treatment options, but also highlight that future research needs to further examine causal pathways and conceptual overlaps.","Millroth, Philip; Frey, Renato",J Anxiety Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102454; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887618521001018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298237/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618521001018,892

Recently, studies have revealed the involvement of both genetic and exposure factors in the susceptibility of COVID-19. However, the correlation between them is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the correlation between genetic and exposure factors associated with COVID-19. We retrieved the information of 7362 participants with COVID-19 testing results from the UK Biobank. We identified genetic factors for COVID-19 by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary analysis. In this study, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 15 exposure factors [smoking, alcohol intake, daytime dozing, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, dementia, atmosphere NO2 concentration, socioeconomic status, education qualification, ethnicity, and income] were found to be potential risk factors of COVID-19. Then, a gene-exposure (G × E) association network was built based on the correlation among and between these genetic factors and exposure factors. rs140092351, a SNP on microRNA miR1202, not only had the most significant association with COVID-19, but also interacted with multiple exposure factors.

Further, by interacting explanatory variables with two group dummies, this paper identifies differential slope (policy) effects of each explanatory variable on mobile broadband adoption. The paper concludes that, among the three groups, considerable gaps exist in the size of effective policy choice sets: six for Take-off, ten for Fast-diffusion, and thirteen for Saturated, suggesting that the countries in the Take-off stage have a very narrow degree of latitude for developing mobile broadband promotion strategies.","Teklemariam, Mekuria Haile; Kwon, Youngsun",Telecomm Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596120300987; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308596120300987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834404/,892

News media narratives matter because they shape societal perceptions and influence the core tent poles of our society, from the economy to elections. Given its importance—and with the benefit of hindsight—we provide a systematic framework to analyze news narratives of Covid-19, laying the groundwork to evaluate policy and risk communications. OBJECTIVES: We leverage a 10-billion-word-database of online news, taken from over 7,000 English newspapers and magazines across 20 countries, culminating in 28 million articles. First, we track the volume of Covid-19 conversations across 20 countries from before to during the pandemic (Oct’19 to May’20). Second, we distill the phases of global pandemic narratives, and elucidate regional differences. METHODS: To track the volume of Covid-19 narratives, we identified 10 target terms—Coronavirus, Covid-19, Covid, nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Virus, Virus, Disease, Epidemic, Pandemic—and tracked their combined monthly prevalence across eight months from October 2019 through May 2020. Globally, across 20 countries, we identified 18,042,855 descriptors of the target terms. Further, these descriptors were analysed with natural language processing models to generate the top five topics of Covid-19 that were labelled by two independent researchers. This process was repeated across six continents to distil regional topics. RESULTS: Our model found four phases of online news media narratives: Pre-pandemic, Early, Peak and Recovery. Pre-pandemic narratives (Oct’19–Dec’19) were divergent across regions with Africa focused on monkeypox, Asia on dengue fever, and North America on Lyme disease and AIDS. Early (Jan–Feb’20) and Peak Pandemic (Mar–May’20) evidenced a global convergence, reflecting the omnipresence of Covid-19. The brief transition from early to peak pandemic narratives underscored the pandemic’s rapid spread. Emerging from the embers of the pandemic’s peak were nascent recovery words that are regionally divergent—Oceania focused on hope and an uncertain future while North America centered on re-opening the economy and tackling discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Practically, we presented a media barometer of Covid-19, and provided a framework to analyse the pandemic’s impact on societal perceptions—laying the important groundwork for policy makers to evaluate policy communications, and design risk communication strategies.","Ng, Reuben; Chow, Ting Yu Joanne; Yang, Wenshu",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469446/,892

While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs(1). Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. While COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal(2), most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease(3). Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies(4), we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient protected against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while pretreatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","Zheng, Jian; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Li, Kun; Verma, Abhishek Kumar; Ortiz, Miguel; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Leidinger, Mariah R.; Knudson, C.

677620,Rapid identification of Sars-CoV-2 variants of concern using the portable peakPCR platform,2021-05-21,"Understanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is important. We describe a single-center cohort of COVID-19 PIBD patients where seroconversion against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined. Immunosuppressed PIBD patients at Texas Children's Hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were included in the study. The clinical course of IBD, concurrent medications, COVID-19 related symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing date, and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing date and result were examined. Of 14 SARS-CoV-2 positive PIBD patients, 12 were tested for qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (seven with transient COVID-19 symptoms, five asymptomatic). All symptomatic (7/7) and 60% of asymptomatic (3/5) patients seroconverted. No patients required hospitalization attributed to COVID-19. High rates of COVID-19 seroconversion occurred in immunosuppressed and symptomatic PIBD patients. More research to evaluate the significance of COVID-19 seroconversion is needed.","Ruan, Wenly; Nguyen, Huyen; Wyatt, Allyson; Ihekweazu, Faith; Vartabedian, Bryan S.; Karam, Lina; Walsh, Seema; Kellermayer, Richard",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000003211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173793/,892
682288,Rapid vaccination and early reactive partial lockdown will minimize deaths from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 infected patients has been soaring in the Middle East countries. The disease poses a significant threat, decisions about prioritizing care should be made in accordance with the proven risk factors for complications. OBJECTIVE: The present study provides the first bespoke prediction model in the Middle East to identify COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for complications. METHOD: A case-control study design was adopted to compare the characteristics of successfully recovered patients with those who had complications. Complications were defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, sepsis or septic shock, pneumonia or respiratory failure, and death. The prediction model was created through multivariable logistic regression. C statistic was used to assess overall discriminatory ability. RESULTS: All COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients (n = 133) in Amman – Jordan were included in the study. Successfully recovered were 125 patients. The median age (IRQ) was 26 (10-40). Almost 30% were >40 years. Patients with complications were eight patients, age 63 (51.5-71.5). The prediction model identified the following variables as risk factors: diabetes (OR = 59.7; 95% CI: 3.5–1011.5, P = 0.005), fever (OR = 24.8; 95% CI: 1.4–447.3, P = 0.029), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (OR = 15.9; 95% CI: 1.3–189.7, P = 0.029), body mass index (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61–0.88, P = 0.001), abnormal Neutrophils (OR = 16.8; 95% CI: 1.0–292.0, P = 0.053). Prediction model was statistically significant, χ2(5) = 86.1, p < 0.0005. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports from China, the most influential variables that led to disease progression in Jordanian patients were diabetes, fever, shortness of breath, body mass index, and abnormal neutrophils. Similar to reports from the USA, smoking was not a leading factor for complications. Comorbidities and patient health status, rather than age, were the primary risk factors for complications. Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine showed no protective effect.","Odeh, Mohanad M.; Al Qaissieh, Rami; Tarifi, Amjad A.; Kilani, Muna M.; Tadros, Ramzy E.; Al khashman, Abedrazzaq I.; Alzoubi, Karem H.",J Infect Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.02.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187603412100054X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984658/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603412100054X?v=s5,892

We report the case of a patient with COVID-19 infection, which, during the course of the treatment, developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis. A 60- year-old male patient, a longstanding diabetic, with a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was admitted for treatment. He received parenteral meropenem and oral oseltamivir with parenteral methylprednisolone. Over the course of the admission, he developed signs of orbital cellulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, orbits, and paranasal sinuses, revealed soft tissue swelling in the right preseptal, malar, premaxillary and retrobulbar regions with paranasal sinusitis. A nasal biopsy revealed broad aseptate filamentous fungal hyphae suggestive of mucormycosis, which was confirmed on culture. Extensive use of steroids/monoclonal antibodies/broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to the development/exacerbation of a preexisting fungal disease. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of secondary invasive fungal infections in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Mehta, Salil; Pandey, Abha",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145132/,892
