This study examines the influence of resilience on the impact of COVID-related stress and enforced lockdown on mental health, drug use and treatment adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Argentina. SETTING PLWH residing predominantly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and urban regions of Argentina were identified from a private clinic electronic database. METHODS Participants completed an anonymous online survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic disruption, resilience, mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness), adherence to HIV treatment, and substance use. We performed ordinary least squares and logistic regressions to test whether resilient coping buffered the impact of economic disruption on mental health and drug use during quarantine. RESULTS 1336 PLWH aged 18-82 were enrolled. The impact of economic disruption on mental health ΔF(1,1321)=8.86, p=.003 and loneliness ΔF(1,1326)=5.77, p=.016 was buffered by resilience. A three-way interaction between resilient buffering, stress, and sex was significant ΔF(1,1325)=4.76, p=.029. Participants reported less than excellent adherence to medication (33%), disruption to mental health services (11%), and disruption to substance abuse treatment (1.3%) during lockdown. DISCUSSION The impact of COVID-stress and lockdown on emotional distress appeared mitigated by resilience coping strategies and the buffering impact of resilience on perceived stress was greater among women. Results highlight PLWH's capacity to adhere to treatment in challenging circumstances and the importance of developing resilience skills for better coping with stress and adversity.","Ballivian, Jamile; Alcaide, Maria L; Cecchini, Diego; Jones, Deborah L; Abbamonte, John M; Cassetti, Isabel",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,912,1

Since there are no approved drugs that satisfactorily treat this condition, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials are warranted and reasonable. Drug repurposing is a well-known strategy that seeks to deploy existing licensed drugs for newer indications and that provides the quickest possible transition from the bench to the bedside to meet therapeutic needs. At present, several existing licensed drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and remdesivir have been used because of their potential efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19. Recently, antibiotics such as tetracyclines and macrolides have been reported to be effective against COVID-19. A combination of tetracyclines and macrolides may be a potential treatment for COVID-19 because there are some differences in the mechanism of action of tetracyclines and macrolides.","Ohe, Masashi; Furuya, Ken; Goudarzi, Houman",Bioscience trends,912,33

RECENT FINDINGS In the United States, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have been mild illnesses, with those 5-17 years of age having the highest frequency. Specifically, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in children is two times higher in adolescents (12-17 years) than younger school-aged children (5-11 years). Despite the higher case counts in older children, 10% of pediatric hospitalizations have been in infants less than one year. In addition, severe respiratory and renal complications, hospitalization, and even death have been documented in children. SUMMARY Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress, with mild nonspecific symptoms being the most commonly reported. The broad clinical presentation and the frequency of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections in children pose challenges for controlling and detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, severe disease has been noted in children with associated medical complications and death. Thus, additional active surveillance and research is needed to understand the burden children contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States.","Rankin, Danielle A; Talj, Rana; Howard, Leigh M; Halasa, Natasha B",Current opinion in pediatrics,912,24

This experiment was conducted to observe the effects of composting on euthanized horse carcass degradation and sodium pentobarbital residues in compost material up to 367 d. Six separate compost bins were constructed on pastureland. Three bins served as the control while 3 served as the treatment. The carbonaceous material, or bulking agent, consisted of hardwood chips mixed with yard waste wetted to approximately 50% moisture content. Bulking agent was added to each bin at a depth of 0.46 m, creating the pad. A licensed veterinarian provided 6 horse carcasses for use in the experiment. These horses had required euthanasia for health reasons. All horses were weighed and then sedated with an intravenous injection of 8 mL of xylazine. After sedation the 3 horses in the treatment group were euthanized by intravenous injection of 60 mL of sodium pentobarbital. The 3 control group horses were anesthetized by intravenous injection of 15 mL of ketamine hydrochloride and then humanely euthanized by precise gunshot to the temporal lobe. Following euthanasia, each carcass was placed on the center of the pad and surrounded with 0.6 m of additional bulking agent. Serum and liver samples were obtained immediately following death. Compost samples were obtained on d 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, 129, 233, and 367 while soil samples were obtained on d -1 and 367. Each sample was analyzed for sodium pentobarbital concentration. Compost pile and ambient temperatures were also recorded. Composting successfully degraded soft tissue with only large bones remaining. Data illustrate that sodium pentobarbital was detectable up to 367 d in compost piles with no clear trend of concentration reduction. Drug residues were detected in soil samples indicating that sodium pentobarbital leached from the carcass and through the pad. These findings confirm the persistence of sodium pentobarbital from equine mortality compost piles and emphasize the importance of proper carcass management of animals euthanized with a barbiturate to reduce environmental impact and secondary toxicosis.","Payne, J; Farris, R; Parker, G; Bonhotal, J; Schwarz, M",Journal of animal science,912,1
