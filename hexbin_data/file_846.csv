The predicted increase in the number of patients requiring hospitalisation prompted the need to increase the number of clinical staff working on hospital wards, particularly healthcare support workers (HCSWs), who play a crucial role in addressing the care needs of older people. This article describes how one health board in Scotland trained and redeployed volunteers among its staff to work as temporary HCSWs in its main hospital during the pandemic. A fast-track, one-day training course was delivered in March and April 2020 to 104 staff from various backgrounds - some non-clinical - by a team of volunteer trainers. Staffing during an emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, presents significant challenges, but the experience at NHS Borders shows that it is possible to develop a training course rapidly and provide additional band 2 staff to supplement the support workforce in a time of crisis.","Magowan, Rachel; Smith, Kim",Nursing older people,846,1

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of desflurane and sevoflurane in patients with elevated preoperative liver functions undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods The study was a randomized study and included 162 patients classified randomly into two groups: Desflurane group: The patients received desflurane (end-tidal concentration 4%-6%) as an inhalational agent during the whole procedure. Sevoflurane group: The patients received sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration 2%-4%) as an inhalational agent during the whole procedure. The investigations included serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin. The values were serially collected at the following timepoints; T0:at the preoperative period, T1:directly after surgery, T2:1st postoperative day, T3:2nd postoperative day, T4:3rd postoperative day, T5:5th postoperative day, T6:7th postoperative day, and T7:10th postoperative day. The statistics were described in terms of mean ± standard deviation, frequencies, and percentages. Results The preoperative liver enzymes and total bilirubin were higher than the normal range in patients of the two groups. Postoperatively, there was a decrease in the AST and ALT with desflurane more than sevoflurane from T1 to T6(P < 0.05). The ALP, GGT, and bilirubin decreased in patients of the two groups, but the comparison was insignificant (P > 0.05). Conclusion The desflurane is a safe inhalational volatile for maintenance of anesthesia in patients with impaired liver function undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It was associated with a decrease in the liver enzymes more than the sevoflurane.","Soliman, Rabie; Yacoub, Abdelbadee; Abdellatif, Mostafa",Indian journal of anaesthesia,846,16

The peak coincided with the majority of SARS cases being reported in April 2003. AIMS In this paper we examine the mechanism of how the SARS outbreak resulted in a higher completed suicide rate especially among older adults in Hong Kong. METHODS We used Qualitative data analysis to uncover the association between the occurrence of SARS and older adult suicide. Furthermore, we used a qualitative study based on the Coroner Court reports to provide empirical evidence about the relationship between SARS and the excessive number of suicide deaths among the elderly. RESULTS SARS-related older adult suicide victims were more likely to be afraid of contracting the disease and had fears of disconnection. The suicide motives among SARS-related suicide deaths were more closely associated with stress over fears of being a burden to their families during the negative impact of the epidemic. Social disengagement, mental stress, and anxiety at the time of the SARS epidemic among a certain group of older adults resulted in an exceptionally high rate of suicide deaths. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that the mental and psychological well-being of the community, in particular older adults, be taken into careful account when developing epidemic control measures to combat the future outbreak of diseases in the community. In addition, it is important to alert family members to vulnerable individuals who are at potential risk because of their illnesses or anxieties.","Yip, Paul S F; Cheung, Y T; Chau, P H; Law, Y W",Crisis,846,33

Extracellular virions are required for cell-to-cell spread and pathogenesis. Specific to the extracellular virion membrane, glycoproteins A33, A34, and B5 are highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and have roles during extracellular virion formation and subsequent infection. B5 is dependent on an interaction with either A33 or A34 for localization to the site of intracellular envelopment and incorporation into the envelope of released extracellular virions. In this report we show that an interaction between A33 and A34 can be detected in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that a three-protein complex between A33, A34, and B5 forms in the ER that disassociates post ER export. Finally, immunofluorescence reveals that co-expression of all three glycoproteins results in their localization to a juxtanuclear region that is presumably the site of intracellular envelopment. These results demonstrate the existence of two previously unidentified interactions; one between A33 and A34 and another simultaneous interaction between all three of the glycoproteins. Furthermore, these results indicate that interactions amongst A33, A34, and B5 are vital for proper intracellular trafficking and subcellular localization.IMPORTANCE The secondary intracellular envelopment of poxviruses at the trans-Golgi network to release infectious extracellular virus (EV) is essential for their spread and pathogenesis. Viral glycoproteins A33, A34, and B5 are critical for the efficient production of infectious EV and interactions amongst these proteins are important for their localization and incorporation into the outer extracellular virion membrane. We have uncovered a novel interaction between glycoproteins A33 and A34. Furthermore, we show that B5 can interact with the A33-A34 complex. Our analysis indicates that the three-protein complex has a role in ER exit and proper localization of the three glycoproteins to the intracellular site of wrapping. These results show that a complex set of interactions occur in the secretory pathway of infected cells to assure proper glycoprotein trafficking and envelope content, which is important for the release of infectious poxvirus virions.","Monticelli, Stephanie R; Earley, Amalia K; Stone, Raychel; Norbury, Christopher C; Ward, Brian M",Journal of virology,846,7

Our objective was to compare short- and long-term outcomes associated with these 2 types of skin incisions following in utero spina bifida repair. METHODS Prospective observational cohort of 72 patients undergoing fetal spina bifida repair at a single institution between September 2011 and August 2018. The decision for the type of incision was at the discretion of the surgeons. The primary outcome was total operative time. Secondary outcomes included an analog scale of wound pain score on postoperative day 3, duration of postoperative stay, and postoperative wound complications within the first 4 weeks. The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire, a validated questionnaire, was obtained for all patients (≥6 months from delivery) using 4 categories (appearance, consciousness, satisfaction with appearance and with symptoms), with higher scores reflecting a poorer perception of the scar. RESULTS There were 43 women (59.7%) in the LT group and 29 (40.3%) in the ML group. In all patients, the same incision was used during cesarean delivery. The total operative time was higher in the LT group by 33 min (p < 0.001), primarily due to abdominal wall incision time (open and closure). No significant differences were found between the groups in pain score, length of postoperative stay, or the rate of wound complications. Fifty-three patients (73.6%) responded to the questionnaire, 36/43 from the LT group and 17/29 from the ML group. There was no difference in the scores of appearance, consciousness, and satisfaction with appearance and symptoms between the groups. CONCLUSION ML incisions shorten operative times without altering long-term incision-related satisfaction when compared to LT incisions.","Fishel Bartal, Michal; Bergh, Eric P; Tsao, Kuojen; Austin, Mary T; Moise, Kenneth J; Fletcher, Stephen A; Sibai, Baha M; Papanna, Ramesha",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,846,0

We explored the ways occupational health nurses can use social media as a helpful resource as well as identified potential concerns associated with its use. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted between December 1, 2019, and April 10, 2020, using PubMed and Google Scholar. Key search terms included social media, social network, nurse or nursing, occupational health, and online health. Criteria for selection included studies with results on social media within health care, nursing, and/or occupational health. Studies were also included if the health effects of social media were addressed. Six additional studies that had been previously identified by hand searching were included. Findings: These findings support the use of social media in occupational health for encouraging participatory health care among employees. Occupational health nurses can also utilize social media for health information, online health communities, emergency communication, health education workshops, professional connections, and continuing education. However, awareness of safe social media practice is necessary due to the possibility of misinformation and privacy breaches. Conclusion/Application to Practice: Social media can be used for education and communication with employees and is a way to support employees with specific health conditions through participation in online health communities . Occupational health nurses can take advantage of the speed and accessibility of social media to reach large numbers of employees. It is also a useful tool for addressing many health concerns encountered by employees; however, careful sourcing of information, awareness of company policies, and other safe practices can help to ensure it is helpful and not harmful.","Siegmund, Lee Anne",Workplace health & safety,846,10

She underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Final pathology confirmed a diffuse large B cell lymphoma arising from the splenic parenchyma. Conclusions: Both PPL and PSL are rare causes of left upper quadrant masses. In this case, we describe a large lymphoma that appeared to arise from the tail of the pancreas, but on final pathology was found to be splenic in origin.

Prior studies have investigated singular health care settings, used varying definitions of frequent attendance, and inconsistently identified factors correlated with frequent attendance. The purpose of this article is to suggest a uniform definition of frequent attenders for different health care settings and to determine factors correlated with frequent attendance. Methods This systematic review of three databases identified 2761 unique articles; 174 met inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for their definition of frequent attenders and factors associated with frequent attendance. Results Most studies defined frequent attenders by number of health care visits within a set time period (n=115) and top percentile cutoff (n=42). Based on averages across studies, we propose the following frequent attender definitions: for primary care, either the top 10th percentile or at least 10 visits in 12 months; for emergency room, at least 5 visits in 12 months; and for inpatient hospitalization, at least 4 admissions in 12 months. Common factors correlated with frequent attendance were mental health and chronic disease. Conclusions We propose definitions of frequent attenders for three common health care settings: primary care, emergency room, and inpatient. Future studies should include mental health and chronic disease, among other factors, when studying this population. Adoption of these recommendations will allow comparisons across studies such that meta-analyses may better determine interventions for more appropriate health care utilization.","Shukla, Dip M; Faber, Erik B; Sick, Brian",Journal of patient-centered research and reviews,846,1

In contemporary practice, TAVR is performed predominantly via a transfemoral arterial approach, whereby a transcatheter heart valve (THV) is delivered in a retrograde fashion through the iliofemoral arterial system and thoraco-abdominal aorta, into the native aortic valve annulus. While the majority of patients possess suitable anatomy for transfemoral arterial access, there is a subset of patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes this traditional approach to TAVR. Fortunately, innovation in the field of structural heart disease has led to the refinement of alternative access options for THV delivery. Selection of the most appropriate route of therapy mandates a careful consideration of multiple factors, including patient anatomy, technical feasibility, and equipment specifications. Furthermore, understanding the risks conferred by each access site for valve delivery-notably stroke, vascular injury, and major bleeding-is of paramount importance when selecting the approach that will best optimize the outcome for an individual. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of alternative approaches to transfemoral arterial TAVR as well as the available outcome data supporting each of these various techniques.","Young, Michael N; Singh, Vikas; Sakhuja, Rahul",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,846,1

It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies have produced conflicting data regarding seasonal association of TTP diagnoses. This study evaluated the seasonal distribution of acute TTP in southern Louisiana. Additionally, this study timeline overlapped with the initiation of a new screening protocol for ADAMTS13 testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients receiving ADAMTS13 testing at Ochsner Medical Center from January 2010 to December 2017 was performed. TTP patient episodes were defined by ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Episodes were plotted according to season of presentation and a chi-square analysis was performed. Data of identified TTP patients was analyzed to evaluate for confounding variables. ADAMTS13 order volumes and results before and after screening protocol implementation were compared. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-two ADAMTS13 tests were ordered on 245 unique patients. Twenty-five patients had ADAMTS13 activity <10%. No significant differences in seasonal TTP case distribution were identified. Patients with confirmed TTP were younger and more likely to be Black or African American. A screening protocol did not decrease the number of annual ADAMTS13 test orders in our time frame, but was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of positive results. CONCLUSION No significant seasonal distribution of TTP was identified in our population. This analysis provides previously unexamined regional information regarding this diagnosis. The number of tests ordered after the implementation of the screening protocol increased, corresponding with our facility's expanding reach.","Simenson, Victoria; Burton, Jeffrey; Del Toro, Alejandra; Alquist, Caroline Raasch",Journal of clinical apheresis,846,4

This prospective study evaluates the first 200 consecutive SILTEPs performed by a single surgeon. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between November 2011 and September 2015, 200 consecutive SILTEPs were performed in 161 patients. The mean age was 49.8 ± 16.3 years and the mean BMI was 24.5 ± 3.4 kg/m2. The technique involved one 11-mm trocar, one 10-mm 0° scope and curved reusable instruments. A supplementary 1.8-mm straight trocarless grasping forceps was percutaneously inserted for perioperative complications or difficulties. RESULTS A unilateral hernia repair was performed in 122 patients, and a bilateral repair in 39 patients. The total operative time was 57.4 ± 22.3 min, and pure laparoscopic time was 46.6 ± 21.6 min. There was no need for insertion of a supplementary 5-mm trocar, and the need for insertion of 1.8-mm trocarless grasper was 32.9%. Perioperative complications occurred in 73 patients. The mean final scar length was 15.3 ± 2.6 mm. The mean hospital stay was 1.0 ± 0.3 days. Postoperative complications at the access site affected 15 patients and at the hernia site 31 patients. After a mean follow-up of 25.4 ± 12.3 months, there was one asymptomatic, small incisional hernia at the access site as well as one reoperation for recurrent inguinal hernia at 16 months.

There are clear SDOH disparities present in the United States, many of which have been especially evident during the COVID pandemic. SDOH have become a greater focus of payers, including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS has updated the reimbursement structure of Medicare and Medicaid to incentivize more SDOH-related interventions. Providers are also growing increasingly attentive to the SDOH needs of their patients, but often are unable to sufficiently address them outside of care settings. The combination of increased SDOH funding with inefficient mechanisms to meet patients' SDOH needs has led to the emergence of the for-profit SDOH industry. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the industry and identify its size, scope, and future implications. The authors conducted an analysis of for-profit SDOH companies using a third-party industry research platform. A collection of 58 companies was identified with $2.4 billion in funding and a total valuation of over $18.5 billion as of July, 2021. Two literature searches were conducted to support strategy recommendations for critically evaluating SDOH outcomes from these companies, and to determine the downstream effects they will have on community-based organizations also working to improve SDOH.","Goldberg, Zachary N; Nash, David B",Population health management,846,24

This population of patients has a predisposition to diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the improvements of these co-morbidities in a class I obese population that had undergone a bariatric procedure. METHODS After internal review board approval and with adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines, a retrospective review was performed of a prospectively maintained database of 42 class I obese patients who underwent a bariatric procedure at our institution during a 10-year period, from February 2000 to May 2010. The fasting glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin level, lipid profile, initial weight, and BMI were measured in the preoperative and postoperative periods. RESULTS Our patient population consisted of 30 women and 12 men, with a preoperative mean BMI of 33.9 kg/m(2). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in 24 patients (57%), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 8 (19%), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in 10 (24%).

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. OBJECTIVE This article intends to use virtual screening and molecular docking methods to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from existing drugs. METHODS To tack part in the current research investigation to define a potential target drug that may protect the world from emerged pandemic corona disease, we have carried out a virtual screening study by of 129 approved drugs that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating existing infections. Especially 12 drugs against chronic hepatitis B virus, 37 against chronic hepatitis C virus, 37 against human immunodeficiency virus, 14 anti-herpesvirus, 11 anti- influenza, and 18 others drugs currently on the market were considered for this study. Then these drugs were evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking studies in the active site of the (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (6lu7). Once the efficacy of the drug is determined, it can be approved for of their in vitro and in vivo activity against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that could be interesting for rapid clinical treatment of patients. These drugs were ranked for potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and those with high molecular docking scores are proposed as novel candidates for repurposing. The N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6lu7) and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor Lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS The results suggest the effectiveness of Beclabuvir, Nilotinib, Tirilazad, Trametinib and Glecaprevir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its main protease. CONCLUSION These promising drugs could inhibit the replication of the virus; hence, we suggest the repurposing of these compounds for thetreatment of COVID-19. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA. However, the assessment of these potential inhibitors as clinical drugs involves further in vivo tests for these drugs.","Chtita, Samir; Belhassan, Assia; Aouidate, Adnane; Belaidi, Salah; Bouachrine, Mohammed; Lakhlifi, Tahar",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,846,16

(2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9612-9620). T1249, the second generation HIV fusion inhibitor, has both LBD and PBD but a different HR sequence, suggesting that these three anti-HIV peptides may have distinct mechanisms of action. Here we rationally designed a set of peptides that contain multiple copies of a predicted HR sequence (5HR) or the HR sequence plus either LBD (4HR-LBD) or PBD (PBD-4HR) or both (PBD-3HR-LBD), and we compared their anti-HIV-1 activity and biophysical properties. We found that the peptide 5HR exhibited low-to-moderate inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion, whereas addition of LBD and/or PBD to the HR sequence resulted in a significant increase of the anti-HIV-1 activity. The peptides containing PBD, including PBD-4HR and PBD-3HR-LBD, could form a stable six-helix bundle with the N-peptide N46 and effectively blocked the gp41 core formation, whereas the peptides containing LBD, e.g. 4HR-LBD and PBD-3HR-LBD, could interact with the lipid vehicles. These results suggest that the HR sequence in these anti-HIV peptides acts as a structure domain and is responsible for its interaction with the HR sequence in N-terminal heptad repeat, whereas PBD and LBD are critical for interactions with their corresponding targets. T20, C34, and T1249 may function like 4HR-LBD, PBD-4HR, and PBD-3HR-LBD, respectively, to interact with different target sites for inhibiting HIV fusion and entry. Therefore, this study provides important information for understanding the mechanisms of action of the peptic HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and for rational design of novel antiviral peptides against HIV and other viruses with class I fusion proteins.","Qi, Zhi; Shi, Weiguo; Xue, Na; Pan, Chungen; Jing, Weiguo; Liu, Keliang; Jiang, Shibo",The Journal of biological chemistry,846,31

METHODS Annual cross-sectional surveys were conducted at all RCHEs in Hong Kong, including self-administered questionnaires, on-site interviews, inspections, and assessments conducted by trained nurses, from 2005 to 2014. In all, 98.5% to 100% of all RCHEs were surveyed each year based on the list of licensed RCHEs in Hong Kong. RESULTS There was a substantial increase in the proportion of RCHE residents aged ≥85 years, from 40.0% in 2005 to 50.2% in 2014 (P=0.002). The percentage of RCHE residents with special care needs also increased, from 22.3% in 2005 to 32.6% in 2014 for residents with dementia (P<0.001) and from 3.4% in 2005 to 5.0% in 2014 for residents with a long-term indwelling urinary catheter (P<0.001). The proportion of RCHEs with separate rooms for isolation areas ranged from 73.6% to 80% but did not show any significant trend over the study period. The proportion of RCHEs with alcohol hand rub available showed an increasing trend from 25.4% in 2006 to 99.2% in 2014 (P=0.008).

The current TNM stage system is limited due to the heterogeneous clinical outcomes displayed in patients of same stage. Therefore, searching for a novel tool to identify patients at high recurrence-risk for improving post-operative individual management is an urgent need. Methods Using four independent public cohorts and qRT-PCR data from 66 tissues, we developed and validated a recurrence-associated immune signature (RAIS) based on global immune genes. The clinical and molecular features, tumor immune microenvironment landscape, and immune checkpoints profiles of RAIS were also investigated. Results In five independent cohorts, this novel scoring system was proven to be an independent recurrent factor and displayed excellent discrimination and calibration in predicting the recurrence-risk at 1~5 years. Further analysis revealed that the high-risk group displayed high mutation rate of TP53, while the low-risk group had more abundance of activated CD4+/CD8+ T cells and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1. Conclusions The RAIS model is highly predictive of recurrence in patients with stage II/III CRC, which might serve as a powerful tool to further optimize decision-making in adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as tailor surveillance protocol for individual patients.","Liu, Zaoqu; Lu, Taoyuan; Li, Jing; Wang, Libo; Xu, Kaihao; Dang, Qin; Liu, Long; Guo, Chunguang; Jiao, Dechao; Sun, Zhenqiang; Han, Xinwei",Frontiers in immunology,846,27

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's (KSA) health reforms prioritize tackling the increasing noncommunicable disease burden by prioritizing PHC, centering it as the core of the newly proposed Model of Care. To identify challenges and opportunities to scale up PHC capacity, understanding the current capacity of primary health care centers (PHCC) is critical. A limited number of publications review PHC capacity in KSA, focusing on specific regions/sectors; this paper is a first to examine PHC capacity on a national level. METHODS The study uses a countrywide Facility Survey that collected data in 2018 from 2319 PHCCs, generating information on their characteristics, number of health workers, services provided, and capacity elements captured through the Service Availability and Drug Availability constructed indices. Descriptive analysis was performed by rural-urban classification. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions were used to understand correlates to health workers and equipment availability. Finally, a logistic regression was fitted for selected services. Regressions controlled for various measures to determine correlates with facilities' capacity. RESULTS On a national level, there are 0.74 PHCCs per 10,000 population in KSA. There are variations in the distribution of PHCCs across regions and within regions across rural and urban areas. PHCCs in urban areas have more examination rooms but lower examination room densities. Offering 24 × 7 services in PHCCs is infrequent and dependency on paper-based medical recording remains common. More urban regions are more likely to offer general services but less likely to offer burn management and emergency services. PHCCs are mostly staffed with general medicine, family medicine, and obstetrics & gynecology physicians, whose numbers are more concentrated in urban areas; however, their densities are higher in rural areas. Finally, psychiatrists and nutritionists are rare to find in PHCCs. CONCLUSIONS Decision-makers need to consider several factors when designing PHC policies. For instance, PHC accreditation needs to be prioritized given its positive correlation with service provision and health workers availability. PHC 24 × 7 operation also needs considerations in rural areas due to the high dependency on PHCCs. Finally, there is a substantial need for improvements in e-health.","Al Saffer, Quds; Al-Ghaith, Taghred; Alshehri, Ahlam; Al-Mohammed, Rimah; Al Homidi, Shahad; Hamza, Mariam M; Herbst, Christopher H; Alazemi, Nahar",BMC health services research,846,16

We sought to compare the characteristics and survival of patients diagnosed with triple-negative apocrine adenocarcinoma to those of patients diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. Utilizing data from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2013, 70 524 eligible female patients with triple-negative breast cancer were identified including 566 patients with apocrine adenocarcinomas and 69 958 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Descriptive statistics for each variable were reported. A comparison of each covariate between the study cohorts was assessed in univariate and multivariate analysis. Cox proportional models were used to calculate hazard ratios. Additionally, the propensity score matching method was implemented to reduce treatment selection bias. RESULTS Patients with triple-negative apocrine tumors were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and have smaller, moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Multivariable analysis noted a significantly improved survival for patients with triple-negative apocrine carcinoma (TNAC) vs triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma (TNBC) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65 [95% confidence interval [CI] [0.53-0.81], P = 0 < .001). Propensity score matching analysis confirmed a significant difference in overall survival for patients with TNAC in comparison to TNBC (HR 0.79 [95% CI [0.63-1.00], P = .05).

One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface epithelium and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively. In the CT the two separate precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells provide some 'autonomy' for the GALT.","Farsang, Attila; Bódi, Ildikó; Fölker, Orsolya; Minkó, Krisztina; Benyeda, Zsófia; Bálint, Ádám; Oláh, Imre",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,846,16

Based on the analyzed literature data, we considered a possible pathophysiological mechanism of action of NO and its derivatives in COVID-19. It can be noted that hyperimmune systemic inflammation and ""cytokine storm"" are enhanced by the production of NO, products of its oxidation (""nitrosative stress""). It is noted in the work that as a result of the oxidation of NO, a large amount of the toxic compound peroxynitrite is formed, which is a powerful proinflammatory agent. Its presence significantly damages the endothelium of the vascular walls and also oxidizes lipids, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome, binds SH-groups of proteins, and damages DNA in the target cells. This is confirmed by the picture of the vessels of the lungs on computed tomography and the data of biochemical studies. In case of peroxynitrite overproduction, inhibition of the synthesis of NO and its metabolic products seems to be justified. Another aspect considered in this work is the mechanism of damage by the virus to the central and peripheral nervous system, which remains poorly understood but may be important in understanding the consequences, as well as predicting brain functions in persons who have undergone COVID-19. According to the analyzed literature, it can be concluded that brain damage is possible due to the direct effect of the virus on the peripheral nerves and central structures, and indirectly through the effect on the endothelium of cerebral vessels. Disturbances in the central nervous regulation of immune responses may be associated with the insufficient function of the acetylcholine anti-inflammatory system. It is proposed to further study several approaches to influence various links of NO exchange, which are of interest for theoretical and practical medicine.","Lysenkov, Sergey Petrovich; Muzhenya, Dmitriy Vitalevich; Tuguz, Aminat Ramazanovna; Urakova, Tamara Ur'evna; Shumilov, Dmitriy Sergeevich; Thakushinov, Ibragim Askarbievich",The Chinese journal of physiology,846,11

Because tegafur-uracil is effective on cancers with LVI, we conducted a multi-center single-arm phase II study to estimate the efficacy of adjuvant tegafur-uracil in patients with LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC. METHODS Patients with completely resected LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC were registered. LVI was diagnosed by consensus of two of three pathologists. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 2 years of oral tegafur-uracil at 250 mg/m2/day. Fifty-five patients from 7 institutions were enrolled from June 2007 to September 2012. RESULTS Among the 52 eligible patients, 36 (69.2%) completed the treatment course. There were 39 male and 13 female patients. The observation period was calculated as 562 to 3107 days using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. The 5-year overall and relapse free survival rates were 94.2 and 88.5% respectively, which were significantly better than that of any other studies conducted on patients with LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC. Notably, the overall survival rate was 15% better than that of our prior retrospective study. The retrospective analysis of stage IA NSCLC patients who had received an operation in the same period revealed that the 5-year overall survival rate of the LVI positive group was 73.6% when adjuvant chemotherapy was not applied. Among 55 safety analysis sets, 4 cases of grade 3 hepatic function disorder (9.1%) and 5 cases of grade 2 anorexia (10.9%) were most frequently observed. No grade 4 adverse effects were encountered. CONCLUSION A 2-year course of oral tegafur-uracil administration is feasible and might have a significant benefit in the adjuvant treatment of LVI-positive stage IA NSCLC.

METHODS ASV was compared to a fixed tidal volume of 6 ml/kg. ASV determined the respiratory rate and tidal volume based on its algorithms. Maximum airway pressure limit was 28 cm H2O in ASV. Six sets of lung mechanics were simulated for two ideal body weights: 60 kg, Group I; 80 kg, Group II. Positive end expiratory pressure was 8, 12, and 16 cm H2O, and target minute volume 120%, 150%, and 200% of predicted minute volume. RESULTS ASV ""sacrificed"" tidal volume and minute ventilation to maintain PP in 9 (17%) of 54 scenarios in Group I and 20 (37%) of 54 scenarios in Group II. In Group I, the number of scenarios with PP of 28 cm H2O or more was 14 for ASV (26%) and 19 for 6 ml/kg (35%). In these scenarios, mean PP were ASV 28.8 +/- 0.86 cm H2O (min 28, max 30.3) and 6 ml/kg 33.01 +/- 3.48 cm H2O (min 28, max 37.8) (P = 0.000).

We compared the outcomes among patients with permanent stenting and those without stenting after stentriever failure. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 208 patients who underwent stentriever thrombectomy for anterior circulation large artery occlusion between September 2010 and September 2015. Modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 recanalization was achieved with stentriever alone or in combination with Penumbra device in 155 patients (74.5%). An additional 8 patients (3.8%) obtained modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 with urokinase or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion. Of the remaining 45 patients (21.6%), 17 underwent stenting (stenting group; mean age, 68 years), whereas 28 did not undergo stenting (nonstenting group; mean age, 72 years). The rate of modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 in stenting group was assessed, and clinical outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS There were no differences in clinical and laboratory findings, initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, location of anterior circulation large artery occlusion, and onset-to-puncture time between groups. Modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 was achieved in 14 members (83.3%) of the stenting group. Stenting group had more favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 35.3%) and less cerebral herniation (11.8%) than nonstenting group (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 7.1%; cerebral herniation, 42.9%; P<0.05 for both).

The resolution response to this chronic inflammation is an active process governed by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like the lipid mediators known as lipoxins. The biosynthesis of lipoxins is catalyzed by several lipoxygenases (LOXs) from arachidonic acid. However, the molecular details of the mechanisms involved are not well known yet. In this paper, we have combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to analyze how reticulocyte 15-LOX-1 catalyzes the production of lipoxins from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE. Our results indicate that the dehydration mechanism from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE, via the formation of an epoxide, presents huge energy barriers even though it was one of the two a priori synthetic proposals. This result is compatible with the fact that no epoxide has been directly detected as an intermediate in the catalytic formation of lipoxins from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE. Conversely, the oxygenation of 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE at C14 is feasible because there is an open channel connecting the protein surface with this carbon atom, and the energy barrier for oxygen addition through this channel is small. The analysis of the following steps of this mechanism, leading to the corresponding hydroperoxide at the 15-LOX-1 active site, indicates that the oxygenation mechanism will lead to the formation of lipoxinB4 after the final action of a reductase. In contrast, our calculations are in agreement with experiments that lipoxinA4 cannot derive from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE by either of the two proposed mechanisms and that 5(S),15(S)-diHETE is not an intermediate of lipoxin biosynthesis catalyzed by 15-LOX-1.","Cruz, Alejandro; González-Lafont, Àngels; Lluch, José M",The journal of physical chemistry.

However, flavone synthase (FNS), the key enzyme responsible for flavone biosynthesis, has not yet been characterized in Lonicera species. In this study, FNSII genes were identified from Lonicera japonica Thunb. and L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. In the presence of NADPH, the recombinant cytochrome P450 proteins encoded by LjFNSII-1.1, LjFNSII-2.1, and LmFNSII-1.1 converted eriodictyol, naringenin, and liquiritigenin to the corresponding flavones directly. The different catalytic properties between LjFNSII-2.1 and LjFNSII-1.1 were caused by a single amino acid substitution at position 242 (glutamic acid to lysine). A methionine at position 206 and a leucine at position 381 contributed considerably to the high catalytic activity of LjFNSII-1.1. In addition, LjFNSII-1.1&2.1 and LmFNSII-1.1 also biosynthesize flavones that were further modified by O-glycosylation in transgenic tobacco. The expression levels of the FNSII genes were consistent with flavone accumulation patterns in flower buds.

This property lends itself to application in endovascular medical devices. Peripheral vasculature embolisation devices incorporating this novel technology have become commercially available and this case series, where the data were collected as part of a post market registry, outlines initial clinical experience with these novel devices. RESULTS Eight cases are described in this series. The disease state/conditions for which embolisation was indicated were right common iliac artery aneurysms (n = 3), a type II endoleak into the thoracic aorta following thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 1), a left inferior gluteal artery aneurysm (n = 1), left internal iliac artery aneurysms (n = 2), and a case of splenomegaly, where splenectomy was planned after the embolisation procedure (n = 1). Target arteries were 5-10 mm in diameter. In each case, at least one IMPEDE Embolization Plug (IMP-Device) of an appropriate diameter was used. All procedures were technically successful and target vessel thrombosis was achieved in all cases. Follow-up imaging available during the 45-90-day data collection timeframe showed sustained vessel occlusion. This case series includes examples of situations commonly encountered when embolising the peripheral vasculature, namely, the use of one or multiple devices in a single vessel and in combination with the use of other embolic devices (e.g., microcoils, gelatin sponge, and PVA particles) in the same case. There were no adverse events related to the specific use of the device. CONCLUSIONS This small series illustrates the safety and efficacy of this novel sponge-based embolic device for the embolisation of small and medium sized arteries and further experience will demonstrate the utility of the shape memory polymer devices.","Morgan, Robert A; Loftus, Ian; Ratnam, Lakshmi; Das, Raj; Mailli, Leto; Hamady, Mohamad S; Lobotesis, Kyriakos",CVIR endovascular,846,12

Early stabilization of hemodynamics is associated with improved outcome. The monitoring used to guide hemodynamic support may influence the time needed to achieve stable hemodynamics. Visualization of the heart using echocardiography offers the advantage of direct measurement of cardiac volumes and ventricular function. A miniaturized monoplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was developed, allowing for almost continuous qualitative hemodynamic TEE assessment (hTEE) after brief bedside training. The primary objective of the study is to assess whether hemodynamic monitoring using the hTEE technology shortens time to resolution of shock in ICU patients in comparison to standard monitoring using a central venous catheter, pulmonary artery catheter, or conventional echocardiography. METHODS Five hundred consecutive subjects with circulatory shock (low mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and signs of organ hypoperfusion) at the time of ICU admission are included in the study. The subjects are randomly assigned to one of four groups using a 2 × 2 factorial design stratified by method of hemodynamic monitoring (hTEE vs standard hemodynamic monitoring) and frequency of hemodynamic assessments (minimum every 4 h vs standard of care). The primary study outcome is the time from study inclusion to resolution of circulatory shock, defined as MAP > 60 mmHg for ≥ 4 h after discontinuation of vasopressors and inotropes. The hTEE monitoring consists of the acquisition of three defined echocardiography views: Transgastric mid-esophageal short axis with measurement of fractional area change of left ventricle, mid-esophageal four-chamber view with measurement of the ratio of right to left ventricular area, and mid-esophageal ascending aortic short-axis view with measurement of the superior vena cava collapsibility index. In the control groups, monitoring modalities, including conventional TTE and TEE but not hTEE, are at the discretion of the treating physician. The interpretation of hemodynamic monitoring and the subsequent changes in patient management are recorded after each hemodynamic assessment. Differences in the primary and further secondary time-to-event outcomes will be assessed using a competing risk model accounting for the competing risk of death. DISCUSSION The effect of using echocardiography as a monitoring modality on relevant patient outcomes has not been established so far. The study at hand may be one of the first trials to provide detailed data on effectiveness and safety of echocardiography to guide treatment in patients with circulatory shock.

Nasal/nasopharyngeal samples were tested in duplicate using antigen-based rapid influenza testing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses. Monthly proportion positive was calculated for each virus. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify associations between sociodemographic/clinical information and viral detection. Of 571 subjects, most (470, 82.3%) were ≥ 5 years of age and 53.1% were male. A respiratory virus was detected by PCR in 63.6% (N = 363). Common viral etiologies included influenza (223, 39%), human enterovirus/rhinovirus (HEV/HRV, 14.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 4.2%), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 3.9%). Both ILI and influenza showed clear seasonal variation, with peaks from March to June each year. RSV and hMPV activity peaked from May to July, whereas HEV/HRV was seen year-round. Patients with respiratory viruses detected were more likely to report pain with breathing (odds ratio [OR] = 2.60, P = 0.003), anorexia (OR = 2.29, P < 0.001), and fatigue (OR = 2.00, P = 0.002) compared with patients with no respiratory viruses detected.

Major and significant disorders, that is, never observed in healthy subjects, are achalasia, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, distal esophageal spasm, absent peristalsis, and hypercontractile (Jackhammer) esophagus. Achalasia subtyping is relevant to predict the response to endoscopic and surgical therapies as several studies suggest that, pneumatic dilation is less effective than Heller myotomy, in type III achalasia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy, initially developed in expert centers, is a promising technique for the treatment of achalasia. The medical therapeutic options for distal esophageal spasm and hypercontractile esophagus are smooth muscle relaxants and pain modulators. Intraesophageal injection of botulinum toxin might be an interesting option for treatment of these disorders but further studies are required to determine the optimal injection protocol and the best candidates based on manometric patterns.

BAG3 carries a BAG domain, a WW domain, and a proline-rich repeat (PXXP), all of which mediate binding to different partners. To elucidate BAG3's interaction network at the molecular level, we employed quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knockdown and human proteome microarrays to comprehensively profile the BAG3 interactome in humans. We identified a total of 382 BAG3-interacting proteins with diverse functions, including transferase activity, nucleic acid binding, transcription factors, proteases, and chaperones, suggesting that BAG3 is a critical regulator of diverse cellular functions. In addition, we characterized interactions between BAG3 and some of its newly identified partners in greater detail. In particular, bioinformatic analysis revealed that the BAG3 interactome is strongly enriched in proteins functioning within the proteasome-ubiquitination process and that compose the proteasome complex itself, suggesting that a critical biological function of BAG3 is associated with the proteasome. Functional studies demonstrated that BAG3 indeed interacts with the proteasome and modulates its activity, sustaining cell survival and underlying resistance to therapy through the down-modulation of apoptosis. Taken as a whole, this study expands our knowledge of the BAG3 interactome, provides a valuable resource for understanding how BAG3 affects different cellular functions, and demonstrates that biologically relevant data can be harvested using this kind of integrated approach.","Chen, Ying; Yang, Li-Na; Cheng, Li; Tu, Shun; Guo, Shu-Juan; Le, Huang-Ying; Xiong, Qian; Mo, Ran; Li, Chong-Yang; Jeong, Jun-Seop; Jiang, Lizhi; Blackshaw, Seth; Bi, Li-Jun; Zhu, Heng; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Ge, Feng",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,846,1

The mechanisms for this relationship may include having high levels of motivation to get food (reinforcing value of food; RRV) and low levels of inhibitory control (delay discounting; DD) which, when combined, is referred to as reinforcement pathology (RP). We sought to examine the relationships among multiple measures of household SES, RP, and age-adjusted body mass index (zBMI) among adolescents. METHODS These data were collected as part of ongoing longitudinal study of risk factors for obesity in 244 adolescents. The adolescents and one parent/guardian had height and weight measured and completed surveys. The adolescents completed an adjusting amount DD task and a computer-based RRV task. Analyses consisted of correlations among measures of SES and RRV, DD, and BMI z-scores. In the case of significant associations, multiple regression models were created with theoretically informed covariates. RESULTS Household income, parent/guardian education, parent/guardian occupation, and food insecurity status were all related to one another. Among the adolescents, a significant portion of the variance in RRV was accounted for by household income after controlling for covariates. For DD, it was parent/guardian education that was most associated after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSION When low income and low parent/guardian education occur together, there may be an increased risk of RP. Separately, food insecurity was predictive of higher parent/guardian BMI. Future research should continue to explore the effects of low income and parent/guardian education on RP among youth by examining them over time.","Crandall, Amanda K; Ziegler, Amanda M; Mansouri, Tegan; Matteson, Jalen; Isenhart, Emily; Carter, Autum; Balantekin, Katherine N; Temple, Jennifer L",BMC public health,846,4

METHODS Key annual meeting metrics were collected retrospectively for 2020 virtual meeting and compared with the most recent in-person annual meeting cohort from 2019. Metrics collected included attendance by ophthalmology specialist, geographic distribution of attendees, postevent survey rate, and social media engagement (Twitter). RESULTS Overall, there was a 7% (n = 60) increase in the number of registrants between 2019 and 2020. The largest change noted was the increase in registrants from British Columbia (n = 78). More ophthalmologists registered for the 2020 meeting than for 2019 meeting (627 versus 592). Of those who registered for the meeting, meeting participation (defined as checking in for the 2019 and logging in for the 2020 meetings) increased from 70% in 2019 to 79% in 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood. Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=462 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected ≥28 days post symptom onset, 0/494 (0%, 95%CI 0-0.7%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.","Andersson, Monique I; Arancibia-Carcamo, Carolina V; Auckland, Kathryn; Baillie, J Kenneth; Barnes, Eleanor; Beneke, Tom; Bibi, Sagida; Brooks, Tim; Carroll, Miles; Crook, Derrick; Dingle, Kate; Dold, Christina; Downs, Louise O; Dunn, Laura; Eyre, David W; Gilbert Jaramillo, Javier; Harvala, Heli; Hoosdally, Sarah; Ijaz, Samreen; James, Tim; James, William; Jeffery, Katie; Justice, Anita; Klenerman, Paul; Knight, Julian C; Knight, Michael; Liu, Xu; Lumley, Sheila F; Matthews, Philippa C; McNaughton, Anna L; Mentzer, Alexander J; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Oakley, Sarah; Oliveira, Marta S; Peto, Timothy; Ploeg, Rutger J; Ratcliff, Jeremy; Robbins, Melanie J; Roberts, David J; Rudkin, Justine; Russell, Rebecca A; Screaton, Gavin; Semple, Malcolm G; Skelly, Donal; Simmonds, Peter; Stoesser, Nicole; Turtle, Lance; Wareing, Susan; Zambon, Maria",Wellcome open research,846,31

This included omitted fever peaks and circadian and complexity characteristics that may correlate with specific aetiologies. DESIGN Ours was a prospective, observational study. A total of 62 patients, admitted to a general internal medicine ward, in whom a temperature > 38 °C had been observed the day before inclusion underwent a 24-h long continuous monitoring of both central and peripheral temperatures. The time series were recorded in a file, while they otherwise followed conventional care. Time series were analysed for standard statistics, chronobiological analysis (amplitude, mesor, acrophase, intra-daily variability) and complexity analysis (Approximate Entropy of both central and peripheral temperature, cross-ApEn). A month after discharge, the clinical reports were reviewed and a definitive diagnosis of the febrile syndrome was established. RESULTS A total of 62 patients were initially included. In six cases, no time series could be obtained because of technical problems, leaving 56 patients accessible for analysis. In 10 cases, no definitive diagnosis was established. Continuous monitoring detected a mean of 0.7 (CI = 0.27-1.33) peaks of fever (central temperature > 38.0 °C) unobserved by conventional care per patient. A proportion of 16% (CI = 6-26) of patients considered afebrile by conventional care had at least one fever peak detected by continuous monitoring. Circadian rhythm persisted or was exacerbated in febrile patients. Circadian amplitude was increased in patients with tuberculosis. Complexity analysis did not differ among different diagnostic groups, although in subgroup analysis, viral infections had a higher complexity than other infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS Temperature Holter monitoring reveals fever peaks that pass otherwise unobserved. Furthermore, chronobiological and complexity analysis of the temperature profile may provide quick and easy 'hidden information', not available to conventional care.","Varela, M; Ruiz-Esteban, R; Martinez-Nicolas, A; Cuervo-Arango, J A; Barros, C; Delgado, E G",International journal of clinical practice,846,5

While frameworks for developing guidelines express the need for those potentially affected by guideline recommendations to be involved in their development, there is a lack of consensus on how this should be done in practice. Further, there is a lack of guidance on how to equitably and meaningfully engage multiple stakeholders. We aim to develop guidance for the meaningful and equitable engagement of multiple stakeholders in guideline development and implementation. METHODS This will be a multi-stage project. The first stage is to conduct a series of four systematic reviews. These will (1) describe existing guidance and methods for stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation, (2) characterize barriers and facilitators to stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation, (3) explore the impact of stakeholder engagement on guideline development and implementation, and (4) identify issues related to conflicts of interest when engaging multiple stakeholders in guideline development and implementation. DISCUSSION We will collaborate with our multiple and diverse stakeholders to develop guidance for multi-stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation. We will use the results of the systematic reviews to develop a candidate list of draft guidance recommendations and will seek broad feedback on the draft guidance via an online survey of guideline developers and external stakeholders. An invited group of representatives from all stakeholder groups will discuss the results of the survey at a consensus meeting which will inform the development of the final guidance papers. Our overall goal is to improve the development of guidelines through meaningful and equitable multi-stakeholder engagement, and subsequently to improve health outcomes and reduce inequities in health.","Petkovic, Jennifer; Riddle, Alison; Akl, Elie A; Khabsa, Joanne; Lytvyn, Lyubov; Atwere, Pearl; Campbell, Pauline; Chalkidou, Kalipso; Chang, Stephanie M; Crowe, Sally; Dans, Leonila; Jardali, Fadi El; Ghersi, Davina; Graham, Ian D; Grant, Sean; Greer-Smith, Regina; Guise, Jeanne-Marie; Hazlewood, Glen; Jull, Janet; Katikireddi, S Vittal; Langlois, Etienne V; Lyddiatt, Anne; Maxwell, Lara; Morley, Richard; Mustafa, Reem A; Nonino, Francesco; Pardo, Jordi Pardo; Pollock, Alex; Pottie, Kevin; Riva, John; Schünemann, Holger; Simeon, Rosiane; Smith, Maureen; Stein, Airton T; Synnot, Anneliese; Tufte, Janice; White, Howard; Welch, Vivian; Concannon, Thomas W; Tugwell, Peter",Systematic reviews,846,0

Insomnia symptoms often manifest as a result of acute life stressors or changes, and COVID-19 experiences may be one such stressor. Other known predisposing factors to insomnia may moderate the impact of COVID-19 experiences on sleep. The present study aimed to determine current levels of insomnia severity in a US sample, to investigate the relation of COVID-19 experiences to insomnia symptoms, and to determine which individuals are most susceptible to this association. METHODS Data were drawn from a larger online survey investigating sleep and health outcomes across the lifespan. COVID-19 experiences were assessed with the exposure and impact subscales of the CAIR Pandemic Impact Questionnaire (C-PIQ). The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measured insomnia symptoms. Biological, psychological, and social moderators were measured using other brief self-report measures. RESULTS Insomnia symptoms prevalence was as follows: moderate-to-severe symptoms (25.5%), subthreshold symptoms (37.7%), and no symptoms (36.7%). Individuals' COVID-19 experiences significantly predicted insomnia symptom severity [F(1,997) = 472.92, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.32]. This association was moderated by race, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, physical somatization, and social loneliness, but not age, gender, or education. CONCLUSIONS Although negative experiences with COVID-19 are associated with worse insomnia symptoms, this relationship is not the same for everyone.","Dzierzewski, Joseph M; Dautovich, Natalie D; Ravyts, Scott G; Perez, Elliottnell; Soto, Pablo; Donovan, Emily K",Sleep medicine,846,17

We hypothesized that a region-specific effect might participate in this heterogeneity. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of alcohol dose on hypertension incidence using contemporary data through December 2017. Subjects were categorized according to their level of alcohol consumption as non-drinkers (reference) and low- (0.01 to 20.0 g/day), moderate- (20.1 to 40.0 g/day), moderate- to high- (40.1 to 60.0 g/day), and high-dose (> 60.0 g/day) drinkers. We defined hypertension as a blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg and/or the use of anti- hypertensive drugs. Results In total, 11 articles (seven Asian and four Western) were selected for our analysis. Among Asian men, a significantly elevated risk was observed even in the low alcohol dose group in comparison with the group with no alcohol consumption, and the risk increased in a dose-dependent manner (pooled relative risks [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 1.25 [1.13 to 1.38], 1.48 [1.27 to 1.72], 1.75 [1.43 to 2.15], and 1.78 [1.51 to 2.09]). Among Western men, a similar dose-response relationship was noted in general (p for subgroup difference > 0.1), but a significantly elevated risk was evident only in the high-dose group (pooled relative risks [95% CI]: 1.22 [0.85 to 1.74], 1.57 [0.90 to 2.75], 1.47 [0.44 to 4.91], and 1.49 [1.02 to 2.18]). Conclusions Even low doses of alcohol can lead to the development of hypertension, particularly in Asian men.

METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data before and after RYGB, when available, and before and after LAGB was performed at the New York Langone University Hospital (New York, NY). The data collected included weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, race, age, operative time, length of stay, postoperative complications, and the percentage of excess weight loss. RESULTS A total of 43 patients (9 men and 34 women) underwent LAGB after weight loss failure with RYGB. Of the 43 patients, 27 patients had undergone RYGB at other institutions, and preoperative RYGB data were available for 23 total patients. The average interval to LAGB was 6.6 years. The mean BMI before RYGB was 50.4 kg/m(2) and before LAGB was 43.3 kg/m(2) (%EWL was 17% after RYGB). At follow-up after LAGB, the average BMI was 35.2 kg/m(2), with a %EWL of 38% (calculated from LAGB only) at 26 months (range 6-66).

In the conventional Glissonean approach from the liver hilum, the tertiary portal pedicles may be difficult to dissect because of their anatomical variations and deep location. We present a technique of purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy of the liver using the transfissural Glissonean approach. METHODS We performed purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. This approach involved initially opening the liver parenchyma along the fissure line (main portal, right portal, and umbilical fissures). Thereafter, the target tertiary portal pedicles were approached and ligated within the liver parenchyma above the liver hilum. RESULTS Between August 2014 and September 2019, we performed 17 cases of laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. The median operative time was 200 min (range 120-310 min), and the intraoperative blood loss was 80 mL (range 30-280 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range 3-9 days). There was no major morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION The transfissural Glissonean approach in laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy is technically feasible because opening the fissure allows direct access to the tertiary portal pedicles.","Kim, Ji Hoon",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,846,7

Due to the sparsity and noise present in such single-cell gene expression data, analyzing various functions related to the inference of gene regulatory networks, derived from single-cell data, remains difficult, thereby posing a barrier to the deepening of understanding of cellular metabolism. Since recent studies have led to the reliable inference of single-cell gene regulatory networks (SCGRNs), the challenge of discriminating between SCGRNs has now arisen. By accurately discriminating between SCGRNs (e.g., distinguishing SCGRNs of healthy pancreas from those of T2D pancreas), biologists would be able to annotate, organize, visualize, and identify common patterns of SCGRNs for metabolic diseases. Such annotated SCGRNs could play an important role in speeding up the process of building large data repositories. In this study, we aimed to contribute to the development of a novel deep learning (DL) application. First, we generated a dataset consisting of 224 SCGRNs belonging to both T2D and healthy pancreas and made it freely available. Next, we chose seven DL architectures, including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169, trained each of them on the dataset, and checked prediction based on a test set. We evaluated the DL architectures on an HP workstation platform with a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU.

Cancer is a reported risk factor for worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical syndrome COVID-19. However, risk associated with specific cancer subtypes, extent of disease, and treatment history remains unclear. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is treated with multiple modalities that may affect COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including surgery, radiation (RT), hormone therapy (HT), and chemotherapy (CT). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and history of breast cancer at two academic centers in Los Angeles, CA between January - September, 2020. Demographic information, cancer diagnosis, treatment history, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were reviewed. The primary outcome was rate of hospitalization for COVID-19. Associations were evaluated for significance by chi-square test or Student's T test, with a = 0.05. Results: Our cohort included 61 patients with history of breast cancer. 19 (31.1%) required hospitalization and 3 (4.9%) died from COVID19. Median age was 61 years. 44% of patients were White/Caucasian, 37.7% Hispanic/Latinx, 8% Black/African American, 5% Asian, and 5% were of another race. 87% of patients had local or regional disease and 13% had distant metastases. 53% of patients had ever received CT historically, 66% HT, and 53% RT. 25% of patients received cancer treatment (surgery, CT, or RT) within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. 38% were on HT at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with prior RT were more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than those with no prior RT (44% vs 14%, p = 0.02), as were patients with 2 or more comorbidities (p = 0.01). In addition, there was a trend toward lower hospitalization rates for patients on HT [24% vs. 42% (p = 0.17)] and a trend toward higher hospitalization rate for non-white ethnicity [35% vs. 25% (p = ns)]. Extent of disease, history of CT, or receipt of any cancer treatment (e.g. surgery, RT, CT) within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated with hospitalization rate. Conclusions: In our diverse cohort of breast cancer patients with COVID-19 a history of RT and presence of multiple comorbidities were both associated with increased risk of hospitalization, while a history of HT was not. Further investigation is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts. These findings may inform recommendations for breast cancer patients during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Kathuria-Prakash, N.; Antrim, L.; Sun, A.

In this work, we computationally studied how RDV-TP binds and inserts to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site, in comparison with natural nucleotide substrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). To do that, we first constructed atomic structural models of an initial binding complex (active site open) and a substrate insertion complex (active site closed), based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures determined recently for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp or non-structural protein (nsp) 12, in complex with accessory protein factors nsp7 and nsp8. By conducting all-atom molecular dynamics simulation with umbrella sampling strategies on the nucleotide insertion between the open and closed state RdRp complexes, our studies show that RDV-TP can bind comparatively stabilized to the viral RdRp active site, as it primarily forms base stacking with the template Uracil nucleotide (at +1), which is under freely fluctuations and supports a low free energy barrier of the RDV-TP insertion (∼ 1.5 kcal/mol). In comparison, the barrier (∼ 2.6 kcal/mol), when the fluctuations of the template nt are well quenched. The simulations also show that the initial base stacking of RDV-TP with the template can be particularly stabilized by motif B-N691, S682, and motif F-K500 with the sugar, base, and the template backbone, respectively. Although the RDV-TP insertion can be hindered by motif-F R555/R553 interaction with the triphosphate, the ATP insertion seems to be facilitated by such interactions. The inserted RDV-TP and ATP can be further distinguished by specific sugar interaction with motif B-T687 and motif-A D623, respectively.","Romero, Moises Ernesto; Long, Chunhong; Rocco, Daniel La; Keerthi, Anusha Mysore; Xu, Dajun; Yu, Jin",bioRxiv,846,33

With an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases, it is important to detect and diagnose COVID-19 in its early stages to prevent its spread. To diagnose remote patients, the Internet can be useful for accessing data of that patient. But, the Internet has also had issues related to data security, reliability, and privacy. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain (BC) based COVID-19 detection scheme (BCovX) for fast and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. For fast and accurate detection of COVID-19 using CXR, BCovX consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using which a patient can be diagnosed for COVID-19 remotely. CNNs have performed successfully in medical imaging classification. BCovX provides reliable and secure data access and exchange using BC and smart contracts (SC). To solve issues related to data storage and its associated cost, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol is used to store medical data. We also present a real-time SC developed in Solidity to govern the transaction between the patient and the doctor. The SC has been compiled and deployed on Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Finally, we have evaluated the performance of BCovX with traditional schemes in terms of storage cost, bandwidth requirements, and accuracy of the CNN model. © 2021 IEEE.","Shukla, A.; Ramdasani, U.; Vinzuda, G.; Obaidat, M.

The author theorises that the sovereign rating of Poland does not constitute the upper limit for ratings granted by the Big Three (Fitch Ratings, Moody's and Standard & Poor's) to Polish financial and non-financial entities. The databases of three leading rating agencies were queried, selecting all (52) long-term foreign ratings assigned to entities registered in Poland. The analysis indicates that currently no confirmation can be found of the use of the country ceiling principle, according to which the rating of any entity registered in a given country cannot be higher than its sovereign rating, by rating agencies (7.7% of rated entities in Poland is given higher rating than the sovereign one). This is at the same time a higher percentage than the average for all Big Three ratings, amounting to approx. 3%. The country ceiling is an upper, potential sovereign rating bound, resulting from the T&C risk. In the case of entities registered in Poland, however, their rating is a maximum of one notch higher than the sovereign rating, which in turn is in line with the policy that Standard & Poor's officially announced as the only agency among the Big Three (the rating of an entity registered in a given jurisdiction can be up to four notches higher than the sovereign rating). The analysis of ratings assigned to Polish entities also indicates that a rating above the sovereign rating awarded by a given credit rating agency does not translate into similar actions of other agencies. This paper analyses the re- lationships between the concepts of country risk, T&C risk and sovereign risk. Another original contribution is establishing how the country ceiling principle used by rating agencies works in practice and verifying the scope of application of this principle in the Polish economic reality.Alternate abstract:Streszczenie: Celem artykułu jest udzielenie odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy ratingi podmiotów zarejestrowanych w Polsce są ograniczone przez rating suwerenny tego kraju. Autor zakłada, że rating suwerenny Polski nie określa górnej granicy ocen przyznawanych przez Wielką Trójkę (Fitch Ratings, Moody's i Standard & Poor's) finansowym i niefinansowym podmiotom polskim. Przeprowadzono kwerendę baz danych trzech głównych agencji ratingowych, wybierając wszystkie (52) długoterminowe ratingi zagraniczne przypisane do podmiotów zarejestrowanych w Polsce. Z analizy wynika, że obecnie nie znajduje potwierdzenia zasada pułapu krajowego, zgodnie z którą rating każdego podmiotu zarejestrowanego w danym kraju nie może być wyższy od ratingu suwerennego (w Polsce 7,7% ocenianych podmiotów otrzymuje wyższy rating niż państwo). Jest to jednocześnie wyższa wartość niż średnia dla wszystkich ocen dokonywanych przez Wielką Trójkę, która wynosi około 3%. Pułap krajowy to górna, potencjalna granica ratingu suwerennego, wynikająca z ryzyka T&C, choć w przypadku podmiotów zarejestrowanych w Polsce ich rating jest maksymalnie o jeden stopień wyższy od ratingu suwerennego, co z kolei jest zgodne z polityką Standard & Poor's - jedynej agencji spośród Wielkiej Trójki, prezentującej oficjalne stanowisko w tej kwestii (rating podmiotu zarejestrowanego w danej jurysdykcji jest do czterech stopni wyższy od ratingu tego kraju). Analiza ratingów przyznanych polskim podmiotom wskazuje również, że przyznawana przez daną agencję ratingową ocena powyżej ratingu państwa nie przekłada się na podobne działania innych agencji. W niniejszym artykule przedstawiono relacje między pojęciami ryzyka kraju, ryzyka transferu i wymienialności oraz ratingu suwerennego.

From the perspective of the labor force, employee’s job satisfaction, personal well-being and life satisfaction can change the labor market. Studies report that there were significant social and economic changes occurring in European countries, including Hungary. These social and economic changes significantly shaped individual and group value choice and other aspects of a quality life. This study presents a comparative analysis of job satisfaction and work-related attitudes between Hungary and other international nations. While the study was in progress, the COVID-19 epidemic reached Hungary. As a result of COVID-19, new forms of employment developed. The most significant change was the working from home phenomenon. This new system of working significantly transformed the domestic and EU employment opportunities. Also, employee’s satisfaction was affected by their working conditions. The study’s data analysis aims to identify the underlying emerging trends which will be explored in a future study. According to the results of this research study, the author found that there is a relationship between job satisfaction and a worker’s attitude among Hungarian employees.

To assess the disease severity, an intensive roving survey was conducted during the 2019 cropping season. Based on the morphological characterization, the causal agent of leaf blight disease was identified as Bipolaris spp. Further sequencing and combined gene analysis of ITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase) and LSU (large subunit) of all the nine isolates confirmed the pathogen as B. setariae. Pathogenicity study showed that all the isolates were pathogenic and caused leaf blight symptoms on browntop millet. The B. setariae isolates showed marked variability with respect to disease incidence on browntop millet (cv. Dundu korale) under artificial inoculation conditions. However, the host range was limited only to browntop millet and found non‐pathogenic to other six small millets examined.

An effective vaccine to cure this virus is not yet available, thus requires concerted efforts at various scales. In this study, we employed Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) based approach to identify the drug-like compounds - inhibiting the replication of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Our database search using an online tool ""ZINC pharmer"" retrieved ~1500 compounds based on pharmacophore features. Lipinski's rule was applied to further evaluate the drug-like compounds, followed by molecular docking-based screening, and the selection of screening ligand complex with Mpro based on S-score (higher than reference inhibitor) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value (less than reference inhibitor) using AutoDock 4.2. Resultantly, ~200 compounds were identified having strong interaction with Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. After evaluating their binding energy using the AutoDock 4.2 software, three compounds (ZINC20291569, ZINC90403206, ZINC95480156) were identified that showed highest binding energy with Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and strong inhibition effect than the N3 (reference inhibitor). A good binding energy, drug likeness and effective pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that these candidates have greater potential to stop the replication of SARS-CoV-2, hence might lead to the cure of COVID-19.","Haider, Zeshan; Subhani, Muhammad Muneeb; Farooq, Muhammad Ansar; Ishaq, Maryum; Khalid, Maryam; Akram, Muhammad Numan; Khan, Rao Sohail Ahmad; Niazi, Adnan Khan",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,846,16

Microarray data, gene sequences and clinical data are more and more perceived as different but related facets of one entity. Significant work is done in the area of text and data mining in order to bring together patient data and biochemical phenomena by means of ontologies. A strong trend in the clinical field is performance of exhaustive studies on DNA material derived from patients that suffer from diseases that are already known to be inherited. Examination of appropriate methods covers data and text mining, ontologies as well as machine learning and classification. CONCLUSIONS The best paper selection of articles on bioinformatics shows examples of excellent research on methods used for studying inherited diseases and their underlying genetic dispositions. Clinical studies, inclusion of experimental findings like microarray data, and of knowledge representation formats all lead to a better understanding the linkage between gene sequences, biological functions and clinical findings in the form of healthy state or physiological disorders.","Lang, E",Yearbook of medical informatics,846,17

This fact, dramatically illustrated by the current avian influenza epizootic in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe, clearly demonstrates the crucial importance of the national Veterinary Services (VS) for the prevention, early detection and response for the efficient control of animal diseases. Complying with this mission for the VS presupposes the existence of appropriate governance and legislation and of an official system to control their quality and reliability- an obvious weakness in many developing and in transition countries. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has therefore developed a project aiming at strengthening the VS in those countries facing the greatest animal health threats and to bring them into line with OIE international standards already adopted by the same countries. Based on the evaluation of the VS and subsequent actions at the global, regional and national levels, the project will have a significant beneficial impact on the targeted countries as well as the international community as a whole, not only in the fields of agriculture, food security and production, and food safety, but also for the local and global prevention of emerging and re-emerging diseases of veterinary and public health importance.

The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. RESULTS A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in nine DID: Bot-plus and Medinteract (100 %), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89 %), Hansten (83 %), Micromedex and Stockley (78 %), Drug Interactions Facts (68 %). Ninety-two per cent of the DID describe the mechanism of action, 87 % classify the information according to the active ingredient, 75 % do not state they have any conflict of interest, classify according to level of severity, have electronic format and are easy to search.

We propose a TB elimination strategy based on the eight-point World Health Organization (WHO) action framework for low incidence countries. Priority actions recommended by the WHO include 1) ensure political commitment, funding and stewardship for planning and essential services; 2) address the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups; 3) address special needs of migrants and cross-border issues; 4) identify active TB and undertake screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in recent TB contacts and selected high-risk groups, and provide appropriate treatment; 5) optimise the prevention and care of drug-resistant TB; 6) ensure continued surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation and case-based data management; 7) invest in research and new tools; and 8) support global TB prevention, care and control. In New Zealand, central government needs to take greater responsibility for TB policy and programme governance. Urgent action is required to prevent TB in higher risk groups including Māori communities, and to enable immigration screening to detect and treat LTBI. Clinical services need to be supported to implement new guidelines for LTBI that enable better targeting of screening and shorter, safer treatment regimens. Access to WHO recommended treatment regimens needs to be guaranteed for drug-resistant TB. Better use of existing data could better define priority areas for action and assist in the evaluation of current control activities. Access to GeneXpert® MTB-RIF near the point of care and whole genome sequencing nationally would greatly improve clinical and public health management through early identification of drug resistance and outbreaks.

This low-pH constraint implicates endocytosis in EIAV entry. To identify the endocytic pathway involved in EIAV entry, we examined the entry requirements for EIAV into two different cells: equine dermal (ED) cells and primary equine endothelial cells. We investigated the entry mechanism of several strains of EIAV and found that both macrophage-tropic and tissue culture-adapted strains utilize clathrin-coated pits for entry. In contrast, a superinfecting strain of EIAV, EIAV(vMA-1c), utilizes two mechanisms of entry. In cells such as ED cells that EIAV(vMA-1c) is able to superinfect, viral entry is pH independent and appears to be mediated by plasma membrane fusion, whereas in cells where no detectable superinfection occurs, EIAV(vMA-1c) entry that is low-pH dependent occurs through clathrin-coated pits in a manner similar to wild-type virus. Regardless of the mechanism of entry being utilized, the internalization kinetics of EIAV is rapid with 50% of cell-associated virions internalizing within 60 to 90 min. Cathepsin inhibitors did not prevent EIAV entry, suggesting that the low-pH step required by wild-type EIAV is not required to activate cellular cathepsins.","Brindley, Melinda A; Maury, Wendy",Journal of virology,846,31

ANIMALS 1,074 calves in feedlots in Ohio, Texas, and Nebraska. PROCEDURE Nasal swab specimens were obtained at time of arrival (day 0) and at various times during the initial 28 days after arrival at feedlots. Specimens were tested for BCV, using an antigen-capture ELISA. Serum samples were obtained at time of arrival and again 28 days after arrival; sera were analyzed for antibodies to BCV, using an antibody-detection ELISA. RESULTS Samples from 12 groups of cattle entering 7 feedlots during a 3-year period revealed that 78 of 1,074 (7.3%) cattle were shedding BCV (range, 0 to 35.9% within specific groups). At time of arrival, 508 of 814 (62.4%) cattle had low (< 50) or undetectable BCV antibody titers. Seroconversion to BCV during the initial 28 days after arrival was detected in 473 of 814 (58%) cattle tested (range, 20.3 to 84.1 % within specific groups). In cattle shedding BCV from the nasal passages, 49 of 68 (72.1 %) seroconverted, and 472 of 746 (63.3%) cattle that were not shedding the virus seroconverted. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Bovine coronavirus can be detected in populations of feedlot cattle in the form of viral shedding as well as seroconversion to the virus.

Diseases caused by the listed viruses characterized by moderate invasiveness and noticeable mortality compared to other respiratory viruses. The pathogenesis of these infections is based on a wide range of innate immunity dysfunctions, manifested in the direct suppression of anti-inflammatory functions and, on the contrary, the activation of pro-inflammatory functions, such as the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory factors is accompanied by a disturbance in the balance of cytokines, leading to the development of a cytokine storm. When the body manages to cope with these disorders, a stable adaptive immunity develops, which is a harmonious combination of cellular and humoral mechanisms of resistance. Particularly difficult COVID-19 occurs in elderly and senile people. It has been shown that the main tests for the risk of multiple organ failure and death in COVID-19 in this category of patients are concomitant diseases, lymphocytopenia, increased transferases, D-dimer and other metabolic disorders. It has been established that critically ill COVID-19 patients develop endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathy, immunothrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which are the basis of multiple organ failure. Pneumonia, as a complication of COVID-19, accompanied by the development of acute respiratory respiratory syndrome, ultimately leads to pulmonary fibrosis, which is often fatal. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Recently, immunomodulatory drugs have been widely introduced in the treatment of this infection, including remdesivir, synthetic quinine derivatives and neutralize antibodies.","Kuznik, B I; Khavinson, V K; Smirnov, V S",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,846,1

Among various routes of intra-abdominal access, the transvaginal method is most appealing because of its utility and proven safety. We describe a series of 4 colonic resections performed with this approach, combined with minilaparoscopy and needlescopic approaches, and discuss the technical aspects, efficacy, and applicability of this technique. METHODS Three patients were selected to undergo hybrid transvaginal natural-orifice right hemicolectomy. A fourth patient, who underwent a segmental resection of a splenic flexure carcinoma, was included. Transvaginal port access was obtained via posterior colpotomy, and was used for dissection, vascular ligation, bowel division, and anastomosis. We used a combination of standard laparoscopic, minilaparoscopic, and needlescopic instruments transabdominally, focusing on reduced size and number of access points. RESULTS Duration of laparoscopy, oncologic outcomes and rate of operative morbidity were comparable to the published literature. Early return of gastrointestinal function and low analgesic requirements was observed in all patients. No morbidity related to transvaginal access was observed and the procedure was performed without difficulty in all cases. CONCLUSION Colonic resection performed by hybrid natural-orifice technique offers several advantages over purely transabdominal laparoscopic procedures. Transvaginal access is easy to perform and offers excellent safety, efficacy, and versatility, especially for right hemicolectomy. Techniques to reduce abdominal wall surgical trauma, such as minilaparoscopy and needlescopic graspers, can be combined effectively in colonic resections, and may act synergistically to reduce postoperative pain and improve outcomes.","Moloney, Jayson M; Gan, Philip S L",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,846,1

The aim of this study was to compare the modified Kessler suture biomechanically with a newer, two-strand suture. Eighteen porcine tendons were cut and repaired according to either the grasping modified Kessler suture or the combined side-locking loop technique (Yotsumoto) and interlocking horizontal mattress suture (Dona). The specimens were tested linearly to failure. The 2 mm gap force, yield force, ultimate force, stiffness, energy to yield, and energy to failure were all significantly higher (p value = 0.005, 0.003, <0.001, 0.001, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively) in the Yotsumoto-Dona group (median values (IQR): 30.9 (28.1-39.5) N, 82.7 (64.9-114.1) N, 82.7 (76.6-114.1) N, 12.5 (10-14.5) N/mm, 0.45 (0.2-0.5) J, and 0.45 (0.35-0.5) J) than in the modified Kessler group (25.8 (12.2-28.1) N, 35 (24.6-54.4) N, 50.9 (34.4-55.1) N, 7 (5.8-91) N/mm, 0.09 (0.06-0.18) J, and 0.21 (0.18-0.28) J). All Yotsumoto-Dona specimens had a yield force exceeding 35 N, while in the Kessler group only four did. The early yielding rate was 6/9 and 2/9 in the modified Kessler and the Yotsumoto-Dona groups, respectively (p = 0.15). Most of the core sutures failed by breakage, but three Yotsumoto knots loosened. All the simple running and six of the Dona epitendinous sutures failed predominantly by pulling-out, and by breakage at the intersections in three of the latter. The relatively easy two-strand Yotsumoto-Dona suture is likely to withstand the loads of active finger flexion, whereas the modified Kessler suture is probably not.","Rigó, István Z; Haugstvedt, Jan-Ragnar; Ludvigsen, Per; Røkkum, Magne",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,846,1

During and after a mass casualty event, it is likely that critical care services will be needed beyond an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The objective of this article is to explore existing ICU care systems such as military aeromedical transport that may be applicable to disaster medicine and to providing critical care outside of an ICU setting. RESULTS The U.S. Air Force Critical Care Aeromedical Transport (CCAT) Teams were developed in 1994 in response to an unmet military need for long-range air transport of critically ill and injured patients. This system has transported several thousand ICU patients and is an applicable model for the future development of extrahospital critical care capabilities needed during a disaster. We also discuss civilian aeromedical critical care systems, the types of medical devices used, and their applicability to disaster medical response. CONCLUSION The U.S. Air Force CCAT Team program, as well as many civilian critical care air ambulance services, provides a workable starting point for the development of disaster medical critical care response capabilities for disaster medical systems.","Grissom, Thomas E; Farmer, J Christopher",Critical care medicine,846,1

Age-specific dengue morbidity rates are highest in the young adult population, unlike in many other Southeast Asian countries where dengue is mainly a paediatric disease. Hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on dengue diagnosis and management which were developed using the paediatric experiences, may not be suitable for the management of adult dengue infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Early DENgue (EDEN) infection and outcome study is a collaborative longitudinal study to investigate epidemiological, clinical, viral and host-specific features of early dengue-infected adults, in an effort to identify new early markers for prognostication. Patients presenting with early undifferentiated fever were included in the study. We carried out an interim analysis to look for early indicators of severe disease. RESULTS During the period of this interim study analysis, 455 febrile patients were recruited. Of these, 133 were confirmed as acute dengue cases based on dengue-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. There were significant clinical and epidemiological differences between dengue and febrile non-dengue cases. Nine per cent of the dengue cases experienced persistent tiredness, drowsiness and loss of appetite beyond 3 weeks of illness. Quantitation of viral loads using the crossover (Ct) value of real-time RT-PCR correlated with the duration of symptoms. More than half of both primary and secondary dengue cases were hospitalised. There was no dengue-related mortality in this study. CONCLUSION The duration of illness and prolonged symptom duration in 9% of the subjects indicate that the burden of dengue illness is substantially different from other non-dengue febrile illness in our study cohort. Our study also highlights the paucity of early prognostic markers for dengue fever in adults.","Low, Jenny G H; Ooi, Eng-Eong; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Leo, Yee-Sin; Hibberd, Martin L; Ng, Lee-Ching; Lai, Yee-Ling; Yap, Grace S L; Li, Chenny S C; Vasudevan, Subhash G; Ong, Adrian","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",846,20

BACKGROUND The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 highlighted that healthcare workers were under-prepared for such an epidemic. While many in-service education sessions were arranged by institutions in response to the outbreak, preservice nursing education has overlooked preparation for handling such infectious disease epidemics. METHOD A quasi-experimental design was used and a 16-hour, purpose-designed infection control education programme was implemented for preservice nursing students in southern Taiwan. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed at three time points during the period September 2005 to April 2006 to examine the sustainability and effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS A total of 175 preservice nursing students participated in the study. Following the education programme, students in the intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement across time in their knowledge of these precautions [F(2, 180) = 13.53, P < 0.001] and confidence in resolving infection-related issues [F(1.79, 168.95) = 3.24] when compared with those in the control group. CONCLUSION To improve nursing students' capacity in responding to infectious epidemics, an educational programme that integrates the theme of infection precautions, learning theory and teaching strategies is recommended for all nursing institutes.","Wu, Chia-Jung; Gardner, Glenn; Chang, Anne M",Journal of advanced nursing,846,19

The high prevalence and progressive nature of the disease complicates defining healthy control groups. In order to evaluate the possible influence of various life style changes on the prevalence of tooth resorption, healthy control groups are a prerequisite. This paper presents a prevalence study for tooth resorption in a free-ranging wild felidae population. Skulls from 46 free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) were examined. The age of the animals had previously been estimated based on cementum annuli in the maxillary right canine tooth. The dental examination included both dental probing and radiographic imaging. Complicated fractures of the canine teeth were found in 9/46 (19.5%) skulls. In one fractured canine, apical root resorption and periapical lucency was detected. The root resorption was attributed to inflammatory resorption as a consequence of the initial dental trauma and necrotic pulp. No signs of tooth resorption were found in the remaining teeth. Supernumerary roots were detected in 18/46 skulls (39.1 %). Supernumerary ""peg"" teeth caudal to the mandibular first molar tooth were detected in 6/46 (13.0%) skulls. Although further studies on dental ultra-structure are needed, the Swedish Eurasian lynx may, in the future, be useful as a healthy comparative model for studies on the etiopathogenesis of tooth resorption in the domestic cat.","Pettersson, Ann",Journal of veterinary dentistry,846,32

The effects of zinc on the invasion activity of human prostate and renal cancer cell lines, PC-3, LNCaP and SKRC-1, were investigated in vitro using a Transwell cell-culture chamber and were compared with specific protease inhibitors for MMPs, uPA and AP-N, respectively. The invasion activity of PC-3 cells was effectively suppressed by zinc and by all protease inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. The invasion activity of LNCaP cells was almost unaffected by these inhibitors. In SKRC-1 cells, the invasion activity was strongly suppressed by MP03, although a moderate inhibition by zinc and bestatin was observed. The purified AP-N activity was strongly inhibited by zinc at a concentration similar to that suppressing the invasion activity of PC-3 cells and this inhibition by zinc was apparently competitive. Although the purified uPA activity was also inhibited by zinc, this inhibition was uncompetitive. AP-N was expressed abundantly on the membrane fraction of PC-3 cells among these cells tested, while its expression on the membrane fraction of SKRC-1 cells was weaker than that of PC-3 cells. The expression of uPA was also highest on the membrane fraction of PC-3 cells.

METHODS Five necropsied cats that were naturally infected with FIP virus, confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, with different intensities of CNS lesions, were studied. Brain and cerebellum were evaluated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin to assess astrocytic morphology, and lectin histochemistry for Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) to detect microglia was performed to evaluate the glial response in the CNS of cats with FIP. RESULTS An important astrocytic response in many areas of the CNS of all cats, including the periventricular areas of lateral ventricles and fourth ventricle, the molecular layer of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, was visualized. This astrocytic reactivity was associated with areas of granulomatous or pyogranulomatous vasculitis/perivasculitis in most cases, and it was characterized by multifocal to coalescing astrocytosis and astrogliosis with an increase in the expression of intermediate filaments, such as GFAP. However, astrocytes exhibited strong vimentin expression in neuroparenchyma with severe inflammatory and necrotic changes, but GFAP expression was mild or absent in these cases. A microglial response was present only in severe lesions, and RCA-I expression was detected primarily in gitter cells and resting microglia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The present study indicates a strong astrocytic response, including the presence of many less differentiated vimentin-positive astrocytes and gitter cells positive for RCA-1 in severe lesions in the CNS of cats with FIP.","Mesquita, Leonardo P; Hora, Aline S; de Siqueira, Adriana; Salvagni, Fernanda A; Brandão, Paulo E; Maiorka, Paulo C",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,846,16

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and trans-membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are the two major host factors that contribute to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animal to human is considered a rare event that necessarily requires strong evolutionary adaptations. Till date no other human cellular receptors are identified beside ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 entry inside the human cell. Proteolytic cleavage of viral spike (S)-protein and ACE2 by TMPRSS2 began the entire host-pathogen interaction initiated with the physical binding of ACE2 to S-protein. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to ACE2 with much higher affinity and stability than that of SARS-CoVs. Molecular interactions between ACE2-S and TMPRSS2-S are crucial and preciously mediated by specific residues. Structural stability, binding affinity and level of expression of these three interacting proteins are key susceptibility factors for COVID-19. Specific protein-protein interactions (PPI) are being identified that explains uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amino acid substitutions due to naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms potentially alter these PPIs and poses further clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19. Repurposing of several phytochemicals and approved drugs against ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S-protein have been proposed that could inhibit PPI between them. We have also identified some novel lead phytochemicals present in Azadirachta indica and Aloe barbadensis which could be utilized for further in vitro and in vivo anti-COVID-19 drug discovery.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety among Brazilian children and its associated factors during social distancing during COVID-19. We used a cross-sectional design with an online survey from April to May 2020 in Brazil. We included children aged 6-12 years and their guardians. The Children's Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ; scores 4-12) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; scores 0-10) were used to measure anxiety. We enrolled 157 girls and 132 boys, with a mean age of 8.84 (±2.05) years; 88.9% of respondents were mothers. Based on CAQ &#8805; 9, the prevalence of anxiety was 19.4% (n = 56), and higher among children with parents with essential jobs and those who were social distancing without parents. In logistic regression, the following variables were associated with higher CAQ scores: social distancing without parents; more persons living together in home; and education level of guardians. Based on NRS > 7, the prevalence of anxiety was 21.8% (n = 63); however, no associations with NRS scores were found with the investigated variables. These findings suggest the necessity of implementing public health actions targeting these parents and their children at the population level.","Garcia de Avila, Marla Andréia; Hamamoto Filho, Pedro Tadao; Jacob, Francine Letícia da Silva; Alcantara, Léia Regina Souza; Berghammer, Malin; Jenholt Nolbris, Margaretha; Olaya-Contreras, Patricia; Nilsson, Stefan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),846,24

The etiopathogenesis of PR is still unknown, but is frequently associated with episodes of upper respiratory tract infections. It is likely that a new viral trigger of pityriasis rosea is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female patient in whom the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea led to the investigation and diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented to the Department of Dermatology for a 3âweek duration of an extremely pruritic erythematous-squamous lesion, initially on the trunk and upper limbs, with extension to the lower limbs in the last week and the lesion respected the cephalic extremity, palms, and soles. One week before the rash, respiratory tract infection symptomatology was observed by the patient. At home, she underwent systemic treatment with antihistamines and topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable, with the spread of the lesions and the accentuation of the pruritus. DIAGNOSES: Considering the actual epidemiological context, we performed a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasal and pharyngeal swabs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to investigate the PR etiology. The patient had a positive RT-PCR result, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment was initiated with systemic corticosteroid therapy - hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 200âmg/day for 7âdays, and loratadine 10âmg 2 times a day. Also, topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids and emollients was associated. OUTCOME: Under the treatment that was initiated a partial remission of the lesions after 7âdays was observed. LESSONS: Our reported case adds to the other findings regarding the association of PR with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the context of the pandemic, suggesting the need to test patients with PR skin lesions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Iancu, Gabriela Mariana",Medicine (Baltimore),846,16

By harnessing the regulatory effects of adenosine on inflammatory mediators, we have instituted a new therapeutic treatment with inhaled adenosine in COVID-19 patients, with the aim of reducing inflammation, the onset of cytokine storm, and therefore to improve prognosis. The use of inhaled adenosine in COVID19 patients has allowed reduction of length of stay, on average 6 days. This result is strengthened by the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 positive days. In treated patients compared to control, a clear improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was observed together with a reduction in inflammation parameters, such as the decrease of CRP level. Furthermore, the efficacy of inhaled exogenous adenosine led to an improvement of the prognosis indices, NLR and PLR. The treatment seems to be safe and modulates the immune system, allowing an effective response against the viral infection progression, reducing length of stay and inflammation parameters.","Caracciolo, Massimo; Correale, Pierpaolo; Mangano, Carmelo; Foti, Giuseppe; Falcone, Carmela; Macheda, Sebastiano; Cuzzola, Maria; Conte, Marco; Falzea, Antonella Consuelo; Iuliano, Eleonora; Morabito, Antonella; Caraglia, Michele; Polimeni, Nicola; Ferrarelli, Anna; Labate, Demetrio; Tescione, Marco; Di Renzo, Laura; Chiricolo, Gaetano; Romano, Lorenzo; De Lorenzo, Antonino",Front Immunol,846,20

However, for this purpose, strict safety criteria were necessary. This study aims to present, through mapping, the vaccines developed in the world against Covid-19, highlighting the main vaccines used in the world, in addition to verifying the vaccines that are being used in Brazil. The methodology of this research is characterized as a quantitative exploratory study, which consists of a mapping of vaccines worldwide against Covid-19. The results presented show that the vaccines developed and those that are under development, registered since the first phase, are vaccines: genetic (19);protein-based vaccines (37);inactivated and attenuated coronavirus vaccines (16). Among these vaccines, 12 of them are the main vaccines in the world. As for efficacy, only EpiVacCorona has an unknown efficacy. However, in Brazil, for emergency use, Vaxzevria-AZD1222, CoronaVac and Comirnaty - BNT162b2 are being used, which have a significant percentage of effectiveness. It is concluded, in light of this study, that countries are entering into partnerships with companies, governments, universities and researchers for the development and testing of vaccines, with the aim of eliminating the pandemic. There are several vaccines whose effectiveness is proven, however, the pandemic will only be extinguished when the number of immunizers is compatible or close to the number of the world population.

Methods: Demographic data and device records were extracted for patients with heart failure in the 16 weeks at the turn of lockdown during pandemic. To explore the variability across the lockdown period, a week-to-week analysis was performed. Patients were interviewed to investigate on physical activity and psychological insights. The primary endpoint was the variation in physical activity at the turn of lockdown. Results: At our facility, 2,225 patients implanted with a cardiac device were screened and data were collected for 211 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients' physical activity significantly decreased in the lockdown period compared with the control period (active time per day 8.0% vs. 10.8%; relative reduction [RRR] 25.9%; p<0.0001). A small decrease was noted for mean heart rate (70.1 vs. 71.7 beats per minute [bpm]; RRR 2.2%; p<0.0001), while thoracic impedance slightly increased (82.2 vs. 82.7 ohm; RRR 0.6%; p = 0.001). Patients' physical activity decreased from week 7 to week 11 (10.9% vs. 6.9%; RRR 36.7%; P<0.0001) with an increase between week 11 and week 16 (6.9% vs. 8.5%; RRR 18.8%; P<0.0001). Patients' perceptions about physical activity showed a very low correlation with remote monitoring-assessed physical activity levels (r2=0.035). Conclusions: Telemedicine and remote monitoring characterized the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on vital signs and physical activity levels of heart failure patients, playing a crucial role in the prediction of heart failure worsening during circumstances discouraging outpatient visits.","Bertagnin, Enrico; Greco, Antonio; Bottaro, Giuseppe; Zappulla, Paolo; Romanazzi, Imma; Daniela Russo, Maria; Lo Presti, Marco; Valenti, Noemi; Sollano, Giuseppe; Calvi, Valeria",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,846,1

Our first aim was to determine both the infection status and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the country's infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)-PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented to answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 635 people (aged 18-73) providing a blood sample 39.1% reported a history of past COVID-19 symptoms while 14.2% reported having current symptoms of COVID-19. The most-prevalent co-morbidity among this group was hypertension (22.0%) followed by asthma (7.0%) and diabetes (6.0%). The SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was 8.9%. Of the 560 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 participants (0.36%) were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. None of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive people were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. CONCLUSION AND INTERPRETATION: In addition to clinical staff, several patient-facing health workers were characterised within Zimbabwe's health system and the seroprevalence data indicated that previous exposure to SAR-CoV-2 had occurred across the full spectrum of patient-facing staff with nurses and nurse aides having the highest seroprevalence. Our results highlight the need for including the various health workers in IPC strategies in health centres to ensure effective biosecurity and biosafety.","Rusakaniko, Simbarashe; Sibanda, Elopy Nemele; Mduluza, Takafira; Tagwireyi, Paradzayi; Dhlamini, Zephaniah; Ndhlovu, Chiratidzo Ellen; Chandiwana, Precious; Chiwambutsa, Shingirai; Lim, Rivka May; Scott, Fiona; Sibanda, Lindiwe Majele; Mutapi, Francisca",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,846,1

One patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in the setting of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the development of infection-driven autoimmune cytopenias. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on both patients, and the impact of the identified variants was validated by functional assays using the patients' PBMCs. RESULTS: Each patient was found to have a unique heterozygous truncation variant in suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). SOCS1 is an essential negative regulator of type I and type II IFN signaling. The patients' PBMCs showed increased levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 phosphorylation and a transcriptional signature characterized by increased expression of type I and type II IFN-stimulated genes and proapoptotic genes. The enhanced IFN signature exhibited by the patients' unstimulated PBMCs parallels the hyperinflammatory state associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, suggesting the contributions of SOCS1 in regulating the inflammatory response characteristic of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous loss-of-function SOCS1 mutations are associated with enhanced IFN signaling and increased immune cell activation, thereby predisposing to infection-associated autoimmune cytopenias.","Lee, Pui Y; Platt, Craig D; Weeks, Sabrina; Grace, Rachael F; Maher, George; Gauthier, Kasey; Devana, Sridevi; Vitali, Sally; Randolph, Adrienne G; McDonald, Douglas R; Geha, Raif S; Chou, Janet",J Allergy Clin Immunol,846,10

This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA), Pahang, Malaysia and to identify the clinical and laboratory markers for severe disease, complications and virologic clearance according to clinical staging. METHODS: This was a single-centre, retrospective, descriptive study. All COVID-19 patients admitted to HTAA from March 9 to April 15, 2020, were included in the study. Patients were categorised according to clinical staging. Data obtained from the medical report includes baseline characteristics of patients, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments, complications, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the total of 247 patients hospitalised, the majority consisted at clinical-stage 1 (43%) and stage 2 (39%) disease. Older patients, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney disease were found more common among patients with severe disease. Fever was uncommon and the majority had normal haemoglobin levels, white cell counts, and platelet counts. C-reactive protein (CRP) was found statistically significant to predict pneumonia or hypoxia at a cut-off value of 14mg/L (sensitivity 73.8%, specificity 91.3%) and 50mg/L (sensitivity 100%, specificity 96.4%) respectively. Pneumonia was mostly diagnosed radiologically using chest radiography, especially among clinical stage 3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a significant complication, with 31% of clinical stage 3 and above developed AKI and 44% of them requiring haemodialysis. Median virologic clearance time was 15 days from onset of illness, and asymptomatic patients had longer clearance time. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presented with a wide spectrum of clinical patterns. CRP was a valuable predictor of severe disease. In this study risk and severity of acute kidney injury were found to be higher. A longer duration of virologic clearance was observed among the asymptomatic patients.","Soh, T V; Dzawani, M; Noorlina, N; Nik, F; Norazmi, A",Med J Malaysia,846,33

An increasing number of patients with ARDS related to coronavirus disease 2019 require prone positioning, which poses a challenge to the intensive care unit staff at Brigham and Women's Hospital. METHODS: A prone team service of physical therapists and occupational therapists with critical care experience was established to assist with increasing demands for prone positioning of patients who were mechanically ventilated. The goals of the rehabilitation-based prone team were to provide support to nursing and respiratory therapy; create a consistent, efficient process; and ensure patient and staff safety. RESULTS: The service evolved over 7 weeks, expanding to 24-hour coverage and adding responsibilities to support the staff as patient volume grew. The volume of requests to the rehabilitation-based prone team generally increased to week 4 and has, since then, declined. Key points for successful implementation included identification of rehabilitation therapists with intensive care unit experience and leadership qualities, multidisciplinary collaboration, availability of needed positioning devices and supplies to protect the integument, and well-defined roles of all disciplines participating in position change process. CONCLUSION: The description of the development, operations, evolution, and utilization of a rehabilitation therapist prone team acts as a guide for future development and implementation.

An added key factor has been a patient-initiated delay in the presentation because of the fear of viral infection. Patterns of clinical consultation have changed, including a greater level of virtual visits, physical spacing, masking, staffing changes to ensure a COVID-free population and significant changes in patterns of family involvement. While this has occurred to improve safety from COVID-19 infection, the implications for cancer outcomes have not yet been defined. Based on prior epidemics and financial recessions, it is likely that delayed presentation and treatment of high-grade malignancy will be associated with worse cancer outcomes. Cancer patients are also at increased risk from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population.

Abnormal brain imaging was evaluated in detail and various imaging patterns on magnetic resonance imaging MRI were identified. RESULTS: Of the 3,403 patients with COVID-19, 167 (4.9%) had neurological signs or symptoms warranting neuroimaging. The most common indications were delirium (44/167, 26%), focal neurology (37/167, 22%), and altered consciousness (34/167, 20%). Neuroimaging showed abnormalities in 23% of patients, with MRI being abnormal in 20 patients and computed tomography (CT) in 18 patients. The most consistent neuroradiological finding was microhaemorrhage with a predilection for the splenium of the corpus callosum (12/20, 60%) followed by acute or subacute infarct (5/20, 25%), watershed white matter hyperintensities (4/20, 20%), and susceptibility changes on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in the superficial veins (3/20, 15%), acute haemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy (2/20, 10%), large parenchymal haemorrhage (2/20, 10%), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1/20, 5%), hypoxic-ischaemic changes (1/20, 5%), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like changes (1/20, 5%).

Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e., HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA) and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device (InMode; Lake Forest, CA). METHODS: Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters, adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 µm and 100% at >0.45 µm. Recordings were obtained with and without a smoke evacuator. RESULTS: Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD ±7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD ±6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the mean recording was 8 pps (STD ±8). At the more superficial depth of 0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD ±6). The Er:YAG laser resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD ±11). When the particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 µm (STD ±147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3 µm (STD ±84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit particles >5 µm throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 µm. The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50% reduction in both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes. CONCLUSION: Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase IV reopening.","Dayan, Erez; Theodorou, Spero; Katz, Bruce; Dover, Jeffrey S",Lasers surg. med,846,16

The prevalence of laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 5.4% (n = 65), corresponding to (i) 22 ongoing infections at admission, including two with mild clinical symptoms and 20 asymptomatic women; (ii) 43 cases of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure; (iii) and 1146 women who were negative for both SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serological test. None of the screened mothers required hospital admission for coronavirus disease before or after delivery, nor were any of the newborns admitted to the intensive care unit. All newborns from mothers with positive PCR on admission were PCR negative. There were no significant differences in maternal or perinatal outcomes among the three studied groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Ongoing or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with asymptomatic or mild clinical symptoms detected during screening in pregnant women at labor and delivery do not have a higher rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes.","Savirón-Cornudella, Ricardo; Villalba, Ana; Esteban, Luis M; Tajada, Mauricio; Rodríguez-Solanilla, Belén; Andeyro-Garcia, Mercedes; Zapardiel, Javier; Rite, Segundo; Castán-Larraz, Berta; Pérez-López, Faustino R",Life Sci,846,18

University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. METHODS: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. RESULTS: Six negative predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students' psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students' psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. CONCLUSION: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students' psychological wellbeing.","Liu, Chang; McCabe, Melinda; Dawson, Andrew; Cyrzon, Chad; Shankar, Shruthi; Gerges, Nardin; Kellett-Renzella, Sebastian; Chye, Yann; Cornish, Kim",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),846,1

Pregnancy by virtue of its physiological and anatomical adaptations increases the risk of severe infections especially those of the respiratory tract. This single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by droplets as well as soiled fomites. There are various degrees of disease severity- asymptomatic, mild, moderate severe and critical. Most infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. For these women, the consequences on the mother or pregnancy are minimal unless they have additional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity or are of ethnic minority background. Most women with symptoms will present with fever, unproductive cough, sore throat, myalgia, nasal congestion, loss of smell and taste with associated leukocytosis and lymphopenia. Diagnosis is by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal flocked swabs or saliva and pathognomonic features of ground-glass appearance and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scans. Management in pregnancy is same as that for non-pregnant women with COVID-19. It is not an indication for elective delivery but assisted delivery in the second stage for those with moderate, severe or critical disease may be required to shorten this stage. COVID-19 is not an indication for interrupting pregnancy or caesarean section but the latter may be performed to facilitate ventilation support or resuscitation in those with severe disease. Pain relief in labour should not be different but regional analgesia is preferred for operative deliveries. Postpartum thromboprophylaxis should be considered and breast feeding encouraged with appropriate precautions to minimize vertical transmission. Pregnant and lactating women should be encouraged to receive the mRNA based vaccines as there is no evidence of adverse outcomes with these.","Hammad, Wafaa Ali Belail; Al Beloushi, Mariam; Ahmed, Badreleden; Konje, Justin C",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,846,14

Declínios populacionais em felinos silvestres devido a doenças já foram relatados, porém, pouco se conhece sobre o potencial papel dos patógenos nas populações de onça-pintada. Este estudo teve por objetivo pesquisar a presença de patógenos nas populações de onça-pintada e animais domésticos das regiões do Parque Nacional das Emas-PNE, Parque Estadual do Cantão-PEC e Pantanal sul mato-grossense, e identificar possíveis associações nos diagnósticos encontrados. Entre fevereiro de 2000 e janeiro de 2010, foram coletadas amostras biológicas de 31 onças-pintadas, 1246 bovinos, 179 cães e 36 gatos. Foram realizados diagnósticos sorológicos para brucelas lisas (AAT), Leptospira spp. (SAM), Toxoplasma gondii (MAT; RIFI), vírus da raiva (RFFIT), vírus da cinomose (SN), FIV e FeLV (SnapTM); e diagnósticos moleculares para Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma haemofelis, &#39;Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum&#39; e &#39;Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis&#39;. Amostras de fezes de onças-pintadas foram analisadas para Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp., protozoários da Família Sarcocystidae e Mycobacterium spp. O monitoramento das onças-pintadas, através do radiotransmissor, permitiu o mapeamento da ocorrência dos patógenos. As populações de bovinos das três áreas apresentaram alta exposição à B. abortus, mas apenas uma onça-pintada do PNE foi exposta à brucela lisa. Os sorovares mais prováveis de Leptospira spp. identificados em onças-pintadas do PNE e Pantanal foram distintos dos encontrados nos animais domésticos. As onças-pintadas, cães e gatos das três áreas foram altamente expostos ao T. gondii. Onças-pintadas do PNE e Pantanal foram expostas ao vírus da raiva, assim como as onças-pintadas do Pantanal e os cães das três áreas foram expostos ao vírus da cinomose. Dois gatos do entorno do PEC foram soropositivos para FeLV, mas nenhuma onça-pintada foi exposta ao agente ou ao FIV. Cães do entorno do PNE e do PEC foram positivos para Babesia spp., enquanto todas onças-pintadas foram negativas para o hemoparasita. Todas as onças-pintadas do Pantanal e PNE, e três de quatro onças do PEC foram positivas para Hepatozoon spp. e Cytauxzoon felis, sendo que cães e gatos também foram expostos ao Hepatozoon spp., mas não ao Cytauxzoon spp. As onças-pintadas das três áreas apresentaram alta exposição ao &#39;Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum&#39;, e alguns indivíduos do Pantanal e PEC foram positivos para o Mycoplasma haemofelis e &#39;Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis&#39;. Poucos gatos foram positivos para os hemoplasmas felinos. Não houve evidências de exposição ao Mycobacterium bovis, e a presença de Cryptosporidium spp. e Giardia intestinalis foi detectada em onças do PNE. De acordo com os resultados, a cinomose e a raiva podem ser consideradas potenciais ameaças às populações de onça-pintada; a brucelose e a leptospirose podem ter sido transmitidas por animais domésticos; e, provavelmente as onças-pintadas possuem papel importante na manutenção do T. gondii, Cytauxzoon felis, Hepatozoon spp. e &#39;Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum&#39; no ambiente.

We studied post-lockdown scenarios and evaluated health-care constraints. Our aim was to identify the scenarios in which health-care availability would not be overwhelmed. Methods: A modified compartmental SEIR stochastic model was used to calculate peak cases at various levels of effectiveness of prevention of transmission. Health-care constraints were evaluated using a Delphi study. We developed ""q-metric"" to evaluate the epidemic. Key constraints were matched against scenarios generated, and a monitoring mechanism was devised. Results: Continuing lockdown (""q-metric"" of >50) until mid-August was theoretically the most effective solution to end the epidemic. Lockdown might however be lifted earlier owing to various compulsions. The key constraints were identified as trained manpower and ventilators. It was estimated that shortfall of specialists to operate ventilators for COVID-19 intensive care units was approximately 40,000. This requires re-purposing of other specialists and short-term training to meet the surge. The shortage of ventilators is around 40,000-50,000. Procuring beyond those numbers would be infructuous owing to limits of training manpower. After lifting lockdown, the aim should be to contain the epidemic within the availability of key constraints. Our model suggests that this can be achieved by community containment and other non-pharmacological interventions at a ""q-metric"" of 19. An algorithm using ""q-metric"" was developed to monitor the epidemic. Conclusion: Various post-lockdown scenarios were simulated. Trained manpower and ventilators were identified as key health-care constraints. Partial community containment measures will require to be continued after the current lockdown is lifted.","Chatterjee, Kaushik; Shankar, Subramanian; Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Yadav, Arun Kumar",,846,16

Therein, this study intends to decode the mechanism of miR-149 in RM. METHODS: miR-149 and RUNX2 expression in the chorionic tissues of normal pregnant women and RM patients were first examined, and the correlation between miR-149 and RUNX2 was analyzed. Subsequently, miR-149 was upregulated in HTR-8 cells or downregulated in BEWO cells, and then the changes in biological functions of trophoblasts in RM were detected. Furthermore, the expression of PTEN/Akt signaling pathway-related factors in trophoblasts was detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS: miR-149 expression was increased while RUNX2 expression was suppressed in RM patients, and miR-149 was negatively correlated with RUNX2. Overexpressed miR-149 induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell activity, while reduced miR-149 in trophoblasts contributed to opposite experimental results. Moreover, miR-149 promoted the expression of PTEN and inhibited Akt phosphorylation by targeting RUNX2, thereby inhibiting trophoblast activity and promoting their apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that miR-149 knockdown halted the RM development through upregulating RUNX2 and activation of the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.","Wang, Peng; Chen, Xu; Chang, Ying; Wang, Yanping; Xu, Xinran; Guo, Yuling; Cui, Hongyan",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,846,20

The coordinated response by Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (The Network) undertaken with the support of NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW), Youth Justice and private jails has ensured that the NSW correctional system has remained otherwise COVID-free. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A research study of how a range of partners which support the operations of NSW Correctional System developed an effective approach for the prevention a COVID-19 epidemic amongst its inmates. FINDINGS: Establishment of effective partnerships, early coordination of representatives from all aspects of the NSW correctional system, limited access to the correctional environment, reduced prison population and strict isolation of all new receptions have all contributed to maintaining this COVID-free status despite other NSW settings with similar risk profiles, such as aged care facilities and cruise ship arrivals, experiencing serious outbreaks.

A total of 23,500 participants were recruited, and 19,372 valid questionnaires were received from 11 centers. Overall, 11.0–13.3% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms, and 1.9–2.7% had severe symptoms. The prevalence of psychological and sleep problems has increased. Working as frontline medical staff (Odds Ratio OR = 3.406), living in Hubei Province (OR = 2.237), close contacts with COVID-19 (OR = 1.808), and age 35–49 years (OR = 1.310) were risk factors for anxiety symptoms; no outside activity for 2 weeks (OR = 2.167) and age 35–49 years (OR = 1.198) were risk factors for depression symptoms; and living in Hubei Province (OR = 2.376), no outside activity for 2 weeks (OR = 1.927), and age 35–49 years (OR = 1.262) were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Only 1.9% of participants received counseling during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS. Psychological and sleep problems increased during interpersonal isolation due to COVID-19. Current psychological interventions are far from sufficient.","Wang, Shu; Zhang, Yuan; Ding, Wei; Meng, Yao; Hu, Huiting; Liu, Zhenhua; Zeng, Xianwei; Wang, Minzhong",Eur Psychiatry,846,23
