Time variation enters in a parsimonious way: only the intercepts and a common factor in the error variances can vary. Computational complexity therefore remains in a range that still allows us to estimate moderately large VARs in a reasonable amount of time. This makes our model an appealing addition to any suite of forecasting models. For eleven U.S. variables, we show the competitiveness compared to a commonly used constant-coefficient mixed-frequency VAR and other related model classes. Our model also accurately captures the drop in the gross domestic product during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Götz, Thomas B; Hauzenberger, Klemens",Econom J,763,3

BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. Patients with concomitant cardiac diseases have an extremely poor prognosis, and SARS-CoV-2 may cause direct acute and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Echocardiography may provide useful information, especially in critical care patients, because it can be performed quickly at the bedside. However, the recommendations relating to the use of echocardiography in the COVID-19 pandemic must be considered only as expert suggestions due to the lack of evidence-based scientific outcome data. To date, there is no means to predict the impact of the virus on patient outcome probably because the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unexplained. PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic utility of quantitative 2D-echocardiography, including strain, in patients with COVID-19 disease. METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the San Paolo University Hospital of Milan, that underwent a clinically indicated echocardiographic exam were included in the study. To limit contamination all measurements were performed offline. Quantitative measurements were obtained by an operator blinded to the clinical data. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, non-survivors (33%) had worse respiratory parameters, index of multiorgan failure and worse markers of lung involvement. Right Ventricular (RV) dysfunction (as assessed by conventional and 2-dimensional speckle tracking, fig. 1) was a common finding and a powerful independent predictor of mortality. At the ROC curve analyses, RV free-wall longitudinal strain (LS) showed an AUC 0.77 ± 0.08 in predicting death, p = 0.008, and global RV LS (RV-GLS) showed an AUC 0.79 ± 0.04, p = 0.004. This association remained significant after correction for age (OR= 1.16, 95%CI 1.01-1.34, p = 0.029 for RV free-wall LS and OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.01-1.42, p = 0.033 for RV-GLS), for oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysis/fraction of inspired oxygen (OR= 1.28, 95%CI 1.04-1.57, p = 0.021 for RV free wall-LS and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04-1.62, p = 0.020 for RV-GLS) and for the severity of pulmonary involvement measured by a computed tomography lung score (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.02-1.19, p = 0.034 for RV free-wall LS, and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04-1.63, p = 0.022 for RV-GLS). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, offline quantitative 2D-echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is feasible. Parameters of RV function are frequently abnormal and have an independent prognostic value over markers of lung involvement. Early identification of RV dysfunction with speckle tracking might be useful not only to guide management acutely (i.e. fluid management, monitoring high-PEEP response in intubated patients) but also to tailor follow-up subsequently.","Valli, F; Bursi, F; Santangelo, G; Sansalone, D; Vella, AM; Toriello, F; Barbieri, A; Carugo, S",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,763,3

But social distancing is not a human invention and has evolved independently in species as dissimilar as apes and lobsters. Epidemics are common in the wild, where their spread is enhanced by animal movement and sociality while curtailed by population fragmentation, host behavior, and the immune systems of hosts. In the present article, we explore the phenomenon of behavioral immunity in wild animals as compared with humans and its relevance to the control of disease in nature. We start by explaining the evolutionary benefits and risks of sociality, look at how pathogens have shaped animal evolution, and provide examples of pandemics in wild animal populations. Then we review the known occurrences of social distancing in wild animals, the cues used to enforce it, and its efficacy in controlling the spread of diseases in nature.","Butler, Mark J; Behringer, Donald C",Bioscience,763,3

There is wide variation in the rates and outcomes of NEC by race and ethnicity, and the reasons for this disparity are poorly understood. In this article, we review the epidemiology and discuss possible explanations for racial and ethnic differences in NEC. Most of the current evidence investigating the role of race in NEC comes from North America and suggests that Hispanic ethnicity and non-Hispanic Black race are associated with higher risk of NEC compared to non-Hispanic White populations. Differences in pre-term births, breastfeeding rates, and various sociodemographic factors does not fully account for the observed disparities in NEC incidence and outcomes. While genetic studies are beginning to identify candidate genes that may increase or decrease risk for NEC among racial populations, current data remain limited by small sample sizes and lack of validation. Complex interactions between social and biological determinants likely underly the differences in NEC outcomes among racial groups. Larger datasets with detailed social, phenotypic, and genotypic information, coupled with advanced bioinformatics techniques are needed to comprehensively understand racial disparities in NEC.","Cuna, Alain; Sampath, Venkatesh; Khashu, Minesh",Front Pediatr,763,15

BACKGROUND Individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression report increased symptoms and decreased quality of life compared with individuals with IBS alone. The current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to further influence symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. STUDY Individuals who met the Rome-IV IBS criteria and reported mild to severe anxiety and/or depression were included. Participants completed an online survey with questions about anxiety, depression, impact of COVID on activities and symptoms, and demographics. RESULTS Fifty-five individuals participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic most commonly influenced their ability to spend time with friends and family, shop for certain types of food, and access health care. Participants also reported increased stress (92%), anxiety (81%), and depressive symptoms (67%). Finally, around half the sample reported increases in abdominal pain (48%), diarrhea (45%), or constipation (44%).

METHODS Seventy-two American Society of Anesthesiologists I to III patients received propofol (target bispectral index, 45) and one of six remifentanil target concentrations in the range of 0 to 5 ng/ml. The NoL, mean arterial pressure (MAP; derived from a beat-to-beat finger cuff measurement), and HR were measured during nonnoxious, moderate noxious (skin incision), and intense noxious (intubation) stimulation. Values are represented as average (95% CI). RESULTS NoL, HR, and MAP did not change during nonnoxious events. Incision increased HR by 1.3/min (-0.46 to 3.1/min; not significant), MAP by 7.9 mmHg (-1.9 to 13.0 mmHg; not significant), and NoL by 8.0 (0.4 to 16.0; P < 0.001). Intubation increased HR by 7.0/min (1.4 to 12.0/min; P < 0.001), MAP by 13.0 mmHg (3.1 to 20 mmHg; P < 0.001), and NoL by 18.0 (7.8 to 29.0; P < 0.001). The ΔNoL area under the curve (0.95) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater compared with ΔHR (0.84, P < 0.001) and ΔMAP (0.78, P < 0.001). Under nonnociceptive conditions, remifentanil had no effect on NoL, in contrast to HR and MAP that showed a dose-dependent decrease. CONCLUSIONS The NoL is a reliable measure of moderate and intense noxious stimulation and outperforms HR and MAP in differentiating noxious from nonnoxious stimuli. In contrast to HR and MAP, the NoL was not affected by hemodynamic effects of remifentanil.","Martini, Chris H; Boon, Martijn; Broens, Suzanne J L; Hekkelman, Evelien F; Oudhoff, Lisanne A; Buddeke, Anna Willemijn; Dahan, Albert",Anesthesiology,763,16

DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING PICU, Advanced Pediatric Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. PATIENTS All children (age > 1 mo to < 14 yr) admitted in PICU with a diagnosis of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (as per Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference definition) from August 1, 2015, to November 2016. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Out of 1,215 children admitted to PICU, 124 (11.4%) had pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fifty-six children (45.2%) died. Median age was 2.75 years (1.0-6.0 yr) and 66.9% were male. Most common primary etiologies were pneumonia, severe sepsis, and scrub typhus. Ninety-seven children (78.2%) were invasively ventilated. On multiple logistic regressions, Lung Injury Score (p = 0.004), pneumothorax (p = 0.012), acute kidney injury at enrollment (p = 0.033), FIO2-D1 (p = 0.018), and PaO2/FIO2 ratio-D7 (p = 0.020) were independent predictors of mortality. Positive fluid balance (a cut-off value > 102.5 mL/kg; p = 0.016) was associated with higher mortality at 48 hours. Noninvasive oxygenation variables like oxygenation saturation index and saturation-FIO2 ratio were comparable to previously used invasive variables (oxygenation index and PaO2/FIO2 ratio) in monitoring the course of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome contributes to a significant burden in the PICU of a developing country and is associated with significantly higher mortality. Infection remains the most common etiology. Higher severity of illness scores at admission, development of pneumothorax, and a positive fluid balance at 48 hours predicted poor outcome.","Yadav, Bharti; Bansal, Arun; Jayashree, Muralidharan",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,763,1

METHODS Twenty patients with HCC that were treated by radiofrequency ablation or trans-catheter chemo-embolization (TACE) and in whom HCC was undetectable by ultrasonography, CT, and/or MRI 1 month after treatment were enrolled in the study. Before and after treatment for HCC, analyses of TAA (glypican-3, NY-ESO-1, and MAGE-1)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were evaluated with an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using peripheral CD8(+) T-cells, monocytes, and 104 types of 20-mer synthetic peptide overlapping by 10 residues and spanning the entirety of the 3 TAAs. RESULTS Sixteen out of 20 patients (80%) showed a positive response (> or = 10 TAA-specific cells/10(5) CD8(+) T-cells) before or after treatment. When we performed univariate analysis of prognostic factors for the tumor-free period in the 20 patients, platelet count, prothrombin time, and the number of TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cells after treatment were significant factors (P = 0.027, 0.030, and 0.004, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the magnitude of the TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell response (> or = 40 TAA-specific cells/10(5) CD8(+) T-cells) was the only significant prognostic factor for a prolonged tumor-free interval (hazard ratio 0.342, P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that strong TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses suppress the recurrence of HCC. Immunotherapy to induce TAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes by means such as the use of peptide vaccines should be considered for clinical application in patients with HCC after local therapy.","Hiroishi, Kazumasa; Eguchi, Junichi; Baba, Toshiyuki; Shimazaki, Tomoe; Ishii, Shigeaki; Hiraide, Ayako; Sakaki, Masashi; Doi, Hiroyoshi; Uozumi, Shojiro; Omori, Risa; Matsumura, Takuya; Yanagawa, Tatsuro; Ito, Takayoshi; Imawari, Michio",Journal of gastroenterology,763,29

However, there are still some controversial problems as to which treatment should be primarily chosen. Methods The relevant studies comparing arthroplasty with internal fixation were searched in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Finally, 31 relevant randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of studies was evaluated and meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software. We also assessed the heterogeneity among studies and publication bias via the I-squared index and forest plots. Results There was no significant difference between arthroplasty and internal fixation groups in patient mortality at both short-term and long-term points. However, patients treated with arthroplasty showed significantly lowered risks of reoperation both at short-term (5.6% vs 31.5%; relative risks (RR) = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13-0.28; P < .00001) and long-term follow-up (9.5% vs 45.9%; RR = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17-0.33; P < .00001). Similarly, arthroplasty-treated patients demonstrated a significant decrease in the risk of postoperation complications at short-term (10.3% vs 34.4%; RR = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.24-0.57; P < .00001) and long-term follow-up (11.7% vs 42.5%; RR = 0.30, 95% CI, 0.16-0.57; P < .0002).

Conclusions Arthroplasty leads to a lower rate of reoperation, a reduced risk of complications, and a better alleviation of postoperation pain both at short-term and long-term follow-up. Most importantly, and according to trial sequence analyses, more than enough evidence has been achieved that arthroplasty does show better outcomes than internal fixation in terms of reoperation rate, complications, and postoperation pain.

The feasibility of minimally invasive single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for colorectal procedures is well-established, but outcome data remain limited. METHODS Patients with benign diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis admitted to Klinikum Leverkusen, Germany, for colonic resection between July 2009 and March 2011 (n = 224) underwent single-incision laparoscopic surgery using the SILS port system. Surgeons had ≥7 years' experience in laparoscopic colon surgery but no SILS experience. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively. Pain was evaluated by using a visual analog scale (0-10). Data were analyzed by using the SPSS PASW Statistics 18 database. RESULTS The majority of patients underwent sigmoid colectomy with high anterior resection (AR) or left hemicolectomy (n = 150) for diverticulitis. Our conversion rate to open surgery was 6.3 %, half in patients undergoing sigmoid colectomy with high AR or left hemicolectomy, 95 % of whom had diverticulitis. Mean operating time was 166 ± 74 (range, 40-441) min in the overall population, with shorter times for single-port transanal tumor resection (SPTTR; 89 ± 51 min; range, 40-153 min) and longer times for proctocolectomy (325 min; range, 110-441 min). Mean hospital stay was approximately 10 days, longer after abdominoperineal rectal resection or proctocolectomy (12-16 days). Most complications occurred following sigmoid colectomy with high AR or left hemicolectomy [19/25 (76 %) of early and 4/5 (80 %) of late complications, respectively]. Pain was <4 on a scale of 0-10 in all cases on postoperative day 1, and typically decreased during the next 2 days. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the feasibility and tolerability of colorectal surgery, conducted by experienced laparoscopic surgeons without specific training in use of the SILS port.","Vestweber, Boris; Galetin, Thomas; Lammerting, Kathrin; Paul, Claudia; Giehl, Jeanette; Straub, Eberhard; Kaldowski, Bodo; Alfes, Angelika; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",Surgical endoscopy,763,16

Here, we present evidence that organismal death is accompanied by a common and sequential molecular flood of stress-induced events that propagate the senescence phenotype, and this phenotype is preserved in the proteome after death. We demonstrate activation of ""death"" pathways involvement in diseases of ageing, with biochemical mechanisms mapping onto neurological damage, embryonic development, the inflammatory response, cardiac disease and ultimately cancer with increased significance. There is sufficient bioavailability of the building blocks required to support the continued translation, energy, and functional catalytic activity of proteins. Significant abundance changes occur in 1258 proteins across 1 to 720 h post-mortem of the 12-week-old mouse mandible. Protein abundance increases concord with enzyme activity, while mitochondrial dysfunction is evident with metabolic reprogramming. This study reveals differences in protein abundances which are akin to states of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). The control of these pathways is significant for a large number of biological scenarios. Understanding how these pathways function during the process of cellular death holds promise in generating novel solutions capable of overcoming disease complications, maintaining organ transplant viability and could influence the findings of proteomics through ""deep-time"" of individuals with no historically recorded cause of death.","Wasinger, Valerie C; Curnoe, Darren; Boel, Ceridwen; Machin, Naomi; Goh, Hsiao Mei",International journal of molecular sciences,763,16

The purpose was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in valvular and perivalvular complications in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and to compare CT results with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and intraoperative findings. METHODS The retrospective study included 44 consecutive patients with PVE who underwent cardiac surgery. The mean age was 59.6 ± 12.9 years, 33 (75 %) were males. The presence of vegetations, abscess/pseudoaneurysm, paravalvular leakage (PVL) and inflammatory infiltration were evaluated by TTE, TEE and CT prior to surgery and the results were compared with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Endocarditis affected 47 valves (26 mechanical, 21 biological) in 44 patients. PVE most often affected the aortic valve (n = 36), followed by the mitral valve (n = 9) and the pulmonary valve (n = 2). In the per-valve analysis, the sensitivity of TTE, TEE and CT in diagnosing vegetations was 65 %, 91 % and 96 %; abscess 44 %, 77 % and 89 %; paravalvular leakage 90 %, 100 % and 70 %; inflammatory infiltration 39 %, 56 % and 78 %, respectively. The combination of CT and echocardiography allowed the detection of abscesses/pseudoaneurysms and inflammatory infiltration in all cases except one. CONCLUSION CT was superior to echocardiography in the diagnosis of paravalvular abscesses, vegetations and inflammatory infiltration. Echocardiography had a higher diagnostic value to CT in the evaluation of paravalvular leakage. Cardiac CT combined with echocardiography improves the diagnostic accuracy of PVE and both modalities should be performed.","Michałowska, Ilona; Stokłosa, Patrycjusz; Miłkowska, Małgorzata; Zakrzewski, Dariusz; Nieznańska, Małgorzata; Kwiatek, Paweł; Lewandowska, Sylwia; Kuśmierski, Krzysztof; Kołsut, Piotr; Kuśmierczyk, Mariusz; Kuriata, Jarosław; Zatorska, Karina; Hryniewiecki, Tomasz",European journal of radiology,763,28

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and undergoing swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were analysed looking for predictors of test positivity. Eight significant predictors were identified and used to build a 'complete' CBC score with a discriminatory power for COVID-19 diagnosis of AUC 92% (p<0.0001). When looking at the weight of individual variables, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, platelets and eosinophils (MAPE: MCV ≤90 fL, 65 points; age ≥45 years, 100 points; platelets ≤180×103/μL, 73 points; eosinophils <0.01/μL, 94 points) gave the highest contribution and were used to build a 'simplified' MAPE score with a discriminatory power of AUC 88%. By setting the cut-off MAPE score at ≥173 points, sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis were 83% and 82%, respectively, and the actual test positivity rate was 60% as compared to 6% of patients with MAPE score <173 points (odds ratio 23.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-58.3, p-value <0.0001). In conclusion, CBC-based scores have potential for optimising the SARS-CoV-2 testing process: if these findings are confirmed in the future, swab tests may be waived for subjects with low score and uncertain symptoms, while they may be considered for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients with high scores.","Formica, Vincenzo; Minieri, Marilena; Bernardini, Sergio; Ciotti, Marco; D'Agostini, Cartesio; Roselli, Mario; Andreoni, Massimo; Morelli, Cristina; Parisi, Giusy; Federici, Massimo; Paganelli, Carla; Legramante, Jacopo M",Clinical medicine,763,7

Vascular-type pathology and mixed pathology are respectively two and three times more likely in demented patients. The summary proportion of dementia is 77%-86% in subjects with mixed degenerative and vascular pathology and 45% in subjects with pure Alzheimer-type pathology.

Most are found incidentally and rupture in the nonpregnant patient has an approximate 25 to 36% mortality rate. Historically these have been managed with an open surgical approach for resection. METHODS We present the case of a 43-year-old man with a recent episode of bacterial endocarditis with an incidental finding of a large 6-cm splenic artery aneurysm. There was noted to be splenic vein occlusion and multiple splenic infarcts versus abscesses on preoperative imaging. There were concerns that this represented a mycotic aneurysm. He underwent laparoscopic en bloc splenic artery aneurysm resection with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with preoperative prophylactic balloon catheter placement. RESULTS His large splenic artery aneurysm was adjacent to the splenic hilum. Due to the splenic vein occlusion, there were large collateral vessels complicating the dissection. Additionally, the aneurysm had dense adhesions to the tail of the pancreas from a desmoplastic reaction. To safely remove the aneurysm, a distal pancreatectomy was included with resection of the spleen. The specimen was successfully removed intact using the laparoscopic approach. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. Final pathology revealed no evidence of bacterial etiology. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy is an appropriate minimally invasive option for the treatment of splenic artery aneurysms. This video demonstrates the technical challenges and management options for successfully completing a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in the face of a splenic artery aneurysm.","Grover, Brandon T; Gundersen, Sigurd B; Kothari, Shanu N",Surgical endoscopy,763,27

Processes involved in aneurysm occlusion include changes in intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics and endothelialization of the device. Here, we call attention to a radiographic sign not previously reported that is detected in incompletely occluded aneurysms after treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device at angiographic follow-up and referred to as the ""collar sign."" MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of all patients who underwent placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device for cerebral aneurysms between January 2014 and May 2016 was performed. All aneurysms found to show the collar sign at follow-up were included. Optical coherence tomography was performed in 1 case. RESULTS One hundred thirty-five aneurysms were treated in 115 patients. At angiographic follow-up, 17 (10.7%) aneurysms were found to be incompletely occluded. Ten (58.8%) of these aneurysms (average diameter, 7.9 ± 5.0 mm) were found to have the collar sign at angiographic follow-up (average, 5.5 ± 1.0 months). Four (40.0%) of the aneurysms underwent a second angiographic follow-up (average, 11.0 ± 0.9 months) after treatment, and again were incompletely occluded and showing the collar sign. Two patients underwent retreatment with a second Pipeline Embolization Device. Optical coherence tomography showed great variability of endothelialization at the proximal end of the Pipeline Embolization Device. CONCLUSIONS The collar sign appears to be indicative of endothelialization, but continued blood flow into the aneurysm. This is unusual given the processes involved in aneurysm occlusion after placement of the Pipeline Embolization Device and has not been previously reported.","Griessenauer, C J; Gupta, R; Shi, S; Alturki, A; Motiei-Langroudi, R; Adeeb, N; Ogilvy, C S; Thomas, A J",AJNR.

However, ethical and technical challenges have hampered the identification of novel blood-borne pathogens in these animals. We recently examined RNA viruses in plasma from wild African monkeys and discovered several novel, highly divergent viruses belonging to the family Arteriviridae. Close relatives of these viruses, including simian hemorrhagic fever virus, have caused sporadic outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaque monkeys since the 1960s. However, arterivirus infection in wild nonhuman primates had not been described prior to 2011. The arteriviruses recently identified in wild monkeys have high sequence and host species diversity, maintain high viremia, and are prevalent in affected populations. Taken together, these features suggest that the simian arteriviruses may be ""preemergent"" zoonotic pathogens.

The special issue was conceived as an interdisciplinary approach to questions of the EU’s legitimacy in the aftermath of structural crises (the eurozone, sovereign debt and the election and appointment of governing agents) and spontaneous crises (migration, external state and non-state security challenges, Brexit and Euroscepticism). Since the special issue’s conception the unanticipated Covid-19 pandemic, and responses from the EU and its member states (current and former) starkly illuminated debates on how the EU should operate, the limits of its power and the limits of its popular legitimacy. The era of passive consensus has been replaced by claims of legitimacy based on active expert-informed intervention, alongside populist claims of the EU’s inherent illegitimacy as an undemocratic technocracy. As such the special issue’s objective is to critically analyse manifold ways in which the populisttechnocratic divide is narrated and performed in different regions, disciplines, and social and political systems in an era of growing internal and external challenges to the Union. We observe that the EU’s institutions remain highly adaptable in responding to challenges, but that member-states have continued and accelerated a tendency to nationalise success and Europeanise failure, with the EU acting as a perennial scapegoat largely due to the ease with which it can be narrated as a site of projection for mistrust, resentment, and social grievances. We argue that the relationship between populism and technocracy is rapidly evolving from an imagined binary into a much more fluid, overlapping, and reversible set of political narratives. We conclude that despite the changing nature of populist-technocratic debates and the resilience and adaptability of the EU, it faces accelerating challenges to its legitimacy in the new era of ‘politics of necessity’. © 2021, Journal of Contemporary European Research.

The main research problem is to know if the ECPT improves the learning to learn competence after a challenge-based learning (CBL) linked to virtual tour in a museum. The main objective was to improve the learning to learn competence, during a virtual tour at the Community of Madrid Regional Archaeological Museum (MAR) (Alcalá de Henares, Spain) for a reflective training of students to understand problems of the past and present and future global challenges, promote collaborative and multidisciplinary work, and defend ethics and leadership. In order to ascertain the level of acquisition of this competence in those teachers who were being trained, their self-perception—pretest–posttest—of the experience was assessed through a system of categories adapted from the European Commission. ECPT worked, in small groups and using e/m-learning tools, ten challenges and one storytelling cooperatively with university teachers to solve prehistoric questions related to current situations and problems. Subsequently, two Early Childhood Education teachers from a school in Alcalá de Henares reviewed the proposals and adapted them for application in the classroom of 5-year-old boys and girls.

Complicaciones del control prenatal y resultado perinatal,17.746685,-1.0958121,2021,"Based on the trend of global aging, people are paying more and more attention to the health of the elderly and the improvement of green open spaces. However, few studies have focused on strategies to improve green spaces in response to this trend. Especially, with the outbreak of COVID-19, an urgent need to develop a sustainable system strategy to improve the health of the elderly in residential communities in old districts has emerged. Traditional improvement strategies based on current situation evaluation often focus on the most prominent practical problems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide theoretical research and practical improvement strategies for green open spaces in old downtown residential communities to improve the health and well-being of the elderly. In response to this problem, this research proposes an alternative method based on causality (FDM-DANP-mV model), by extracting 23 green open space elements that affect the health of the elderly and dividing them into three dimensions, to form a preliminary evaluation framework. On this basis, the more effective and feasible standard elements are screened out, and the influence relationship behind the elements is clarified. Then, the sustainable development strategy is systematically discussed in three practical cases. This allows for the analysis of the present situation to not only identify the current significant problems but also to capture the source of the influence behind the real problems based on the clarification of the dominant influence relationship. The actual value of this study is to provide a key design decision basis for the improvement of the green open spaces in old downtown residential communities, aiming at avoiding waste to the greatest extent under the premise of limited resources and gradually promoting the improvement of the urban built environment to promote the health and well-being of the elderly.","Li, S.

The worldwide COVID-19 lockdown has only amplified the issue. The extended period of lockdown and virtual classes has increased college students' time on their electronic gadgets. The debilitating health effect of excessive usage of gadgets has been well established. There are an array of effects like headache, nausea, ophthalmological concerns and psychological outcomes associated with gadget use for extended periods. The study aims to understand the difference in time spent using gadgets before and during the lockdown and the associated health impacts. The study included 348 participants (n=348), consisting of 183 female and 165 male participants. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire through Google forms from college students after obtaining consent. The results suggested that the average time spent on gadgets increased from 4.75hrs/day before lockdown to 11.36hrs/day during lockdown among participants. Most health complaints like headaches, insomnia, eye complaints, tiredness and restlessness were associated with gadget use during the lockdown. The percentage of participants experiencing these complaints during lockdown was also significantly higher than before lockdown. By understanding the effects of gadget use, it would be possible to create interventions and suggest ways to manage the excessive use of gadgets. It is of prime importance to handle the issue considering the quality of life and wellbeing of students.","Pachiyappan, T.; Kumar, O.

An electronic-questionnaire served as primary research instrument and was distributed through social media platforms to which 80 out of 250 responses were selected. Simple quantitative analysis such as mean value, frequency distribution and percentage were utilized. Results showed that the most of the respondent’s diet has wellness, social and psychological influence. Organic diet desires and self-cooking practices are continuing to grow. The study also showed that the essential aspects of food choice, health, quality and safety are increasingly being taken into account. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the habits of food intake to healthier, influencing even the preference of consumed food. Thus, this study can be used as a theoretical guide especially for factors influencing the eating patterns during a pandemic.

Concerns were raised about the impact of these restrictions on young children's emotional wellbeing. The aim of this study was to explore parents' perceptions of young children's emotional wellbeing during these COVID-19 restrictions. Methods We interviewed 20 parents of children 3-4 years due to begin school in England in September 2020. Interviews were conducted via telephone (n=18) and video call (n=2), audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interviews focused on childcare arrangements, children's behaviour and transition to school. A sample of transcripts were coded line-by-line to create a coding framework, which was subsequently applied to the remaining transcripts. Coded data were then analysed using a nurture lens to develop themes and further understanding. Results Participants were predominantly mothers (n=16), White British (n=10), and educated to degree level (n=13), with half the sample living in the highest deprivation quintile in England (n=10). Five were single parents. Three themes developed from nurturing concepts were identified: creating age-appropriate explanations; understanding children's behaviour; concerns about school transition. Parents recognised their children's emotional wellbeing was impacted but attempted to support their young children whilst looking ahead to their transition to primary school. Conclusions This study is one of the first to examine in-depth the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on young children's emotional wellbeing. The longer-term impacts are not yet understood. Although young children may be unable to understand in detail what the virus is, they undoubtedly experience the disruption it brings to their lives. The wellbeing of families and children needs to be nurtured as they recover from the effects of the pandemic to allow them to thrive.","Chambers, S.; Clarke, J.; Kipping, R.; Langford, R.; Brophy, R.; Hannam, K.

The quantitative investigation was performed using GARCH approach. In the survey, the GARCH model (1,1) was applied to explore the volatility of the BET and BSE traded shares. Conditional volatility for the daily return series showed noticeable evidence of volatility that shifts over the explored period. In the first quarter of 2020, the Romanian equity market volatility increased to a level very close to that recorded during the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. Over the next two quarters, volatility had a downward trend. Besides, after VAR estimation, no causal connection was found among the COVID-19 variables and the BET index.","Gherghina, Ștefan Cristian Armeanu Daniel Ștefan Joldeș Camelia Cătălina",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,763,17

In particular, we argue that the coronavirus 2019 pandemic reveals the contemporary and particular nature of the relationship between football and its supporters, which is increasingly focused on the consumption of themed digital participatory experiences. During this pandemic, what fans missed was not only live football, but also the sporting ?experience? and the opportunities for participation that this provides. Hence, here we saw fans, clubs and media providers employing new digital technologies to create themed experiences that facilitated (and mediated) participation and interaction. Following ?i?ek (2014), we suggest that the coronavirus 2019 pandemic can be understood as a global mega event that creates a seismic, reality alerting schism, whose aftermath requires new ontologies and theories. Our response is to utilise a number of key and illustrative examples and to offer a new synthesis of theories and literatures, most notably, on the experience society, theming, participatory culture, neoliberalism and digital culture. This new context and (re)combination of theories then provides a new, and essential, perspective that reveals a great deal about the contemporary nature of the sport, what fans buy into, and also, how this may change post pandemic.","Crawford, Garry Fenton Alex Chadwick Simon Lawrence Stefan",International Review for the Sociology of Sport,763,9

Men chronically exposed to training for endurance sports exhibit persistently reduced basal free and total testosterone concentrations without concurrent luteinizing hormone elevations. These men are deemed to have the ""Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition"" (EHMC). Broadly, dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis is associated with either of these states. In women this effect on the axis is linked to the existence of a low energy availability (LEA) state, research in men relative to LEA is ongoing. The exact physiological mechanism inducing the reduction of testosterone in these men is currently unclear but is postulated to be a dysfunction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis. The potential exists for the reduced testosterone concentrations within EHMC men to be disruptive and detrimental to some anabolic-androgenic testosterone-dependent physiological processes. Findings, while limited, suggest spermatogenesis problems may exist in some cases; thus, infertility risk in such men is a critical concern. Present evidence suggests the EHMC condition is limited to men who have been persistently involved in chronic endurance exercise training for an extended period of time, and thus is not a highly prevalent occurrence. Nevertheless, it is critical that endocrinologist and fertility clinicians become more aware of the existence of EHMC as a potential problem-diagnosis in their male patients who exercise.","Lane, Amy R; Magallanes, Carlos A; Hackney, Anthony C",Archivos de medicina del deporte : publicacion de la Federacion Espanola de Medicina del Deporte,763,7

We have investigated extra-articular cartilage involvement in two commonly used animal models for RA, collagen-induced and pristane-induced arthritis, by immunizing rats with different susceptibility to disease (LEW.1 A, LEW.1F and DA rats). We found that nasal and tracheolaryngeal cartilage is affected in LEW.1 A and DA rats to varying degrees in collagen-induced arthritis but not in any strain in the pristane-induced model. Antibodies to matrilin-1, a cartilage-specific protein expressed mainly in tracheolaryngeal and nasal cartilage but not in joints, were positively associated with the presence of inflammation in nasal cartilage. In contrast, no antibody response to matrilin-1 could be detected in pristane-induced arthritis. In addition, nasal vaccination with collagen type II prior to immunization in DA rats significantly decreased the antibody response to matrilin-1 at day 56, but not at earlier time points, indicating a late protective effect on extra-articular cartilage. We conclude that pristane-induced arthritis is a joint-specific model whereas collagen-induced arthritis affect joints as well as extra-articular cartilage.

METHODS Klenow-FragELTM DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit and immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase detection reagent kit were used to detect cell apoptosis and expressions of CD68, CD20, CD4, CD8 and CD45RA in the pathological tissues of SARS patients. RESULTS Apoptotic cells increased significantly in the spleen, lung and lymph nodes of SARS patients as compared with normal tissues. The apoptotic cells included pneumocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, and CD68+ monocytes were observed in abundance in the lung, spleen and lymph nodes of SARS patients. In the lung tissue of the patients, few CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells and CD4+/CD8+ T cells were spotted, and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells along with CD4+/CD8+ T cells were also significantly decreased in the spleen and lymph nodes, where few conserved B and T cells underwent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Apoptosis is a general phenomenon in SARS, and the invasive cells in the pathological tissues are primarily monocytes, suggesting that apoptosis and invasion of monocyte play important roles in the progression of SARS. The cell apoptosis and decreased number of T cell and B cells in the lungs and CD4+/CD8+ T cells and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes indicate that the SARS virus may exercise immune cell-killing effect to some extent during its pathogenesis.","Zhang, Qing-ling; Ding, Yan-qing; He, Li; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Jin-hua; Wang, Hui-jun; Cai, Jun-jie; Geng, Jian; Lu, Yao-dan; Luo, Yuan-long",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,763,17

In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, viral entry is reported to require a low pH in intracytoplasmic vesicles; however, little is known about how SARS-CoV invades such compartments. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious SARS-CoV, as well as a SARS-CoV pseudovirus packaged in the SARS-CoV envelope. The SARS-CoV entered caveolin-1-negative HepG2 cells, and the entry was significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine, an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing for the clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV entered COS7 cells transfected with the mutant of ACE2 with the cytoplasmic tail deleted, SARS-CoV receptor, as well as the wild-type ACE2, and their entries were significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine. In addition, ACE2 translocated into EEA1-positive early endosomes immediately after the virus attachment to ACE2. These results suggest that when SARS-CoV binds ACE2 it is internalized and penetrates early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner and that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is not required for the penetration of SARS-CoV.","Inoue, Yuuki; Tanaka, Nobuyuki; Tanaka, Yoshinori; Inoue, Shingo; Morita, Kouichi; Zhuang, Min; Hattori, Toshio; Sugamura, Kazuo",Journal of virology,763,1

Infection through ingestion of contaminated water has been widely documented; C. parvum was reported to be responsible for the largest waterborne outbreak of infectious disease in US history.

Thus, control of C. parvum infection in both animals and humans remains an important objective. Research in our laboratory has focused on understanding mechanisms of resistance to C. parvum. We have demonstrated that acquisition of intestinal flora increases resistance to C. parvum. Substances present in the intestinal mucosa of adult animals can transfer resistance when fed to susceptible infants. Both expression of intestinal enzymes and rate of proliferation of epithelial cells may be altered following C. parvum infection.

The recent epidemiological studies indicated that hMPV is the second most frequently detected virus in LRTIs of young children, following the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by fibrosis of the distal respiratory airways. It is usually a result of an inflammatory process triggered by a LRTI related to adenovirus, RSV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, measles virus, Legionella pneumophila, influenza virus or Bordetella pertussis as a causative agent. In this report, a case of hMPV bronchiolitis complicated with BO has been reported to point out the complications and severity of the clinical progress belongs to this virus. A three-month-old female patient has admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit with the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and respiratory failure. She was born at term, weighing 2950 gram and had been hospitalized in newborn intensive care unit for 11 days with the diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn and neonatal sepsis. On auscultation, there were bilateral crepitant rales, wheezing and prolonged expirium. Her oxygen saturation was 97-98% while respiratory support was given with a non-rebreathing reservoir mask. Complete blood count, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were in normal ranges. The chest radiography yielded right middle lobe atalectasia, left paracardiac infiltration and bilateral air trapping. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was analyzed by a commercial multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific®, USA) developed for the detection of 15 respiratory viruses. Her sample yielded positive result for only hMPV. On the 4th day of hospitalization, the patient was intubated because of respiratory failure and carbon dioxide retention. She was extubated on the 19th day but could not tolerate. In the thorax computed tomography (CT), bilateral hyperinflation, patchy infiltration, mosaic perfusion and atelectasis especially bilateral posterior areas were detected. Bronchoscopy was normal except mild bronchomalacia in right middle lobe bronchus. The patient was diagnosed as BO secondary to hMPV bronchiolitis, according to the clinical, virological, bronchoscopic and thorax CT results. On the 76th day of admission, she was discharged with respiratory support with home ventilation via a tracheostomy cannula and medical treatments of oral metilprednisolone, nebulized salbutamol and budesonide.

C3H mice were found to be fully susceptible up to the age of 20 days and resistant after 23 days of age. Protection of susceptible animals from death due to infection could be achieved by maternal antibodies or by transfer of spleen cells from immunized, but not from nonimmunized, donor mice. Lack of protection by transfer of unprimed adult spleen cells was not related to immunosuppression by the host. Moreover, resistance of adult mice could not be abrogated by application of lymphocytes from suckling mice, although immune suppression by other means did affect the resistance of adult animals. On the other hand, spleen cells from nonimmunized mice could be primed with inactivated JHM virus in suckling mice and protected these mice from death due to a subsequent virus infection. Thus, the outcome of infection with JHM virus in suckling and adult mice can be influenced by immunological events, but is not exclusively due to the different stages of immune competence.","Pickel, K; Müller, M A; ter Meulen, V",Infection and immunity,763,1

The main source of financing is social contributions, proportional to income. The provision of care is based on the principles of independent medical practice, free choice of physician and care facility, and predominantly fee-for-service payment. The Belgian population enjoys good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to the population's good access to many high-quality health services. However, some challenges remain in terms of appropriateness of pharmaceutical care (overuse of antibiotics and psychotropic drugs), reduced accessibility for mental health and dental care due to higher user charges, socioeconomic inequalities in health status and the need for further strengthening of prevention policies. The system must also continue to evolve to cope with an ageing population, an increase of chronic diseases and the development of new technologies. This Belgian HiT profile (2020) presents the evolution of the health system since 2014, including detailed information on new policies. The most important reforms concern the transfer of additional health competences from the Federal State to the Federated entities and the plan to redesign the landscape of hospital care. Policy-makers have also pursued the goals of further improving access to high-quality services, while maintaining the financial sustainability and efficiency of the system, resulting in the implementation of several measures promoting multidisciplinary and integrated care, the concentration of medical expertise, patient care trajectories, patient empowerment, evidence-based medicine, outcome-based care and the so-called one health approach. Cooperation with neighbouring countries on pricing and reimbursement policies to improve access to (very high price) innovative medicines are also underway. Looking ahead, because additional challenges will be highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis, a focus on the resilience of the system is expected.","Gerkens, Sophie; Merkur, Sherry",Health systems in transition,763,30

Generated from the online-registering system data was specially prepared by the Croatian Tourist Boards.

The paper further discusses the global context of the pandemic situation and local and personal responses that have an important impact on re-directing and tracing eventually new tourism trajectories of the (post)pandemic time. Two principal groups of factors have been recognized as mostly affecting the processes, trends and possible future trajectories have been identified: on the one hand global movement and travel bans and restrictions, on the other hand personal responses reflected in motivation and behavioural changes. Changes that occurred in pandemic time are seen as catalysts for re-enforcement and raised interest in escapism and slow movements in tourism. Instead of seeking to ‘go back to business as usual’, the authors argue to reconsider the trajectories that emerged during the time of the pandemic and to envisage other approaches towards more sustainable tourism.","Šulc, Ivan Fuerst-Bjeliš Borna",Research in Globalization,763,15

METHODS: One of 5 full-time equivalent AMS pharmacists was deployed to support pandemic work and AMS rounds with infectious disease physicians were reduced from 5 to 2 times a week.

Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers' trips are used for acquiring private cars' emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00-8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00-18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be ""greener"" travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","Sui, Yi; Zhang, Haoran; Shang, Wenlong; Sun, Rencheng; Wang, Changying; Ji, Jun; Song, Xuan; Shao, Fengjing",Appl Energy,763,15

Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acid-reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastro-intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic and non-electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Both authors double checked the reference lists of the searches Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 26 April 2021. On the 26 April 2021 further searches were conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov register to identify any ongoing trials that may be of relevance. The WHO ICTRP database was last searched in 2020 and is not currently available for searching due to the Covid-19 pandemic. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials involving agents that reduce gastric acidity compared to placebo or a comparator treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: The searches identified 40 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Meta-analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a cross-over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive meta-analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias. However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastro-intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions.","Ng, Sze May; Moore, Helen S",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,763,16

There is a lot of evidence for the possible role of oxidative stress in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the current study, we aimed to measure the levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) in the serum of patients with Covid-19. A total of 96 individuals with and without Covid-19 were enrolled and divided into four groups, including hospitalized group in non-intensive care units (non-ICU) (n=35), hospitalized group in intensive care units with endotracheal intubation (EI) (ICU with EI) (n=19), hospitalized group in intensive care units without endotracheal intubation (ICU without EI) (n=24), and healthy people without Covid-19 disease as our control group (n=18).The present study revealed that the TOS level was significantly lower in the group of control (P = 0.001), and level of (GSH) remarkably increased in the patients' groups (P < 0.001). TAC activity in non-ICU group of patients had no significant difference in comparison with control group. However, in hospitalized patients' groups in ICU with and without EI this activity was significantly different from control group (P<0.001). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the levels of TOS, GSH, and TAC with blood Oxygen saturation (SpO2), fever, duration of hospitalization, and the prognosis of this disease (P<0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) (CI, 95%) of TOS, TAC and GSH-C to predict death among patients were respectively 0.907 (0.841, 0.973), 0.735 (0.626, 0.843) and 0.820 (0.725, 0.914). ROC curve analysis showed that TOS, TAC and GSH-C have the potential specificity and sensitivity to distinguish between alive and dead patients. We found that elevated levels of oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidant indices can aggravate disease's severity in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Therefore, it can be suggested to apply antioxidant agents as one of the effective therapeutic strategies in these groups.","Karkhanei, Behrouz; Ghane, Elaheh Talebi; Mehri, Fereshteh",New Microbes New Infect,763,26

Our focus is the computational analysis of meaning of short scientific texts (abstracts or brief reports). In this paper, a vector space model is developed for quantifying the meaning of words and texts. We introduce the Meaning Space, in which the meaning of a word is represented by a vector of Relative Information Gain (RIG) about the subject categories that the text belongs to, which can be obtained from observing the word in the text. This new approach is applied to construct the Meaning Space based on Leicester Scientific Corpus (LSC) and Leicester Scientific Dictionary-Core (LScDC). The LSC is a scientific corpus of 1,673,350 abstracts and the LScDC is a scientific dictionary which words are extracted from the LSC. Each text in the LSC belongs to at least one of 252 subject categories of Web of Science (WoS). These categories are used in construction of vectors of information gains. The Meaning Space is described and statistically analysed for the LSC with the LScDC. The usefulness of the proposed representation model is evaluated through top-ranked words in each category. The most informative n words are ordered. We demonstrated that RIG-based word ranking is much more useful than ranking based on raw word frequency in determining the science-specific meaning and importance of a word. The proposed model based on RIG is shown to have ability to stand out topic-specific words in categories. The most informative words are presented for 252 categories. The new scientific dictionary and the 103,998 x 252 Word-Category RIG Matrix are available online. Analysis of the Meaning Space provides us with a tool to further explore quantifying the meaning of a text using more complex and context-dependent meaning models that use co-occurrence of words and their combinations.","Suzen, Neslihan; Mirkes, Evgeny M.; Gorban, Alexander N.",,763,16

Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

Some evidence suggests that infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) produces a 'cytokine storm', which is related to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction leading to physiological deterioration and death. It is important to highlight the state of hypercoagulability that can be triggered, involving microvascular thrombosis and vascular occlusive events, which are relevant to such poor outcomes. At present, no specific antiviral drug or vaccine is available for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and current research is aimed at preventing and mitigating damage to the target organs, mainly the lungs. In seeking therapies for patients with COVID-19, immunomodulators, cytokine antagonists and early anti-coagulation therapies have been tested in attempts to reduce the mortality rate. Pentoxifylline, a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor widely used to improve the rheological properties of blood, has beneficial anti-inflammatory properties and can significantly reduce the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein and other immunoregulators. It has also been found to exert anti-thrombotic, antioxidant and anti-fibrogenic actions. These properties could help to prevent or mitigate the inflammatory response and hypercoagulability that develop with SARS-CoV-2 infection, decreasing multi-organ dysfunction manifesting primarily as acute lung injury.","González-Pacheco, H; Amezcua-Guerra, L M; Sandoval, J; Arias-Mendoza, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,763,20

Recent research on mammals found that neutrophil concentrations disproportionately increased (scaled hypermetrically) with body mass, a result not predicted by any existing theory. Although the scaling relationship for mammals might predict how leucocyte concentrations scale with body mass in other vertebrates, vertebrate classes are distinct in many ways that might affect their current and historic interactions with parasites and hence the evolution of their immune systems. Subsequently, here, we asked which existing scaling hypothesis best-predicts relationships between body mass and lymphocyte, eosinophil and heterophil concentrations-the avian functional equivalent of neutrophils-among more than 100 species of birds. We then examined the predictive power of body mass relative to life-history variation, as extensive literature indicates that the timing of key life events has influenced immune system variation among species. Finally, we ask whether avian scaling patterns differ from the patterns we observed in mammals. We found that an intercept-only model best explained lymphocyte and eosinophil concentrations among birds, indicating that the concentrations of these cell types were both independent of body mass. For heterophils, however, body mass explained 31% of the variation in concentrations among species, much more than life-history variation (4%). As with mammalian neutrophils, avian heterophils scaled hypermetrically (b = 0.19 ± 0.05), but more steeply than mammals (approx. 1.5 ×; 0.11 ± 0.03). As such, we discuss why birds might require more broadly protective cells compared to mammals of the same body size. Overall, body mass appears to have strong influences on the architecture of immune systems.","Ruhs, Emily Cornelius; Martin, Lynn B; Downs, Cynthia J",Proc Biol Sci,763,20

This inhibition is thought to be the result of zinc diffusion across the synaptic cleft and subsequent binding to the extracellular domain of the NMDAR. However, this model fails to incorporate the observed association of the highly zinc-sensitive NMDAR subunit GluN2A with the postsynaptic zinc transporter ZnT1, which moves intracellular zinc to the extracellular space. Here, we report that disruption of ZnT1-GluN2A association by a cell-permeant peptide strongly reduced NMDAR inhibition by synaptic zinc in mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus synapses. Moreover, synaptic zinc inhibition of NMDARs required postsynaptic intracellular zinc, suggesting that cytoplasmic zinc is transported by ZnT1 to the extracellular space in close proximity to the NMDAR. These results challenge a decades-old dogma on how zinc inhibits synaptic NMDARs and demonstrate that presynaptic release and a postsynaptic transporter organize zinc into distinct microdomains to modulate NMDAR neurotransmission.","Krall, Rebecca F; Moutal, Aubin; Phillips, Matthew B; Asraf, Hila; Johnson, Jon W; Khanna, Rajesh; Hershfinkel, Michal; Aizenman, Elias; Tzounopoulos, Thanos",Sci.

METHODS: Single center observational study comparing IFN-based therapy (interferon ß-1b, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir) vs. FPV in non-critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Allocation to either treatment group was non-random but based on changes to national treatment protocols rather than physicians' selection (quasi-experimental). We examined the association between IFN-based therapy and 28-day mortality using Cox regression model with treatment as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: The study cohort included 222 patients, of whom 68 (28%) received IFN-based therapy. Antiviral therapy was started at a median of 5 days (3-6 days) from symptoms onset in the IFN group vs. 6 days (4-7 days) for the FPV group, P <0.0001.

We compared comorbidities, clinical features and other predictive factors between COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission for intubation/mechanical ventilation and all other COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia. Method: Field data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Selangor, Malaysia, up to 13 April 2020 were used, comprising socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms of COVID-19 cases. ICU admission was determined from medical records. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with ICU admission requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 1287 COVID-19-positive cases were included for analysis. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15.5%) and diabetes (11.0%). More than one third of cases presented with fever (43.8%) or cough (37.1%). Of the 25 cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation, 68.0% had hypertension, 88.0% had fever, 40.0% had dyspnoea and 44.0% were lethargic. Multivariate regression showed that cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation had significantly higher odds of being older (aged 360 years) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.9] and having hypertension (aOR = 5.7), fever (aOR = 9.8), dyspnoea (aOR = 9.6) or lethargy (aOR = 7.9) than cases that did not require intubation/mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation were significantly older, with a higher proportion of hypertension and symptoms of fever, dyspnoea and lethargy.

Bhutan incorporated religion, culture, and tradition in their campaign wherein the royal government collaborated with the Zhung Dratsang, the country's central monastic body, in deciding the most auspicious day for the launch of their vaccination rollout by avoiding the one-month long Dana, selecting the first person to be vaccinated in accordance to the Buddhist astrology, and leading the country in chanting the Sangay Menlha, a mantra believed by many as a powerful prayer in warding off diseases. The launch turned out as a feast for all Bhutanese since it seemingly marked the beginning of the last phase of their COVID-19 struggle.

Technology now has the potential to fully separate reproduction from the human body with the prospect of ectogenesis-the gestation of a fetus outside of the human body. This paper considers the issues that have been caused by the general medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth and the impact that ectogenesis may have on these existing issues. The medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth is criticised for its impact on the relationship between doctors and pregnant women and the way in which doctors treat fetuses. It is argued that ectogenesis may cause more imbalance in the doctor and intended parent relationship and may result in an increased lack of clarity regarding a doctor's duty to the fetus. This paper finds that extensive guidance and revised legislation will be necessary to minimise the impact of ectogenesis on the existing issues caused by the medicalisation of reproduction.,"Adkins, Victoria",J. med. ethics,763,15

Recent phylogenomic studies indicate that the freshwater 'microturbellarian' Bothrioplana semperi may be the closest ancestor to the Neodermata, but this hypothesis receives little morphological support. Therefore, additional morphological and ultrastructural characters that might help understand interrelations within the Neodermata are needed. METHODS: Ultrastructure of the excretory ducts of representatives of the most basal parasitic flatworms (Neodermata), namely monocotylid (Monopisthocotylea) and chimaericolid (Polyopisthocotylea) monogeneans, aspidogastreans (Trematoda), as well as gyrocotylidean and amphilinidean tapeworms (Cestoda), were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: The present study revealed the same pattern of the cytoarchitecture of excretory ducts in all studied species of the basal neodermatans. This pattern is characterised by the presence of septate junctions between the adjacent epithelial cells and lateral ciliary flames along different levels of the excretory ducts. Additionally, a new character was observed in the protonephridial terminal cell of Gyrocotyle urna, namely a septate junction between terminal and adjacent duct cells at the level of the distal extremity of the flame tuft.

Although pixel-level lesion severity labels, e.g. lesion segmentation, can be the most excellent target to build a robust model, collecting enough data with such labels is difficult due to time and labor-intensive annotation tasks. Instead, array-based severity labeling that assigns integer scores on six subdivisions of lungs can be an alternative choice enabling the quick labeling. Several groups proposed deep learning algorithms that quantify the severity of COVID-19 using the array-based COVID-19 labels and localize the lesions with explainability maps. To further improve the accuracy and interpretability, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer tailored for both quantification of the severity and clinically applicable localization of the COVID-19 related lesions. Our model is trained in a weakly-supervised manner to generate the full probability maps from weak array-based labels. Furthermore, a novel progressive self-training method enables us to build a model with a small labeled dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis on the external testset demonstrates that our method shows comparable performance with radiologists for both tasks with stability in a real-world application.","Kim, Gwanghyun; Park, Sangjoon; Oh, Yujin; Seo, Joon Beom; Lee, Sang Min; Kim, Jin Hwan; Moon, Sungjun; Lim, Jae-Kwang; Ye, Jong Chul",,763,19

However, the impact of NPIs has been inconsistent and remains unclear. This study, therefore, aims to measure the impact of major NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) on reducing COVID-19 transmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis research of both randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. We will undertake a systematic search of: MEDLINE, Embase, Allied & Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, ClinicalTrails.Gov for clinical trials on COVID-19, Cochrane Resources on Coronavirus (COVID-19), Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service and Google Scholar for published and unpublished literatures on COVID-19 including preprint engines such as medRxiv, bioRxiv, Litcovid and SSRN for unpublished studies on COVID-19 and will be reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Outcomes of interest for impact analysis will include the reduction of COVID-19 transmission, avoiding crowds and restricting movement, isolating ill and psychological impacts. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist has been used for this protocol. For quality of included studies, we will use the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias for randomised controlled trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach will grade the certainty of the evidence for all outcome measures across studies. Random-effects model for meta-analysis will measure the effect size of NPIs or the strengths of relationships. For quantitative data, risk ratio or OR, absolute risk difference (for dichotomous outcome data), or mean difference or standardised mean difference (for continuous data) and their 95% CIs will be calculated. Where statistical pooling is not possible, a narrative synthesis will be conducted for the included studies. To assess the heterogeneity of effects, I2 together with the observed effects will be evaluated to provide the true effects in the analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval from an institutional review board or research ethics committee is not required as primary data will not be collected. The final results of this study will be published in an open-access peer-reviewed journal, and abstract will be presented at suitable national/international conferences or workshops. We will also share important information with public health authorities as well as with the WHO. In addition, we may post the submitted manuscript under review to medRxiv, or other relevant preprint servers.

Although coagulation abnormalities have found in novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) patients, still little is known about the association between the disease and changes in coagulation parameters. Our purpose is to evaluate the differences between the coagulation parameters between COVID-19 patients and healthy counterparts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted to the present study. We evaluated coagulation value in these patients and in 40 healthy individuals. RESULTS: We found that although there was no significant difference between PT and PTT values in patients and healthy counterparts, the fibrinogen values in patients were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the values of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer in all COVID-19 cases were considerably higher than those in control people (p < 0.05). Of note, FDP and D-dimer in patients with regular COVID-19 infection were lower than patients with severe forms. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the conduction of routine blood coagulation test could be a beneficial supplementary approach for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, our study shed more light on the therapeutic value of anti-coagulant-based treatment for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with severe type of the disease.","Sayyadi, M; Khosravi, M; Ghaznavi-Rad, E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,763,23

India has high patient to rheumatologist ratio, and patients have limited concepts about telemedicine. Thus, we attempted to find the feasibility and acceptance of patients in switching to teleconsultation. The CARE rheumatology clinic at Kerala, India, caters to average 170 (range: 140-240) patients per day. Patients with prefixed appointments had two-level screening for eligibility for teleconsultation. Those eligible were given the option for teleconsultation on the widely available WhatsApp app. Of those who completed teleconsultations, 100 were chosen at random to provide feedback. In the first 7 days, out of 1469 appointments, 975 were found eligible for teleconsultation. Of these, 723 (74%) opted for it. The average footfall in the clinic was reduced to 67 (range 29-117). The proportion of patients accepting teleconsultations increased with time. Amongst the 100 respondents, median satisfaction was 9 (IQR 8-10) and recommendation for continuing was 9.5 (IQR 8-10) on a 0-10 scale. Multivariate analysis showed the recommendation score was dependent on beliefs about social distancing, perceptions about clinical examination, and the satisfaction score of the first teleconsultation. Age, sex, availability of personal video conferencing app or of vehicles did not independently influence this score. Without teleconsultation facilities, three-fourths of the respondents would have stopped drugs or self-medicated. The switch was feasible and accepted by patients. It enabled quick reduction in the number of persons travelling to the centre. Not making the switch could have deprived approximately three-quarters of these patients of proper medical care. Key Points â¢ Patient to rheumatologist ratios in India is heavily skewed and awareness about telemedicine is limited. â¢ Switch to telemedicine was feasible and allowed a decrease in the number of people attending the clinic. â¢ Not switching could have lead to disruption of care or self-medication in a majority of patients.","Shenoy, Padmanabha; Ahmed, Sakir; Paul, Aby; Skaria, Teny Grace; Joby, Joel; Alias, Bazil",Clin Rheumatol,763,15

This results in millions of people being isolated for long periods, which may increase feelings of worry and anxiety. As the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is an often used dysfunctional strategy to cope with such feelings, these restrictions might cause an increase of consumption. Already at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown can increase the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the future. However, up to now little is known about the changes in alcohol-drinking behavior and tobacco smoking in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To address this theme, we investigated the changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption in the German population aged between 18 and 80 years via an online survey. RESULTS: In total, 3,245 persons participated in the survey; 35.5% of them reported an increase in drinking during the lockdown (42.9% did not change their drinking behavior, 21.3% drank less, and 0.3% started drinking). The odds of consuming more alcohol during lockdown were associated with middle age, higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lower agreement with the importance of the restrictions, and consuming alcohol more than once per week before the lockdown. Also, 45.8% of the participants increased their smoking during the lockdown. The odds of smoking more during lockdown were associated with higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is important to start campaigns to inform the general population about potential long-term effects of increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and to raise the health-care professionals' awareness of this topic.","Koopmann, Anne; Georgiadou, Ekaterini; Reinhard, Iris; Müller, Astrid; Lemenager, Tagrid; Kiefer, Falk; Hillemacher, Thomas",Eur Addict Res,763,29

He also complained of fever, cough, and taste alteration. He was referred to Afghan Japan Hospital for COVID-19 testing and tested positive. He was followed on for the treatment of SARS-CoV2. After 2 weeks, the patient tested negative and returned to the dentistry clinic for follow-up. Although there were no other signs of COVID-19, the painful erosive lesion on his tongue persisted. Oral evaluation were performed and the patient was advised to practice good hygiene. After 10 days, we observed an asymptomatic geographic tongue without fever and myalgias and the lesion of dorsal surface of tongue improved from severe condition to moderate.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between February 25 and May 2, 2020, were retrospectively included according to the following criteria: (a) COVID-19 defined as severe based on the WHO interim guidance (i.e., clinical signs of pneumonia plus respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, and/or SpO2 < 90 % on room air); (b) chest radiograph in the acute setting; (c) post-discharge unenhanced chest CT; and (d) post-discharge comprehensive PFT. Imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated in consensus by two readers, and volume of abnormal lung was measured on CT using 3D Slicer software. Differences between demographics, comorbidities, acute radiographic findings, PFT, and post-discharge clinical and laboratory data of patients with normal and abnormal CT findings were assessed by Mann-Whitney or Fisher tests, and the compromised lung volume-PFT association by Pearson correlation after removing possible outliers. RESULTS: At a median of 105 days from symptom onset, 74/91 (81 %) patients had CT abnormalities. The most common CT pattern was combined ground-glass opacity and reticular pattern (46/74, 62 %) along with architectural distortion (68/74, 92 %) and bronchial dilatation (66/74, 89 %). Compromised lung volume had a median value of 15 % [11-23], was higher in dyspneic patients, and negatively correlated with the percentage of predicted DLCO, VA, and FVC values (r = -0.39, -0.5, and -0.42, respectively). These PFT parameters were significantly lower in patients with CT abnormalities. Impairment of DLCO and KCO was found in 12 (13 %) cases, possibly implying an underlying pulmonary vasculopathy in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most severe COVID-19 survivors still had physiologically relevant CT abnormalities about three months after the disease onset, with an impairment of diffusion capacity on PFT. A pulmonary vasculopathy was suggested in a minor proportion of patients.","Balbi, Maurizio; Conti, Caterina; Imeri, Gianluca; Caroli, Anna; Surace, Alessandra; Corsi, Andrea; Mercanzin, Elisa; Arrigoni, Alberto; Villa, Giulia; Di Marco, Fabiano; Bonaffini, Pietro Andrea; Sironi, Sandro",Eur J Radiol,763,15

However, FDG uptake outside lung parenchyma was poorly characterized in detail. We evaluated the extra-parenchymal lung involvement in asymptomatic cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia through 18F-FDG PET-CT. METHODS: A total of 1079 oncologic 18F-FDG PET-CT were performed between February 2 and May 18, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as characteristic ground-glass bilateral CT infiltrates and positive genetic/serologic tests. Nonmetastatic extra-parenchymal lung PET-CT findings were evaluated through qualitative (visual), quantitative (measurements on CT), and semiquantitative (maximum standardized uptake value: SUVmax on PET) interpretation. Clinical data, blood tests, and PET-CT results were compared between patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 23 18F-FDG PET-CT scans with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 and available laboratory data were included: 14 positive (cases) and 9 negative (controls) for COVID-19 infection, representing a low prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia (1.3%). Serum lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimers tended to be increased in COVID-19 cases. Extra-parenchymal lung findings were found in 42.9% of patients with COVID-19, most frequently as mediastinal and hilar nodes with 18F-FDG uptake (35.7%), followed by incidental pulmonary embolism in two patients (14.3%). In the control group, extra-pulmonary findings were observed in a single patient (11.1%) with 18F-FDG uptake located to mediastinal, hilar, and cervical nodes. Nasopharyngeal and hepatic SUVmax were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia, 18F-FDG PET-CT findings are more frequently limited to thoracic structures, suggesting that an early and silent distant involvement is very rare. Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially severe finding raising special concern. PET-CT can provide new pathogenic insights about this novel disease.","Wakfie-Corieh, Cristina Gamila; Blanes García, Alba María; Ferrando-Castagnetto, Federico; Valhondo-Rama, Raquel; Ortega Candil, Aida; Rodríguez Rey, Cristina; Cabrera Martín, María Nieves; García-Esquinas, Marta García; Couto Caro, Rosa María; Pedrera Canal, María; Carreras Delgado, José Luis",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,763,24

Using longitudinal data of 7400 American adults between March 10 and June 23, 2020, the study examines social-distancing and mask-wearing behaviors. We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.","Shin, Su Hyun; Ji, Hyunjung; Lim, HanNa",Soc Sci Med,763,2

A shielded device for air and surface disinfection with UV radiation and ozone has been developed. It contains 28 low intensity (11 W) UV lamps (254 nm) in a specially designed three-dimensional grid to provide a large flow cross-sectional area and long path for the air particles to be irradiated. The device can be used in medical institutions, veterinary clinics, manufacturing plants, public premises, poultry, and livestock farms. It does not generate air-ions and ozone concentrations do not exceed the allowed 8-hour average values. The large number of UV lamps and powerful fans ensure air disinfection in large rooms in a relatively short time (400 m3 h-1). Simultaneously, the floor surface under the appliance is disinfected. Disinfection efficiency tests demonstrated 99.9999% reduction for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas phage 6 aerosols within a single transfer through the system (10 seconds of treatment). The housing of the device protects from direct UV radiation;therefore, people can be in the room during the operation of the device. © 2021, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

No available data exist so far regarding the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: A survey was made at the University of Naples Federico II and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome, on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes toward the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020) and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome (ref. #Ost4-2020). RESULTS: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine during pregnancy (40 [28.2%] vs 102 [71.8%]). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99 [69.7%] vs 43 [30.3%]; chi-square test=24.187; P<.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128 [90.1%] vs 14 [9.9%]; chi-square test=6.091; P=.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75 [52.8%] vs 67 [47.2%]; chi-square test=10.996; P=.001). CONCLUSION: Urgent data are needed on the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counseling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty.","Carbone, Luigi; Mappa, Ilenia; Sirico, Angelo; Di Girolamo, Raffaella; Saccone, Gabriele; Di Mascio, Daniele; Donadono, Vera; Cuomo, Lara; Gabrielli, Olimpia; Migliorini, Sonia; Luviso, Maria; D039,; antonio, Francesco; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Maruotti, Giuseppe Maria",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,763,21

However, the efficacy of HFNC for patients with COVID-19 has not been established. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of HFNC for patients with COVID-19 and describe early predictors of HFNC treatment success in order to develop a prediction tool that accurately identifies the need for upgrade respiratory support therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 treated by HFNC in respiratory wards of 2 hospitals in Wuhan between 1 January and 1 March 2020. Overall clinical outcomes, the success rate of HFNC strategy and related respiratory variables were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were analyzed. Of these, 65 patients (61.9%) showed improved oxygenation and were successfully withdrawn from HFNC. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROX index (SpO2/FiO2*RR) at 6h, 12h and 24h of HFNC initiation were closely related to the prognosis. The ROX index after 6h of HFNC initiation (AUROC, 0.798) had good predictive capacity for outcomes of HFNC. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, young age, gender of female, and lower SOFA score all have predictive value, while a ROX index greater than 5.55 at 6 h after initiation was significantly associated with HFNC success (OR, 17.821; 95% CI, 3.741-84.903 p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that HFNC was an effective way of respiratory support in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Several studies have demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is also a potential route. As the pandemic is continuously evolving, and more data are made available, this article highlights the best evidence and practices regarding the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus relevant to GI practice. Published clinical studies have supported that SARS-CoV-2 affects the GI tract and the liver. The largest published dataset comprised of 4243 patients and showed a pooled prevalence of GI symptoms at 17.6%. GI symptoms varied and usually preceded pulmonary symptoms by 1–2 days. These include anorexia (26.8%), nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.5%), and abdominal pain (9.2%). Incidence of liver injury ranges from 15 to 53%. Evidence shows that the severity of COVID-19 infection is compounded by its effects on nutrition, most especially for the critically ill. As such, nutrition societies have recommended optimization of oral diets and oral nutritional supplements followed by early enteral nutrition if nutritional targets are not met, and parenteral nutrition in the distal end of the spectrum. In addition to possible fecal–oral transmission, GI endoscopy procedures, which are considered to be aerosol-generating procedures, contribute to increased risk to GI health-care professionals. Infection prevention measures and guidelines are essential in protecting both patients and personnel.","Aguila, Enrik John T.; Cua, Ian Homer Y.; Dumagpi, Joseph Erwin L.; Francisco, Carlos Paolo D.; Raymundo, Nikko Theodore V.; Sy-Janairo, Marianne Linley L.; Cabral-Prodigalidad, Patricia Anne I.; Lontok, Marie Antoinette DC.",JGH Open,763,15

Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance. Objective: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaWü study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany. Exposures: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay. Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic.","Tönshoff, Burkhard; Müller, Barbara; Elling, Roland; Renk, Hanna; Meissner, Peter; Hengel, Hartmut; Garbade, Sven F; Kieser, Meinhard; Jeltsch, Kathrin; Grulich-Henn, Jürgen; Euler, Julia; Stich, Maximilian; Chobanyan-Jürgens, Kristine; Zernickel, Maria; Janda, Ales; Wölfle, Lena; Stamminger, Thomas; Iftner, Thomas; Ganzenmueller, Tina; Schmitt, Christian; Görne, Tessa; Laketa, Vibor; Olberg, Sylvia; Plaszczyca, Anna; Cortese, Mirko; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Pape, Constantin; Remme, Roman; Huzly, Daniela; Panning, Marcus; Weigang, Sebastian; Giese, Sebastian; Ciminski, Kevin; Ankerhold, Jakob; Kochs, Georg; Schwemmle, Martin; Handgretinger, Rupert; Niemeyer, Charlotte M; Engel, Corinna; Kern, Winfried V; Hoffmann, Georg Friedrich; Franz, Axel R; Henneke, Philipp; Debatin, Klaus-Michael; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg",JAMA pediatr.

Recently, minimally invasive endoscopic techniques via a transorbital superior eyelid approach (ETOA) or endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) have been proposed as viable alternatives to transcranial approaches for orbital tumors. In this study, the authors investigated the feasibility of 360° circumferential access to orbital tumors via both ETOA and EEA. METHODS: Between April 2014 and June 2019, 16 patients with orbital tumors underwent either ETOA or EEA at the authors' institution. Based on the neuro-topographic ""four-zone model"" of the orbit with its tumor epicenter around the optic nerve in the coronal plane, ETOA (n = 10, 62.5%) was performed for tumors located predominantly superolateral to the nerve and EEA (n = 6, 37.5%) for those located predominantly inferomedial to the nerve. Eight patients (50%) presented with intraconal tumors and 8 (50%) with extraconal ones. The orbital tumors included orbital schwannoma (n = 6), cavernous hemangioma (n = 2), olfactory groove meningioma (n = 1), sphenoorbital meningioma (n = 1), chondrosarcoma (n = 1), trigeminal schwannoma (n = 1), metastatic osteosarcoma (n = 1), mature cystic teratoma (n = 1), sebaceous carcinoma (n = 1), and ethmoid sinus osteoma (n = 1). The clinical outcomes and details of surgical techniques were reviewed. RESULTS: Gross-total resection was achieved in 12 patients (75%), near-total resection in 3 (18.8%), and subtotal resection in 1 (6.2%). Eight (88.9%) of the 9 patients with preoperative proptosis showed improvement after surgery, and 4 (66.7%) of the 6 patients with visual symptoms demonstrated improvement. Four (40%) of the 10 patients treated with ETOA experienced partial third nerve palsy immediately after surgery (3 transient and 1 persistent). There have been no postoperative CSF leaks or infections in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Without transcranial approaches requiring temporalis muscle dissection and orbitozygomatic osteotomy, the selection of ETOA or EEA based on a concept of a four-zone model with its epicenter around the optic nerve successfully provides a minimally invasive 360° circumferential access to the entire orbit with acceptable morbidity.","Jeon, Chiman; Hong, Sang Duk; Woo, Kyung In; Seol, Ho Jun; Nam, Do-Hyun; Lee, Jung-Il; Kong, Doo-Sik",J Neurosurg,763,1

At the authors' institution, pneumonia is the most common diagnosis for which azithromycin is used as a treatment for patients who are hospitalized. OBJECTIVE: To compare corrected QT (QTc) interval measurements on electrocardiogram (ECG) before and after inpatient azithromycin treatment for pneumonia. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 642 patients age 18 years and older who were diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with azithromycin at an academic teaching hospital between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. Patients who had an ECG performed both before and after azithromycin treatment were included and divided into 2 groups: those who had 1 dose of azithromycin (Group 1) and those who had 2 doses (Group 2). Patients were excluded if they had a baseline QTc interval on initial ECG greater than or equal to 500 ms, any signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction, any initial dysrhythmia or underlying ECG abnormalities, or absence of pre- and post-ECG results. Outcomes measures included a comparison of QTc intervals on ECG before and after azithromycin, and an analysis of the percentage of patients with a QTc interval measurement greater than 500 ms on ECG after azithromycin treatment. Our primary outcome measurement was the QTc interval measurement on ECG before and after azithromycin in patients treated with azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia. Our secondary outcome measurement was the percentage of patients with a QTc interval measurement of greater than 500 ms on ECG after azithromycin treatment. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate repeated QTc measures of our primary outcome in Group 1 and Group 2. Our secondary outcome was reported as a percentage of total patients with a QTc interval of greater than 500 ms after azithromycin doses on ECG. RESULTS: Of 642 patients, 142 had available pre- and post-EGC results available;100 were included in Group 1 (1 dose) and 42 in Group 2 (2 doses). Mean QTc interval differences after 1 dose of azithromycin exhibited an increase compared to baseline values (424 vs 477 ms). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant QTc prolongation after 1 dose of azithromycin (mean rank, 43.76;Z=-4.921;P<.001). QTc interval differences after 2 doses of azithromycin did not reach statistical significance when compared to baseline values (422 vs 444 ms). A total of 10 patients (10%) in Group 1 and 4 patients (9.5%) in Group 2 had a QTc interval >500 ms after azithromycin. There were no documented dysrhythmias during hospitalization in this study period. CONCLUSION: QTc interval increases were observed during inpatient azithromycin therapy for pneumonia, but were not found to be associated with cardiac dysrhythmias during hospitalization.","Dela Cruz, M.; Ershad, M.; Mostafa, A.",J Osteopath Med,763,1

The scope of this study is to analyze the evolution of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic throughout Italy and factors associated to the different way it spread in the Italian Regions, starting from the day that the first indigenous cases were detected through day 81 (6 days after the end of the strict lockdown). Data were obtained from daily reports and are represented as number (and percentage) of cases/100,000 persons. A lockdown with movement restrictions, especially across Regions, was declared at day 20. At day 81, 219,070 cases (363/100,000 persons) were diagnosed. A regression analysis based on the Gompertz model predicts a total number 233,606 cases (386/100,000 persons) at the end of the epidemic. The 21 areas, divided into Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, showed a wide range in the frequency of cases at day 81 (58-921, median 258/100,000 persons) and total predicted cases (58-946, median 267/100,000 persons). Similarly, the predicted time for the end of the wave of the epidemic (considering as surrogate marker the time at which 99% of the total cases are predicted to occur) was highly variable, ranging from 64 to 136 (median 99) days. We analyzed the impact of local and interventional variables on the epidemic curve in each Region. The number of cases correlated inversely with the distance from the area in which first cases were detected and directly also with the gross domestic product pro capite (as a marker of industrial activity) of the Region. Moreover, an earlier start of the lockdown (i.e. in the presence of a lower number of cases) and wider testing were associated with a lower final number of total cases. In conclusion, this analysis shows that population-wide testing and early lockdown enforcement appear effective in limiting the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.","Lilleri, Daniele; Zavaglio, Federica; Gabanti, Elisa; Gerna, Giuseppe; Arbustini, Eloisa",PLoS One,763,16

The article presents a guide for teacher interactions with students in networked technologies. It also serves as a guide for network designers who are concerned about the quality of online learning, and want more equitable access to systems that inspire young people ""to pursue their interests and take ownership of their learning"" (Nacu et al. 2018, p. 1029). During the Covid-19 pandemic, network platforms assumed a central role in the educational process. The article is a timely reminder of the importance of designing and implementing platforms that will address twenty-first century learning goals. This response to the Nacu et al. article reviews their research from a ""theory of change"" perspective. The authors in the original article present a heuristic that expands the online roles that educators currently use to support young people in building their knowledge. To realize the full potential of the heuristic, a more holistic approach is required, one that repositions online learning as a knowledge-building environment. A theory of change could identify the critical variables needed to help teachers and designers transition to a more comprehensive understanding of online learning. Unfortunately, heuristics by themselves do not prepare network designers or teachers to do this work. Future research can embed the heuristic in a broader, deeper effort to prepare teachers and designers to enact student-centered online learning environments.","Meier, Ellen B",Educ Technol Res Dev,763,26

This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties and criterion validity of the widely used 9-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS) in young gamers. METHODS: Three independent samples were drawn from socio-demographically representative cross-sectional telephone surveys collected in the years 2016 (N = 762), 2017 (N = 777), and 2018 (N = 784) and analyzed separately. RESULTS: The IGDS revealed psychometric properties suitable for screening in large samples. Cronbach's alpha was 0.563, 0.724, and 0.778. The unidimensionality assumption was challenged. At-risk and pathological gamers compared to normal gamers reported longer digital media use and more emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention with clinical relevance to medium effect sizes. The comparison of at-risk and pathological gamers indicated a partial distinction between the two problematic gaming groups. CONCLUSIONS: The IGDS could be shown to be an overall suitable and valid tool to identify pathological gamers in childhood and adolescence according to the DSM-5 criteria on a population level. However, the polythetic structure limits comparability with the recent ICD-11 criteria.

Theoretical and empirical literature implies that individuals who are characterized by catastrophic appraisals of somatic cues, a tendency known as anxiety sensitivity, as well as by older subjective age, might be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety during the pandemic. Furthermore, subjective age might moderate the relations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Yet, research to date has not explored the contribution of both anxiety sensitivity and subjective age in explaining distress following stress in general, nor in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Filling this gap, a convenience sample of 828 participants, (Mage = 43.98, SD = 14.06), filled questionnaires measuring background variables, COVID-19 related stressors, anxiety sensitivity, subjective age, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. RESULTS: Positive associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and subjective age, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression symptoms, on the other. Furthermore, subjective age moderated the associations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Although higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were related to depression and anxiety during the pandemic, these associations were stronger among participants with an older subjective age. DISCUSSION: The findings are consistent with theories that view subjective age as an intra-individual construct involved in modulating important mental health outcomes in the context of coping with stress.","Avidor, Sharon; Abu Hamam, Asmaa; Lahav, Yael",,763,16

We sought to evaluate the effect of SC on reducing attack rate and the need for critical care during COVID-19 outbreaks, while considering scenarios with concurrent implementation of self-isolation (SI) of symptomatic cases. METHODS: We developed an age-structured agent-based simulation model and parameterized it with the demographics of Ontario stratified by age and the latest estimates of COVID-19 epidemiologic characteristics. Disease transmission was simulated within and between different age groups by considering inter- and intra-group contact patterns. The effect of SC of varying durations on the overall attack rate, magnitude and peak time of the outbreak, and requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the population was estimated. Secondly, the effect of concurrent community-based voluntary SI of symptomatic COVID-19 cases was assessed. RESULTS: SC reduced attack rates in the range of 7.2-12.7% when the duration of SC increased from 3 to 16 weeks, when contacts among school children were restricted by 60-80%, and in the absence of SI by mildly symptomatic persons. Depending on the scenario, the overall reduction in ICU admissions attributed to SC throughout the outbreak ranged from 3.3 to 6.7%. When SI of mildly symptomatic persons was included and practiced by 20%, the reduction of attack rate and ICU admissions exceeded 6.3% and 9.1% (on average), respectively, in the corresponding scenarios. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SC may have limited impact on reducing the burden of COVID-19 without measures to interrupt the chain of transmission during both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. While highlighting the importance of SI, our findings indicate the need for better understanding of the epidemiologic characteristics of emerging diseases on the effectiveness of social distancing measures.","Abdollahi, Elaheh; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; Keynan, Yoav; Langley, Joanne M; Moghadas, Seyed M",BMC Med,763,20

Além do cálculo da prevalência da brucelose bovina, foi realizada a caracterização epidemiológica das propriedades em cada uma das cinco áreas e verificada a possibilidade de agrupamento de algumas delas de acordo com as semelhanças existentes. Para o estudo foram colhidas amostras de soro de 7756 animais e questionários epidemiológicos foram aplicados em 1579 propriedades. As prevalências de focos e de animais soropositivos para brucelose bovina no Estado de Santa Catarina foram 0,02% (0,00-0,15%) e 0,06% (0,01-0,40%), respectivamente. Nas áreas 1 e 2, a prevalência de focos foi de 0,00% (0,00-1,23%); na área 3 foi de 0,00% (0,00-0,93%), na área 4 foi de 0,34% (0,00-1,86%) e na área 5 foi de 0,00% (0,00-1,26%). Em relação à prevalência de animais soropositivos para brucelose bovina, com exceção da área 4, cuja prevalência foi de 0,89% (0,13-5,76%), as demais áreas tiveram prevalência de 0,00% (0,00-0,00%). A maioria das propriedades das cinco áreas possui criação extensiva e bovinos mestiços, utiliza ordenha manual e não utiliza inseminação artificial. Com exceção da área 5, cuja maioria é de exploração leiteira, as demais são predominantemente de exploração mista. A área 3, que possui a maior mediana de produção diária de leite (7,5 litros), é a única cuja maioria das propriedades fazem o resfriamento do leite. A área 1 é a que possui maior mediana do número de bovinos (16 bovinos por propriedade). De acordo com as análises realizadas, sugere-se que as áreas 3 e 4 sejam agrupadas","Sikusawa, Suzana",,763,15

Untreated depression during pregnancy may have long-term effects on the mother and offspring. Therefore, delineating the effects of pregnancy on the mental health of reproductive-age women is crucial. This study aims to determine the risk for depressive symptoms in pregnant and non-pregnant women during COVID-19, and to identify its bio-psycho-social contributors. A total of 1114 pregnant and 256 non-pregnant women were recruited via social media in May 2020 to complete an online survey that included depression and anxiety questionnaires, as well as demographic, obstetric and COVID-19-related questionnaires. Pregnant women also completed the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). Pregnant women reported fewer depressive symptoms and were less concerned that they had COVID-19 than non-pregnant women. Among pregnant women, risk factors for depression included lower income, fewer children, unemployment, thinking that one has COVID-19, high-risk pregnancy, earlier gestational age, and increased pregnancy-related stress. Protective factors included increased partner support, healthy behaviors, and positive appraisal of the pregnancy. Thus, being pregnant is associated with reduced risk for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Increased social support, engaging in health behaviors and positive appraisal may enhance resilience. Future studies of pregnant versus non-pregnant women could clarify the role of pregnancy during stressful events, and clarify aspects of susceptibility and resilience during pregnancy.","Yirmiya, Karen; Yakirevich-Amir, Noa; Preis, Heidi; Lotan, Amit; Atzil, Shir; Reuveni, Inbal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),763,8

Albumin oxidation and breakdown affect interactions with bioactive lipid mediators that play important roles in antimicrobial defense and repair. There is bio-mechanistic plausibility for a causal link between hypoalbuminemia and increased risks of primary and secondary infections. Serum albumin levels have prognostic value for complications in viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and for infectious complications of non-infective chronic conditions. Hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of healthcare-associated infections, particularly with Clostridium difficile. In coronavirus disease 2019, hypoalbuminemia correlates with viral load and degree of acute lung injury and organ dysfunction. Non-oncotic properties of albumin affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials. Low serum albumin is associated with inadequate antimicrobial treatment. Infusion of human albumin solution (HAS) supplements endogenous albumin in patients with cirrhosis of the liver and effectively supported antimicrobial therapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence of the beneficial effects of HAS on infections in hypoalbuminemic patients without cirrhosis is largely observational. Prospective RCTs are underway and, if hypotheses are confirmed, could lead to changes in clinical practice for the management of hypoalbuminemic patients with infections or at risk of infectious complications.","Wiedermann, Christian J",Int. j. mol. sci.

High concentrations of SO2 can induce a series of defensive responses in Arabidopsis plants. However, the role of photosynthesis in the plant response to SO2 stress is not clear. Here, we report the photosynthetic responses of Arabidopsis plants to SO2 stress. Exposure to 30 mg/m3 SO2 decreased stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) but increased photosynthetic pigments and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The contents of carbohydrates and sucrose were not altered. The transcript levels of most genes related to photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6/f (Cytb6f), photosystem I (PSI) and carbon fixation were upregulated, revealing one important regulatory circuit for the maintenance of chloroplast homeostasis under SO2 stress. Exposure to SO2 triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, accompanied by increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the contents of cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH) and non-protein thiol (NPT), which maintained cellular redox homeostasis. Together, our results indicated that chloroplast photosynthesis was involved in the plant response to SO2 stress.

Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput nucleic acid testing (NAT) analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for SARS-COV-2. METHODS: We evaluated a new approach of a multiple-swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. Analytical sensitivity was constant up to a total number of 50 swabs. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (5-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (10-sample pools). RESULTS: The novel method did not cause false-negative results with nonsignificantly differing cycle threshold values between single-swab and multiple-swab NAT. In two routine applications, all minipools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. CONCLUSIONS: The new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly. The multiple-swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently. The example in Germany shows that blood transfusion services can support general health systems with their experience in NAT and their high-throughput instruments. Screening of a huge number of inhabitants is currently the only option to prevent a second infection wave and enable exit strategies in many countries.","Schmidt, Michael; Hoehl, Sebastian; Berger, Annemarie; Zeichhardt, Heinz; Hourfar, Kai; Ciesek, Sandra; Seifried, Erhard",Transfusion,763,15

The disease has spread very swiftly worldwide. A timely clue which includes the estimation of the incubation period among COVID-19 patients can allow governments and healthcare authorities to act accordingly. OBJECTIVES: to undertake a review and critical appraisal of all published/preprint reports that offer an estimation of incubation periods for COVID-19. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This research looked for all relevant published articles between the dates of December 1, 2019, and April 25, 2020, i.e. those that were related to the COVID-19 incubation period. Papers were included if they were written in English, and involved human participants. Papers were excluded if they were not original (e.g. reviews, editorials, letters, commentaries, or duplications). SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. CHARTING METHODS: A data-charting form was jointly developed by the two reviewers (NZ and EA), to determine which variables to extract. The two reviewers independently charted the data, discussed the results, and updated the data-charting form. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0 to 14 days) and the ECDC (2 to 12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus.","Zaki, Nazar; Mohamed, Elfadil A.",J Infect Public Health,763,18

We captured the dynamics of infectious virus and viral RNA shedding during acute infection through daily longitudinal sampling of 60 individuals for up to 14 days. By fitting mechanistic models, we directly estimate viral reproduction and clearance rates, and overall infectiousness for each individual. Significant person-to-person variation in infectious virus shedding suggests that individual-level heterogeneity in viral dynamics contributes to superspreading. Viral genome load often peaked days earlier in saliva than in nasal swabs, indicating strong compartmentalization and suggesting that saliva may serve as a superior sampling site for early detection of infection. Viral loads and clearance kinetics of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 viruses were indistinguishable, however B.1.1.7 exhibited a significantly slower pre-peak growth rate in saliva. These results provide a high-resolution portrait of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and implicate individual-level heterogeneity in infectiousness in superspreading.","Ke, R.; Martinez, P.

Barotrauma and overdistension are related to undesirable pressures and might be responsible for morbidity and mortality. In the current work we use computational fluid dynamics to investigate the pressure field in the upper respiratory airways. We performed a set of simulations varying the volumetric flow rate of mechanical ventilators and we have shown that the pressure profile can be calculated by means of the volumetric flow rate in accordance with a mathematical expression given by Pav=aV˙2, where Pav is the average pressure at selected sections of the upper airways and V˙ is the volumetric flow rate. Numerical findings provide evidence that the constant a varies with the location of the plane in the upper airways. We also show that some particular diameters of endotracheal tubes (ETT) must be used with care for a given range of volumetric flow rates. Overall, we document an important relationship among pressure, volumetric flow rate and selected internal diameters from ETT.","Selvaggio, André Zamith; Lisbôa, Sérgio; Vianna, Sávio S V",Medical engineering & physics,763,1

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on comorbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis. The functional prognosis during the hospital period was unfavourable in 73.9% (17/23 modified Rankin scale 4–6), and age was the main predictive variable (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.012–2.225; P = 0.043).

The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day survival or disease severity.","Schlesinger, Tobias; Weißbrich, Benedikt; Wedekink, Florian; Notz, Quirin; Herrmann, Johannes; Krone, Manuel; Sitter, Magdalena; Schmid, Benedikt; Kredel, Markus; Stumpner, Jan; Dölken, Lars; Wischhusen, Jörg; Kranke, Peter; Meybohm, Patrick; Lotz, Christopher",PLoS One,763,1
