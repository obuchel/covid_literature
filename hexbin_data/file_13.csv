13,Vaccinia virus infection disrupts microtubule organization and centrosome function,2000-08-01,"We examined the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton during vaccinia virus infection. We found that newly assembled virus particles accumulate in the vicinity of the microtubule-organizing centre in a microtubule- and dynein–dynactin complex-dependent fashion. Microtubules are required for efficient intracellular mature virus (IMV) formation and are essential for intracellular enveloped virus (IEV) assembly. As infection proceeds, the microtubule cytoskeleton becomes dramatically reorganized in a fashion reminiscent of overexpression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Consistent with this, we report that the vaccinia proteins A10L and L4R have MAP-like properties and mediate direct binding of viral cores to microtubules in vitro. In addition, vaccinia infection also results in severe reduction of proteins at the centrosome and loss of centrosomal microtubule nucleation efficiency. This represents the first example of viral-induced disruption of centrosome function. Further studies with vaccinia will provide insights into the role of microtubules during viral pathogenesis and regulation of centrosome function.","Ploubidou, Aspasia; Moreau, Violaine; Ashman, Keith; Reckmann, Inge; González, Cayetano; Way, Michael",The EMBO Journal,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc306617?pdf=render,13
26,Recombination Every Day: Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi-Cellular Host Infection,2005-03-01,"Viral recombination can dramatically impact evolution and epidemiology. In viruses, the recombination rate depends on the frequency of genetic exchange between different viral genomes within an infected host cell and on the frequency at which such co-infections occur. While the recombination rate has been recently evaluated in experimentally co-infected cell cultures for several viruses, direct quantification at the most biologically significant level, that of a host infection, is still lacking. This study fills this gap using the cauliflower mosaic virus as a model. We distributed four neutral markers along the viral genome, and co-inoculated host plants with marker-containing and wild-type viruses. The frequency of recombinant genomes was evaluated 21 d post-inoculation. On average, over 50% of viral genomes recovered after a single host infection were recombinants, clearly indicating that recombination is very frequent in this virus. Estimates of the recombination rate show that all regions of the genome are equally affected by this process. Assuming that ten viral replication cycles occurred during our experiment—based on data on the timing of coat protein detection—the per base and replication cycle recombination rate was on the order of 2 × 10(−5) to 4 × 10(−5). This first determination of a virus recombination rate during a single multi-cellular host infection indicates that recombination is very frequent in the everyday life of this virus.","Froissart, Remy; Roze, Denis; Uzest, Marilyne; Galibert, Lionel; Blanc, Stephane; Michalakis, Yannis",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1054884/,13
97,Efficient replication of pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) in a mouse macrophage cell line,2007-06-04,"Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae) is a natural respiratory pathogen of rodent species and an important new model for the study of severe viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia. However, despite high virus titers typically detected in infected mouse lung tissue in vivo, cell lines used routinely for virus propagation in vitro are not highly susceptible to PVM infection. We have evaluated several rodent and primate cell lines for susceptibility to PVM infection, and detected highest virus titers from infection of the mouse monocyte-macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Additionally, virus replication in RAW 264.7 cells induces the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines relevant to respiratory virus disease, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-β (IFN-β), macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β (MIP-1α and MIP-1β) and the functional homolog of human IL-8, mouse macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 (MIP-2). Identification and characterization of a rodent cell line that supports the replication of PVM and induces the synthesis of disease-related proinflammatory mediators will facilitate studies of molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis that will complement and expand on findings from mouse model systems.","Dyer, Kimberly D; Schellens, Ingrid MM; Bonville, Cynthia A; Martin, Brittany V; Domachowske, Joseph B; Rosenberg, Helene F",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891281/,13
238,Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways,2009-05-15,"Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.","Scull, Margaret A.; Gillim-Ross, Laura; Santos, Celia; Roberts, Kim L.; Bordonali, Elena; Subbarao, Kanta; Barclay, Wendy S.; Pickles, Raymond J.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673688/,13
278,Evolutionarily Conserved Herpesviral Protein Interaction Networks,2009-09-04,"Herpesviruses constitute a family of large DNA viruses widely spread in vertebrates and causing a variety of different diseases. They possess dsDNA genomes ranging from 120 to 240 kbp encoding between 70 to 170 open reading frames. We previously reported the protein interaction networks of two herpesviruses, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). In this study, we systematically tested three additional herpesvirus species, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), murine cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, for protein interactions in order to be able to perform a comparative analysis of all three herpesvirus subfamilies. We identified 735 interactions by genome-wide yeast-two-hybrid screens (Y2H), and, together with the interactomes of VZV and KSHV, included a total of 1,007 intraviral protein interactions in the analysis. Whereas a large number of interactions have not been reported previously, we were able to identify a core set of highly conserved protein interactions, like the interaction between HSV-1 UL33 with the nuclear egress proteins UL31/UL34. Interactions were conserved between orthologous proteins despite generally low sequence similarity, suggesting that function may be more conserved than sequence. By combining interactomes of different species we were able to systematically address the low coverage of the Y2H system and to extract biologically relevant interactions which were not evident from single species.","Fossum, Even; Friedel, Caroline C.; Rajagopala, Seesandra V.; Titz, Björn; Baiker, Armin; Schmidt, Tina; Kraus, Theo; Stellberger, Thorsten; Rutenberg, Christiane; Suthram, Silpa; Bandyopadhyay, Sourav; Rose, Dietlind; von Brunn, Albrecht; Uhlmann, Mareike; Zeretzke, Christine; Dong, Yu-An; Boulet, Hélène; Koegl, Manfred; Bailer, Susanne M.; Koszinowski, Ulrich; Ideker, Trey; Uetz, Peter; Zimmer, Ralf; Haas, Jürgen",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731838/,13

408,A Clathrin Independent Macropinocytosis-Like Entry Mechanism Used by Bluetongue Virus-1 during Infection of BHK Cells,2010-06-29,"Acid dependent infection of Hela and Vero cells by BTV-10 occurs from within early-endosomes following virus uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Forzan et al., 2007: J Virol 81: 4819–4827). Here we report that BTV-1 infection of BHK cells is also dependent on a low endosomal pH; however, virus entry and infection were not inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of Eps15, AP180 or the ‘aa’ splice variant of dynamin-2, which were shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, infection was not inhibited by depletion of cellular cholesterol, which suggests that virus entry is not mediated by a lipid-raft dependent process such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Although virus entry and infection were not inhibited by the dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant, entry was inhibited by the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, indicating that virus entry is dynamin dependent. During entry, BTV-1 co-localised with LAMP-1 but not with transferrin, suggesting that virus is delivered to late-endosomal compartments without first passing through early-endosomes. BTV-1 entry and infection were inhibited by EIPA and cytochalasin-D, known macropinocytosis inhibitors, and during entry virus co-localised with dextran, a known marker for macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake. Our results extend earlier observations with BTV-10, and show that BTV-1 can infect BHK cells via an entry mechanism that is clathrin and cholesterol-independent, but requires dynamin, and shares certain characteristics in common with macropinocytosis.","Gold, Sarah; Monaghan, Paul; Mertens, Peter; Jackson, Terry",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894058/,13
414,The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection,2010-06-16,"In order to establish an infection, viruses need to either suppress or escape from host immune defense systems. Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response. Viruses have the capacity to suppress or escape from this pattern recognition molecule-mediated antimicrobial response in various ways. In this paper, we review the various strategies used by viruses to modulate the pattern recognition molecule-mediated innate immune response.","Yokota, Shin-ichi; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Fujii, Nobuhiro",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903949/,13
448,In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Identify Important Features of Dengue Virus pr-E Protein Interactions,2010-10-21,"Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.","Zheng, Aihua; Umashankar, Mahadevaiah; Kielian, Margaret",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958806/,13
499,Further Characterisation of the Translational Termination-Reinitiation Signal of the Influenza B Virus Segment 7 RNA,2011-02-08,"Termination-dependent reinitiation is used to co-ordinately regulate expression of the M1 and BM2 open-reading frames (ORFs) of the dicistronic influenza B segment 7 RNA. The start codon of the BM2 ORF overlaps the stop codon of the M1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG and ∼10% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon reinitiate translation at the overlapping AUG. BM2 synthesis requires the presence of, and translation through, 45 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG, known as the ‘termination upstream ribosome binding site’ (TURBS). This region may tether ribosomal 40S subunits to the mRNA following termination and a short region of the TURBS, motif 1, with complementarity to helix 26 of 18S rRNA has been implicated in this process. Here, we provide further evidence for a direct interaction between mRNA and rRNA using antisense oligonucleotide targeting and functional analysis in yeast cells. The TURBS also binds initiation factor eIF3 and we show here that this protein stimulates reinitiation from both wild-type and defective TURBS when added exogenously, perhaps by stabilising ribosome-mRNA interactions. Further, we show that the position of the TURBS with respect to the UAA UG overlap is crucial, and that termination too far downstream of the 18S complementary sequence inhibits the process, probably due to reduced 40S tethering. However, in reporter mRNAs where the restart codon alone is moved downstream, termination-reinitiation is inhibited but not abolished, thus the site of reinitiation is somewhat flexible. Reinitiation on distant AUGs is not inhibited in eIF4G-depleted RRL, suggesting that the tethered 40S subunit can move some distance without a requirement for linear scanning.","Powell, Michael L.; Leigh, Kendra E.; Pöyry, Tuija A.

515,Dengue Virus Virulence and Transmission Determinants,2009-08-22,"The mechanisms of dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis are little understood because we have no models of disease; only humans develop symptoms (dengue fever, DF, or dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) and research has been limited to studies involving patients. DENV is very diverse: there are four antigenic groups (serotypes) and three to five genetic groups (genotypes) within each serotype. Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative virulence or transmissibility of each DENV genotype; both of these factors are important determinants of epidemiology and their measurement is complex because the natural cycle of this disease involves human-mosquito-human transmission. Although epidemiological and evolutionary studies have pointed to viral factors in determining disease outcome, only recently developed models could prove the importance of specific viral genotypes in causing severe epidemics and their potential to spread to other continents. These new models involve infection of primary human cell cultures, “humanized” mice and field-collected mosquitoes; also, new mathematical models can estimate the impact of viral replication, human immunity and mosquito transmission on epidemic behavior. DENV evolution does not seem to be rapid and the transmission and dispersal of stable, replication-fit genotypes has been more important in the causation of more severe epidemics. Controversy regarding viral determinants of DENV pathogenesis and epidemiology will continue until virulence and transmissibility can be measured under various conditions.","Rico-Hesse, R.",Dengue Virus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057078/,13
532,Dissection of the Influenza A Virus Endocytic Routes Reveals Macropinocytosis as an Alternative Entry Pathway,2011-03-31,"Influenza A virus (IAV) enters host cells upon binding of its hemagglutinin glycoprotein to sialylated host cell receptors. Whereas dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is generally considered as the IAV infection pathway, some observations suggest the occurrence of an as yet uncharacterized alternative entry route. By manipulating entry parameters we established experimental conditions that allow the separate analysis of dynamin-dependent and -independent entry of IAV. Whereas entry of IAV in phosphate-buffered saline could be completely inhibited by dynasore, a specific inhibitor of dynamin, a dynasore-insensitive entry pathway became functional in the presence of fetal calf serum. This finding was confirmed with the use of small interfering RNAs targeting dynamin-2. In the presence of serum, both IAV entry pathways were operational. Under these conditions entry could be fully blocked by combined treatment with dynasore and the amiloride derivative EIPA, the hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis, whereas either drug alone had no effect. The sensitivity of the dynamin-independent entry pathway to inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants affecting actomyosin dynamics as well as to a number of specific inhibitors of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream effectors thereof all point to the involvement of macropinocytosis in IAV entry. Consistently, IAV particles and soluble FITC-dextran were shown to co-localize in cells in the same vesicles. Thus, in addition to the classical dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, IAV enters host cells by a dynamin-independent route that has all the characteristics of macropinocytosis.","de Vries, Erik; Tscherne, Donna M.; Wienholts, Marleen J.; Cobos-Jiménez, Viviana; Scholte, Florine; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Rottier, Peter J.

556,Quantitative Subcellular Proteome and Secretome Profiling of Influenza A Virus-Infected Human Primary Macrophages,2011-05-12,"Influenza A viruses are important pathogens that cause acute respiratory diseases and annual epidemics in humans. Macrophages recognize influenza A virus infection with their pattern recognition receptors, and are involved in the activation of proper innate immune response. Here, we have used high-throughput subcellular proteomics combined with bioinformatics to provide a global view of host cellular events that are activated in response to influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages. We show that viral infection regulates the expression and/or subcellular localization of more than one thousand host proteins at early phases of infection. Our data reveals that there are dramatic changes in mitochondrial and nuclear proteomes in response to infection. We show that a rapid cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, followed by their secretion, contributes to inflammasome activation and apoptosis seen in the infected macrophages. Also, our results demonstrate that P2X(7) receptor and src tyrosine kinase activity are essential for inflammasome activation during influenza A virus infection. Finally, we show that influenza A virus infection is associated with robust secretion of different danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) suggesting an important role for DAMPs in host response to influenza A virus infection. In conclusion, our high-throughput quantitative proteomics study provides important new insight into host-response against influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages.","Lietzén, Niina; Öhman, Tiina; Rintahaka, Johanna; Julkunen, Ilkka; Aittokallio, Tero; Matikainen, Sampsa; Nyman, Tuula A.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093355/,13
600,A modified MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay for the rapid screening of antiviral plant extracts,2010,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional methods of screening plant extracts and purified components for antiviral activity require up to a week to perform, prompting the need to develop more rapid quantitative methods to measure the ability of plant based preparations to block viral replication. We describe an adaption of an MS2 plaque reduction assay for use in S. aureus. RESULTS: MS2 bacteriophage was capable of infecting and replicating in B. cereus, S. aureus and F + E. coli but not F- E. coli. Indeed, both B. cereus and S. aureus were more sensitive to MS2 induced lysis than F+ E. coli. When MS2 bacteriophage was mixed with Camellia sinensis extract (1 mg/ml), Scaevola spinescens extract (1 mg/ml) or Aloe barbadensis juice and the mixtures inoculated into S. aureus, the formation of plaques was reduced to 8.9 ± 3.8%, 5.4 ± 2.4% and 72.7 ± 20.9% of the untreated MS2 control values respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the MS2 plaque reduction assay to detect antiviral activity in these known antiviral plant preparations indicates its suitability as an antiviral screening tool. An advantage of this assay compared with traditionally used cytopathic effect reduction assays and replicon based assays is the more rapid acquisition of results. Antiviral activity was detected within 24 h of the start of testing. The MS2 assay is also inexpensive and non-pathogenic to humans making it ideal for initial screening studies or as a simulant for pathogenic viruses.","Cock, Ian; Kalt, F.

605,Type 1 Interferon Induction of Natural Killer Cell Gamma Interferon Production for Defense during Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection,2011-08-09,"Natural killer (NK) cells are equipped to innately produce the cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in part because they basally express high levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). Type 1 interferons (IFNs) have the potential to activate STAT4 and promote IFN-γ expression, but concurrent induction of elevated STAT1 negatively regulates access to the pathway. As a consequence, it has been difficult to detect type 1 IFN stimulation of NK cell IFN-γ during viral infections in the presence of STAT1 and to understand the evolutionary advantage for maintaining the pathway. The studies reported here evaluated NK cell responses following infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the compartment handling the earliest events after infection, the peritoneal cavity. The production of type 1 IFNs, both IFN-α and IFN-β, was shown to be early and of short duration, peaking at 30 h after challenge. NK cell IFN-γ expression was detected with overlapping kinetics and required activating signals delivered through type 1 IFN receptors and STAT4. It took place under conditions of high STAT4 levels but preceded elevated STAT1 expression in NK cells. The IFN-γ response reduced viral burdens. Interestingly, increases in STAT1 were delayed in NK cells compared to other peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. Taken together, the studies demonstrate a novel mechanism for stimulating IFN-γ production and elucidate a biological role for type 1 IFN access to STAT4 in NK cells.","Mack, Ethan A.; Kallal, Lara E.; Demers, Delia A.; Biron, Christine A.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150756/,13

One of the bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a novel genotype. The ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses. The genome organization is conserved amongst these viruses, including the presence of a putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in ORF2.

645,A Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Replicon-Based Bioassay for the Rapid and Sensitive Determination of Multi-Species Type I Interferon,2011-10-05,"Type I interferons (IFN) comprise a family of cytokines that signal through a common cellular receptor to induce a plethora of genes with antiviral and other activities. Recombinant IFNs are used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, multiple sclerosis, and certain malignancies. The capability of type I IFN to suppress virus replication and resultant cytopathic effects is frequently used to measure their bioactivity. However, these assays are time-consuming and require appropriate biosafety containment. In this study, an improved IFN assay is presented which is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon encoding two reporter proteins, firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The vector lacks the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV and is propagated on a G protein-expressing transgenic cell line. Several mammalian and avian cells turned out to be susceptible to infection with the complemented replicon particles. Infected cells readily expressed the reporter proteins at high levels five hours post infection. When human fibroblasts were treated with serial dilutions of human IFN-β prior to infection, reporter expression was accordingly suppressed. This method was more sensitive and faster than a classical IFN bioassay based on VSV cytopathic effects. In addition, the antiviral activity of human IFN-λ (interleukin-29), a type III IFN, was determined on Calu-3 cells. Both IFN-β and IFN-λ were acid-stable, but only IFN-β was resistant to alkaline treatment. The antiviral activities of canine, porcine, and avian type I IFN were analysed with cell lines derived from the corresponding species. This safe bioassay will be useful for the rapid and sensitive quantification of multi-species type I IFN and potentially other antiviral cytokines.","Berger Rentsch, Marianne; Zimmer, Gert",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187809/,13
701,Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bγ and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis,2011-12-15,"Host factors are recruited into viral replicase complexes to aid replication of plus-strand RNA viruses. In this paper, we show that deletion of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1Bgamma (eEF1Bγ) reduces Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in yeast host. Also, knock down of eEF1Bγ level in plant host decreases TBSV accumulation. eEF1Bγ binds to the viral RNA and is one of the resident host proteins in the tombusvirus replicase complex. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains lacking eEF1Bγ demonstrated its role in minus-strand synthesis by opening of the structured 3′ end of the viral RNA and reducing the possibility of re-utilization of (+)-strand templates for repeated (-)-strand synthesis within the replicase. We also show that eEF1Bγ plays a synergistic role with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A in tombusvirus replication, possibly via stimulation of the proper positioning of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase over the promoter region in the viral RNA template.These roles for translation factors during TBSV replication are separate from their canonical roles in host and viral protein translation.","Sasvari, Zsuzsanna; Izotova, Lara; Kinzy, Terri Goss; Nagy, Peter D.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3240602/,13
719,The Transmembrane Domain of CEACAM1-4S Is a Determinant of Anchorage Independent Growth and Tumorigenicity,2012-01-03,"CEACAM1 is a multifunctional Ig-like cell adhesion molecule expressed by epithelial cells in many organs. CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S, two isoforms produced by differential splicing, are predominant in rat liver. Previous work has shown that downregulation of both isoforms occurs in rat hepatocellular carcinomas. Here, we have isolated an anchorage dependent clone, designated 253T-NT that does not express detectable levels of CEACAM1. Stable transfection of 253-NT cells with a wild type CEACAM1-4S expression vector induced an anchorage independent growth in vitro and a tumorigenic phenotype in vivo. These phenotypes were used as quantifiable end points to examine the functionality of the CEACAM1-4S transmembrane domain. Examination of the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain showed N-terminal GXXXG dimerization sequences and C-terminal tyrosine residues shown in related studies to stabilize transmembrane domain helix-helix interactions. To examine the effects of transmembrane domain mutations, 253-NT cells were transfected with transmembrane domain mutants carrying glycine to leucine or tyrosine to valine substitutions. Results showed that mutation of transmembrane tyrosine residues greatly enhanced growth in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of transmembrane dimerization motifs, in contrast, significantly reduced anchorage independent growth and tumorigenicity. 253-NT cells expressing CEACAM1-4S with both glycine to leucine and tyrosine to valine mutations displayed the growth-enhanced phenotype of tyrosine mutants. The dramatic effect of transmembrane domain mutations constitutes strong evidence that the transmembrane domain is an important determinant of CEACAM1-4S functionality and most likely by other proteins with transmembrane domains containing dimerization sequences and/or C-terminal tyrosine residues.","Lawson, Erica L.; Mills, David R.; Brilliant, Kate E.; Hixson, Douglas C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250453/,13
736,Molecular mechanism for 3:1 subunit stoichiometry of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels,2011-08-30,"Molecular determinants of ion channel tetramerization are well characterized, but those involved in heteromeric channel assembly are less clearly understood. The heteromeric composition of native channels is often precisely controlled. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels from rod photoreceptors exhibit a 3:1 stoichiometry of CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits that tunes the channels for their specialized role in phototransduction. Here we show, using electrophysiology, fluorescence, biochemistry, and X-ray crystallography, that the mechanism for this controlled assembly is the formation of a parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domain of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper region of CNGA1 subunits, constraining the channel to contain three CNGA1 subunits, followed by preferential incorporation of a single CNGB1 subunit. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper domain relaxed the constraint and permitted multiple CNGB1 subunits in the channel. The X-ray crystal structures of the parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domains of CNGA1 and CNGA3 subunits were similar, suggesting that a similar mechanism controls the stoichiometry of cone CNG channels.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) primarily exists in a latent state, while only 1–3% of cells support lytic infection at any specific time. KSHV reactivation from latency is an exceedingly intricate process mediated by the integration of viral and cellular factors. Previously, our lab has described early growth response-1 (Egr-1) as an essential component for the KSHV reactivation process via its ability to mediate transcription of KSHV ORF50, the gene encoding for replication and transcription activator (RTA), a viral component known to control the switch from latent to lytic infection. In here, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that Egr-1 binds KSHV ORF50 promoter (ORF50P) in at least two different GC-rich binding domains. Expression profiles of cellular egr-1 and KSHV-encoded ORF50 follow a similar pattern during de novo KSHV infection. Over-expressing Egr-1, a signaling component downstream of Raf>MEK>ERK1/2, in KSHV-infected cells activates KSHV lytic replication. Through performing more physiologically relevant experiments, we analyzed the effect of a dietary supplement containing resveratrol on KSHV-infected cells. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate resveratrol to act in lowering ERK1/2 activity and expression of Egr-1 in KSHV-infected cells, resulting in the suppression of virus reactivation from latency. Taken together, these findings will undoubtedly contribute to future studies on not only combating KSHV related disease conditions, but also on other herpesviruses-induced pathogenesis.","Dyson, Ossie F.; Walker, Lia R.; Whitehouse, Adrian; Cook, Paul P.; Akula, Shaw M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3299779/,13
793,Dengue Virus Infection Perturbs Lipid Homeostasis in Infected Mosquito Cells,2012-03-22,"Dengue virus causes ∼50–100 million infections per year and thus is considered one of the most aggressive arthropod-borne human pathogen worldwide. During its replication, dengue virus induces dramatic alterations in the intracellular membranes of infected cells. This phenomenon is observed both in human and vector-derived cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells, we show that this membrane remodeling is directly linked to a unique lipid repertoire induced by dengue virus infection. Specifically, 15% of the metabolites detected were significantly different between DENV infected and uninfected cells while 85% of the metabolites detected were significantly different in isolated replication complex membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular lipid redistribution induced by the inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, is sufficient for cell survival but is inhibitory to dengue virus replication. Lipids that have the capacity to destabilize and change the curvature of membranes as well as lipids that change the permeability of membranes are enriched in dengue virus infected cells. Several sphingolipids and other bioactive signaling molecules that are involved in controlling membrane fusion, fission, and trafficking as well as molecules that influence cytoskeletal reorganization are also up regulated during dengue infection. These observations shed light on the emerging role of lipids in shaping the membrane and protein environments during viral infections and suggest membrane-organizing principles that may influence virus-induced intracellular membrane architecture.","Perera, Rushika; Riley, Catherine; Isaac, Giorgis; Hopf-Jannasch, Amber S.; Moore, Ronald J.; Weitz, Karl W.; Pasa-Tolic, Ljiljana; Metz, Thomas O.; Adamec, Jiri; Kuhn, Richard J.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310792/,13
823,Patterns and influencing factor of synonymous codon usage in porcine circovirus,2012-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. Nevertheless, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of porcine circovirus (PCV) genome in the process of its evolution is available. In this study, to give a new understanding on the evolutionary characteristics of PCV and the effects of natural selection from its host on the codon usage pattern of the virus, Patterns and the key determinants of codon usage in PCV were examined. METHODS: We carried out comprehensive analysis on codon usage pattern in the PCV genome, by calculating relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), dinucleotides and nucleic acid content of the PCV genome. RESULTS: PCV genomes have relatively much lower content of GC and codon preference, this result shows that nucleotide constraints have a major impact on its synonymous codon usage. The results of the correspondence analysis indicate codon usage patterns of PCV of various genotypes, various subgenotypes changed greatly, and significant differences in codon usage patterns of Each virus of Circoviridae.There is much comparability between PCV and its host in their synonymous codon usage, suggesting that the natural selection pressure from the host factor also affect the codon usage patterns of PCV. In particular, PCV genotype II is in synonymous codon usage more similar to pig than to PCV genotype I, which may be one of the most important molecular mechanisms of PCV genotype II to cause disease. The calculations results of the relative abundance of dinucleotides indicate that the composition of dinucleotides also plays a key role in the variation found in synonymous codon usage in PCV. Furthermore, geographic factors, the general average hydrophobicity and the aromaticity may be related to the formation of codon usage patterns of PCV. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies suggest that synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV genome are the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection from its host. The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding the characteristics of synonymous codon usage in PCV genomes, but also have significant value for the molecular evolution of PCV.","LIU, Xin-sheng; Zhang, Yong-guang; Fang, Yu-zhen; Wang, Yong-lu",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341187/,13
974,Niclosamide Is a Proton Carrier and Targets Acidic Endosomes with Broad Antiviral Effects,2012-10-25,"Viruses use a limited set of host pathways for infection. These pathways represent bona fide antiviral targets with low likelihood of viral resistance. We identified the salicylanilide niclosamide as a broad range antiviral agent targeting acidified endosomes. Niclosamide is approved for human use against helminthic infections, and has anti-neoplastic and antiviral effects. Its mode of action is unknown. Here, we show that niclosamide, which is a weak lipophilic acid inhibited infection with pH-dependent human rhinoviruses (HRV) and influenza virus. Structure-activity studies showed that antiviral efficacy and endolysosomal pH neutralization co-tracked, and acidification of the extracellular medium bypassed the virus entry block. Niclosamide did not affect the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, but neutralized coated vesicles or synthetic liposomes, indicating a proton carrier mode-of-action independent of any protein target. This report demonstrates that physico-chemical interference with host pathways has broad range antiviral effects, and provides a proof of concept for the development of host-directed antivirals.","Jurgeit, Andreas; McDowell, Robert; Moese, Stefan; Meldrum, Eric; Schwendener, Reto; Greber, Urs F.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486884/,13
1001,"Horizontal Transposon Transfer in Eukarya: Detection, Bias, and Perspectives",2012-07-12,"The genetic similarity observed among species is normally attributed to the existence of a common ancestor. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the exchange of genetic material is not limited to the transfer from parent to offspring but can also occur through horizontal transfer (HT). Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA fragments with an innate propensity for HT; they are mobile and possess parasitic characteristics that allow them to exist and proliferate within host genomes. However, horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) is not easily detected, primarily because the complex TE life cycle can generate phylogenetic patterns similar to those expected for HTT events. The increasingly large number of new genome projects, in all branches of life, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the TE content and HTT events in these species, although a standardized method of HTT detection is required before trends in the HTT rates can be evaluated in a wide range of eukaryotic taxa and predictions about these events can be made. Thus, we propose a straightforward hypothesis test that can be used by TE specialists and nonspecialists alike to discriminate between HTT events and natural TE life cycle patterns. We also discuss several plausible explanations and predictions for the distribution and frequency of HTT and for the inherent biases of HTT detection. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological concerns for HTT detection that may result in the underestimation and overestimation of HTT rates during eukaryotic genome evolution.","Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Ortiz, Mauro Freitas; Loreto, Elgion Lucio Silva",Genome Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516303/,13
1029,Inhibitory Influence of Enterococcus faecium on the Propagation of Swine Influenza A Virus In Vitro,2013-01-07,"The control of infectious diseases such as swine influenza viruses (SwIV) plays an important role in food production both from the animal health and from the public health point of view. Probiotic microorganisms and other health improving food supplements have been given increasing attention in recent years, but, no information on the effects of probiotics on swine influenza virus is available. Here we address this question by assessing the inhibitory potential of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium) on the replication of two porcine strains of influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2 strain) in a continuous porcine macrophage cell line (3D4/21) and in MDBK cells. Cell cultures were treated with E. faecium at the non-toxic concentration of 1×10(6) CFU/ml in growth medium for 60 to 90 min before, during and after SwIV infection. After further incubation of cultures in probiotic-free growth medium, cell viability and virus propagation were determined at 48 h or 96 h post infection. The results obtained reveal an almost complete recovery of viability of SwIV infected cells and an inhibition of virus multiplication by up to four log units in the E. faecium treated cells. In both 3D4/21- and MDBK-cells a 60 min treatment with E. faecium stimulated nitric oxide (NO) release which is in line with published evidence for an antiviral function of NO. Furthermore, E. faecium caused a modified cellular expression of selected mediators of defence in 3D4-cells: while the expression of TNF-α, TLR-3 and IL-6 were decreased in the SwIV-infected and probiotic treated cells, IL-10 was found to be increased. Since we obtained experimental evidence for the direct adsorptive trapping of SwIV through E. faecium, this probiotic microorganism inhibits influenza viruses by at least two mechanisms, direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level.","Wang, Zhenya; Chai, Weidong; Burwinkel, Michael; Twardziok, Sven; Wrede, Paul; Palissa, Christiane; Esch, Bettina; Schmidt, Michael F.

1040,Mutations in the Fusion Protein Cleavage Site of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotype 4 Confer Increased Replication and Syncytium Formation In Vitro but Not Increased Replication and Pathogenicity in Chickens and Ducks,2013-01-14,"To evaluate the role of the F protein cleavage site in the replication and pathogenicity of avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs), we constructed a reverse genetics system for recovery of infectious recombinant APMV-4 from cloned cDNA. The recovered recombinant APMV-4 resembled the biological virus in growth characteristics in vitro and in pathogenicity in vivo. The F cleavage site sequence of APMV-4 (DIQPR↓F) contains a single basic amino acid, at the -1 position. Six mutant APMV-4 viruses were recovered in which the F protein cleavage site was mutated to contain increased numbers of basic amino acids or to mimic the naturally occurring cleavage sites of several paramyxoviruses, including neurovirulent and avirulent strains of NDV. The presence of a glutamine residue at the -3 position was found to be important for mutant virus recovery. In addition, cleavage sites containing the furin protease motif conferred increased replication and syncytium formation in vitro. However, analysis of viral pathogenicity in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, and 3-week-old ducks showed that none the F protein cleavage site mutations altered the replication, tropism, and pathogenicity of APMV-4, and no significant differences were observed among the parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses in vivo. Although parental and mutant viruses replicated somewhat better in ducks than in chickens, they all were highly restricted and avirulent in both species. These results suggested that the cleavage site sequence of the F protein is not a limiting determinant of APMV-4 pathogenicity in chickens and ducks.","Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Shive, Heather; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544850/,13
1073,Causes and Implications of Codon Usage Bias in RNA Viruses,2013-02-25,"Choice of synonymous codons depends on nucleotide/dinucleotide composition of the genome (termed mutational pressure) and relative abundance of tRNAs in a cell (translational pressure). Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.","Belalov, Ilya S.; Lukashev, Alexander N.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581513/,13
1126,Viral RNA extraction for in-the-field analysis,2007-09-01,"Retroviruses encode their genetic information with RNA molecules, and have a high genomic recombination rate which allows them to mutate more rapidly, thereby posting a higher risk to humans. One important way to help combat a pandemic of viral infectious diseases is early detection before large scale outbreaks occur. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been used to identify precisely different strains of some very closely related pathogens. However, isolation and detection of viral RNA in the field are difficult due to the unstable nature of viral RNA molecules. Consequently, performing in-the-field nucleic acid analysis to monitor the spread of viruses is financially and technologically challenging in remote and underdeveloped regions that are high-risk areas for outbreaks. A simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method is reported to meet the requirements for in-the-field viral RNA extraction and detection. The ability of this device to perform viral RNA extraction with subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus is demonstrated. This inexpensive device has the potential to be distributed on a large scale to underdeveloped regions for early detection of retrovirus, with the possibility of reducing viral pandemic events.","Zhong, Jiang F.; Weiner, Leslie P.; Burke, Kathy; Taylor, Clive R.",Journal of Virological Methods,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3635480?pdf=render,13
1158,Rapid Identification of Novel Immunodominant Proteins and Characterization of a Specific Linear Epitope of Campylobacter jejuni,2013-05-29,"Campylobacter jejuni remains one of the major gut pathogens of our time. Its zoonotic nature and wide-spread distribution in industrialized countries calls for a quick and reliable diagnostic tool. Antibody-based detection presents a suitable means to identify pathogenic bacteria. However, the knowledge about immunodominant targets is limited. Thus, an approach is presented, which allows for the rapid screening of numerous cDNA derived expression clones to identify novel antigens. The deeper understanding of immunodominant proteins assists in the design of diagnostic tools and furthers the insight into the bacterium’s pathogenicity as well as revealing potential candidates for vaccination. We have successfully screened 1536 clones of an expression library to identify 22 proteins that have not been described as immunodominant before. After subcloning the corresponding 22 genes and expression of full-length proteins, we investigated the immunodominant character by microarrays and ELISA. Subsequently, seven proteins were selected for epitope mapping. For cj0669 and cj0920c linear epitopes were identified. For cj0669, specificity assays revealed a specific linear epitope site. Consequently, an eleven amino acid residue sequence TLIKELKRLGI was analyzed via alanine scan, which revealed the glycine residue to be significant for binding of the antibody. The innovative approach presented herein of generating cDNAs of prokaryotes in combination with a microarray platform rendering time-consuming purification steps obsolete has helped to illuminate novel immunodominant proteins of C.jejuni. The findings of a specific linear epitope pave the way for a plethora of future research and the potential use in diagnostic applications such as serological screenings. Moreover, the current approach is easily adaptable to other highly relevant bacteria making it a formidable tool for the future discovery of antigens and potential biomarkers. Consequently, it is desirable to simplify the identification of structural epitopes, as this would extend the spectrum of novel epitopes to be detected.","Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F.; Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus v.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667084/,13
1161,A Novel Lactococcal Vaccine Expressing a Peptide from the M2 Antigen of H5N2 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A Virus Prolongs Survival of Vaccinated Chickens,2013-05-22,"A cost-effective and efficacious influenza vaccine for use in commercial poultry farms would help protect against avian influenza outbreaks. Current influenza vaccines for poultry are expensive and subtype specific, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop a universal avian influenza vaccine. We have constructed a live bacterial vaccine against avian influenza by expressing a conserved peptide from the ectodomain of M2 antigen (M2e) on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (LL). Chickens were vaccinated intranasally with the lactococcal vaccine (LL-M2e) or subcutaneously with keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin conjugated M2e (KLH-M2e). Vaccinated and nonvaccinated birds were challenged with high pathogenic avian influenza virus A subtype H5N2. Birds vaccinated with LL-M2e or KLH-M2e had median survival times of 5.5 and 6.0 days, respectively, which were significantly longer than non-vaccinated birds (3.5 days). Birds vaccinated subcutaneously with KLH-M2e had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups. However, there was a significant correlation between the time of survival and M2e-specific serum IgG. The results of these trials show that birds in both vaccinated groups had significantly (P < 0.05) higher median survival times than non-vaccinated birds and that this protection could be due to M2e-specific serum IgG.","Reese, Kaleb A.; Lupfer, Christopher; Johnson, Rudd C.; Mitev, Georgi M.; Mullen, Valerie M.; Geller, Bruce L.; Pastey, Manoj",Vet Med Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3674685/,13
1183,Comparison of Heterologous Prime-Boost Strategies against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Gag Using Negative Stranded RNA Viruses,2013-06-26,"This study analyzed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against HIV-1 using three different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses (NSV) expressing HIV-1 Gag as vaccine vectors: rabies virus (RABV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.","Lawrence, Tessa M.; Wanjalla, Celestine N.; Gomme, Emily A.; Wirblich, Christoph; Gatt, Anthony; Carnero, Elena; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Lyles, Douglas S.; McGettigan, James P.; Schnell, Matthias J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694142/,13

In this study, a cytopathic-effect-based, high-throughput screening assay was developed and applied to screen JEV inhibitors from Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds 1280. The antiviral effects of three hit compounds including FGIN-1-27, cilnidipine, and niclosamide were evaluated in cells by western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence assay, and plaque reduction assay. A time-of-addition assay proved that all three compounds inhibited JEV at the stage of replication. The EC50s of FGIN-1-27, cilnidipine, and niclosamide were 3.21, 6.52, and 5.80 µM, respectively, while the selectivity indexes were 38.79, 30.67, and 7.49. FGIN-1-27 and cilnidipine have high efficiency and selectivity against JEV.

1352,"Isolation, Characterization, and Molecular Modeling of a Rheumatoid Factor from a Hepatitis C Virus Infected Patient with Sjögren's Syndrome",2013-12-30,"We have previously isolated several IgG rheumatoid factors (RFs) from patients with both rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura using phage display system. To study IgG RFs in patients with other autoimmune diseases, phage display antibody libraries from a hepatitis C virus infected patient with Sjögren's syndrome were constructed. After panning, a specific clone RFL11 was isolated for characterization in advance. The binding activity and specificity of RFL11 to IgG Fc fragment were comparable to those of RFs previously isolated. The analysis with existed RF-Fc complex structures indicated the homology model of RFL11 is similar to IgM RF61 complex with high binding affinity of about 6 × 10(−8) M. This effect resulted from longer complementarity-determining region (CDR) combining key somatic mutations. In the RFL11-Fc interfaces, the CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of Fc pocket and resulting in strong ion and cation-pi interactions. Moreover, a process of antigen-driven maturation was proven by somatically mutated VH residues on H2 and H3 CDR loops in the interfaces. Taken together, these results suggested that high affinity IgG RFs can be generated in patients with Sjögren's syndrome and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.","Lee, Yu-Ching; Tsai, Keng-Chang; Leu, Sy-Jye; Wang, Tuan-Jen; Liu, Chia-Yu; Yang, Yi-Yuan",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892945/,13
1359,Variation in RNA Virus Mutation Rates across Host Cells,2014-01-23,"It is well established that RNA viruses exhibit higher rates of spontaneous mutation than DNA viruses and microorganisms. However, their mutation rates vary amply, from 10(−6) to 10(−4) substitutions per nucleotide per round of copying (s/n/r) and the causes of this variability remain poorly understood. In addition to differences in intrinsic fidelity or error correction capability, viral mutation rates may be dependent on host factors. Here, we assessed the effect of the cellular environment on the rate of spontaneous mutation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which has a broad host range and cell tropism. Luria-Delbrück fluctuation tests and sequencing showed that VSV mutated similarly in baby hamster kidney, murine embryonic fibroblasts, colon cancer, and neuroblastoma cells (approx. 10(−5) s/n/r). Cell immortalization through p53 inactivation and oxygen levels (1–21%) did not have a significant impact on viral replication fidelity. This shows that previously published mutation rates can be considered reliable despite being based on a narrow and artificial set of laboratory conditions. Interestingly, we also found that VSV mutated approximately four times more slowly in various insect cells compared with mammalian cells. This may contribute to explaining the relatively slow evolution of VSV and other arthropod-borne viruses in nature.","Combe, Marine; Sanjuán, Rafael",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900646/,13
1397,Genetic characterization of type 2a canine parvoviruses from Taiwan reveals the emergence of an Ile324 mutation in VP2,2014-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV 2) is a major infectious cause of mortality in puppies. The characteristic symptom of CPV 2 disease is intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea. Soon after CPV was first recognized in the late 1970s, the original virus, CPV 2, was replaced in the canine population by strains carrying minor antigenic variants (termed 2a, 2b, and 2c) of the VP2 gene that could be distinguished using monoclonal antibodies and molecular analyses. Here, we provide an updated molecular characterization of the CPV 2 circulating in Taiwan. METHODS: In this study, 28 isolates of CPV 2 from 144 dogs with suspected CPV infection were obtained from northern, central, and southern Taiwan from 2008 to 2012 and screened by PCR. The 28 isolates were sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene was performed. RESULTS: Of the 28 Taiwanese CPV 2 isolates, 15 were identified as new CPV 2a, and 13 were identified as new CPV 2b. Compared to the reference CPV 2a, all 15 of the CPV 2a sequences collected in this study contain an Ile324 mutation caused by a TAT to ATT mutation at nucleotides 970–972 of the VP2 gene. CONCLUSION: Our VP2 sequence data revealed that both types are currently prevalent CPV 2 field strains circulating in Taiwan, and a unique Ile324 VP2 mutation was found in our Taiwanese CPV 2a isolates and recent Asian isolates. CPV 2c was not observed in this study.","Lin, Chao-Nan; Chien, Chi-Hsien; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Chueh, Ling-Ling; Hung, Meng-Yu; Hsu, Han-Siang",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944821/,13

In the present study, we isolated an RNA aptamer specific to the glycosylated receptor-binding domain of the HA protein (gHA1) after 12 cycles of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment procedure (SELEX), and we then investigated if the selected aptamer suppresses viral infection in host cells. Nitrocellulose filter binding and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments revealed that 1 RNA aptamer, HA12-16, bound specifically to the gHA1 protein. Cell viability assay showed that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppressed viral infection in host cells by enhancing cell viability. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis further demonstrated that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA. These results indicate that the isolated RNA aptamer can be developed as an antiviral reagent against influenza through appropriate therapeutic formulation.","Kwon, Hyun-Mi; Lee, Kwang Hyun; Han, Byung Woo; Han, Mi Ra; Kim, Dong Ho; Kim, Dong-Eun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023947/,13

For many viral diseases, vaccination with virus-like particles (VLPs) has shown considerable promise as a prophylactic approach; however, the processes of assembly and release of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) VLPs are not well characterized, and their immunogenicity in the host is unknown. In this study, VLPs of PPRV were generated in a baculovirus system through simultaneous expression of PPRV matrix (M) protein and hemaglutin in (H) or fusion (F) protein. The released VLPs showed morphology similar to that of the native virus particles. Subcutaneous injection of these VLPs (PPRV-H, PPRV-F) into mice and goats elicited PPRV-specific IgG production, increased the levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, and promoted lymphocyte proliferation. Without adjuvants, the immune response induced by the PPRV-H VLPs was comparable to that obtained using equivalent amounts of PPRV vaccine. Thus, our results demonstrated that VLPs containing PPRV M protein and H or F protein are potential “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals” (DIVA) vaccine candidates for the surveillance and eradication of PPR.","Li, Wenchao; Jin, Hongyan; Sui, Xiukun; Zhao, Zhanzhong; Yang, Chenghuai; Wang, Wenquan; Li, Junping; Li, Gang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130610/,13

However, the structural features of the complete PSV genome remain largely unknown. To analyze the structural features of PSV genomes, the full-length nucleotide sequences of three Korean PSV strains were determined and analyzed using bioinformatic techniques in comparison with other known PSV strains. The Korean PSV genomes ranged from 7,542 to 7,566 nucleotides excluding the 3′ poly(A) tail, and showed the typical picornavirus genome organization; 5′untranslated region (UTR)-L-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3′UTR. Three distinct cis-active RNA elements, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′UTR, a cis-replication element (CRE) in the 2C coding region and 3′UTR were identified and their structures were predicted. Interestingly, the structural features of the CRE and 3′UTR were different between PSV strains. The availability of these first complete genome sequences for PSV strains will facilitate future investigations of the molecular pathogenesis and evolutionary characteristics of PSV.","Son, Kyu-Yeol; Kim, Deok-Song; Kwon, Joseph; Choi, Jong-Soon; Kang, Mun-Il; Belsham, Graham J.; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4168140/,13
1671,Lipid interactions during virus entry and infection,2014-09-11,"For entry and infection viruses have developed numerous strategies to subjugate indispensable cellular factors and functions. Host cell lipids and cellular lipid synthesis machinery are no exception. Not only do viruses exploit existing lipid signalling and modifications for virus entry and trafficking, they also reprogram lipid synthesis, metabolism, and compartmentalization for assembly and egress. Here we review these various concepts and highlight recent progress in understanding viral interactions with host cell lipids during entry and assembly.","Mazzon, Michela; Mercer, Jason",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265854/,13
1715,Genomic Characterization of Novel Circular ssDNA Viruses from Insectivorous Bats in Southern Brazil,2015-02-17,"Circoviruses are highly prevalent porcine and avian pathogens. In recent years, novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in a variety of fecal and environmental samples using deep sequencing approaches. In this study the identification of genomes of novel circoviruses and cycloviruses in feces of insectivorous bats is reported. Pan-reactive primers were used targeting the conserved rep region of circoviruses and cycloviruses to screen DNA bat fecal samples. Using this approach, partial rep sequences were detected which formed five phylogenetic groups distributed among the Circovirus and the recently proposed Cyclovirus genera of the Circoviridae. Further analysis using inverse PCR and Sanger sequencing led to the characterization of four new putative members of the family Circoviridae with genome size ranging from 1,608 to 1,790 nt, two inversely arranged ORFs, and canonical nonamer sequences atop a stem loop.","Lima, Francisco Esmaile de Sales; Cibulski, Samuel Paulo; dos Santos, Helton Fernandes; Teixeira, Thais Fumaco; Varela, Ana Paula Muterle; Roehe, Paulo Michel; Delwart, Eric; Franco, Ana Cláudia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4331541/,13
1732,Structure determination of Murine Norovirus NS6 proteases with C-terminal extensions designed to probe protease–substrate interactions,2015-02-26,"Noroviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They encode an NS6 protease that cleaves a viral polyprotein at specific sites to produce mature viral proteins. In an earlier study we obtained crystals of murine norovirus (MNV) NS6 protease in which crystal contacts were mediated by specific insertion of the C-terminus of one protein (which contains residues P5-P1 of the NS6-7 cleavage junction) into the peptide binding site of an adjacent molecule, forming an adventitious protease-product complex. We sought to reproduce this crystal form to investigate protease–substrate complexes by extending the C-terminus of NS6 construct to include residues on the C-terminal (P′) side of the cleavage junction. We report the crystallization and crystal structure determination of inactive mutants of murine norovirus NS6 protease with C-terminal extensions of one, two and four residues from the N-terminus of the adjacent NS7 protein (NS6 1′, NS6 2′, NS6 4′). We also determined the structure of a chimeric extended NS6 protease in which the P4-P4′ sequence of the NS6-7 cleavage site was replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NS2-3 cleavage junction (NS6 4′ 2|3).The constructs NS6 1′ and NS6 2′ yielded crystals that diffracted anisotropically. We found that, although the uncorrected data could be phased by molecular replacement, refinement of the structures stalled unless the data were ellipsoidally truncated and corrected with anisotropic B-factors. These corrections significantly improved phasing by molecular replacement and subsequent refinement.The refined structures of all four extended NS6 proteases are very similar in structure to the mature MNV NS6—and in one case reveal additional details of a surface loop. Although the packing arrangement observed showed some similarities to those observed in the adventitious protease-product crystals reported previously, in no case were specific protease–substrate interactions observed.","Fernandes, Humberto; Leen, Eoin N.; Cromwell Jr, Hamlet; Pfeil, Marc-Philipp; Curry, Stephen",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349150/,13
1765,Cleavage of Dicer Protein by I7 Protease during Vaccinia Virus Infection,2015-03-27,"Dicer is the key component in the miRNA pathway. Degradation of Dicer protein is facilitated during vaccinia virus (VV) infection. A C-terminal cleaved product of Dicer protein was detected in the presence of MG132 during VV infection. Thus, it is possible that Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease followed by proteasome degradation of the cleaved product. There is a potential I7 protease cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein. Indeed, reduction of Dicer protein was detected when Dicer was co-expressed with I7 protease but not with an I7 protease mutant protein lack of the protease activity. Mutation of the potential I7 cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein resisted its degradation during VV infection. Furthermore, Dicer protein was reduced dramatically by recombinant VV vI7Li after the induction of I7 protease. If VV could facilitate the degradation of Dicer protein, the process of miRNA should be affected by VV infection. Indeed, accumulation of precursor miR122 was detected after VV infection or I7 protease expression. Reduction of miR122 would result in the suppression of HCV sub-genomic RNA replication, and, in turn, the amount of viral proteins. As expected, significant reduction of HCVNS5A protein was detected after VV infection and I7 protease expression. Therefore, our results suggest that VV could cleave Dicer protein through I7 protease to facilitate Dicer degradation, and in turn, suppress the processing of miRNAs. Effect of Dicer protein on VV replication was also studied. Exogenous expression of Dicer protein suppresses VV replication slightly while knockdown of Dicer protein does not affect VV replication significantly.","Chen, Jhih-Si; Li, Hui-Chun; Lin, Shu-I; Yang, Chee-Hing; Chien, Wan-Yu; Syu, Ciao-Ling; Lo, Shih-Yen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376780/,13
1801,A Functional Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the Suppression of Influenza A Virus Replication,2015-04-24,"Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics in humans. Here, we investigated four members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family; FGFR1 to 4, and examined their expression patterns in human lung epithelial cells A549 with influenza A virus infection. We identified a functional role of FGFR1 in influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1) virus replication. Our results showed that FGFR1 silencing by siRNA interference promoted influenza A/PR8 and H5N1 virus replication in A549 cells, while lentivirus-mediated exogenous FGFR1 expression significantly suppressed influenza A virus replication; however, FGFR4 did not have the same effects. Moreover, FGFR1 phosphorylation levels were downregulated in A549 cells by influenza A virus infection, while the repression of FGFR1 kinase using PD173074, a potent and selective FGFR1 inhibitor, could enhance virus replication. Furthermore, we found that FGFR1 inhibits influenza virus internalization, but not binding, during viral entry. These results suggested that FGFR1 specifically antagonizes influenza A virus replication, probably by blocking viral entry.","Liu, Xin; Lai, Chengcai; Wang, Keyu; Xing, Li; Yang, Penghui; Duan, Qing; Wang, Xiliang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409105/,13

AI causes tremendous economic losses in poultry industry and pose great threatens to human health. Active serologic surveillance is necessary to prevent and control the spread of AI. In this study, a protein microarray using nucleoprotein (NP) of H5N1 AIV expressed in insect cells was developed to detect antibodies against AIV NP protein. The protein microarray was used to test Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), AIV positive and negative sera. The results indicated that the protein microarray could hybridize specifically with antibodies against AIV with strong signals and without cross-hybridization. Moreover, 76 field serum samples were detected by microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). The positive rate was 92.1% (70/76), 93.4% (71/76) and 89.4% (68/76) by protein microarray, ELISA and HI test, respectively. Compared with ELISA, the microarray showed 100% (20/20) agreement ratio in chicken and 98.2% (55/56) in ornamental bird. In conclusion, this method provides an alternative serological diagnosis for influenza antibody screening and will provide a basis for the development of protein microarrays that can be used to respectively detect antibodies of different AIV subtypes and other pathogens.","ZHAO, Yuhui; WANG, Xiurong; CHEN, Pucheng; ZENG, Xianying; BAO, Hongmei; WANG, Yunhe; XU, Xiaolong; JIANG, Yongping; CHEN, Hualan; LI, Guangxing",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427741/,13
1854,An Ultrasensitive Mechanism Regulates Influenza Virus-Induced Inflammation,2015-06-05,"Influenza viruses present major challenges to public health, evident by the 2009 influenza pandemic. Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatory-associated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles. The approach developed here should facilitate the construction of gene regulatory models of other infectious diseases.","Shoemaker, Jason E.; Fukuyama, Satoshi; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Zhao, Dongming; Kawakami, Eiryo; Sakabe, Saori; Maemura, Tadashi; Gorai, Takeo; Katsura, Hiroaki; Muramoto, Yukiko; Watanabe, Shinji; Watanabe, Tokiko; Fuji, Ken; Matsuoka, Yukiko; Kitano, Hiroaki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457877/,13
1867,Hepatitis C virus and host cell nuclear transport machinery: a clandestine affair,2015-06-19,"There is growing evidence that factors encoded by cytoplasmic replicating viruses functionally interact with components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport apparatus. They do so either to access the cell nucleus, thus affecting genes expression, or to interfere with nuclear transport functionality, hindering host immune response. Recent studies revealed that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) makes no exception, interacting with the host cell nuclear transport machinery at two different levels. On the one hand, small amounts of both core and NS5A localize within the host cell nucleus during productive infection, modulating gene expression and signaling functions to promote persistent infection. On the other hand, HCV infection causes a profound redistribution of certain nucleoproteins to the close proximity of endoplasmic reticulum membrane-derived viral replication factories, where viral RNA amplification occurs. These nucleoporins are believed to form nuclear pore complex-like structures, as suggested by their ability to recruit nuclear localization sequence-bearing proteins. Thus, both processes are linked to virus-induced persistence and pathogenesis, representing possible targets for the development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics.","Bonamassa, Barbara; Ciccarese, Francesco; Antonio, Veronica Di; Contarini, Andrea; Palù, Giorgio; Alvisi, Gualtiero",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472997/,13

Antibodies against the filovirus surface glycoprotein (GP) have been shown to provide life-saving therapy in nonhuman primates, but such antibodies are generally virus-specific. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described against Ebola virus. In contrast, relatively few have been described against Marburg virus. Here we present ten mAbs elicited by immunization of mice using recombinant mucin-deleted GPs from different Marburg virus (MARV) strains. Surprisingly, two of the mAbs raised against MARV GP also cross-react with the mucin-deleted GP cores of all tested ebolaviruses (Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Reston), but these epitopes are masked differently by the mucin-like domains themselves. The most efficacious mAbs in this panel were found to recognize a novel “wing” feature on the GP2 subunit that is unique to Marburg and does not exist in Ebola. Two of these anti-wing antibodies confer 90 and 100% protection, respectively, one hour post-exposure in mice challenged with MARV.","Fusco, Marnie L.; Hashiguchi, Takao; Cassan, Robyn; Biggins, Julia E.; Murin, Charles D.; Warfield, Kelly L.; Li, Sheng; Holtsberg, Frederick W.; Shulenin, Sergey; Vu, Hong; Olinger, Gene G.; Kim, Do H.; Whaley, Kevin J.; Zeitlin, Larry; Ward, Andrew B.; Nykiforuk, Cory; Aman, M.

1909,A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer,2015-08-07,"From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia. The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch’s postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus. Vaccines prepared from BEI- and formalin inactivated virus, as well as from E. coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease.","de Groof, Ad; Guelen, Lars; Deijs, Martin; van der Wal, Yorick; Miyata, Masato; Ng, Kah Sing; van Grinsven, Lotte; Simmelink, Bartjan; Biermann, Yvonne; Grisez, Luc; van Lent, Jan; de Ronde, Anthony; Chang, Siow Foong; Schrier, Carla; van der Hoek, Lia",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529248/,13

The factors that enable avian H5N1 influenza viruses to replicate in humans are not completely understood. Here we use a high-throughput screening approach to identify novel mutations in the polymerase genes of an avian H5N1 virus that confer efficient polymerase activity in mammalian cells. Several of the identified mutations (which have previously been found in natural isolates) increase viral replication in mammalian cells and virulence in infected mice compared with the wild-type virus. The identification of amino-acid mutations in avian H5N1 influenza virus polymerase complexes that confer increased replication and virulence in mammals is important for the identification of circulating H5N1 viruses with an increased potential to infect humans.

Those pseudotype vectors contained no additional attenuating mutations in the rVSV genome. Here we describe rVSV vectors containing a full complement of VSV genes and expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP from an additional transcription unit. These rVSV vectors contain the same combination of attenuating mutations used previously in the clinical development pathway of an rVSV/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine. One of these rVSV vectors (N4CT1-EBOVGP1), which expresses membrane-anchored EBOV GP from the first position in the genome (GP1), elicited a balanced cellular and humoral GP-specific immune response in mice. Guinea pigs immunized with a single dose of this vector were protected from any signs of disease following lethal EBOV challenge, while control animals died in 7–9 days. Subsequently, N4CT1-EBOVGP1 demonstrated complete, single-dose protection of 2 macaques following lethal EBOV challenge. A single sham-vaccinated macaque died from disease due to EBOV infection.

1992,Remote Activation of Host Cell DNA Synthesis in Uninfected Cells Signaled by Infected Cells in Advance of Virus Transmission,2015-08-26,"Viruses modulate cellular processes and metabolism in diverse ways, but these are almost universally studied in the infected cell itself. Here, we study spatial organization of DNA synthesis during multiround transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) using pulse-labeling with ethynyl nucleotides and cycloaddition of azide fluorophores. We report a hitherto unknown and unexpected outcome of virus-host interaction. Consistent with the current understanding of the single-step growth cycle, HSV suppresses host DNA synthesis and promotes viral DNA synthesis in spatially segregated compartments within the cell. In striking contrast, during progressive rounds of infection initiated at a single cell, we observe that infection induces a clear and pronounced stimulation of cellular DNA replication in remote uninfected cells. This induced DNA synthesis was observed in hundreds of uninfected cells at the extended border, outside the perimeter of the progressing infection. Moreover, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that this activation is maintained, resulting in a propagating wave of host DNA synthesis continually in advance of infection. As the virus reaches and infects these activated cells, host DNA synthesis is then shut off and replaced with virus DNA synthesis. Using nonpropagating viruses or conditioned medium, we demonstrate a paracrine effector of uninfected cell DNA synthesis in remote cells continually in advance of infection. These findings have significant implications, likely with broad applicability, for our understanding of the ways in which virus infection manipulates cell processes not only in the infected cell itself but also now in remote uninfected cells, as well as of mechanisms governing host DNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE We show that during infection initiated by a single particle with progressive cell-cell virus transmission (i.e., the normal situation), HSV induces host DNA synthesis in uninfected cells, mediated by a virus-induced paracrine effector. The field has had no conception that this process occurs, and the work changes our interpretation of virus-host interaction during advancing infection and has implications for understanding controls of host DNA synthesis. Our findings demonstrate the utility of chemical biology techniques in analysis of infection processes, reveal distinct processes when infection is examined in multiround transmission versus single-step growth curves, and reveal a hitherto-unknown process in virus infection, likely relevant for other viruses (and other infectious agents) and for remote signaling of other processes, including transcription and protein synthesis.","Schmidt, Nora; Hennig, Thomas; Serwa, Remigiusz A.; Marchetti, Magda; O'Hare, Peter",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621119/,13

In 2005, the first HCV infection system in cell culture was established using clone JFH-1, which was isolated from a Japanese patient with fulminant HCV infection. JFH-1 replicates efficiently in hepatoma cells and infectious virion particles are released into the culture supernatant. The development of cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) systems has allowed us to understand how hosts respond to HCV infection and how HCV evades host responses. Although the mechanisms underlying the different outcomes of HCV infection are not fully understood, innate immune responses seem to have a critical impact on the outcome of HCV infection, as demonstrated by the prognostic value of IFN-λ gene polymorphisms among patients with chronic HCV infection.

2030,Rescue and evaluation of a recombinant PRRSV expressing porcine Interleukin-4,2015-11-14,"BACKGROUND: The current vaccines for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) have failed to provide broad protection against infection by various strains of PRRSV. Porcine Interleukin-4 (pIL-4) plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response and has been used previously as an immunological adjuvant. The objective of this study was to construct a recombinant PRRSV expressing pIL-4 and to evaluate the immune response of the recombinant virus in piglets. METHODS: The pIL-4 gene was inserted in the PRRSV (CH-1R strain) infectious clone by overlap PCR. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting were used to confirm the recombinant virus. The stability of the recombinant virus was assessed by DNA sequencing and IFA after 15 passages in vitro. Recombinant virus was injected into pigs and efficacy of immune protection was evaluated in comparison with the parental virus. RESULTS: The recombinant virus (CH-1R/pIL-4) was successfully rescued and shown to have similar growth kinetics as the parental virus. The recombinant virus was stable for 15 passages in cell culture. Pigs vaccinated with CH-1R/pIL-4 produced a similar humoral response to the response elicited by parental virus, but IL-4 level in the supernatant of PBMCs from pigs vaccinated with CH-1R/pIL-4 was significantly higher than the parent virus at 28 days post-immunization (DPI). Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis showed that the percentage of CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive T (DPT) cells in the CH-1R/pIL-4 vaccinated group was significantly higher than the parental virus at 3 and 7 Days Post-Challenge (DPC), and the IL-4 level in the blood significantly increased at 7 DPC. However, the viral load and histopathology did not show significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A recombinant PRRSV expressing porcine IL-4 was rescued and it remained genetically stable in vitro. The recombinant virus induced higher DPT ratios and IL-4 levels in the blood after HP-PRRSV challenge compared to the parental virus in piglets. However, it did not significantly improve protection efficacy of PRRSV vaccine.","Li, Zhijun; Wang, Gang; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Chong; Wang, Xinglong; Huang, Baicheng; Li, Qiongyi; Li, Liangliang; Xue, Biyun; Ding, Peiyang; Syed, Shahid Faraz; Wang, Chengbao; Cai, Xuehui; Zhou, En-Min",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647277/,13
2031,Polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion of herpes simplex type 1 virions with the plasma membrane of cells that support endocytic entry,2015-11-16,"BACKGROUND: Mouse B78 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are important to the study of HSV-1 entry because both are resistant to infection at the level of viral entry. When provided with a gD-receptor such as nectin-1, these cells support HSV-1 entry by an endocytosis pathway. Treating some viruses bound to cells with the fusogen polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediates viral fusion with the cell surface but is insufficient to rescue viral entry. It is unclear whether PEG-mediated fusion of HSV with the plasma membrane of B78 or CHO cells results in successful entry and infection. FINDINGS: Treating HSV-1 bound to B78 or CHO cells with PEG allowed viral entry as measured by virus-induced beta-galactosidase activity. Based on the mechanism of PEG action, we propose that entry likely proceeds by direct fusion of HSV particles with the plasma membrane. Under the conditions tested, PEG-mediated infection of CHO cells progressed to the level of HSV late gene expression, while B78 cells supported HSV DNA replication. We tested whether proteolysis or acidification of cell-bound virions could trigger HSV fusion with the plasma membrane. Under the conditions tested, mildly acidic pH of 5–6 or the protease trypsin were not capable of triggering HSV-1 fusion as compared to PEG-treated cell-bound virions. CONCLUSIONS: B78 cells and CHO cells, which typically endocytose HSV prior to viral penetration, are capable of supporting HSV-1 entry via direct penetration. HSV capsids delivered directly to the cytosol at the periphery of these cells complete the entry process. B78 and CHO cells may be utilized to screen for factors that trigger entry as a consequence of fusion of virions with the cell surface, and PEG treatment can provide a necessary control.","Walker, Erik B.; Pritchard, Suzanne M.; Cunha, Cristina W.; Aguilar, Hector C.; Nicola, Anthony V.",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647588/,13
2036,Hsp70 Isoforms Are Essential for the Formation of Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Replication and Transcription Compartments,2015-11-20,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with various AIDS-related malignancies. Like other herpesviruses, multiple processes required for KSHV lytic replication, including viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis and capsid assembly occur in virus-induced intranuclear structures, termed replication and transcription compartments (RTCs). Here we utilised a novel methodology, combining subcellular fractionation and quantitative proteomics, to identify cellular proteins which are recruited to KSHV-induced RTCs and thus play a key role in KSHV lytic replication. We show that several isoforms of the HSP70 chaperone family, Hsc70 and iHsp70, are redistributed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus coinciding with the initial formation of KSHV-induced RTCs. We demonstrate that nuclear chaperone foci are dynamic, initially forming adjacent to newly formed KSHV RTCs, however during later time points the chaperones move within KSHV RTCs and completely co-localise with actively replicating viral DNA. The functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment into KSHV RTCs was also examined using the specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008. Intriguingly, results highlight an essential role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability and maturation. Notably, inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms precluded KSHV RTC formation and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) relocalisation to the viral genome leading to the abolishment of global KSHV transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis and DNA replication. These new findings have revealed novel mechanisms that regulate KSHV lytic replication and highlight the potential of HSP70 inhibitors as novel antiviral agents.","Baquero-Pérez, Belinda; Whitehouse, Adrian",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4654589/,13
2069,Live Cell Analysis and Mathematical Modeling Identify Determinants of Attenuation of Dengue Virus 2’-O-Methylation Mutant,2015-12-31,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted virus infecting ~390 million people worldwide. In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of naïve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2’-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate.

2095,Molecular Mechanisms of White Spot Syndrome Virus Infection and Perspectives on Treatments,2016-01-18,"Since its emergence in the 1990s, White Spot Disease (WSD) has had major economic and societal impact in the crustacean aquaculture sector. Over the years shrimp farming alone has experienced billion dollar losses through WSD. The disease is caused by the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a large dsDNA virus and the only member of the Nimaviridae family. Susceptibility to WSSV in a wide range of crustacean hosts makes it a major risk factor in the translocation of live animals and in commodity products. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Understanding the molecular basis of disease processes has contributed significantly to the treatment of many human and animal pathogens, and with a similar aim considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding host–pathogen molecular interactions for WSD. Work on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in aquatic crustaceans has been restricted by a lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for host species. Nevertheless, some of the key host–pathogen interactions have been established: between viral envelope proteins and host cell receptors at initiation of infection, involvement of various immune system pathways in response to WSSV, and the roles of various host and virus miRNAs in mitigation or progression of disease. Despite these advances, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain; for example, the roles of the majority of WSSV proteins are still unknown. In this review we assess current knowledge of how WSSV infects and replicates in its host, and critique strategies for WSD treatment.","Verbruggen, Bas; Bickley, Lisa K.; van Aerle, Ronny; Bateman, Kelly S.; Stentiford, Grant D.; Santos, Eduarda M.; Tyler, Charles R.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728583/,13
2169,The Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Matrix Protein PPXY Late Domain Drives the Production of Defective Interfering Particles,2016-03-24,"Arenaviruses cause severe diseases in humans but establish asymptomatic, lifelong infections in rodent reservoirs. Persistently-infected rodents harbor high levels of defective interfering (DI) particles, which are thought to be important for establishing persistence and mitigating virus-induced cytopathic effect. Little is known about what drives the production of DI particles. We show that neither the PPXY late domain encoded within the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein nor a functional endosomal sorting complex transport (ESCRT) pathway is absolutely required for the generation of standard infectious virus particles. In contrast, DI particle release critically requires the PPXY late domain and is ESCRT-dependent. Additionally, the terminal tyrosine in the PPXY motif is reversibly phosphorylated and our findings indicate that this posttranslational modification may regulate DI particle formation. Thus we have uncovered a new role for the PPXY late domain and a possible mechanism for its regulation.","Ziegler, Christopher M.; Eisenhauer, Philip; Bruce, Emily A.; Weir, Marion E.; King, Benjamin R.; Klaus, Joseph P.; Krementsov, Dimitry N.; Shirley, David J.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806877/,13
2181,Emergence of a Large-Plaque Variant in Mice Infected with Coxsackievirus B3,2016-03-29,"Coxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wild-type CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies.","Wang, Yao; Pfeiffer, Julie K.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817249/,13
2319,An In Vivo Selection Identifies Listeria monocytogenes Genes Required to Sense the Intracellular Environment and Activate Virulence Factor Expression,2016-07-14,"Listeria monocytogenes is an environmental saprophyte and facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen with a well-defined life-cycle that involves escape from a phagosome, rapid cytosolic growth, and ActA-dependent cell-to-cell spread, all of which are dependent on the master transcriptional regulator PrfA. The environmental cues that lead to temporal and spatial control of L. monocytogenes virulence gene expression are poorly understood. In this study, we took advantage of the robust up-regulation of ActA that occurs intracellularly and expressed Cre recombinase from the actA promoter and 5’ untranslated region in a strain in which loxP sites flanked essential genes, so that activation of actA led to bacterial death. Upon screening for transposon mutants that survived intracellularly, six genes were identified as necessary for ActA expression. Strikingly, most of the genes, including gshF, spxA1, yjbH, and ohrA, are predicted to play important roles in bacterial redox regulation. The mutants identified in the genetic selection fell into three broad categories: (1) those that failed to reach the cytosolic compartment; (2) mutants that entered the cytosol, but failed to activate the master virulence regulator PrfA; and (3) mutants that entered the cytosol and activated transcription of actA, but failed to synthesize it. The identification of mutants defective in vacuolar escape suggests that up-regulation of ActA occurs in the host cytosol and not the vacuole. Moreover, these results provide evidence for two non-redundant cytosolic cues; the first results in allosteric activation of PrfA via increased glutathione levels and transcriptional activation of actA while the second results in translational activation of actA and requires yjbH. Although the precise host cues have not yet been identified, we suggest that intracellular redox stress occurs as a consequence of both host and pathogen remodeling their metabolism upon infection.","Reniere, Michelle L.; Whiteley, Aaron T.; Portnoy, Daniel A.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945081/,13
2371,The Mutational Robustness of Influenza A Virus,2016-08-29,"A virus’ mutational robustness is described in terms of the strength and distribution of the mutational fitness effects, or MFE. The distribution of MFE is central to many questions in evolutionary theory and is a key parameter in models of molecular evolution. Here we define the mutational fitness effects in influenza A virus by generating 128 viruses, each with a single nucleotide mutation. In contrast to mutational scanning approaches, this strategy allowed us to unambiguously assign fitness values to individual mutations. The presence of each desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations were verified by next generation sequencing of each stock. A mutation was considered lethal only after we failed to rescue virus in three independent transfections. We measured the fitness of each viable mutant relative to the wild type by quantitative RT-PCR following direct competition on A549 cells. We found that 31.6% of the mutations in the genome-wide dataset were lethal and that the lethal fraction did not differ appreciably between the HA- and NA-encoding segments and the rest of the genome. Of the viable mutants, the fitness mean and standard deviation were 0.80 and 0.22 in the genome-wide dataset and best modeled as a beta distribution. The fitness impact of mutation was marginally lower in the segments coding for HA and NA (0.88 ± 0.16) than in the other 6 segments (0.78 ± 0.24), and their respective beta distributions had slightly different shape parameters. The results for influenza A virus are remarkably similar to our own analysis of CirSeq-derived fitness values from poliovirus and previously published data from other small, single stranded DNA and RNA viruses. These data suggest that genome size, and not nucleic acid type or mode of replication, is the main determinant of viral mutational fitness effects.","Visher, Elisa; Whitefield, Shawn E.; McCrone, John T.; Fitzsimmons, William; Lauring, Adam S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003363/,13
2383,Tobamoviruses have probably co-diverged with their eudicotyledonous hosts for at least 110 million years,2015-12-16,"A phylogeny has been calculated by maximum likelihood comparisons of the concatenated consensus protein sequences of 29 tobamoviruses shown to be non-recombinant. This phylogeny has statistically significant support throughout, including its basal branches. The viruses form eight lineages that are congruent with the taxonomy of the hosts from which each was first isolated and, with the exception of three of the twenty-nine species, all fall into three clusters that have either asterid or rosid or caryophyllid hosts (i.e. the major subdivisions of eudicotyledonous plants). A modified Mantel permutation test showed that the patristic distances of virus and host phylogenies are significantly correlated, especially when the three anomalously placed viruses are removed. When the internal branches of the virus phylogeny were collapsed the congruence decreased. The simplest explanation of this congruence of the virus and host phylogenies is that most tobamovirus lineages have co-diverged with their primary plant hosts for more than 110 million years, and only the brassica-infecting lineage originated from a major host switch from asterids to rosids. Their co-divergence seems to have been ‘fuzzy’ rather than ‘strict’, permitting viruses to switch hosts within major host clades. Our conclusions support those of a coalesence analysis of tobamovirus sequences, that used proxy node dating, but not a similar analysis of nucleotide sequences from dated samples, which concluded that the tobamoviruses originated only 100 thousand years ago.","Gibbs, Adrian J.; Wood, Jeffrey; Garcia-Arenal, Fernando; Ohshima, Kazusato; Armstrong, John S.",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014485/,13
2426,XRN1 Is a Species-Specific Virus Restriction Factor in Yeasts,2016-10-06,"In eukaryotes, the degradation of cellular mRNAs is accomplished by Xrn1 and the cytoplasmic exosome. Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. We find a highly refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the “L-A” totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon. Thus, Xrn1p appears to co-evolve with totiviruses to maintain its potent antiviral activity and limit viral propagation in Saccharomyces yeasts. We demonstrate that Xrn1p physically interacts with the Gag protein encoded by the L-A virus, suggesting a host-virus interaction that is more complicated than just Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs.","Rowley, Paul A.; Ho, Brandon; Bushong, Sarah; Johnson, Arlen; Sawyer, Sara L.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053509/,13
2458,The Influenza Virus Protein PB1-F2 Increases Viral Pathogenesis through Neutrophil Recruitment and NK Cells Inhibition,2016-10-31,"The influenza A virus (IAV) PB1-F2 protein is a virulence factor contributing to the pathogenesis observed during IAV infections in mammals. In this study, using a mouse model, we compared the host response associated with PB1-F2 with an early transcriptomic signature that was previously associated with neutrophils and consecutively fatal IAV infections. This allowed us to show that PB1-F2 is partly involved in neutrophil-related mechanisms leading to death. Using neutropenic mice, we confirmed that the harmful effect of PB1-F2 is due to an excessive inflammation mediated by an increased neutrophil mobilization. We identified the downstream effects of this PB1-F2-exacerbated neutrophil recruitment. PB1-F2 had no impact on the lymphocyte recruitment in the airways at day 8 pi. However, functional genomics analysis and flow cytometry in broncho-alveolar lavages at 4 days pi revealed that PB1-F2 induced a NK cells deficiency. Thus, our results identify PB1-F2 as an important immune disruptive factor during the IAV infection.","Vidy, Aurore; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Da Costa, Bruno; Delmas, Bernard; Chevalier, Christophe; Le Goffic, Ronan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087861/,13
2495,Analysis of chikungunya virus proteins reveals that non-structural proteins nsP2 and nsP3 exhibit RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor activity,2016-11-30,"RNAi pathway is an antiviral defence mechanism employed by insects that result in degradation of viral RNA thereby curbing infection. Several viruses including flaviviruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to counteract the antiviral RNAi pathway. Till date, no VSR has been reported in alphaviruses. The present study was undertaken to evaluate chikungunya virus (CHIKV) proteins for RNAi suppressor activity. We systematically analyzed all nine CHIKV proteins for RNAi suppressor activity using Sf21 RNAi sensor cell line based assay. Two non-structural proteins, namely, nsP2 and nsP3 were found to exhibit RNAi suppressor activity. We further validated the findings in natural hosts, namely in Aedes and in mammalian cell lines and further through EMSA and Agrobacterium infiltration in GFP silenced transgenic tobacco plants. Domains responsible for maximum RNAi suppressor activity were also identified within these proteins. RNA binding motifs in these domains were identified and their participation in RNAi suppression evaluated using site directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment of these motifs across all species of known alphaviruses revealed conservation of these motifs emphasizing on a similar role of action in other species of alphaviruses as well. Further validation of RNAi suppressor activity of these proteins awaits establishment of specific virus infection models.","Mathur, Kalika; Anand, Abhishek; Dubey, Sunil Kumar; Sanan-Mishra, Neeti; Bhatnagar, Raj K.; Sunil, Sujatha",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5128919/,13
2569,Oligomerization domains in the glycan‐binding receptors DC‐SIGN and DC‐SIGNR: Sequence variation and stability differences,2016-12-22,"Human dendritic cell‐specific intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 grabbing nonintegrin, DC‐SIGN, and the sinusoidal endothelial cell receptor DC‐SIGNR or L‐SIGN, are closely related sugar‐binding receptors. DC‐SIGN acts both as a pathogen‐binding endocytic receptor and as a cell adhesion molecule, while DC‐SIGNR has only the pathogen‐binding function. In addition to differences in the sugar‐binding properties of the carbohydrate‐recognition domains in the two receptors, there are sequence differences in the adjacent neck domains, which are coiled‐coil tetramerization domains comprised largely of 23‐amino acid repeat units. A series of model polypeptides consisting of uniform repeat units have been characterized by gel filtration, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. The results demonstrate that two features characterize repeat units which form more stable tetramers: a leucine reside in the first position of the heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues that pack on the inside of the coiled coil and an arginine residue on the surface of the coiled coil that forms a salt bridge with a glutamic acid residue in the same polypeptide chain. In DC‐SIGNR from all primates, very stable repeat units predominate, so the carbohydrate‐recognition domains must be held relatively closely together. In contrast, stable repeat units are found only near the membrane in DC‐SIGN. The presence of residues that disrupt tetramer formation in repeat units near the carbohydrate‐recognition domains of DC‐SIGN would allow these domains to splay further apart. Thus, the neck domains of DC‐SIGN and DC‐SIGNR can contribute to the different functions of these receptors by presenting the sugar‐binding sites in different contexts.","dos Santos, Ália; Hadjivasiliou, Andreas; Ossa, Felipe; Lim, Novandy K.; Turgut, Aylin; Taylor, Maureen E.; Drickamer, Kurt",Protein Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5275740/,13
2597,Comparative analysis estimates the relative frequencies of co-divergence and cross-species transmission within viral families,2017-02-08,"The cross-species transmission of viruses from one host species to another is responsible for the majority of emerging infections. However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.","Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Duchêne, Sebastián; Holmes, Edward C.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319820/,13
2598,K-Pax2: Bayesian identification of cluster-defining amino acid positions in large sequence datasets,2015-07-15,"The recent growth in publicly available sequence data has introduced new opportunities for studying microbial evolution and spread. Because the pace of sequence accumulation tends to exceed the pace of experimental studies of protein function and the roles of individual amino acids, statistical tools to identify meaningful patterns in protein diversity are essential. Large sequence alignments from fast-evolving micro-organisms are particularly challenging to dissect using standard tools from phylogenetics and multivariate statistics because biologically relevant functional signals are easily masked by neutral variation and noise. To meet this need, a novel computational method is introduced that is easily executed in parallel using a cluster environment and can handle thousands of sequences with minimal subjective input from the user. The usefulness of this kind of machine learning is demonstrated by applying it to nearly 5000 haemagglutinin sequences of influenza A/H3N2.Antigenic and 3D structural mapping of the results show that the method can recover the major jumps in antigenic phenotype that occurred between 1968 and 2013 and identify specific amino acids associated with these changes.

2713,Structure-Based Mutations in the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Glycoprotein B Ectodomain Arm Impart a Slow-Entry Phenotype,2017-05-16,"Glycoprotein B (gB) is the conserved herpesvirus fusion protein, and it is required for the entry of herpesviruses. The structure of the postfusion conformation of gB has been solved for several herpesviruses; however, the gB prefusion crystal structure and the details of how the protein refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion form to mediate fusion have not been determined. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we previously reported that three mutations (I671A, H681A, and F683A) in the C-terminal arm of the gB ectodomain greatly reduced cell-cell fusion. This fusion deficit could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation, suggesting that the gB triple mutant was not misfolded. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed two independent herpes simplex virus 1 mutant strains (gB 3A) carrying the three arm mutations. The gB 3A viruses have 200-fold smaller plaques than the wild-type virus and demonstrate remarkably delayed entry into cells. Single-step and multistep growth curves show that gB 3A viruses have delayed replication kinetics. Interestingly, incubation at 40°C promoted the entry of the gB 3A viruses. We propose that the gB 3A viruses’ entry deficit is due to a loss of interactions between residues in the gB C-terminal arm and the coiled-coil core of gB. The results suggest that the triple alanine mutation may destabilize the postfusion gB conformation and/or stabilize the prefusion gB conformation and that exposure to elevated temperatures can overcome the defect in gB 3A viruses.","Fan, Qing; Kopp, Sarah J.; Connolly, Sarah A.; Longnecker, Richard",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433099/,13

In contrast to previous studies investigating JEVR in rodent or mosquito cells, in this study, we used primate Vero cells instead. We noted that few novel proteins co-immunoprecipitated with JEV, and discovered that one of these was heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β), which was probed by mass spectrometry with the highest score of 60.3 after questing the monkey and human protein databases. The specific HSP90β-JEV binding was confirmed by western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions, and this was significantly inhibited by an anti-human HSP90β monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the results of confocal laser scanning microscopic examination demonstrated that the HSP90β-JEV binding occurred on the Vero cell surface. Finally, JEV progeny yields determined by plaque assay were also markedly decreased in siRNA-treated Vero cells, particularly at 24 and 36 h post-infection.

2825,Epistatic Interactions within the Influenza A Virus Polymerase Complex Mediate Mutagen Resistance and Replication Fidelity,2017-08-16,"Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that employs mutagenic nucleoside analogs to exploit the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses. Studies of mutagen-resistant viruses have identified determinants of replicative fidelity and the importance of mutation rate to viral population dynamics. We have previously demonstrated the effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza A virus using three nucleoside analogs as well as the virus’s high genetic barrier to mutagen resistance. Here, we investigate the mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations that were enriched in drug-treated populations. We find that PB1 T123A has higher replicative fitness than the wild type, PR8, and maintains its level of genome production during 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine) treatment. Surprisingly, this mutagen-resistant variant also has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations. A second drug-selected mutation, PA T97I, interacts epistatically with PB1 T123A to mediate high-level mutagen resistance, predominantly by limiting the inhibitory effect of nucleosides on polymerase activity. Consistent with the importance of epistatic interactions in the influenza virus polymerase, our data suggest that nucleoside analog resistance and replication fidelity are strain dependent. Two previously identified ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} resistance mutations, PB1 V43I and PB1 D27N, do not confer drug resistance in the PR8 background, and the PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase exhibits a normal baseline mutation rate. Our results highlight the genetic complexity of the influenza A virus polymerase and demonstrate that increased replicative capacity is a mechanism by which an RNA virus can counter the negative effects of elevated mutation rates. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. This standing genetic diversity gives them the potential to adapt rapidly, evolve resistance to antiviral therapeutics, and evade immune responses. Viral mutants with altered mutation rates or mutational tolerance have provided insights into how genetic diversity arises and how it affects the behavior of RNA viruses. To this end, we identified variants within the polymerase complex of influenza virus that are able to tolerate drug-mediated increases in viral mutation rates. We find that drug resistance is highly dependent on interactions among mutations in the polymerase complex. In contrast to other viruses, influenza virus counters the effect of higher mutation rates primarily by maintaining high levels of genome replication. These findings suggest the importance of maintaining large population sizes for viruses with high mutation rates and show that multiple proteins can affect both mutation rate and genome synthesis.","Pauly, Matthew D.; Lyons, Daniel M.; Fitzsimmons, William J.; Lauring, Adam S.",mSphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5557677/,13

2880,HBV core protein allosteric modulators differentially alter cccDNA biosynthesis from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways,2017-09-25,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein assembles viral pre-genomic (pg) RNA and DNA polymerase into nucleocapsids for reverse transcriptional DNA replication to take place. Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or “empty” capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric modulators on nucleocapsid assembly and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B.","Guo, Fang; Zhao, Qiong; Sheraz, Muhammad; Cheng, Junjun; Qi, Yonghe; Su, Qing; Cuconati, Andrea; Wei, Lai; Du, Yanming; Li, Wenhui; Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629035/,13

In addition to encoding the amino acid sequence for Gag, the underlying RNA sequence could encode cis-acting elements or nucleotide biases that are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, RNA sequences that inhibit viral replication could be suppressed in gag. However, the functional relevance of RNA elements and nucleotide biases that promote or repress HIV-1 replication remain poorly understood. RESULTS: To characterize if the RNA sequence in gag controls HIV-1 replication, the matrix (MA) region was codon modified, allowing the RNA sequence to be altered without affecting the protein sequence. Codon modification of nucleotides (nt) 22-261 or 22-378 in gag inhibited viral replication by decreasing genomic RNA (gRNA) abundance, gRNA stability, Gag expression, virion production and infectivity. Comparing the effect of these point mutations to deletions of the same region revealed that the mutations inhibited infectious virus production while the deletions did not. This demonstrated that codon modification introduced inhibitory sequences. There is a much lower than expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 and codon modification introduced a substantial increase in CpG abundance. To determine if they are necessary for inhibition of HIV-1 replication, codons introducing CpG dinucleotides were mutated back to the wild type codon, which restored efficient Gag expression and infectious virion production. To determine if they are sufficient to inhibit viral replication, CpG dinucleotides were inserted into gag in the absence of other changes. The increased CpG dinucleotide content decreased HIV-1 infectivity and viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV-1 RNA sequence contains low abundance of CpG dinucleotides. Increasing the abundance of CpG dinucleotides inhibits multiple steps of the viral life cycle, providing a functional explanation for why CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in HIV-1.

2944,Autophagy pathway induced by a plant virus facilitates viral spread and transmission by its insect vector,2017-11-10,"Many viral pathogens are persistently transmitted by insect vectors and cause agricultural or health problems. Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.","Chen, Yong; Chen, Qian; Li, Manman; Mao, Qianzhuo; Chen, Hongyan; Wu, Wei; Jia, Dongsheng; Wei, Taiyun",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708841/,13

To investigate the potential synergism in anti-tumoral efficacy of oncolytic and vaccine properties, we chose Ovalbumin and an ideal tumor antigen, claudin-6, for pre-clinical proof of concept. To enhance immunogenicity, both antigens were presented by retroviral virus-like particle produced in situ during MV-infection. All recombinant MV revealed normal growths, genetic stability, and proper expression and presentation of both antigens. Potent antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity were found in immunized MV-susceptible IFNAR(−/−)-CD46Ge mice. These immune responses significantly inhibited metastasis formation or increased therapeutic efficacy compared to control MV in respective novel in vivo tumor models using syngeneic B16-hCD46/mCLDN6 murine melanoma cells. These data indicate the potential of MV to trigger selected tumor antigen-specific immune responses on top of direct tumor lysis for enhanced efficacy.","Hutzler, Stefan; Erbar, Stephanie; Jabulowsky, Robert A.; Hanauer, Jan R.

Work from multiple laboratories has revealed that HPV has evolved a unique means to deliver its viral genome (vDNA) to the cell nucleus, relying on myriad host cell proteins and processes. The major breakthrough finding from these recent endeavors has been the realization of L2-dependent utilization of cellular sorting factors for the retrograde transport of vDNA away from degradative endo/lysosomal compartments to the Golgi, prior to mitosis-dependent nuclear accumulation of L2/vDNA. An overview of current models of HPV entry, subcellular trafficking, and the role of L2 during initial infection is provided below, highlighting unresolved questions and gaps in knowledge.","Campos, Samuel K.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744145/,13

Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C–3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs.","Tsuchiaka, Shinobu; Naoi, Yuki; Imai, Ryo; Masuda, Tsuneyuki; Ito, Mika; Akagami, Masataka; Ouchi, Yoshinao; Ishii, Kazuo; Sakaguchi, Shoichi; Omatsu, Tsutomu; Katayama, Yukie; Oba, Mami; Shirai, Junsuke; Satani, Yuki; Takashima, Yasuhiro; Taniguchi, Yuji; Takasu, Masaki; Madarame, Hiroo; Sunaga, Fujiko; Aoki, Hiroshi; Makino, Shinji; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Nagai, Makoto",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764308/,13
3014,Internal genes of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus determine high viral replication in myeloid cells and severe outcome of infection in mice,2018-01-04,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 influenza virus has been a public health concern for more than a decade because of its frequent zoonoses and the high case fatality rate associated with human infections. Severe disease following H5N1 influenza infection is often associated with dysregulated host innate immune response also known as cytokine storm but the virological and cellular basis of these responses has not been clearly described. We rescued a series of 6:2 reassortant viruses that combined a PR8 HA/NA pairing with the internal gene segments from human adapted H1N1, H3N2, or avian H5N1 viruses and found that mice infected with the virus with H5N1 internal genes suffered severe weight loss associated with increased lung cytokines but not high viral load. This phenotype did not map to the NS gene segment, and NS1 protein of H5N1 virus functioned as a type I IFN antagonist as efficient as NS1 of H1N1 or H3N2 viruses. Instead we discovered that the internal genes of H5N1 virus supported a much higher level of replication of viral RNAs in myeloid cells in vitro, but not in epithelial cells and that this was associated with high induction of type I IFN in myeloid cells. We also found that in vivo during H5N1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin were infected and produced type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together our data infer that human and avian influenza viruses are differently controlled by host factors in alternative cell types; internal gene segments of avian H5N1 virus uniquely drove high viral replication in myeloid cells, which triggered an excessive cytokine production, resulting in severe immunopathology.","Li, Hui; Bradley, Konrad C.; Long, Jason S.; Frise, Rebecca; Ashcroft, Jonathan W.; Hartgroves, Lorian C.; Shelton, Holly; Makris, Spyridon; Johansson, Cecilia; Cao, Bin; Barclay, Wendy S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771632/,13
3069,Transcriptional Innate Immune Response of the Developing Chicken Embryo to Newcastle Disease Virus Infection,2018-02-27,"Traditional approaches to assess the immune response of chickens to infection are through animal trials, which are expensive, require enhanced biosecurity, compromise welfare, and are frequently influenced by confounding variables. Since the chicken embryo becomes immunocompetent prior to hatch, we here characterized the transcriptional response of selected innate immune genes to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in chicken embryos at days 10, 14, and 18 of embryonic development. The results suggest that the innate immune response 72 h after challenge of 18-day chicken embryo is both consistent and robust. The expression of CCL5, Mx1, and TLR3 in lung tissues of NDV challenged chicken embryos from the outbred Kuroiler and Tanzanian local ecotype lines showed that their expression was several orders of magnitude higher in the Kuroiler than in the local ecotypes. Next, the expression patterns of three additional innate-immunity related genes, IL-8, IRF-1, and STAT1, were examined in the highly congenic Fayoumi (M5.1 and M15.2) and Leghorn (Ghs6 and Ghs13) sublines that differ only at the microchromosome bearing the major histocompatibility locus. The results show that the Ghs13 Leghorn subline had a consistently higher expression of all genes except IL-8 and expression seemed to be subline-dependent rather than breed-dependent, suggesting that the innate immune response of chicken embryos to NDV infection may be genetically controlled by the MHC-locus. Taken together, the results suggest that the chicken embryo may represent a promising model to studying the patterns and sources of variation of the avian innate immune response to infection with NDV and related pathogens.","Schilling, Megan A.; Katani, Robab; Memari, Sahar; Cavanaugh, Meredith; Buza, Joram; Radzio-Basu, Jessica; Mpenda, Fulgence N.; Deist, Melissa S.; Lamont, Susan J.; Kapur, Vivek",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835104/,13
3083,Evolution of Synonymous Codon Usage Bias in West African and Central African Strains of Monkeypox Virus,2018-03-09,"The evolution of bias in synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes and the factors influencing its diversification have not been reported so far. In this study, various trends associated with synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes were investigated, and the results are reported. Identification of factors that influence codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes was done using various codon usage indices, such as the relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons, and the codon adaptation index. The Spearman rank correlation analysis and a correspondence analysis were used for correlating various factors with codon usage. The results revealed that mutational pressure due to compositional constraints, gene expression level, and selection at the codon level for utilization of putative optimal codons are major factors influencing synonymous codon usage bias in monkeypox viral genomes. A cluster analysis of relative synonymous codon usage values revealed a grouping of more virulent strains as one major cluster (Central African strains) and a grouping of less virulent strains (West African strains) as another major cluster, indicating a relationship between virulence and synonymous codon usage bias. This study concluded that a balance between the mutational pressure acting at the base composition level and the selection pressure acting at the amino acid level frames synonymous codon usage bias in the chosen monkeypox viruses. The natural selection from the host does not seem to have influenced the synonymous codon usage bias in the analyzed monkeypox viral genomes.","Karumathil, Sudeesh; Raveendran, Nimal T; Ganesh, Doss; Kumar NS, Sampath; Nair, Rahul R; Dirisala, Vijaya R",Evol Bioinform Online,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5846927/,13
3105,Development of a Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit to Detect IgG/IgM Antibody against Zika Virus Using Monoclonal Antibodies to the Envelope and Non-structural Protein 1 of the Virus,2018-02-28,"We developed a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit for detecting IgG/IgM antibodies against Zika virus (ZIKV) using monoclonal antibodies to the envelope (E) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of ZIKV. These proteins were produced using baculovirus expression vector with Sf9 cells. Monoclonal antibodies J2G7 to NS1 and J5E1 to E protein were selected and conjugated with colloidal gold to produce the Zika IgG/IgM RDT kit (Zika RDT). Comparisons with ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and PCR were done to investigate the analytical sensitivity of Zika RDT, which resulted in 100% identical results. Sensitivity and specificity of Zika RDT in a field test was determined using positive and negative samples from Brazil and Korea. The diagnostic accuracy of Zika RDT was fairly high; sensitivity and specificity for IgG was 99.0 and 99.3%, respectively, while for IgM it was 96.7 and 98.7%, respectively. Cross reaction with dengue virus was evaluated using anti-Dengue Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PVD201), in which the Zika RDT showed cross-reactions with DENV in 16.7% and 5.6% in IgG and IgM, respectively. Cross reactions were not observed with West Nile, yellow fever, and hepatitis C virus infected sera. Zika RDT kit is very simple to use, rapid to assay, and very sensitive, and highly specific. Therefore, it would serve as a choice of method for point-of-care diagnosis and large scale surveys of ZIKV infection under clinical or field conditions worldwide in endemic areas.","Kim, Yeong Hoon; Lee, Jihoo; Kim, Young-Eun; Chong, Chom-Kyu; Pinchemel, Yanaihara; Reisdörfer, Francis; Coelho, Joyce Brito; Dias, Ronaldo Ferreira; Bae, Pan Kee; Gusmão, Zuinara Pereira Maia; Ahn, Hye-Jin; Nam, Ho-Woo",Korean J Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858665/,13
3110,Molecular basis of binding between the global post-transcriptional regulator CsrA and the T3SS chaperone CesT,2018-03-22,"The T3SS chaperone CesT is recently shown to interact with the post-transcriptional regulator CsrA to modulate post-attachment signaling in enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. The molecular basis of the CesT/CsrA binding, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that CesT and CsrA both created two ligand binding sites in their homodimers, forming irregular multimeric complexes in solution. Through construction of a recombinant CsrA-dimer (Re-CsrA) that contains a single CesT binding site, the atomic binding features between CesT and CsrA are delineated via the structure of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex. In contrast to a previously reported N-terminally swapped dimer-form, CesT adopts a dimeric architecture with a swapped C-terminal helix for CsrA engagement. In CsrA, CesT binds to a surface patch that extensively overlaps with its mRNA binding site. The binding mode therefore justifies a mechanism of CsrA-modulation by CesT via competitive inhibition of the CsrA/mRNA interactions.","Ye, Fei; Yang, Fanli; Yu, Ruijie; Lin, Xi; Qi, Jianxun; Chen, Zhujun; Cao, Yu; Wei, Yuquan; Gao, George F.; Lu, Guangwen",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864733/,13
3167,"Imaging, Tracking and Computational Analyses of Virus Entry and Egress with the Cytoskeleton",2018-03-31,"Viruses have a dual nature: particles are “passive substances” lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are “active substances” turning-over energy. How passive viral substances convert to active substances, comprising viral replication and assembly compartments has been of intense interest to virologists, cell and molecular biologists and immunologists. Infection starts with virus entry into a susceptible cell and delivers the viral genome to the replication site. This is a multi-step process, and involves the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. Likewise, the egress of progeny virus particles from the replication site to the extracellular space is enhanced by the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. This overcomes the limitation of thermal diffusion, and transports virions and virion components, often in association with cellular organelles. This review explores how the analysis of viral trajectories informs about mechanisms of infection. We discuss the methodology enabling researchers to visualize single virions in cells by fluorescence imaging and tracking. Virus visualization and tracking are increasingly enhanced by computational analyses of virus trajectories as well as in silico modeling. Combined approaches reveal previously unrecognized features of virus-infected cells. Using select examples of complementary methodology, we highlight the role of actin filaments and microtubules, and their associated motors in virus infections. In-depth studies of single virion dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions thereby provide deep insight into virus infection processes, and are a basis for uncovering underlying mechanisms of how cells function.","Wang, I-Hsuan; Burckhardt, Christoph J.; Yakimovich, Artur; Greber, Urs F.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923460/,13
3296,"Influenza A Virus Cell Entry, Replication, Virion Assembly and Movement",2018-07-20,"Influenza viruses replicate within the nucleus of the host cell. This uncommon RNA virus trait provides influenza with the advantage of access to the nuclear machinery during replication. However, it also increases the complexity of the intracellular trafficking that is required for the viral components to establish a productive infection. The segmentation of the influenza genome makes these additional trafficking requirements especially challenging, as each viral RNA (vRNA) gene segment must navigate the network of cellular membrane barriers during the processes of entry and assembly. To accomplish this goal, influenza A viruses (IAVs) utilize a combination of viral and cellular mechanisms to coordinate the transport of their proteins and the eight vRNA gene segments in and out of the cell. The aim of this review is to present the current mechanistic understanding for how IAVs facilitate cell entry, replication, virion assembly, and intercellular movement, in an effort to highlight some of the unanswered questions regarding the coordination of the IAV infection process.","Dou, Dan; Revol, Rebecca; Östbye, Henrik; Wang, Hao; Daniels, Robert",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062596/,13
3343,Kinetic analysis of the influenza A virus HA/NA balance reveals contribution of NA to virus-receptor binding and NA-dependent rolling on receptor-containing surfaces,2018-08-13,"Interactions of influenza A virus (IAV) with sialic acid (SIA) receptors determine viral fitness and host tropism. Binding to mucus decoy receptors and receptors on epithelial host cells is determined by a receptor-binding hemagglutinin (HA), a receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) and a complex in vivo receptor-repertoire. The crucial but poorly understood dynamics of these multivalent virus-receptor interactions cannot be properly analyzed using equilibrium binding models and endpoint binding assays. In this study, the use of biolayer interferometric analysis revealed the virtually irreversible nature of IAV binding to surfaces coated with synthetic sialosides or engineered sialoglycoproteins in the absence of NA activity. In addition to HA, NA was shown to be able to contribute to the initial binding rate while catalytically active. Virus-receptor binding in turn contributed to receptor cleavage by NA. Multiple low-affinity HA-SIA interactions resulted in overall extremely high avidity but also permitted a dynamic binding mode, in which NA activity was driving rolling of virus particles over the receptor-surface. Virus dissociation only took place after receptor density of the complete receptor-surface was sufficiently decreased due to NA activity of rolling IAV particles. The results indicate that in vivo IAV particles, after landing on the mucus layer, reside continuously in a receptor-bound state while rolling through the mucus layer and over epithelial cell surfaces driven by the HA-NA-receptor balance. Quantitative BLI analysis enabled functional examination of this balance which governs this dynamic and motile interaction that is expected to be crucial for penetration of the mucus layer and subsequent infection of cells by IAV but likely also by other enveloped viruses carrying a receptor-destroying enzyme in addition to a receptor-binding protein.","Guo, Hongbo; Rabouw, Huib; Slomp, Anne; Dai, Meiling; van der Vegt, Floor; van Lent, Jan W.

3373,Intracranial Inoculation Is More Potent Than Intranasal Inoculation for Inducing Optic Neuritis in the Mouse Hepatitis Virus-Induced Model of Multiple Sclerosis,2018-09-04,"Neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induce acute inflammation and chronic demyelination in the spinal cord and optic nerves mediated by axonal spread following intracranial inoculation in mice, with pathologic features similar to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord demyelination is also induced following intranasal inoculation with neurotropic MHV strains, however much higher viral doses are required as compared to intracranial inoculation. Recently, it was shown that intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins leads to significant, rapid accumulation of protein in the optic nerve and in the eye, with only low levels reaching spinal cord and other brain regions. Thus, we examined whether intranasal inoculation with MHV at doses equivalent to those given intracranially could induce optic neuritis—inflammation, demyelination and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve with or without inducing spinal cord demyelination. Four week old male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intracranially with the recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59, or intranasally with RSA59 or the non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2 as control. One month post-inoculation, mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 had significant myelin loss in both spinal cord and optic nerves, with significant loss of RGCs as well, consistent with prior studies. As expected, intranasal inoculation with RSA59 failed to induce demyelination in spinal cord; however, it also did not induce optic nerve demyelination. No acute inflammation was found, and no viral antigen was detected, in the optic nerve or retina 1 day after inoculation. Results confirm the neurotropic effects of RSA59 following intracranial inoculation, and suggest that direct infection with axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord and optic nerve is required to induce demyelinating disease. These studies suggest that MHV does not selectively concentrate in optic nerve and retina to sufficient levels to induce demyelination following intranasal inoculation. Intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease.","Singh, Manmeet; Khan, Reas S.; Dine, Kimberly; Das Sarma, Jayasri; Shindler, Kenneth S.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6132074/,13
3428,A Simple Method to Detect Candidate Overlapping Genes in Viruses Using Single Genome Sequences,2018-08-07,"Overlapping genes in viruses maximize the coding capacity of their genomes and allow the generation of new genes without major increases in genome size. Despite their importance, the evolution and function of overlapping genes are often not well understood, in part due to difficulties in their detection. In addition, most bioinformatic approaches for the detection of overlapping genes require the comparison of multiple genome sequences that may not be available in metagenomic surveys of virus biodiversity. We introduce a simple new method for identifying candidate functional overlapping genes using single virus genome sequences. Our method uses randomization tests to estimate the expected length of open reading frames and then identifies overlapping open reading frames that significantly exceed this length and are thus predicted to be functional. We applied this method to 2548 reference RNA virus genomes and find that it has both high sensitivity and low false discovery for genes that overlap by at least 50 nucleotides. Notably, this analysis provided evidence for 29 previously undiscovered functional overlapping genes, some of which are coded in the antisense direction suggesting there are limitations in our current understanding of RNA virus replication.","Schlub, Timothy E; Buchmann, Jan P; Holmes, Edward C",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188560/,13

The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus may be problematic because of the cross reactivity of the antibodies with other flaviviruses leading to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Moreover, rapidly replicating positive strand RNA viruses, including Zika virus, generate large spectrum of mutant genomes (quasi species) every replication round, allowing rapid selection of variants resistant to drugs targeting virus-specific proteins. On the other hand, viruses are ultimate cellular parasites and rely on the host metabolism for every step of their life cycle, thus presenting an opportunity to manipulate host processes as an alternative approach to suppress virus replication and spread. Zika and other flaviviruses critically depend on the cellular secretory pathway, which transfers proteins and membranes from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, for virion assembly, maturation and release. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of interactions of Zika and similar arthropod-borne flaviviruses with the cellular secretory machinery with a special emphasis on virus-specific changes of the secretory pathway. Identification of the regulatory networks and effector proteins required to accommodate the trafficking of virions, which represent a highly unusual cargo for the secretory pathway, may open an attractive and virtually untapped reservoir of alternative targets for the development of superior anti-viral drugs.","Sager, Garrett; Gabaglio, Samuel; Sztul, Elizabeth; Belov, George A.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213159/,13

ERBs develop a productive MARV infection with low viremia and shedding but no overt disease, suggesting this virus is efficiently controlled by ERB antiviral responses. This dynamic would contrast with humans, where MARV-mediated interferon (IFN) antagonism early in infection is thought to contribute to the severe, often fatal disease. The newly-annotated ERB genome and transcriptome have now enabled us to use a custom-designed NanoString nCounter ERB CodeSet in conjunction with RNA-seq to investigate responses in a MARV-infected ERB cell line. Both transcriptomic platforms correlated well and showed that MARV inhibited the antiviral program in ERB cells, while an IFN antagonism-impaired MARV was less efficient at suppressing the response gene induction, phenotypes previously reported for primate cells. Interestingly, and despite the expansion of IFN loci in the ERB genome, neither MARV showed specific induction of almost any IFN gene. However, we detected an upregulation of putative, unannotated ERB antiviral paralogs, as well as an elevated basal expression in uninfected ERB cells of key antiviral genes.","Arnold, Catherine E.; Guito, Jonathan C.; Altamura, Louis A.; Lovett, Sean P.; Nagle, Elyse R.; Palacios, Gustavo F.; Sanchez-Lockhart, Mariano; Towner, Jonathan S.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266330/,13

Processing by Dicer enzyme, cell membrane permeability, and RNAi efficiency of the peptide-conjugated siRNAs were examined. Dicer cleaved the peptide-conjugated 27-nt siRNA leading to the release of 21-nt siRNA, whereas the peptide-conjugated 21-nt siRNA was not cleaved. High membrane permeability and cytoplasmic localization was found in the conjugates. Moreover, the peptide-conjugated 27-nt siRNA showed increased potency of RNAi in comparison with the nonmodified 21-nt and 27-nt siRNAs, whereas the peptide-conjugated 21-nt siRNA showed decreased RNAi efficacy. This potent RNAi efficacy is probably owing to acceleration of RISC through recognition by Dicer, as well as to the improvement of cell membrane permeability and intracellular accumulation.","Kubo, Takanori; Yanagihara, Kazuyoshi; Sato, Yuichiro; Morita, Yasuhiro; Seyama, Toshio",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6268710/,13

3670,A system for production of defective interfering particles in the absence of infectious influenza A virus,2019-03-01,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a serious health threat and novel antiviral strategies are needed. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase and may suppress spread of wild type (wt) virus. The antiviral activity of DIPs is exerted by a DI genomic RNA segment that usually contains a large deletion and suppresses amplification of wt segments, potentially by competing for cellular and viral resources. DI-244 is a naturally occurring prototypic segment 1-derived DI RNA in which most of the PB2 open reading frame has been deleted and which is currently developed for antiviral therapy. At present, coinfection with wt virus is required for production of DI-244 particles which raises concerns regarding biosafety and may complicate interpretation of research results. Here, we show that cocultures of 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing codon optimized PB2 allow production of DI-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of helper virus. Moreover, we demonstrate that infectivity of these particles can be quantified using MDCK-PB2 cells. Finally, we report that the DI-244 particles produced in this novel system exert potent antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV but not against the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus. This is the first report of DIP production in the absence of infectious IAV and may spur efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral therapy.","Bdeir, Najat; Arora, Prerna; Gärtner, Sabine; Hoffmann, Markus; Reichl, Udo; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Winkler, Michael",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396908/,13
3725,Plant-derived antiviral drugs as novel hepatitis B virus inhibitors: Cell culture and molecular docking study,2018-12-26,"Despite high anti-HBV efficacies, while the nucleoside analogs (e.g., lamivudine) lead to the emergence of drug-resistance, interferons (e.g., IFN-α causes adverse side-effects. Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 μg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 μg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), β-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (∆G = −5.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (∆G = −6.1 to −9.3 kcal/mol). Taken together, our data suggest the anti-HBV potential of the tested natural compounds as novel viral Pol/RT inhibitors.","Parvez, Mohammad K.; Tabish Rehman, Md.; Alam, Perwez; Al-Dosari, Mohammed S.; Alqasoumi, Saleh I.; Alajmi, Mohammed F.",Saudi Pharm J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6439212/,13
3785,Interferon-Stimulated Genes—Mediators of the Innate Immune Response during Canine Distemper Virus Infection,2019-04-01,"The demyelinating canine distemper virus (CDV)-leukoencephalitis represents a translational animal model for multiple sclerosis. The present study investigated the expression of type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway members in CDV-induced cerebellar lesions to gain an insight into their role in lesion development. Gene expression of 110 manually selected genes in acute, subacute and chronic lesions was analyzed using pre-existing microarray data. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT2, MX protein, protein kinase R (PKR), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 1 and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 expression were also evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Cellular origin of STAT1, STAT2, MX and PKR were determined using immunofluorescence. CDV infection caused an increased expression of the antiviral effector proteins MX, PKR, OAS1 and ISG15, which probably contributed to a restricted viral replication, particularly in neurons and oligodendrocytes. This increase might be partly mediated by IRF-dependent pathways due to the lack of changes in IFN-I levels and absence of STAT2 in astrocytes. Nevertheless, activated microglia/macrophages showed a strong expression of STAT1, STAT2 and MX proteins in later stages of the disease, indicating a strong activation of the IFN-I signaling cascade, which might be involved in the aggravation of bystander demyelination.","Klotz, Daniela; Gerhauser, Ingo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480560/,13

3810,Influenza A virus surface proteins are organized to help penetrate host mucus,2019-05-14,"Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating a spatial organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the virus’s conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, potentially contributing to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV.","Vahey, Michael D; Fletcher, Daniel A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516830/,13

As the major viral proteins present on the surface of virions, viral envelope proteins are a prominent target of the host immune system in preventing and ultimately eliminating viral infection. In addition to the well-appreciated adaptive immunity that produces envelope protein-specific antibodies and T cell responses, recent studies have begun to unveil a rich layer of host innate immune mechanisms restricting viral entry. This review focuses on the exciting progress that has been made in this new direction of research, by discussing various known examples of host restriction of viral entry, and diverse viral countering strategies, in particular, the emerging role of viral envelope proteins in evading host innate immune suppression. We will also highlight the effective cooperation between innate and adaptive immunity to achieve the synergistic control of viral infection by targeting viral envelope protein and checking viral escape. Given that many of the related findings were made with HIV-1, we will use HIV-1 as the model virus to illustrate the basic principles and molecular mechanisms on host restriction targeting HIV-1 envelope protein.","Beitari, Saina; Wang, Yimeng; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liang, Chen",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6521621/,13
3899,Identification and Molecular Characterisation of Bovine Parainfluenza Virus-3 and Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus - First Report from Turkey,2019-06-12,"INTRODUCTION: Bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are the cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants. The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 155 samples were collected. Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females. The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years. Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns. All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level. RESULTS: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey. This is the first report on their detection and molecular characterisation in ruminants in Turkey.","Timurkan, Mehmet Ozkan; Aydin, Hakan; Sait, Ahmet",J Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598183/,13
4071,Allele-Specific Expression of CD4(+) T Cells in Response to Marek’s Disease Virus Infection,2019-09-17,"Marek’s disease (MD) is a T cell lymphoma disease induced by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a highly oncogenic α herpesvirus primarily affecting chickens. MD is a chronic infectious disease that threatens the poultry industry. However, the mechanisms of genetic resistance for MD are complex and not completely understood. In this study, to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance, high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4(+) T cells isolated from MDV-infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two highly inbred chicken lines (6(3) MD-resistant and 7(2) MD-susceptible). After RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates in each group, we identified 61 and 123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) annotated in 39 and 132 genes in intercrosses 6(3) × 7(2) and 7(2) × 6(3), respectively, which exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection. Similarly, we identified 62 and 79 SNPs annotated in 66 and 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. We identified 534 and 1543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05) related to MDV infection in intercrosses 6(3) × 7(2) and 7(2) × 6(3), respectively. We also identified 328 and 20 DEGs in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. The qRT-PCR using seven DEGs further verified our results of RNA-seq analysis. The qRT-PCR of 11 important ASE genes was performed for gene functional validation in CD4(+) T cells and tumors. Combining the analyses, six genes (MCL1, SLC43A2, PDE3B, ADAM33, BLB1, and DMB2), especially MCL1, were highlighted as the candidate genes with the potential to be involved in MDV infection. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that many ASE genes are linked to T cell activation, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, which play potentially important roles in MDV infection. Our approach underlines the importance of comprehensive functional studies for gaining valuable biological insight into the genetic factors behind MD and other complex traits, and our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of MD and disease resistance breeding in poultry.","Bai, Hao; He, Yanghua; Ding, Yi; Carrillo, José A.; Selvaraj, Ramesh K.; Zhang, Huanmin; Chen, Jilan; Song, Jiuzhou",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770979/,13
4108,Molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses in commercial chicken flocks in Pakistan from 2014 through to 2016,2019-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Viral diseases are a matter of great concern for poultry farmers in Pakistan. Multiple common viral respiratory diseases (CVRDs) cause huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The prevalence of CVRDs in many countries, including Pakistan, is not clearly understood. RESULTS: Incidences of 5 chicken respiratory viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV/AAVV-1), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were assessed on commercial Pakistani farms with respiratory problems from 2014 through to 2016. While AIV and AAVV-1 were frequently detected (16 to 17% of farms), IBV and aMPV were rarely detected (in 3 to 5% of farms) and ILTV was not detected. We characterized H9 AIV of the G1 lineage, genotype VII AAVV-1, GI-13 IBV, and type B aMPV strains with very little genetic variability in the 2-year study period. Co-infections with AIV and AAVV-1 were common and wild type AAVV-1 was detected despite the use of vaccines. Control measures to limit the virus burden in chicken flocks are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that AIV (H9), AAVV-1, IBV and aMPV are prevalent in commercial poultry in Pakistan. Further studies are necessary to assess circulating strains, economic losses caused by infections and coinfections of these pathogens, and the costs and benefits of countermeasures. Furthermore, veterinarians and farmers should be informed of the pathogens circulating in the field and hence advised on the use of vaccines.","Umar, Sajid; Teillaud, Angélique; Aslam, Hassan Bin; Guerin, Jean-Luc; Ducatez, Mariette F.",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6802313/,13
4122,Recovery of TRIM25-Mediated RIG-I Ubiquitination through Suppression of NS1 by RNA Aptamers,2019-10-10,"Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus has been shown to inhibit the innate immune response by blocking the induction of interferon (IFN). In this study, we isolated two single-stranded RNA aptamers specific to NS1 with K(d) values of 1.62 ± 0.30 nM and 1.97 ± 0.27 nM, respectively, using a systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The selected aptamers were able to inhibit the interaction of NS1 with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), and suppression of NS1 enabled retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) to be ubiquitinated regularly by TRIM25. Additional luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that suppression of NS1 by the selected aptamers induced IFN production. It is noted that viral replication was also inhibited through IFN induction in the presence of the selected aptamers. These results suggest that the isolated aptamers are strongly expected to be new therapeutic agents against influenza infection.","Woo, Hye-Min; Lee, Jin-Moo; Kim, Chul-Joong; Lee, Jong-Soo; Jeong, Yong-Joo",Mol Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6821451/,13
4128,Role of rhesus macaque IFITM3(2) in simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaques,2019-11-04,"The experimental infection of rhesus macaques (rh) with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is an important model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of humans. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits HIV and SIV infection at the stage of host cell entry. However, it is still unclear to what extent the antiviral activity of IFITM3 observed in cell culture translates into inhibition of HIV/SIV spread in the infected host. We have shown previously that although rhIFITM3 inhibits SIV entry into cultured cells, polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene are not strongly associated with viral load or disease progression in SIV infected macaques. Here, we examined whether rhIFITM3(2), which is closely related to rhIFITM3 at the sequence level, exerts antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene impact the course of SIV infection. We show that expression of rhIFITM3(2) is interferon-inducible and inhibits SIV entry into cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to rhIFITM3. We further report the identification of 19 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene. However, analysis of a well characterized cohort of SIV infected macaques revealed that none of the polymorphisms had a significant impact upon the course of SIV infection. These results and our previous work suggest that polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) genes do not strongly modulate the course of SIV infection in macaques.","Winkler, Michael; Gärtner, Sabine; Markus, Lara; Hoffmann, Markus; Nehlmeier, Inga; Krawczak, Michael; Sauermann, Ulrike; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827983/,13

Thus, with the exclusion of hepatitis D virus, close or distant relatives of these human pathogens were identified in a number of domestic and wild mammals. Also, sequences of human viral strains isolated from different geographic locations and over different time-spans have allowed the application of phylogeographic and molecular dating approaches to large viral phylogenies.

The emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains. Therefore, the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies. In this study, we found that germacrone, one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from Rhizoma Curcuma, was able to effectively inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Germacrone showed antiviral activity against PRV in the early phase of the viral replication cycle. Moreover, we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus, nor does it affect the expression of the PRV receptor protein nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155. Our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant PRV.","He, Wanting; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Su, Jingyin; Ye, Rui; Zheng, Yuna; Su, Shuo",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963304/,13

We aimed to evaluate the effect of performing rib fixation with the addition of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) on patients with ARF caused by blunt thoracic injury with ventilator dependence. METHODS: This observational study prospectively enrolled patients with multiple bicortical rib fractures with hemothorax caused by severe blunt chest trauma. All patients received positive pressure mechanical ventilation within 24 h after trauma because of ARF. Some patients who received rib fixation with VATS were enrolled as group 1, and the others who received only VATS were designated as group 2. The length of ventilator use was the primary clinical outcome. Rates of pneumonia and length of hospital stay constituted secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. The basic demographic characteristics between the two groups exhibited no statistical differences. All patients received operations within 6 days after trauma. The length of ventilator use was shorter in group 1 (3.19 ± 3.37 days vs. 8.05 ± 8.23, P = 0.002). The rate of pneumonia was higher in group 2 (38.1% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.005). The length of hospital stay was much shorter in group 1 (17.76 ± 8.38 days vs. 24.13 ± 9.80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Rib fixation combined with VATS could shorten the length of ventilator use and reduce the pneumonia rate in patients with severe chest blunt injury with ARF. Therefore, this operation could shorten the overall length of hospital stay.","Wu, Tung-Ho; Lin, Hsing-Lin; Chou, Yi-Pin; Huang, Fong-Dee; Huang, Wen-Yen; Tarng, Yih-Wen",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7017455/,13

The reduction of steps is a key factor in order to decrease the risk of human errors resulting in invalid series and delayed results. We describe here a process of preparation of oligonucleotide primers and hydrolysis probe in a single tube at predefined optimized concentrations that are stabilized via lyophilization (Lyoph-P&P). Lyoph-P&P was compared versus the classic protocol using extemporaneously prepared liquid reagents using (i) sensitivity study, (ii) long-term stability at 4 °C, and (iii) long-term stability at 37 °C mimicking transportation without cold chain. Two previously published molecular assays were selected for this study. They target two emerging viruses that are listed on the blueprint of the WHO as to be considered for preparedness and response actions: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV). Results of our study demonstrate that (i) Lyoph-P&P is stable for at least 4 days at 37 °C supporting shipping without the need of cold chain, (ii) Lyoph-P&P rehydrated solution is stable at +4 °C for at least two weeks, (iii) sensitivity observed with Lyoph-P&P is at least equal to, often better than, that observed with liquid formulation, (iv) validation of results observed with low-copy specimens is rendered easier by higher fluorescence level. In conclusion, Lyoph-P&P holds several advantages over extemporaneously preparer liquid formulation that merit to be considered when a novel real-time molecular assay is implemented in a laboratory in charge of routine diagnostic activity.","Thirion, Laurence; Dubot-Peres, Audrey; Pezzi, Laura; Corcostegui, Iban; Touinssi, Mhammed; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Charrel, Remi N.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077261/,13

The underlying pathophysiology of NEC is poorly defined, although there is a suggestion that bacterial agents play an important role in the process. In this study, we evaluated bacterial isolates from 17 NEC cases and matched asymptomatic control infants. Isolates from NEC patients were no more likely than control isolates to be adherent to enterocytes, as assessed by a Caco-2 cell tissue culture model. Adherent Escherichia coli isolates, from both NEC cases and controls, were able to cause pathologic changes typical of NEC in a weanling rabbit ileal loop model. Adherence of E. coli strains to Caco-2 cells, and subsequent production of disease in weanling rabbits, could be blocked by coinfection with Gram-positive isolates from control children. In contrast, in three of four instances, adherent E. coli from NEC cases retained their adherence and caused illness in rabbits when coinfected with Gram-positive isolates from the homologous child. Our data suggest that patterns of intestinal adherence, as influenced by the underlying intestinal microbial ecology, play a role in the pathophysiology of NEC.","Panigrahi, Pinaki; Gupta, Sunil; Gewolb, Ira H; Morris, J Glenn",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086551/,13

Both VR-2332 and the European isolate (called the Lelystad virus) have been identified as infectious agents responsible for the swine disease called PRRS. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that there are degrees of amino acid identity to the Lelystad virus open reading frames ranging from 55% in ORF 5 to 79% in ORF 6. Hydropathy profiles indicate that the ORFs of VR-2332 and Lelystad virus correspond structurally despite significant sequence differences. These results are consistent with the biological similarities but distinct serological properties of North American and European isolates of the virus.","Murtaugh, M. P.; Elam, M. R.; Kakach, L.

At the acid pH values the virus was released more slowly but reached a maximum titre similar to that at the higher pH values and showed only minimum reduction in infectivity up to 49 hours post inoculation. The stability of virus in tissue culture medium was shown to be directly related to pH between pH 6.0–8.0, being more stable at the acid pH values. The degree of cytopathogenicity induced in chick kidney cells following infection with IBV was directly related to the pH at which the cells were incubated, occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher pH values.

5288,An update on swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1: a review,2009-10-07,"One subject of spatial epidemiology is spatial variation in disease risk or incidence. The spread of epidemics can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, spatial pattern of an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rates is investigated. The conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation are gained and, in particular, exact Turing domain is found in the two parameters space. Furthermore, numerical results show that force of infection, namely β, plays an important role in the spatial pattern. More specifically, different patterns emerge as β increases. The mathematical analysis and numerical results well extend the finding of pattern formation in the epidemic models and may well explain the field observed in some areas.","Sun, Gui-Quan",Nonlinear Dyn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088525/,13
5447,Viral component of the human genome,2017-05-09,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as pandemics, can result in adverse consequences and major economic losses across various economic sectors. Based on findings from the 2009 A H1N1 pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR), this paper presents a recovery analysis for workforce disruptions using economic input–output modeling. The model formulation takes into consideration the dynamic interdependencies across sectors in an economic system in addition to the inherent characteristics of the economic sectors. From a macroeconomic perspective, the risk of the influenza disaster can be modeled using two risk metrics. First, there is the level of inoperability, which represents the percentage difference between the ideal production level and the degraded production level. Second, the economic loss metric represents the financial value associated with the reduced output. The contribution of this work revolves around the modeling of uncertainties triggered by new perturbations to interdependent economic sectors within an influenza pandemic timeline. We model the level of inoperability of economic sectors throughout their recovery horizon from the initial outbreak of the disaster using a dynamic model. Moreover, we use the level of inoperability values to quantify the cumulative economic losses incurred by the sectors within the recovery horizon. Finally, we revisit the 2009 NCR pandemic scenario to demonstrate the use of uncertainty analysis in modeling the inoperability and economic loss behaviors due to time-varying perturbations and their associated ripple effects to interdependent economic sectors.","El Haimar, Amine; Santos, Joost R.",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089399/,13

A series of deletion mutants containing different regions ofgp41 gene were constructed and expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) strain. After IPTG induction, the high mortality of host bacteria was observed in host bacteria carrying the deletion mutants ofgp41 gene except for those transformed with pET-HN2; coordinately, the mRNA transcripts of thegp41 was rapidly decreased; and the release of [(3)H]uridine increased upon induction. All these data suggested that GP41 protein has a cytotoxic effect onE. coli, and it is the cytotoxicity of thegp41 gene product that contributes to the high mortality when expressed inE. coli.","Yuan, Yuhua; Bi, Changhao; Li, Ju; Wang, Xueqian; Geng, Yunqi; Chen, Qimin",Chin Sci Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089494/,13

As a result, several very different time scales are simultaneously present in the model; this makes its analytical study an extremely difficult task. However, the significant difference of the time scales implies the existence of a possibility of the model order reduction through a process of time separation. In this paper we conduct the procedure of model order reduction for a reasonably simple model of RNA virus evolution reducing the original system of three integro-partial derivative equations to a single equation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Monascus pigment derivatives, which were derived from a microbial secondary metabolite synthesized from polyketides by Monascus spp., as HCV antiviral agents. METHODS: We performed an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay to screen for HCV RdRp inhibitors. The anti-HCV activity of RdRp inhibitors in HCV-replicating cells was evaluated by quantification of the RNA viral genome. Molecular docking analysis was performed to predict the binding sites of the selected RdRp inhibitors. RESULTS: We have identified a Monascus pigment and its derivatives as inhibitors of the HCV NS5B RdRp. A group of Monascus orange pigment (MOP) amino acid derivatives, in which the reactive oxygen moiety was changed to amino acids, significantly inhibited HCV replication. Further, combination of the MOP derivatives (Phe, Val or Leu conjugates) with interferon (IFN)-α inhibited HCV replication more than IFN-α treatment alone. Lastly, molecular docking studies indicate the inhibitors may bind to a thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B. The antiviral activity of the MOP derivatives was related to a modulation of the mevalonate pathway, since the mevalonate-induced increase in HCV replication was suppressed by the MOP compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify amino acid derivatives of MOP as potential anti-HCV agents and suggest that their combination with IFN-α might offer an alternative strategy for the control of HCV replication.","Sun, Ji-Min; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kim, Geon-Woo; Rhee, Jin-Kyu; Kim, Nam Doo; Jung, Heeyong; Jeun, Jungae; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Han, Seung Hyun; Shin, Chul Soo; Oh, Jong-Won",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109977/,13

This workshop emphasized the following points. (1) In epidemiological studies of influenza virus, serological, clinical, and gene-sequencing methods have been used to produce a full picture of genetic evolution. Less complete information exists about other viruses, although new data on respiratory syncytial virus are emerging. (2) Tools for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections have been developed in conjunction with the use of solid-phase immunoassays. A role remains for tissue culture in surveillance and epidemiological studies. Detection of bacterial involvement in respiratory infections has been more difficult. (3) Treatment of infections due to respiratory viruses has advanced with the use of amantadine and aerosolized ribavirin. On the other hand, many viruses remain refractory to treatment. Means for preventing influenza are established, but barriers to the development of other viral vaccines—including the existence of multiple serotypes, imperfect natural immunity, and paradoxical hypersensitivity—have proven difficult to surmount.","McIntosh, Kenneth; Halonen, Pekka; Ruuskanen, Olli",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110003/,13

The prevalence of FIV infection in this population was 12.5% and among the seropositive cats a greater proportion was male (74.5%) than female (25.5%). A correlation between the clinical status and the evolution of the pathology is described together with a score based on the severity of the stomatitis in infected cats.

Second, we discuss how the integration and analysis of multiple types of omics data through integrative bioinformatics may facilitate the determination of more predictive and robust disease signatures, lead to a better understanding of (patho)physiological molecular mechanisms, and facilitate personalized medicine. Third, we focus on network analysis and discuss how gene networks can be constructed from omics data and how these networks can be decomposed into smaller modules. We discuss how the resulting modules can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses, provide insight into disease mechanisms, and lead to predictive models.

We performed solid-phase rolling circle amplification (RCA) on the surface of a Au electrode, and detected RCA products in situ using chronocoulometry (CC) with [Ru (NH(3))(6)](3+) as the signaling molecule. Detection sensitivity for DNA and a microRNA (miR-143) was 100 fM and 1 pM, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted potentiometric DNA detection using an ethidium ion (Et(+))-selective electrode (Et(+)ISE) for real-time monitoring of isothermal DNA amplification by primer-generation RCA (PG-RCA). The Et(+)ISE potential enabled real-time monitoring of the PG-RCA reaction in the range of 10 nM–1 μM of initial target DNA.

They are important in catalysis and RNA splicing and are the most important steps of translation. This chapter describes experimental methods for probing RNA structure and theoretical methods allowing the prediction of thermodynamically favorable RNA folding. These methods are complementary and together they provide a powerful approach to determine the structure of RNAs. The three-dimensional (tertiary) structure of RNA is formed by hydrogen-bonding among functional groups of nucleosides in different regions of the molecule, by coordination of polyvalent cations, and by stacking between the double-stranded regions present in the RNA. The tertiary structures of only some small RNAs have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The most widely used approach for the investigation of RNA structure is chemical and enzymatic probing, in combination with theoretical methods and phylogenetic studies allowing the prediction of variants of RNA folding. Investigations of RNA structures with different enzymatic and chemical probes can provide detailed data allowing the identification of double-stranded regions of the molecules and nucleotides involved in tertiary interactions.","Kolchanov, N.A.; Titov, I.I.; Vlassova, I.E.; Vlassov, V.V.",Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133174/,13

We hypothesized that differential expression of host genes related to translation and innate immune response could contribute to differential resistance to NDV in inbred Fayoumi and Leghorn lines. The expression of twenty-one genes related to the interferon signaling pathway and the eIF2 family was evaluated at two- and six-days post infection (dpi) in the spleen from both lines, either challenged by NDV or nonchallenged. Higher expression of OASL in NDV challenged versus nonchallenged spleen was observed in Leghorns at 2 dpi. Lower expression of EIF2B5 was found in NDV challenged than nonchallenged Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi. At 2 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2B5 and EIF2S3 than NDV challenged Leghorns. At 6 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2S3 and EIF2B4 than NDV challenged Leghorns. The genetic line differences in expression of eIF2-related genes may contribute to their differential resistance to NDV and also to understanding the interaction between protein synthesis shut-off and virus control in chickens.","Del Vesco, Ana Paula; Kaiser, Michael G.; Monson, Melissa S.; Zhou, Huaijun; Lamont, Susan J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145804/,13

It is composed of a highly conserved N‐terminal region, which is homological to group‐1 cystatin, and a repetitive peptide at the C‐terminus. The purified recombinant proteins of tarocystatin, such as full‐length (FL), N‐terminus (Nt) and C‐terminus (Ct) peptides, were produced and their inhibitory activities against papain as well as their antifungal effects were investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that FL peptide exhibited mixed type inhibition (K (ia) = 0.098 μm and K (ib) = 0.252 μm) and Nt peptide showed competitive inhibition (K (i) = 0.057 μm), whereas Ct peptide possessed weak papain activation properties. A shift in the inhibitory pattern from competitive inhibition of Nt peptide alone to mixed type inhibition of FL peptide implied that the Ct peptide has an regulatory effect on the function of FL peptide. Based on the inhibitory kinetics of FL (group‐2) and Nt (group‐1) peptides on papain activity, an inhibitory mechanism of group‐2 phytocystatins and a regulatory mechanism of extended Ct peptide have each been proposed. By contrast, the antifungal activity of Nt peptide appeared to be greater than that of FL peptide, and the Ct peptide showed no effect on antifungal activity, indicating that the antifungal effect is not related to proteinase inhibitory activity. The results are valid for most phytocystatins with respect to the inhibitory mechanism against cysteine proteinase.","Wang, Ke‐Ming; Kumar, Senthil; Cheng, Yi‐Sheng; Venkatagiri, Shripathi; Yang, Ai‐Hwa; Yeh, Kai‐Wun",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164091/,13

METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical records from two referral institutions for cases undergoing pancreatic biopsy between 2000 and 2013. RESULTS: Twenty‐four dogs and 19 cats that had surgical pancreatic biopsy had sufficient detail in their clinical records and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Postoperative complications were seen in 10 cases of which 5 were suggestive of post‐surgical pancreatitis. Two patients were euthanased within 10 days of surgery because of the underlying disease; neither suffered postoperative complications. Pancreatic pathology was found in 19 cases, 7 cases showed no change other than benign pancreatic nodular hyperplasia, and no abnormalities were seen in 18 cases. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Complications may be encountered following surgical pancreatic biopsy, although the risk should be minimal with good surgical technique. Pancreatic biopsy may provide a useful contribution to case management but it is not clear whether a negative pancreatic biopsy should be used to rule out pancreatic disease. Dogs were more likely to have no significant pathology found on pancreatic biopsy than cats, where chronic pancreatitis was the most common finding.","Pratschke, K.

On the other hand, Jijoye, P3HR‐1, and P3HR‐1 K cell lines were confirmed to be Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) nonproducer, low producer, and high producer, respectively. The chemical activation of EBV genome by treating P3HR‐1 cells with 12‐O‐tetradecanyl phorbol‐13 acetate (TPA) and n‐butyrate resulted in inhibition of the expression of class I and II antigens, while the addition of retinoic acid, an inhibitor of virus replication, blocked the decrease in the MHC antigen expression. These findings suggested that there might be an inverse correlation between the virus production and the expression of class I and II MHC antigens.","Yokochi, Takashi; Inoue, Yoshiko; Iwata, Hitoshi; Miyadai, Toshiaki; Kimura, Yoshinobu",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168452/,13

10857,"Direct RNA Sequencing for the Study of Synthesis, Processing, and Degradation of Modified Transcripts",2020-04-28,"Enhanced host protection against re-infection requires generation of memory T cells of sufficient quantity and functional quality. Unlike well-studied inbred mice, T cell responses of diverse size and quality are generated following infection of humans and outbred mice. Thus, additional models are needed that accurately reflect variation in immune outcomes in genetically diverse populations and to uncover underlying genetic causes. The Collaborative Cross (CC), a large recombinant inbred panel of mice, is an ideal model in this pursuit for the high degree of genetic variation present, because it allows for assessment of genetic factors underlying unique phenotypes. Here, we advance the utility of the CC as a tool to analyze the immune response to viral infection. We describe variability in resting immune cell composition and adaptive immune responses generated among CC strains following systemic virus infection and reveal quantitative trait loci responsible for generation of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells.","Martin, Matthew D.; Sompallae, Ramakrishna; Winborn, Christina S.; Harty, John T.; Badovinac, Vladimir P.",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7212788/,13

We describe the population epidemiology of IMD in Malta in order to assess the potential utility of a meningococcal vaccination programme. All cases of microbiologically confirmed IMD in the Maltese population from 2000 to 2017 were analysed to quantify the overall and capsular-specific disease burden. Mean overall crude and age-specific meningococcal incidence rates were calculated to identify the target age groups that would benefit from vaccination. Over the 18-year study period, 111 out of the 245 eligible notified cases were confirmed microbiologically of which 70.3% had septicaemia, 21.6% had meningitis, and 6.3% had both. The mean overall crude incidence rate was 1.49/100,000 population with an overall case fatality rate of 12.6%. Meningococcal capsular groups (Men) B followed by C were the most prevalent with W and Y appearing over the last 6 years. Infants had the highest meningococcal incidence rate of 18.9/100,000 followed by 6.1/100,000 in 1–5 year olds and 3.6/100,000 in 11–15 year old adolescents. The introduction of MenACWY and MenB vaccines on the national immunization schedule in Malta would be expected to reduce the disease burden of meningococcal disease in children and adolescents in Malta.","Pace, David; Gauci, Charmaine; Barbara, Christopher",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7229431/,13

However, the mechanism underlying B. ovis infection remains unclear. In the present study, we used prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild-type B. ovis and intracellular B. ovis in RAW264.7 macrophages. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the top 10 upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The results showed that 212 genes were differentially expressed, including 68 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in 30 GO terms linked to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, beta-alanine metabolism, and quorum sensing pathway.

Interestingly, Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), a neurotropic virus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in the trigeminal ganglion followed by periodic reactivations, has been reportedly linked both to AD and to oxidative stress conditions. Herein, we analyzed, through biochemical and redox proteomic approaches, the mouse model of recurrent HSV-1 infection we previously set up, to investigate whether multiple virus reactivations induced oxidative stress in the mouse brain and affected protein function and related intracellular pathways. Following multiple HSV-1 reactivations, we found in mouse brains increased levels of oxidative stress hallmarks, including 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and 13 HNE-modified proteins whose levels were found significantly altered in the cortex of HSV-1-infected mice compared to controls. We focused on two proteins previously linked to AD pathogenesis, i.e., glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and collapsin response-mediated protein 2 (CRMP2), which are involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and in microtubule stabilization, respectively. We found that recurrent HSV-1 infection disables GRP78 function and activates the UPR, whereas it prevents CRMP2 function in mouse brains. Overall, these data suggest that repeated HSV-1 reactivation into the brain may contribute to neurodegeneration also through oxidative damage.","Protto, Virginia; Tramutola, Antonella; Fabiani, Marco; Marcocci, Maria Elena; Napoletani, Giorgia; Iavarone, Federica; Vincenzoni, Federica; Castagnola, Massimo; Perluigi, Marzia; Di Domenico, Fabio; De Chiara, Giovanna; Palamara, Anna Teresa",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7409037/,13

A central feature of virus perseverance in cattle herds is the unique mechanism of persistent infection. Managing BVDV infection in herds involves controlling persistently infected carrier animals using a multidimensional approach of vaccination, biosecurity, and identification of BVDV reservoirs. A decade has passed since the original American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement on BVDV. While much has remained the same with respect to clinical signs of disease, pathogenesis of infection including persistent infection, and diagnosis, scientific articles published since 2010 have led to a greater understanding of difficulties associated with control of BVDV. This consensus statement update on BVDV presents greater focus on topics currently relevant to the biology and control of this viral pathogen of cattle, including changes in virus subpopulations, infection in heterologous hosts, immunosuppression, and vaccination.","Walz, Paul H.; Chamorro, Manuel F.; M.

Acrylamide was administered in drinking water throughout the 106-week study at concentrations required to provide a dose of 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg/day to males or 0, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg/day to females. Complete necropsy and gross pathology examinations were performed on all study animals. Histopathology examinations were conducted on selected tissues of all high-dose and control animals. Selected tissues from intermediate and low-dose groups were subjected to histopathological examinations as required to clarify high- and controldose group observations. There was no visual observation of neurotoxicity in any study animal but sciatic nerve degeneration was observed in the male and female high-dose groups. Increased mortality related to acrylamide was observed in the high- dose male group from Month 17 to the end of the study and in the high-dose females during Month 24. Mesotheliomas of the testicular tunic were significantly increased in the high-dose male group. The combined incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas and fibroadenomas was significantly increased in both acrylamide-dosed female groups. Males and females in the high-dose groups as well as females of the low-dose group had significantly (p<0.001) increased thyroid follicular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas. A variety of other tumor types observed with increased incidence in a previous acrylamide onco genicity study (i.e., combined CNS glial neoplasms, papillomas of the oral cavity, adenomas of the clitoral gland, and uterine adenocarcinomas) were not observed to be present at increased incidence in this study. This study confirms previously described acrylamide induction of benign tumors of the thyroid and mammary glands as well as mesotheliomas of the testis. By using a larger number of animals with an unbalanced study design, this study showed that acrylamide did not induce glial tumors and demonstrated that the no-observable-effect level for scrotal mesotheliomas is 0.5 mg/kg. It also demonstrated that the in creased incidence of mammary tumors was again within historical control ranges.","FRIEDMAN, MARVIN A.; DULAK, LINDA H.; STEDHAM, MICHAEL A.",Fundam Appl Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7528933/,13

Unfortunately, no effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against many Mononegavirales are currently available. Viral polymerases have been attractive and major antiviral therapeutic targets. Therefore, Mononegavirales polymerases have been extensively investigated for their structures and functions. Mononegavirales mimic RNA synthesis of their eukaryotic counterparts by utilizing multifunctional RNA polymerases to replicate entire viral genomes and transcribe viral mRNAs from individual viral genes as well as synthesize 5′ methylated cap and 3′ poly(A) tail of the transcribed viral mRNAs. The catalytic subunit large protein (L) and cofactor phosphoprotein (P) constitute the Mononegavirales polymerases. In this review, we discuss the shared and unique features of RNA synthesis, the monomeric multifunctional enzyme L, and the oligomeric multimodular adapter P of Mononegavirales. We outline the structural analyses of the Mononegavirales polymerases since the first structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L protein determined in 2015 and highlight multiple high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the polymerases of Mononegavirales, namely, VSV, RABV, HRSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), that have been reported in recent months (2019 to 2020). We compare the structures of those polymerases grouped by virus family, illustrate the similarities and differences among those polymerases, and reveal the potential RNA synthesis mechanisms and models of highly conserved Mononegavirales.

The knowledge of the genetic diversity and epidemiology of AstVs in Africa is limited. This study aimed to characterize astroviruses in asymptomatic smallholder piglets in Kenya and Uganda. Twenty-four samples were randomly selected from a total of 446 piglets aged below 6 months that were initially collected for rotavirus study and sequenced for whole genome analysis. Thirteen (13/24) samples had contigs with high identity to genus Mamastrovirus. Analysis of seven strains with complete (or near complete) AstV genome revealed variable nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities with known porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) strains. The U083 and K321 strains had nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 66.4 to 75.4% with the known PoAstV2 strains; U460 strain had nucleotide sequence identities of 57.0 to 65.1% regarding the known PoAstV3; and K062, K366, K451, and K456 strains had nucleotide sequence identities of 63.5 to 80% with the known PoAstV4 strains. The low sequence identities (<90%) indicate that novel genotypes of PoAstVs are circulating in the study area. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple recombination events in PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to the observed genetic diversity. Linear antigen epitope prediction and a comparative analysis of capsid protein of our field strains identified potential candidate epitopes that could help in the design of immuno-diagnostic tools and a subunit vaccine.

Unfortunately, various small gastrointestinal lesions are undetectable during early-stage examination by medical experts. In previous studies, various deep learning–based computer-aided diagnosis tools have been used to make a significant contribution to the effective diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, most of these methods were designed to detect a limited number of gastrointestinal diseases, such as polyps, tumors, or cancers, in a specific part of the human gastrointestinal tract. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis tool to assist medical experts in diagnosing various types of gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: Our proposed framework comprises a deep learning–based classification network followed by a retrieval method. In the first step, the classification network predicts the disease type for the current medical condition. Then, the retrieval part of the framework shows the relevant cases (endoscopic images) from the previous database. These past cases help the medical expert validate the current computer prediction subjectively, which ultimately results in better diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: All the experiments were performed using 2 endoscopic data sets with a total of 52,471 frames and 37 different classes. The optimal performances obtained by our proposed method in accuracy, F1 score, mean average precision, and mean average recall were 96.19%, 96.99%, 98.18%, and 95.86%, respectively. The overall performance of our proposed diagnostic framework substantially outperformed state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive computer-aided diagnosis framework for identifying various types of gastrointestinal diseases. The results show the superiority of our proposed method over various other recent methods and illustrate its potential for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Our proposed network can be applicable to other classification domains in medical imaging, such as computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound sequences.","Owais, Muhammad; Arsalan, Muhammad; Mahmood, Tahir; Kang, Jin Kyu; Park, Kang Ryoung",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728528/,13

Here, we model wartime-like crash deployment of direct air capture (DAC) as a policy response to the climate crisis, calculating funding, net CO(2) removal, and climate impacts. An emergency DAC program, with investment of 1.2–1.9% of global GDP annually, removes 2.2–2.3 GtCO(2) yr(–1) in 2050, 13–20 GtCO(2) yr(–1) in 2075, and 570–840 GtCO(2) cumulatively over 2025–2100. Compared to a future in which policy efforts to control emissions follow current trends (SSP2-4.5), DAC substantially hastens the onset of net-zero CO(2) emissions (to 2085–2095) and peak warming (to 2090–2095); yet warming still reaches 2.4–2.5 °C in 2100. Such massive CO(2) removals hinge on near-term investment to boost the future capacity for upscaling. DAC is most cost-effective when using electricity sources already available today: hydropower and natural gas with renewables; fully renewable systems are more expensive because their low load factors do not allow efficient amortization of capital-intensive DAC plants.","Hanna, Ryan; Abdulla, Ahmed; Xu, Yangyang; Victor, David G.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809262/,13

Many people practice low-intensity short-duration exercise with the expectation of a beneficial effect on immunocompetency. However, it is difficult to affirm the existence of definite evidence of such a benefit. In this article, we discuss the effects of low-intensity short-duration exercise on cell-mediated immunity, and contrast them to the effects of high-intensity and long-duration exercise. Whereas high-intensity exercise induces inflammation and reduces cell-mediated immune system function, low-intensity exercise does not appear to have a large effect on either inflammation or cell-mediated immune function. Low-intensity exercises such as walking and yoga, which are helpful to relieve stress, cannot be considered as harmful to the immune system. Although yoga was shown to impose fewer restrictions on breathing and physical strain, the evidence that yoga enhances cell-mediated immunity remains insufficient. Therefore, further studies are needed to examine the exercise mode that may be most effective for improvement of immune functions.","Suzuki, Katsuhiko; Hayashida, Harumi",Sports (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7826544/,13

Most HSCs remain quiescent in the bone marrow (BM) and respond in a timely manner to either physiological or pathological cues, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. In the past few years, accumulating evidence has highlighted an intermediate role of inflammasome activation in hematopoietic maintenance, post-hematopoietic transplantation complications, and senescence. As a cytosolic protein complex, the inflammasome participates in immune responses by generating a caspase cascade and inducing cytokine secretion. This process is generally triggered by signals from purinergic receptors that integrate extracellular stimuli such as the metabolic factor ATP via P2 receptors. Furthermore, targeted modulation/inhibition of specific inflammasomes may help to maintain/restore adequate hematopoietic homeostasis. In this review, we will first summarize the possible relationships between inflammasome activation and homeostasis based on certain interesting phenomena. The cellular and molecular mechanism by which purinergic receptors integrate extracellular cues to activate inflammasomes inside HSCs will then be described. We will also discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammasomes and their components in some diseases through pharmacological or genetic strategies.","Yang, Lijing; Hu, Mengjia; Lu, Yukai; Han, Songling; Wang, Junping",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827629/,13

METHODS: 60 kg anesthetized and mechanically ventilated male pigs were subjected to a mean 1030 (range 900–1246) mL (25% of estimated total blood volume, class II) haemorrhage. AAJT (n = 6) or zone 3 REBOA (n = 6) were then applied for 240 min. Crystalloid fluids were administered to maintain carotid MAP. The animals were monitored for 30 min after reperfusion. RESULTS: Cumulative resuscitative fluid requirements increased 7.2 times (mean difference 2079 mL; 95% CI 627–3530 mL) in zone 3 REBOA (mean 2412; range 800–4871 mL) compared to AAJT (mean 333; range 0–1000 mL) to maintain target carotid MAP. Release of the AAJT required vasopressor support with norepinephrine infusion for a mean 9.6 min (0.1 µg/kg/min), while REBOA release required no vasopressor support. CONCLUSION: Zone 3 REBOA required 7.2 times more crystalloids to maintain the targeted MAP. The AAJT may therefore be considered in a situation of hemorrhagic shock to limit the need for crystalloid infusions, although removal of the AAJT caused more severe hemodynamic and metabolic effects which required vasopressor support.","Brännström, Andreas; Dahlquist, Albin; Gustavsson, Jenny; Arborelius, Ulf P.; Günther, Mattias",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7846491/,13

In this retrospective study, we aimed to define the clinical phenotype, laboratory features, and treatment outcomes of CQ/HCQ myopathy, as well as the safety profile of these drugs. We identified 13 patients seen between 2000 and 2019, with a median age at presentation of 66 years (range 53–89); 11 were females. At onset of symptoms, patients were on CQ or HCQ for a minimum of 6 months and up to 21 years. Diagnosis was often delayed by a median of 6 months (range 3–48). At presentation, 13 patients reported limb weakness, with five requiring assistance in walking. Ten reported dysphagia, often severe, resulting in marked weight loss or aspiration pneumonia. Nine reported respiratory symptoms, which were multifactorial in four, and four reported severe neck weakness. Myopathy clinical phenotype showed predominant involvement of one or more of the following: proximal limb muscle weakness (12 patients), dysphagia (9), axial weakness (4), and respiratory failure (5). Eleven patients had a cardiac evaluation showing prolonged QT interval in 10 and CQ/HCQ cardiomyopathy (CMP) in four. Ten out of 12 patients markedly improved after discontinuing the medication, but most were left with some residual weakness. Eleven patients had a muscle biopsy showing a myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and marked acid phosphatase reactivity. Nine had elevated creatine kinase level up to 1,199 U/L. Twelve patients had an electromyography (EMG), which showed myopathic motor unit potentials with fibrillation potentials in 11 and myotonic discharges in 3. Higher cumulative dose and longer exposure duration were associated with more severe disability and more common cardiac and swallow involvement, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Herein, we demonstrate that long-term exposure to CQ and HCQ may result in a myopathy with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation and predilection for swallowing, respiratory, and cardiac muscles, often with marked associated morbidity. Once accurately diagnosed and the drug is discontinued, patients usually improve but often fail to return to baseline.","Naddaf, Elie; Paul, Pritikanta; AbouEzzeddine, Omar F.",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7884308/,13

PsGH3 modeled structure constructed using Phyre2 displayed multidomain architecture comprising an N-terminal (β/α)(8)-fold domain followed by (α/β)(6)-sandwich domain, PA14 domain, and a C-terminal domain resembling an immunoglobulin fold. Ramachandran plot displayed 99.3% of amino acids in the allowed region and 0.7% residues in the disallowed region. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and structure superposition of PsGH3 with other homologues from GH3 family revealed the conserved residues, Asp274 and Glu624 present in loops LA and LB, respectively originating from N-terminal domain act as catalytic residues. The volume and area calculated for PsGH3 displayed a deep active-site conformation comparable with its homologues, β-1,4-glucosidases (GH3) of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Streptomyces venezuelae. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of PsGH3 structure for 80 ns suggested stable and compact structure. Molecular docking studies revealed deeper active site conformation of PsGH3 that could house larger cellooligosaccharides up to 7° of polymerization (DP7). The amino acid residues, Ala86, Leu88, Cys275, Pro483, Phe493, Asn417, Asn491, Pro492, and Leu495 created a binding pocket near the catalytic cleft, crucial for ligand binding. MD simulation of PsGH3 in the presence of cellooligosaccharides, viz., cellobiose and celloheptaose showed stability in terms of RMSD, R(g), and SASA values till 80 ns. The calculation of average number of hydrogen bond (H-bond), interaction energy, and binding free energy confirmed the stronger binding affinity of the larger cellooligosaccharides such as celloheptaose in the binding cavity of PsGH3.","Nath, Priyanka; Goyal, Arun",J Mol Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7945971/,13
16225,Structural basis for VPS34 kinase activation by Rab1 and Rab5 on membranes,2021-03-10,"The naïve antibody/B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of different individuals ought to exhibit significant functional commonality, given that most pathogens trigger an effective antibody response to immunodominant epitopes. Sequence-based repertoire analysis has so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared (‘public’) antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we search for evidence of geometric similarity/convergence across human antibody repertoires. We first structurally profile naïve (‘baseline’) antibody diversity using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals, predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples (‘Public Baseline’ structures). Our approach is the first computational method to find levels of BCR commonality commensurate with epitope immunodominance and could therefore be harnessed to find more genetically distant antibodies with same-epitope complementarity. We then apply the same structural profiling approach to repertoire snapshots from three individuals before and after flu vaccination, detecting a convergent structural drift indicative of recognising similar epitopes (‘Public Response’ structures). We show that Antibody Model Libraries derived from Public Baseline and Public Response structures represent a powerful geometric basis set of low-immunogenicity candidates exploitable for general or target-focused therapeutic antibody screening.","Raybould, Matthew I.

EHM affects as many as 14% of infected horses and a cell-associated viremia is thought to be central for EHM pathogenesis. While EHM is infrequent in younger horses, up to 70% of aged horses develop EHM. The aging immune system likely contributes to EHM pathogenesis; however, little is known about the host factors associated with clinical EHM. Here, we used the “old mare model” to induce EHM following EHV-1 infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of horses prior to infection and during viremia were collected and RNA sequencing with differential gene expression was used to compare the transcriptome of horses that did (EHM group) and did not (non-EHM group) develop clinical EHM. Interestingly, horses exhibiting EHM did not show respiratory disease, while non-EHM horses showed significant respiratory disease starting on day 2 post infection. Multiple immune pathways differed in EHM horses in response to EHV-1. These included an upregulation of IL-6 gene expression, a dysregulation of T-cell activation through AP-1 and responses skewed towards a T-helper 2 phenotype. Further, a dysregulation of coagulation and an upregulation of elements in the progesterone response were observed in EHM horses.","Zarski, Lila M.; Giessler, Kim S.; Jacob, Sarah I.; Weber, Patty Sue D.; McCauley, Allison G.; Lee, Yao; Soboll Hussey, Gisela",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7995974/,13

In this study, we assessed the ability of a home-based 6-minute walk test (6MWT) as well as passively collected activity data to supplement or even replace the in-clinic 6MWTs in patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We enrolled 110 participants who were scheduled for vascular or cardiac procedures. Each participant was supplied with an iPhone and an Apple Watch running the VascTrac research app and was followed for 6 months. Supervised 6MWTs were performed during clinic visits at scheduled intervals. Weekly at-home 6MWTs were performed via the VascTrac app. The app passively collected activity data such as daily step counts. Logistic regression with forward feature selection was used to assess at-home 6MWT and passive data as predictors for “frailty” as measured by the gold-standard supervised 6MWT. Frailty was defined as walking <300m on an in-clinic 6MWT. RESULTS: Under a supervised in-clinic setting, the smartphone and Apple Watch with the VascTrac app were able to accurately assess ‘frailty’ with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85%. Outside the clinic in an unsupervised setting, the home-based 6MWT is 83% sensitive and 60% specific in assessing “frailty.” Passive data collected at home were nearly as accurate at predicting frailty on a clinic-based 6MWT as was a home-based 6MWT, with area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 and 0.704, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal observational study, passive activity data acquired by an iPhone and Apple Watch were an accurate predictor of in-clinic 6MWT performance. This finding suggests that frailty and functional capacity could be monitored and evaluated remotely in patients with cardiovascular disease, enabling safer and higher resolution monitoring of patients.","Rens, Neil; Gandhi, Neil; Mak, Jonathan; Paul, Jeddeo; Bent, Drew; Liu, Stephanie; Savage, Dasha; Nielsen-Bowles, Helle; Triggs, Doran; Ata, Ghausia; Talgo, Julia; Gutierrez, Santiago; Aalami, Oliver",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990307/,13

Here, we investigate one possible advantage of online education: the ease of allowing remote guest speakers to interact with students in real time. In particular, we piloted a model in which guest speakers could facilitate direct music-related interactions with students, possibly benefiting students’ content knowledge and sense of community. In the context of an undergraduate animal physiology course, face-to-face lessons on arterial blood gases and the renal system were supplemented with videoconferences with a guest speaker who presented relevant content-rich songs and led class discussions of the lyrics. Survey and test data suggested that, after each of the lessons, the students (i) had increased confidence in their understanding of the material, (ii) performed better on objective test questions, and (iii) attributed their learning chiefly to the musical intervention.

AIM: To identify the needs and experiences of adult refugees in Jordan with advanced cancer and informal caregivers. DESIGN: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were purposively sampled at two Jordanian hospitals to achieve heterogeneity by age, gender, country of origin, and primary diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine refugees (22 patients, 7 caregivers) participated, and four themes were generated: (1) Psychological distress and sustaining social support. Refugees often experienced unmet psychosocial needs. However, psychosocial support was reported either absent or limited. (2) Knowledge and uncertainty. Lack of information and poor communication between healthcare providers and patients caused significant distress due to uncertainty. (3) Family anxiety and support roles. Being away from the home country cut patients and caregivers off from their wider social support network, which added increased anxiety and responsibilities to caregivers. (4) Compounded trauma and poverty. Many refugees have experienced trauma related to war that may affect their physical and mental health. They faced serious financial crises caused by the rising cost of medicines and treatment.

17613,protGear: A protein microarray data pre-processing suite,2021-04-24,"BACKGROUND: High turnover among healthcare workers is an increasingly common phenomenon in hospitals worldwide, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). In addition to the serious financial consequences, this is a major concern for patient care (disrupted continuity of care, decreased quality and safety of care, increased rates of medication errors, …). OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to understand how the ICU-level nurse turnover rate may be explained from multiple covariates at individual and ICU-level, using data from 526 French registered and auxiliary nurses (RANs). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in ICUs of Paris-area hospitals in 2013. First, we developed a small extension of a multi-level modeling method proposed in 2007 by Croon and van Veldhoven and validated its properties using a comprehensive simulation study. Second, we applied this approach to explain RAN turnover in French ICUs. RESULTS: Based on the simulation study, the approach we proposed allows to estimate the regression coefficients with a relative bias below 7% for group-level factors and below 12% for individual-level factors. In our data, the mean observed RAN turnover rate was 0.19 per year (SD = 0.09). Based on our results, social support from colleagues and supervisors as well as long durations of experience in the profession were negatively associated with turnover. Conversely, number of children and impossibility to skip a break due to workload were significantly associated with higher rates of turnover. At ICU-level, number of beds, presence of intermediate care beds (continuous care unit) in the ICU and staff-to-patient ratio emerged as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research may help decision makers within hospitals by highlighting major determinants of turnover among RANs. In addition, the new approach proposed here could prove useful to researchers faced with similar micro-macro data.","Daouda, Oumou Salama; Hocine, Mounia N.; Temime, Laura",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121288/,13

Extremism research has analyzed such movements in detail, focusing on individual- and movement-level characteristics. But are there system-level commonalities in the ways these movements emerge and grow? Here we compare the growth of the Boogaloos, a new and increasingly prominent U.S. extremist movement, to the growth of online support for ISIS, a militant, terrorist organization based in the Middle East that follows a radical version of Islam. We show that the early dynamics of these two online movements follow the same mathematical order despite their stark ideological, geographical, and cultural differences. The evolution of both movements, across scales, follows a single shockwave equation that accounts for heterogeneity in online interactions. These scientific properties suggest specific policies to address online extremism and radicalization. We show how actions by social media platforms could disrupt the onset and ‘flatten the curve’ of such online extremism by nudging its collective chemistry. Our results provide a system-level understanding of the emergence of extremist movements that yields fresh insight into their evolution and possible interventions to limit their growth.","Velásquez, N.; Manrique, P.; Sear, R.; Leahy, R.; Restrepo, N.

As such, dengue vaccine development has been an active area of research. Previous studies selected attenuated vaccine candidates based on plaque size. However, these candidates led to mixed safety outcome in clinical trials, suggesting it is insufficiently informative as an indicator of dengue virus (DENV) attenuation. In this study, we examined the genome diversity of wild-type DENVs and their attenuated derivatives developed by Mahidol University and tested in phase 1 clinical trials. We found that the attenuated DENVs, in particular the strain under clinical development by Takeda Vaccines, DENV2 PDK53, showed significantly higher genome diversity than its wild-type parent, DENV2 16681. The determinant of genomic diversity was intrinsic to the PDK53 genome as infectious clone of PDK53 showed greater genomic diversity after a single in vitro passage compared to 16681 infectious clone. Similar trends were observed with attenuated DENV1 and DENV4, both of which were shown to be attenuated clinically, but not DENV3 that was not adequately attenuated clinically. Taken together, evidence presented here suggests that genome diversity could be developed into a marker of DENV attenuation.","Bifani, Amanda Makha; Choy, Milly M.; Tan, Hwee Cheng; Ooi, Eng Eong",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138019/,13

Angiogenesis is regulated by intracellular endothelial signalling pathways, induced downstream of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors (VEGFRs). A major challenge in understanding angiogenesis is interpreting how signalling events occur dynamically within endothelial cell populations during sprouting, proliferation, and migration. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) is a central downstream effector of Vegf-signalling and reports the signalling that drives angiogenesis. We generated a vascular Erk biosensor transgenic line in zebrafish using a kinase translocation reporter that allows live-imaging of Erk-signalling dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of this line to live-image Erk activity during physiologically relevant angiogenic events. Further, we reveal dynamic and sequential endothelial cell Erk-signalling events following blood vessel wounding. Initial signalling is dependent upon Ca(2+) in the earliest responding endothelial cells, but is independent of Vegfr-signalling and local inflammation. The sustained regenerative response, however, involves a Vegfr-dependent mechanism that initiates concomitantly with the wound inflammatory response. This work reveals a highly dynamic sequence of signalling events in regenerative angiogenesis and validates a new resource for the study of vascular Erk-signalling in real-time.","Okuda, Kazuhide S; Keyser, Mikaela S; Gurevich, David B; Sturtzel, Caterina; Mason, Elizabeth A; Paterson, Scott; Chen, Huijun; Scott, Mark; Condon, Nicholas D; Martin, Paul; Distel, Martin; Hogan, Benjamin M",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175085/,13

A total of 14 531 students from 180 schools participated in the 2020 survey, yielding a corresponding student-level participation rate of 87.4% and school-level participation rate of 49.9%. The overall response rate, a product of the school-level and student-level participation rates, was 43.6%. EXPOSURES: Current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported current e-cigarette use behaviors (frequency of use, usual e-cigarette brand, and access source) by school level and flavored e-cigarette use and flavor types among current e-cigarette users by school level and device type. Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Overall, 14 531 students completed the survey, including 7330 female students and 7133 male students with self-reported grade level and sex. In 2020, 19.6% (95% CI, 17.2%-22.2%) of high school students and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6%-6.0%) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use. Among them, 38.9% (95% CI, 35.2%-42.6%) of high school users and 20.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-24.8%) of middle school users reported e-cigarette use on 20 to 30 days within the past 30 days. Among current users, JUUL was the most commonly reported usual brand (high school: 25.4%; 95% CI, 18.8%-33.4%; middle school: 35.1%; 95% CI, 27.9%-43.1%). Among current users, the most common source of obtaining e-cigarettes was from a friend (high school: 57.1%; 95% CI, 52.6%-61.4%; middle school: 58.9%; 95% CI, 51.4%-66.1%). Among current users, 84.7% (95% CI, 82.2%-86.9%) of high school students and 73.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-79.8%) of middle school students reported flavored e-cigarette use. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most commonly reported flavor among current exclusive e-cigarette users of prefilled pods or cartridges (67.3%; 95% CI, 60.9%-73.0%), disposable e-cigarettes (85.8%; 95% CI, 79.8%-90.3%), and tank-based devices (82.7%; 95% CI, 68.9%-91.1%), followed by mint-flavored e-cigarettes.

Joinpoint regression indicated a −3.1% (95% CI, −3.7% to −2.6%) annual decrease in suicidal ideation between 1991 and 2009, followed by a 3.4% annual increase (95% CI, 1.9% -4.8%) between 2009 and 2019. Decreasing followed by increasing trends in suicidal ideation showed modestly different turning points in female (1991-2009, 2009-2019), White (1991-2009, 2009-2019), Hispanic (1991-2007, 2007-2019), and Black (1991-2005, 2005-2019) adolescents. Although no significant trends were observed in suicide attempts from 1991 through 2019, male (68.4% increase; 95% CI, 0.2% -1.2%) and Black (79.7% increase; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.5%) adolescents had greater increases in the prevalence of suicide attempts. Interaction of sex and race/ethnicity revealed increases in suicidal ideation in White females from 2009 to 2019 (APC, 4.3%; 95% CI, 1.5%-7.1%), Black females from 2005 to 2019 (APC, 3.4%; 95% CI, 1.4%-5.4%), and Hispanic females from 2009 to 2019 (APC, 3.3%; 95% CI, 1.0%-5.6%) and suicide attempts in White females from 2009 to 2019 (APC, 3.1%; 95% CI, 0.3%-6.0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study show apparent sex and racial/ethnic differences in trends in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Increases in suicidal ideation since 2009 were observed in female individuals; changes in male and Black adolescents represented the largest increase in the prevalence of suicide attempts between 1991 and 2019. Evidence-based suicide prevention programs need to be tailored by sex and race/ethnicity, calling for greater diversification of health care system, school, and community prevention approaches.","Xiao, Yunyu; Cerel, Julie; Mann, J.

18601,The Impact of Purifying and Background Selection on the Inference of Population History: Problems and Prospects,2021-02-16,"Therapeutics that target cellular senescence, including novel “senolytic” compounds, hold significant promise for treating or preventing obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, and the multiple complications of diabetes and obesity. Senolytics selectively clear senescent cells, which accumulate with aging and obesity and represent a fundamental mechanism of aging that contributes to metabolic dysfunction and diabetes pathogenesis. In addition to improving metabolic function, targeting senescent cells holds promise as a preventive strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diabetes complications. The intermittent administration schedule used for senolytic therapy may confer benefits in terms of improving adherence and limiting adverse effects. It is necessary to design effective clinical trials that will safely translate discoveries from preclinical models into human studies that may pave the way for a novel therapeutic class for treating obesity, diabetes, and their complications. In this review, we outline what is known regarding the role of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications, present evidence from preclinical models that targeting cellular senescence is beneficial, review senolytic drugs, and outline the features of clinical trials investigating the role of targeting senescent cells for diabetes.","Palmer, Allyson K; Tchkonia, Tamar; Kirkland, James L",Endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234500/,13

Using ITS2 RNA Secondary Structure and Molecular Docking Study,2021-06-17,"Background: Exercise is medicine. Multiple studies on the effects and mechanisms of exercise in treating depression among teenagers and adolescents have been widely reported. However, literature involving scientometric analysis of this topic is sparse. Here, we endeavored to conduct a bibliometric study and visualization analysis to give a bird's-eye view of publications between 2000 and 2020 on exercise therapy treating depression. Methods: Relevant original publications were obtained from the Science Citation Index Expanded in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database between 2000 and 2020. CiteSpace (5.7.R 5) and VOSviewer (1.6.16) software were used to perform bibliometric analysis of countries, institutions, categories, journals, authors, references, and keywords involved in this topic. Results: A total number of 975 articles on this field were retrieved from the WoSCC database and we identified an overall increase in the amount of publications over the past two decades, with the United States and Harvard University leading the field. Most related publications were published in the journals with a focus on sport, medicine, rehabilitation, psychology, and health, as represented by the dual-map overlay. A series of authors and co-cited authors were identified as main contributors in the exercise-depression-teenager domain. Three major clusters were explored based on the reference co-citation analysis: “exercise,” “suicide,” and “concussion”. Conclusions: Current concerns and hotspots of exercise intervention in depression treatments were summarized by “individual level,” “social level,” “role of exercise,” and “research quality.” We considered that the following four directions were potential future perspectives: “research on the effect of specific exercise intervention,” “research on the essence of exercise and sports,” “research on the combination mode of ‘exercise + X',” and “research on the micro and molecular level,” which should receive more attention.","You, Yanwei; Wang, Dizhi; Wang, Yuning; Li, Zhipeng; Ma, Xindong",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249759/,13
19429,Characteristics of Chimeric West Nile Virus Based on the Japanese Encephalitis Virus SA14-14-2 Backbone,2021-06-29,"Renal damage and renal failure are among the most severe complications of spina bifida. Over the past decades, a comprehensive treatment strategy has been applied that results in minimal renal scaring. In addition, the majority of patients can be dry for urine by the time they go to primary school. To obtain such results, it is mandatory to treat detrusor overactivity from birth onward, as upper urinary tract changes predominantly start in the first months of life. This means that new patients with spina bifida should be treated from birth by clean intermittent catheterization and pharmacological suppression of detrusor overactivity. Urinary tract infections, when present, need aggressive treatment, and in many patients, permanent prophylaxis is indicated. Later in life, therapy can be tailored to urodynamic findings. Children with paralyzed pelvic floor and hence urinary incontinence are routinely offered surgery around the age of 5 years to become dry. Rectus abdominis sling suspension of the bladder neck is the first-choice procedure, with good to excellent results in both male and female patients. In children with detrusor hyperactivity, detrusorectomy can be performed as an alternative for ileocystoplasty provided there is adequate bladder capacity. Wheelchair-bound patients can manage their bladder more easily with a continent catheterizable stoma on top of the bladder. This stoma provides them extra privacy and diminishes parental burden. Bowel management is done by retrograde or antegrade enema therapy. Concerning sexuality, special attention is needed to address expectations of adolescent patients. Sensibility of the glans penis can be restored by surgery in the majority of patients.

Although the field has made impressive progress in documenting the extent of natural hybridization, both historical and recent, there are still many unanswered questions about its genetic and evolutionary consequences. Recent work has suggested that the outcomes of hybridization in the genome may be in part predictable, but many open questions about the nature of selection on hybrids and the biological variables that shape such selection have hampered progress in this area. We synthesize what is known about the mechanisms that drive changes in ancestry in the genome after hybridization, highlight major unresolved questions, and discuss their implications for the predictability of genome evolution after hybridization.","Moran, Benjamin M; Payne, Cheyenne; Langdon, Quinn; Powell, Daniel L; Brandvain, Yaniv; Schumer, Molly",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8337078/,13
20095,Cost Effectiveness of Screening for Hepatitis C Virus in Iraq in the Era of Simplified Testing and Treatment,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Europe has about 10,000 imported cases of malaria each year, or around 80 cases per 100,000 trips to endemic areas. Non-use of chemoprophylaxis in travellers remains the main reason for this. The proliferation of online travel blogs as a source of advice (sometimes the only one used) for preparing a trip to an endemic area may play a role in the decision to use chemoprophylaxis. The aim of this study was to analyse the information offered on malaria in the main travel blogs in English and Spanish. METHODS: Five hundred travel blogs in English and 100 in Spanish, considered highly relevant were analysed. The relevance were according to different metrics: (1) Alexa Rank; (2) social networks (RRSS) measuring the total followers of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube; (3) number of monthly visits using the SEMrush tool; (4) domain authority; and (5) number of backlinks or incoming links using the SEMrush tool. RESULTS: Of the included travel blogs, 57% of those in English and 64% of those in Spanish offered information on malaria, and 79 and 75%, respectively, featured a discussion on malaria written as a blog post or in forum comments. Information on chemoprophylaxis was available in 56.1% of English-language blogs and 10.7% of Spanish-speaking blogs, while its side effects were discussed in 38.6 and 68.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Content analysis revealed that the information was usually insufficient, incomplete or, more seriously, inaccurate. In many cases, this could discourage users from taking appropriate preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Travel blogs in English and Spanish provide low-quality information on malaria. The so-called “travel influencers” must communicate reliable, verified and quality information on malaria on their channels in a way that could contribute to reducing the burden of the disease in travellers.

Aurolab aqueous drainage implant (AADI) is a nonvalved drainage implant conventionally implanted with the tube placed in the anterior chamber. Studies about the outcome of the various aqueous drainage devices implanted in the anterior chamber have reported complications such as tube extrusion, migration, blockage, erosion, and corneal decompensation. We propose modifying the conventional GDD implantation technique by placing the tube in the vitreous cavity, thereby negating the risk of anterior segment complications in patients with refractory glaucoma whose anterior segment is already compromised. Another novel approach implemented in this technique was making a scleral tunnel instead of using a scleral or corneal patch graft to cover the tube to prevent its migration.

This study investigated the factors associated with signing DNR documents of older patients in the geriatric ward. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a geriatric ward in a tertiary hospital in Southern Taiwan. Three hundred and thirty-seven hospitalized older patients aged ≥65 years in the geriatric ward from 2018 to 2019. The Hospital Information System and electronic medical records were accessed to obtain details regarding patients’ demographics, daily living activities, serum albumin level, nutrition screening score, intensive care unit transferal, resuscitation procedure, days of hospital stay, and survival status on discharge, and DNR status was recorded retrospectively. Patients were classified into DNR and non-DNR groups, with t-tests and Chi-square tests applied to compare the differences between groups. Logistic regression was performed to predict factors related to the DNR documents. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were included, 66 of whom had signed a DNR during hospitalization. After multivariate logistic regression, age 85 or more compared to age 65–74 (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 5.94), poor nutrition with screening score two or more (aOR 2.71), albumin level less than 3 (aOR 3.24), Charlson Comorbidity Index higher than 2 (aOR 2.46) and once transferred to ICU (aOR 5.11) were independently associated with DNR documentation during hospitalization.

20311,Distinct interferon response in bat and other mammalian cell lines infected with Pteropine orthoreovirus,2021-08-25,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: An understanding of the way that animals respond to heat stress is key to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for a changing climate. The response of mammals to heat exposure involves changes at every level of organization from molecular and cellular to systemic and behavioral. The concert of events involves many genes and gene products. The Na+/K+ ATPase ∝1 (ATP1A1), a product of the ATP1A1 gene, is important for the response to heat because it determines the activity of the Na(+)/K(+) pump that is ubiquitous in cell membranes. It was shown recently that ATP1A1 is important in combating the oxidative stress that a cell faces and that it modulates the Src signaling pathway that is involved in the response to many stressors. Vechur cattle (dwarf Bos taurus indicus) are well known for their adaptability to the tropical heat and humidity that persists in their native state of Kerala, India. We here analyze the comparative expression profile of the ATP1A1 gene in heat-tolerant Vechur and Kasaragod (another dwarf B. t. indicus) cattle and a heat-intolerant crossbreed (B. t. taurus × B. t. indicus) and characterize the sequence of ATP1A1 mRNA in the Vechur genotype. Environmental stress and heat tolerance were measured. Expression profiling indicated that ATP1A1 was differentially expressed in the phenotypically disparate cattle breeds. A molecular evolutionary genetic analysis revealed that the divergent origin of dwarf cattle was adaptive in response to heat stress and suggests the potential use of ATP1A1 as a marker for heat tolerance. ABSTRACT: Climate change is an imminent threat to livestock production. One adaptation strategy is selection for heat tolerance. While it is established that the ATP1A1 gene and its product play an important role in the response to many stressors, there has been no attempt to characterize the sequence or to perform expression profiling of the gene in production animals. We undertook a field experiment to compare the expression profiles of ATP1A1 in heat-tolerant Vechur and Kasaragod cattle (Bos taurus indicus) with the profile of a heat-susceptible crossbreed (B. t. taurus × B. t. indicus). The cattle were exposed to heat stress while on pasture in the hot summer season. The environmental stress was quantified using the temperature humidity index (THI), while the heat tolerance of each breed was assessed using a heat tolerance coefficient (HTC). The ATP1A1 mRNA of Vechur cattle was amplified from cDNA and sequenced. The HTC varied significantly between the breeds and with time-of-day (p < 0.01). The breed–time-of-day interaction was also significant (p < 0.01). The relative expression of ATP1A1 differed between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible breeds (p = 0.02). The expression of ATP1A1 at 08:00, 10:00 and 12:00, and the breed–time-of-day interaction, were not significant. The nucleotide sequence of Vechur ATP1A1 showed 99% homology with the B. t. taurus sequence. The protein sequence showed 98% homology with B. t. taurus cattle and with B. grunniens (yak) and 97.7% homology with Ovis aries (sheep). A molecular clock analysis revealed evidence of divergent adaptive evolution of the ATP1A1 gene favoring climate resilience in Vechur cattle. These findings further our knowledge of the relationship between the ATP1A1 gene and heat tolerance in phenotypically incongruent animals. We propose that ATP1A1 could be used in marker assisted selection (MAS) for heat tolerance.","Elayadeth-Meethal, Muhammed; Thazhathu Veettil, Aravindakshan; Asaf, Muhasin; Pramod, Sathiamoorthy; Maloney, Shane K.; Martin, Graeme B.; Rivero, M.

With the aim of obtaining preliminary data on whether KLK3 could serve as an early marker of environmental pollution effects, in 61 and 58 healthy women living in a high environmental impact (HEI) and low environmental impact (LEI) area, respectively, serum KLK3 levels at different phases of menstrual cycle were measured. KLK3 values resulted in always being higher in the HEI group with respect to the LEI group. These differences were particularly relevant in the ovulatory phase (cycle day 12°–13°) of the menstrual cycle. The differences in KLK3 values during the three phases of the menstrual cycle were significant in the LEI group differently from the HEI group. In addition, higher progesterone levels were observed in the LEI group with respect to the HEI group in the luteal phase, indicating an opposite trend of KLK3 and progesterone in this phase of the menstrual cycle. Although changes in KLK3 could also depend on other factors, these preliminary data could be an early indication of an expanding study of the role of biomarkers in assessing early environmental effects for female reproductive health.","Raimondo, Salvatore; Gentile, Mariacira; Esposito, Giusy; Gentile, Tommaso; Ferrara, Ida; Crescenzo, Claudia; Palmieri, Mariangela; Cuomo, Felice; De Filippo, Stefania; Lettieri, Gennaro; Piscopo, Marina; Montano, Luigi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392638/,13

In this study, the virus's specific gene fragments were isolated from clinically suspected cases and amplified by PCR. Finally, after a viral infection to investigate the immune response of the host, the gene expression of MHC (major histo-compatible) molecules (MHCIα, MHCIIβ), Ii (Invariant Chain) gene, inflammatory cytokines (IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-1β), and transcription factors (MDA5, STING, IRF7, and NF-kB) were detected by real-time PCR (fluorescence technology). The results of sequence comparison showed that the clinically isolated virus was 100% homologous to a virulent strain of avian adenovirus group C serotype 4 (FAdV-4), which were named AH-FAdV-4. The TCID(50) and pathogenicity of the virus were determined that was 10(6.52)/0.1 mL with a mortality rate of 100% in chickens and 0% in ducks. Furthermore, results showed that the expression level of MHCIα, MHCIIβ, and Ii genes in chicken embryo kidney cells significantly (P < 0.01) upregulated (increased) after infection, which was 43, 5.2, and 2.5 times higher than the control group. With the addition of PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-kB, then the expression level of MHCIα, MHCIIβ, and Ii was decreased significantly (P < 0.01) than the control group. The transcription levels of these genes were decreased 0.64, 0.27, and 0.26 respectively. Simultaneously, the expression levels of IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-1β were also significantly (P < 0.01) up-regulated (increased) 7.8, 22.7, and 5 times higher than the control group. It was found that up-regulation of STING and NF-κB pathways are directly involved in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-1β), MHC molecules (MHCIα, MHCIIβ), and Ii gene. The results also showed that the gene regulation pathways consecutively increased the expression levels of MDA5, STING, IRF7, and NF-kB.

20595,The role of upstream open reading frames in translation regulation in the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Public health reporting is the cornerstone of public health practices that inform prevention and control strategies. There is a need to leverage advances made in the past to implement an architecture that facilitates the timely and complete public health reporting of relevant case-related information that has previously not easily been available to the public health community. Electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) is a reliable method for reporting cases to public health authorities but contains very limited data. In an earlier pilot study, we designed the Public Health Automated Case Event Reporting (PACER) platform, which leverages existing ELR infrastructure as the trigger for creating an electronic case report. PACER is a FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources)-based system that queries the electronic health record from where the laboratory test was requested to extract expanded additional information about a case. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the pilot implementation of a modified PACER system for electronic case reporting and describe how this FHIR-based, open-source, and interoperable system allows health systems to conduct public health reporting while maintaining the appropriate governance of the clinical data. METHODS: ELR to a simulated public health department was used as the trigger for a FHIR-based query. Predetermined queries were translated into Clinical Quality Language logics. Within the PACER environment, these Clinical Quality Language logical statements were managed and evaluated against the providers’ FHIR servers. These predetermined logics were filtered, and only data relevant to that episode of the condition were extracted and sent to simulated public health agencies as an electronic case report. Design and testing were conducted at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and the pilot was deployed at the Medical University of South Carolina. We evaluated this architecture by examining the completeness of additional information in the electronic case report, such as patient demographics, medications, symptoms, and diagnoses. This additional information is crucial for understanding disease epidemiology, but existing electronic case reporting and ELR architectures do not report them. Therefore, we used the completeness of these data fields as the metrics for enriching electronic case reports. RESULTS: During the 8-week study period, we identified 117 positive test results for chlamydia. PACER successfully created an electronic case report for all 117 patients. PACER extracted demographics, medications, symptoms, and diagnoses from 99.1% (116/117), 72.6% (85/117), 70.9% (83/117), and 65% (76/117) of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PACER deployed in conjunction with electronic laboratory reports can enhance public health case reporting with additional relevant data. The architecture is modular in design, thereby allowing it to be used for any reportable condition, including evolving outbreaks. PACER allows for the creation of an enhanced and more complete case report that contains relevant case information that helps us to better understand the epidemiology of a disease.","Mishra, Ninad; Duke, Jon; Karki, Saugat; Choi, Myung; Riley, Michael; Ilatovskiy, Andrey V; Gorges, Marla; Lenert, Leslie",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387889/,13

21021,Conformational transitions of caspase-6 in substrate-induced activation process explored by perturbation-response scanning combined with targeted molecular dynamics,2021-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring (TM) interventions have been designed to support care delivery and engage patients in their care at home, but little research exists on TM of complex chronic conditions (CCCs). Given the growing prevalence of complex patients, an evaluation of multi-condition TM is needed to expand TM interventions and tailor opportunities to manage complex chronic care needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and patients’ perceived usefulness of a multi-condition TM platform in a nurse-led model of care. METHODS: A pragmatic, multimethod feasibility study was conducted with patients with heart failure (HF), hypertension (HTN), and/or diabetes. Patients were asked to take physiological readings at home via a smartphone-based TM app for 6 months. The recommended frequency of taking readings was dependent on the condition, and adherence data were obtained through the TM system database. Patient questionnaires were administered, and patient interviews were conducted at the end of the study. An inductive analysis was performed, and codes were then mapped to the normalization process theory and Implementation Outcomes constructs by Proctor. RESULTS: In total, 26 participants were recruited, 17 of whom used the TM app for 6 months. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 patients, and 8 patients were interviewed with their informal caregiver present. Patient adherence was high, with patients with HF taking readings on average 76.6% (141/184) of the days they were asked to use the system and patients with diabetes taking readings on average 72% (19/26) of the days. The HTN adherence rate was 55% (29/52) of the days they were asked to use the system. The qualitative findings of the patient experience can be grouped into 4 main themes and 13 subthemes. The main themes were (1) making sense of the purpose of TM, (2) engaging and investing in TM, (3) implementing and adopting TM, and (4) perceived usefulness and the perceived benefits of TM in CCCs. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-condition TM in nurse-led care was found to be feasible and was perceived as useful. Patients accepted and adopted the technology by demonstrating a moderate to high level of adherence across conditions. These results demonstrate how TM can address the needs of patients with CCCs through virtual TM assessments in a nurse-led care model by supporting patient self-care and keeping patients connected to their clinical team.","Gordon, Kayleigh; Dainty, Katie N; Steele Gray, Carolyn; DeLacy, Jane; Shah, Amika; Resnick, Myles; Seto, Emily",JMIR Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408315/,13

High-throughput proteomics analysis of urine samples was performed to identify reliable and non-invasive biomarkers that could effectively discriminate between the two ovarian tumor types. METHODS: In total, 132 urine samples from 73 malignant and 59 benign cases of ovarian carcinoma were divided into C1 (training and test datasets) and C2 (validation dataset) cohorts. Mass spectrometry (MS) data of all samples were acquired in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and analyzed using DIA-NN software. The generated classifier was trained with Random Forest algorithm from the training dataset and validated in the test and validation datasets. Serum CA125 and HE4 levels were additionally determined in all patients. Finally, classification accuracy of the classifier, serum CA125 and serum HE4 in all samples were evaluated and plotted via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

A classifier incorporating five proteins (WFDC2, PTMA, PVRL4, FIBA, and PVRL2) was trained and validated in this study. Evaluation of the performance of the classifier revealed AUC values of 0.970 and 0.952 in the test and validation datasets, respectively. In all 132 patients, AUCs of 0.966, 0.947, and 0.979 were achieved with the classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively. Among eight patients with early stage malignancy, 7, 6, and 4 were accurately diagnosed based on classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively. CONCLUSION: The novel classifier incorporating a urinary protein panel presents a promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for classifying benign and malignant ovarian tumors.","Ni, Maowei; Zhou, Jie; Zhu, Zhihui; Yuan, Jingtao; Gong, Wangang; Zhu, Jianqing; Zheng, Zhiguo; Zhao, Huajun",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437375/,13
21562,Immunization with Leishmania tarentolae-derived norovirus virus-like particles elicits high humoral response and stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies,2021-09-24,"Hepatitis E virus is an important emerging pathogen producing a lethal impact on the pregnant population and immunocompromised patients. Starting in 1983, it has been described as the cause for acute hepatitis transmitted via the fecal–oral route. However, zoonotic and blood transfusion transmission of HEV have been reported in the past few decades, leading to the detailed research of HEV pathogenesis. The reason behind HEV being highly virulent to the pregnant population particularly during the third trimester, leading to maternal and fetal death, remains unknown. Various host factors (immunological, nutritional, hormonal) and viral factors have been studied to define the key determinants assisting HEV to be virulent in pregnant and immunocompromised patients. Similarly, chronic hepatitis is seen particularly in solid organ transplant patients, resulting in fatal conditions. This review describes recent advances in the immunopathophysiology of HEV infections in general, pregnant, and immunocompromised populations, and further elucidates the in vitro and in vivo models utilized to understand HEV pathogenesis.","Yadav, Kush Kumar; Kenney, Scott P.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465319/,13
21982,Elucidating the Binding Mode between Heparin and Inflammatory Cytokines by Molecular Modeling,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Achieving hemodynamic stabilization does not prevent progressive tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction during resuscitation of septic shock patients. Many indicators have been proposed to judge the optimization of oxygen delivery to meet tissue oxygen consumption. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate and validate combining CO(2) gap and oxygen-derived variables with lactate clearance during early hours of resuscitation of adults presenting with septic shock. RESULTS: Our study included 456 adults with a mean age of 63.2 ± 6.9 years, with 71.9% being males. Respiratory and urinary infections were the origin of about 75% of sepsis. Mortality occurred in 164 (35.9%) patients. The APACHE II score was 18.2 ± 3.7 versus 34.3 ± 6.8 (p < 0.001), the initial SOFA score was 5.8 ± 3.1 versus 7.3 ± 1.4 (p=0.001), while the SOFA score after 48 hours was 4.2 ± 1.8 versus 9.4 ± 3.1 (p < 0.001) in the survivors and nonsurvivors, respectively. Hospital mortality was independently predicted by hyperlactatemia (OR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.63–6.82, p=0.004), PvaCO(2) gap (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.28–6.74, p=0.026), PvaCO(2)/CavO(2) ratio (OR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.49–5.74, p=0.006), and increased SOFA score after 48 hours of admission (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.36–8.13, p=0.02). A blood lactate cutoff of 40 mg/dl at the 6th hour of resuscitation (T6) had a 92.7% sensitivity and 75.3% specificity for predicting hospital mortality (AUROC = 0.902) with 81.6% accuracy. Combining the lactate cutoff of 40 mg/dl and PvaCO(2)/CavO(2) ratio cutoff of 1.4 increased the specificity to 93.2% with a sensitivity of 75.6% in predicting mortality and with 86.8% accuracy. Combining the lactate cutoff of 40 mg/dl and PvaCO(2) gap of 6 mmHg increased the sensitivity to 93% and increased the specificity to 98% in predicting mortality with 91% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Combining the carbon dioxide gap and arteriovenous oxygen difference with lactate clearance during early hours of resuscitation of septic shock patients helps to predict hospital mortality more accurately.","Ahmed, Walid; Laimoud, Mohamed",Crit Care Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487837/,13
22178,Correction: Functional and Genetic Analysis of Coronavirus Replicase-Transcriptase Proteins,2006-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Numerous Ebola virus outbreaks have occurred in Equatorial Africa over the past decades. Besides human fatalities, gorillas and chimpanzees have also succumbed to the fatal virus. The 2004 outbreak at the Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Republic of Congo) alone caused a severe decline in the resident western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population, with a 95% mortality rate. Here, we explore the immediate genetic impact of the Ebola outbreak in the western lowland gorilla population. RESULTS: Associations with survivorship were evaluated by utilizing DNA obtained from fecal samples from 16 gorilla individuals declared missing after the outbreak (non-survivors) and 15 individuals observed before and after the epidemic (survivors). We used a target enrichment approach to capture the sequences of 123 genes previously associated with immunology and Ebola virus resistance and additionally analyzed the gut microbiome which could influence the survival after an infection. Our results indicate no changes in the population genetic diversity before and after the Ebola outbreak, and no significant differences in microbial community composition between survivors and non-survivors. However, and despite the low power for an association analysis, we do detect six nominally significant missense mutations in four genes that might be candidate variants associated with an increased chance of survival. CONCLUSION: This study offers the first insight to the genetics of a wild great ape population before and after an Ebola outbreak using target capture experiments from fecal samples, and presents a list of candidate loci that may have facilitated their survival.

22888,West Nile Virus may have felled Alexander the Great,2003-11-28,"Fast simulation tools for the prediction of transient particle transport are critical in designing the air distribution indoors to reduce the exposure to indoor particles and associated health risks. This investigation proposed a combined fast fluid dynamics (FFD) and Markov chain model for fast predicting transient particle transport indoors. The solver for FFD-Markov-chain model was programmed in OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD toolbox. This study used two cases from the literature to validate the developed model and found well agreement between the transient particle concentrations predicted by the FFD-Markov-chain model and the experimental data. This investigation further compared the FFD-Markov-chain model with the CFD-Eulerian model and CFD-Lagrangian model in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy of the FFD-Markov-chain model was similar to that of the other two models. For the two studied cases, the FFD-Markovchain model was 4.7 and 6.8 times faster, respectively, than the CFD-Eulerian model, and it was 137.4 and 53.3 times faster than the CFD-Lagrangian model in predicting the steady-state airflow and transient particle transport. Therefore, the FFD-Markov-chain model is able to greatly reduce the computing cost for predicting transient particle transport in indoor environments.","Liu, Wei; You, Ruoyu; Chen, Chun",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090511/,13

25091,Cleavage of the Glycoprotein of Arenaviruses,2018-02-16,"Enhancement of secondary metabolites through elicitation in hairy root culture is a very effective method which is broadly used to simulate the stress responses in plants. Elicitors are compounds that induce plants to produce secondary metabolites at elevated levels and reduce the processing time required to achieve high product concentrations. Hairy root cultures are considered as an excellent alternative for the supply of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites/bioactives, due to their inherent genetic and biochemical stability. Plant-based secondary metabolites are well accepted in India as well as other countries to cure even the serious medical problems. In this chapter, three medicinally important plants are discussed in which stress-based elicitation of secondary metabolites has been achieved in hairy root cultures. These three plants contain important secondary metabolites in their different parts. Glycyrrhizin found in Glycyrrhiza glabra plant is used as antiulcer, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, and anti-inflammatory. Glycyrrhizin is also effective against HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses. In Solanum plant, steroidal glycoalkaloids contain pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites. Solasodine, a major alkaloid of Solanum plant, is used as a contraceptive in different parts of the world. Ajmaline and ajmalicine are important root-specific indole alkaloids of Rauwolfia serpentina. Ajmalicine is useful in circulatory disorders, while ajmaline is principally known for its antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive activities. The main objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge in these plants regarding elicitation-based enhancement of valuable secondary metabolites in the form of research studies conducted till date (as per author’s knowledge).","Srivastava, Mrinalini; Misra, Pratibha",Production of Plant Derived Natural Compounds through Hairy Root Culture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121597/,13
25335,Novel Therapeutics Against West Nile Virus,2009,"The biopharmaceutical industry continues to face the challenge of producing large amount of recombinant proteins for use as therapeutics, and eighty percent of protein therapeutics in clinical development are produced in mammalian cell systems. Approaches to increase production addressing growth conditions, such as the improvement of media composition and process control, or transcription of the recombinant gene via the use of strong promoters/enhancers and amplification of gene copy number, have increased the yields obtained from mammalian cells considerably over the past decades. However these processes remain laborious, and extensive screening of clones is often required, as stable cell line and/or protein production is not always obtained. Unstable or variable expression is linked to the location of transgene integration site, the regulation of gene expression, the silencing of genes, and the loss of gene copies. Genetic elements that may remodel chromatin to maintain the transgene in an active configuration are now being employed increasingly to improve protein production using mammalian cells. Here we will review how one type of such elements, the MARs, may increase transgene integration into the cell genome and decrease silencing effects to reduce expression variability. We also illustrate how inclusion of these elements in expression vectors leads to increased specific productivities ranging from 20 to 100 picograms per cell and per day (p/c/d), resulting in protein titers above 5 g/l.","Gorman, Cori; Arope, Salina; Grandjean, Mélanie; Girod, Pierre-Alain; Mermod, Nicolas",Cell Line Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121902/,13
25351,Pegylated Interferons: Clinical Applications in the Management of Hepatitis C Infection,2008,"Sepsis is newly defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis is highly complex, and the mortality of in-patients suffering from sepsis is more than 10%. Severe unmanaged inflammation and inappropriate immune response characterize sepsis. Anti-inflammation therapies alone are not successful for the reason that disbalance of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving agents. In the recent researches, the host responses during the course of self-resolving infections are found to have the involvements of specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs), namely, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. These endogenous lipid metabolites are core signal molecules in the resolution of inflammation, playing a key role in regulating the inflammation and promoting return to homeostasis. Besides, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, a sensitive marker for oxidative stress) is also known for upregulation in inflammation profiling. Carbon monoxide, synthesized by HO-1, performs multiple stances of anti-inflammation and pro-resolution along with the SPMs. If the potentially beneficial effects of these mediators would be well evaluated in clinical trials, they present encouraging new hints in managing infectious maladies especially sepsis.","Liu, Yongjian; Hao, Yu; Bhandari, Suwas; Jin, Shengwei",Severe Trauma and Sepsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121927/,13

We then run a series of studies to create a corpus of data for our model. We run two different visualization algorithms, one that is computation heavy and one that is communication heavy with concurrencies up to 32, 768 cores. Our primary results are in exploring the cost model within the context of our corpus. Our findings show that in-transit consistently achieves significant cost efficiencies by running visualization algorithms at lower concurrency, and that in many cases these efficiencies are enough to offset other costs (transfer, blocking, and additional nodes) to be cost effective overall. Finally, this work informs future studies, which can focus on choosing ideal configurations for in-transit processing that can consistently achieve cost efficiencies.","Kress, James; Larsen, Matthew; Choi, Jong; Kim, Mark; Wolf, Matthew; Podhorszki, Norbert; Klasky, Scott; Childs, Hank; Pugmire, David",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295346/,13

We first show that for rules with ACs, conflicts are in general neither inherited from a bigger context any more, nor is it possible to find a finite and complete subset of finite conflicts as illustrated for the category of graphs. We define initial conflicts to be special so-called symbolic transformation pairs, and show that they are minimally complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) in this symbolic way. We show that initial conflicts represent a proper subset of critical pairs again. We moreover demonstrate that (analogous to the case of rules without ACs) for each conflict a unique initial conflict exists representing it. We conclude with presenting a sufficient condition illustrating important special cases for rules with ACs, where we do not only have initial conflicts being complete in a symbolic way, but also find complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) subsets of conflicts in the classical sense.","Lambers, Leen; Orejas, Fernando",Graph Transformation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314705/,13

To combat this spread, clinical imaging, for example, X-ray images, can be utilized for diagnosis. Automatic identification software tools are essential to facilitate the screening of COVID-19 using X-ray images. This paper aims to classify COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia patients from chest X-ray images. As such, an Optimized Convolutional Neural network (OptCoNet) is proposed in this work for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed OptCoNet architecture is composed of optimized feature extraction and classification components. The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters for training the CNN layers. The proposed model is tested and compared with different classification strategies utilizing an openly accessible dataset of COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia images. The presented optimized CNN model provides accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score values of 97.78%, 97.75%, 96.25%, 92.88%, and 95.25%, respectively, which are better than those of state-of-the-art models.

METHODS: A single-center, prospective cohort study (Trial Registry Number: NCT02763709; PEDCIMP2016) was conducted at the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in North India. A complete electrophysiological evaluation (4 motor nerves and 2 sensory nerves) was performed at baseline in children (2–12 years) admitted to the ICU with a pediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) of > 20 with more than 24-h stay. Following the entry evaluation, a minimal alternate day simplified electrophysiological testing of the unilateral common peroneal nerve and the sural nerve was assessed. A 25% reduction in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential from baseline was considered significant for ICUAW and was confirmed by complete electrophysiological re-evaluation. RESULTS: Of the total 481 children assessed for eligibility, 97 were enrolled. The median age of the cohort was 7 years. Sepsis (81%); need for vasoactive support (43%); multiorgan dysfunction (26%) were the common reasons for admission. Of the 433 eligible patient ICU days, 380 electrophysiological observations were done. A significant decrease of > 25% in CMAP of common peroneal nerve was not detected in any of the 380 observations. However, two children unfit for inclusion were diagnosed with ICUAW during the study period.

43548,FangNet: Mining herb hidden knowledge from TCM clinical effective formulas using structure network algorithm,2020-12-04,"Background: An abundance of long-term care regulations creates a bevy of rights for nursing facility residents, staff, and families. Front-line workers and managers have significant discretion and responsibilities for interpreting these rights. Building on street-level-bureaucracy theory (Lipsky, 2010), which focuses on how front-line workers implement policy, this study examines how staff at various levels (direct care, mid-level professional, top management) resolve conflicting rights. Methods: This study employs a novel advanced multi-method qualitative design with semi-structured staff interviews (n=90), content analysis of long-term care facility policies (n=75), and participant observation of two facilities for a multi-layered comparative case study. Findings: Data analysis revealed variations in staff responses to conflicting rights regarding autonomy and safety (e.g. fall prevention, dementia, coronavirus) and discrimination (i.e. sexual/racial harassment). While harassment was rampant, direct care workers responded more deferentially to residents and often justified harassment as part of a customer service job in one’s home. Staff at all levels relied on teams to develop creative problem-solving approaches, but team composition and discretion varied significantly between facilities and staff levels. While staff included few social workers, staff heavily relied on them to adjudicate conflicting rights. Implications: Conflicting rights impact resident care and relationships among residents, staff, and families. This research provides policymakers and practitioners with new data about how staff resolve conflicting rights, which can facilitate stronger policies to support an overburdened and underpaid long-term care workforce. This research also expands street-level-bureaucracy theory to include managers and reveals how various team approaches can produce diverse solutions.","Perone, Angela",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741884/,13

Myocarditis remains a rare diagnosis and manifests with a wide spectrum of non-specific symptoms that include chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities that resemble that of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Therefore, clinical diagnosis is often challenging and is often misdiagnosed. We present a case of a 22-year-old male who presented with left-sided non-radiating chest pain associated with shortness of breath, elevated troponin of 3.2 ng/ml (<0.03 ng/ml). Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac echocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevations in the anterolateral leads and an ejection fraction of 35%, respectively. The patient was initially suspected of having a STEMI; however, cardiac catheterization revealed non-obstructed coronary arteries. Due to elevated inflammatory markers, the patient was then started on colchicine for suspected myocarditis and had complete resolution of symptoms one week after. This case highlights that a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt diagnosis is necessary to prevent any delays in appropriate therapy for myocarditis.","Fernando, Ashen; Guragai, Nirmal; Vasudev, Rahul; Pullatt, Raja; Randhawa, Preet",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769724/,13
44220,Development and validation of a competitive ELISA based on virus-like particles of serotype Senecavirus A to detect serum antibodies,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. This report takes a closer look at the cases, fatalities, and recoveries in different regions of the world with details regarding the geographic scale of SARS-CoV-2 spread, risks, and the subsequent impact on the countries affected. Also, this report discusses some effective measures that were carried out by some countries that helped them to mitigate the pandemic and flatten the curve of COVID-19 spread as early as possible. METHODS: Our research was conducted via an electronic literature review on PubMed, Google Scholar, and MedLine Plus. Data were then collected from peer-reviewed articles that included applicable keywords and published between January 1, 2020, and June 9, 2020 RESULTS: The rapid spread of infection has impacted over 200 countries and territories to date. As of June 9, 2020, there were 7,039,918 confirmed cases and 404,396 deaths globally. The USA is the North American country with the highest number of confirmed COVID 19 cases with 1,993,560. In South America, total confirmed cases in Brazil are 691,758. The most affected country in the African region is South Africa with 50,879. In Europe, the Russian Federation top with 485,253 confirmed cases. China with 84,638 is still the Western Pacific country with the most confirmed COVID 19 cases. India had 266,598 total confirmed cases and Australia reported 7,265 confirmed cases. Fatalities recorded similar patterns regionally except in Europe where the UK recorded the highest number of fatalities with 40,597 deaths and Iran had the highest number of fatalities with 5,957 cases in Asia. The goal of the practice “slowing the spread” is to prevent hospital systems from being strained beyond their capacity, thus resulting in less mortality. Countries yet to see the peak would benefit substantially by implementing aggressive social distancing, self-isolation, closure of schools and other institutions, encouraging working from home, and/or placing hard limits on the size of crowds at events.

44264,Protective cellular and mucosal immune responses following nasal administration of a whole gamma-irradiated influenza A (subtype H1N1) vaccine adjuvanted with interleukin-28B in a mouse model,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Between 15–50% of patients seen in ambulatory settings are prescribed an antibiotic. At least one third of this usage is considered unnecessary. In 2019, our institution implemented the MITIGATE Toolkit, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral respiratory infections in emergency and urgent care settings. In February 2020 we identified our first hospitalized patient with SARS-CoV(2). In March, efforts to limit person-to-person contact led to shelter in place orders and substantial reorganization of our healthcare system. During this time we continued to track rates of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: This was a single center observational study. Electronic medical record data were accessed to determine antibiotic prescribing and diagnosis codes. We provided monthly individual feedback to urgent care prescribers, (Sep 2019-Mar 2020), primary care, and ED providers (Jan 2020 – Mar 2020) notifying them of their specific rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and labeling them as a top performer or not a top performer compared to their peers. The primary outcome was rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: Pre toolkit intervention, 14,398 patient visits met MITIGATE inclusion criteria and 12% received an antibiotic unnecessarily in Jan-April 2019. Post-toolkit intervention, 12,328 patient visits met inclusion criteria and 7% received an antibiotic unnecessarily in Jan-April 2020. In April 2020, patient visits dropped to 10–50% of what they were in March 2020 and April 2019. During this time the unnecessary antibiotic prescribing rate doubled in urgent care to 7.8% from 3.6% the previous month and stayed stable in primary care and the ED at 3.2% and 11.8% respectively in April compared to 4.6% and 10.4% in the previous month. CONCLUSION: Rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were reduced nearly in half from 2019 to 2020 across 3 ambulatory care settings. The increase in prescribing in April seen in urgent care and after providers stopped receiving their monthly feedback is concerning. Many factors may have contributed to this increase, but it raises concerns for increased inappropriate antibacterial usage as a side effect of the SARS-CoV(2) pandemic.

44597,(−)-Kusunokinin as a Potential Aldose Reductase Inhibitor: Equivalency Observed via AKR1B1 Dynamics Simulation,2020-12-21,"BACKGROUND: Given that many youth and young adults utilize multiple orifices during sexual activity, testing for STIs from multiple anatomical sites can increase rates of diagnosis. However, during the COVID pandemic, obtaining oral swabs by clinical staff was deemed an unacceptable COVID transmission risk and was discontinued in our clinic. To circumvent this obstacle to diagnosis, clinic staff developed a workaround of obtaining patient collected pharyngeal swabs for STI testing. This abstract reviews the results of this pilot intervention. METHODS: Patients presenting to an urban youth family planning/STI clinic who desired STI testing and ever engaged in oral sex were offered pharyngeal testing for chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC). Patients were instructed on how to obtain an oral sample, and subsequently sent outside of the clinic to obtain their individual sample. Chart review was conducted by clinic staff of a two month period during which this protocol was in place, and the following variables were collected: gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and STD testing results by anatomic site. Simple descriptive statistical analysis were used. RESULTS: 146 patients received a GC/CT test from > 1 anatomical site, with 34 patients having > 1 positive result. All pharyngeal samples were self-collected. Four patients were positive for GC/CT from throat samples only (12% of positive tests). All were biologically female, including one transgender FTM. Sexual orientation was split evenly between bisexual and heterosexual. Reported race/ethnicity included two African-American, one white, and one “Filipino”. For comparison, of the overall subsample of patients with positive GC/CT results, patients identified as 53% female, 44% male, and 3% FTM; 74% “straight”, 15% bisexual, 9% “gay”, and 3% did not disclose; 29% white, 50% African-American, 21% unknown as other; and 11% Hispanic. Twelve patients were positive for GC/CT from the throat and either rectum and/or urine/vagina/endocervix (35% of positive tests). CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that obstacles created by the COVID crisis can be circumvented with creative strategies. We were able to pick up 12% and 35% of total infections by self-collected pharyngeal swabs in throat only and throat plus other sites, respectively.

While Tehran greatly values its dealings with and needs China, there are political and economic issues on the Iranian side limiting the progress of the MSRI. China and Chinese firms also are cautious about aggressively propelling the MSRI forward in Iran given sanctions on Iran, the global energy situation, and China’s current economic challenges.

We find that the likelihood that a potential supplier (hereafter, a vendor) is selected to be an actual supplier (hereafter, supplier) increases when personal connections between executives of the vendor and the customer exist. The magnitude of the effect varies predictably across management ranks and positions and is stronger when information asymmetries between a vendor and a customer are high. Conditioning on the existence of a supply-chain partnership, a departure of a personally connected executive prompts the termination of the supply-chain relationship more often than a departure of an unconnected executive. Additional analyses show personal connections are associated with less restrictive procurement contracts and with improved customer performance after the formation of a supply-chain relationship. Overall, our study highlights the role of personal connections in reducing information asymmetry and improving operating efficiency in the supply chain.

This article analyzes the everyday life religious practices of Catholic individuals during pandemic and lockdown times in Argentina, based on field work conducted from March to December 2020 using digital ethnography tools. The article focuses on how religions face the pandemic situation and people’s demands, the renewed importance gained by the home’s intimate spaces which were newly sacralized as they became the center of everyday religious practices, and the rituals which emerge from online communication. The conclusions emphasize the importance accorded by communities to emotional support and the management of emotions and to coping with personal and family problems.

55162,SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF8 Accessory Protein Dimerization Domains and Protein‐Protein Host Interaction,2021-05-14,"Trust has become a first-order concept in AI, urging experts to call for measures ensuring AI is ‘trustworthy’. The danger of untrustworthy AI often culminates with Deepfake, perceived as unprecedented threat for democracies and online trust, through its potential to back sophisticated disinformation campaigns. Little work has, however, been dedicated to the examination of the concept of trust, what undermines the arguments supporting such initiatives. By investigating the concept of trust and its evolutions, this paper ultimately defends a non-intuitive position: Deepfake is not only incapable of contributing to such an end, but also offers a unique opportunity to transition towards a framework of social trust better suited for the challenges entailed by the digital age. Discussing the dilemmas traditional societies had to overcome to establish social trust and the evolution of their solution across modernity, I come to reject rational choice theories to model trust and to distinguish an ‘instrumental rationality’ and a ‘social rationality’. This allows me to refute the argument which holds Deepfake to be a threat to online trust. In contrast, I argue that Deepfake may even support a transition from instrumental to social rationality, better suited for making decisions in the digital age.","Etienne, Hubert",AI Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8237779/,13

It has been applied to solve a wide range of behavior-related problems, including physical and mental health monitoring, affective computing, activity recognition, routine modeling, etc. However, in spite of the emerging literature that has investigated a wide range of application scenarios, there is little work focusing on the lessons learned by researchers, and on guidance for researchers to this approach. How do researchers conduct these types of research studies? Is there any established common practice when applying mobile sensing across different application areas? What are the pain points and needs that they frequently encounter? Answering these questions is an important step in the maturing of this growing sub-field of ubiquitous computing, and can benefit a wide range of audiences. It can serve to educate researchers who have growing interests in this area but have little to no previous experience. Intermediate researchers may also find the results interesting and helpful for reference to improve their skills. Moreover, it can further shed light on the design guidelines for a future toolkit that could facilitate research processes being used. In this paper, we fill this gap and answer these questions by conducting semi-structured interviews with ten experienced researchers from four countries to understand their practices and pain points when conducting their research. Our results reveal a common pipeline that researchers have adopted, and identify major challenges that do not appear in published work but that researchers often encounter. Based on the results of our interviews, we discuss practical suggestions for novice researchers and high-level design principles for a toolkit that can accelerate passive mobile sensing research.","Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.",CCF Trans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8258281/,13

Although the ear region of Deltatherium has previously been described, there has not been a comprehensive, well-illustrated contribution using current anatomical terminology. The dental and cranial anatomy of Deltatherium is a chimera, with morphological similarities to both ‘condylarth’ and ‘cimolestan’ taxa. As such, the phylogenetic relationships of this taxon have remained elusive since its discovery, and it has variably been associated with Arctocyonidae, Pantodonta and Tillodontia. The petrosal of Deltatherium is anteriorly bordered by an open space comprising a contiguous carotid opening and pyriform fenestra. The promontorium features both a small rostral tympanic process and small epitympanic wing but lacks well-marked sulci. A large ventral facing external aperture of the canaliculus cochleae is present and bordered posteriorly by a well-developed caudal tympanic process. The hiatus Fallopii opens on the ventral surface of the petrosal. The tegmen tympani is mediolaterally broad and anteriorly expanded, and its anterior margin is perforated by a foramen for the ramus superior of the stapedial artery. The tympanohyal is small but approximates the caudal tympanic process to nearly enclose the stylomastoid notch. The mastoid is widely exposed on the basicranium and bears an enlarged mastoid process, separate from the paraoccipital process. These new observations provide novel anatomical data corroborating previous hypotheses regarding the plesiomorphic eutherian condition but also reveal subtle differences among Paleocene eutherians that have the potential to help inform the phylogeny of Deltatherium.

Such a mode shift can only be achieved by a combination of drastic push and pull measures. Getting commuters to switch modes might be particularly difficult and have a negative impact on their access to employment and welfare. METHODOLOGY: We investigate the potential for a mode shift from car to public transport for German commuters using a data-driven approach based mainly on open data sources that avoids complex transport model runs. Different datasets on the home and workplace location of all employees in Germany are consolidated to create an origin-destination commuter matrix at traffic analysis zone level. The commuter matrix is merged with travel time data for car and public transport to calculate a spatially disaggregated and mode-specific measure of accessibility. The comparison of accessibility by car and public transport is used to derive the potential for a mode shift and identify potential challenges and barriers. RESULTS: Public transport accessibility to workplaces is poorer across the country compared to access by car. On average, public transport travel times are almost three times higher than the corresponding car travel times. The differences in accessibility are largely independent of the region type. Results are validated by an independent dataset from a household travel survey. Based on these results, the potential for a mode shift appears to be very low.","Mocanu, Tudor; Joshi, Jigeeshu; Winkler, Christian",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475387/,13

To achieve the integration of vertical driving force and horizontal driving force, a novel 2- (two degrees-of-freedom) DOF Lorentz force actuator is developed by designing the pose of the windings and permanent magnets (PMs). The structure and the working principle are introduced. The electromagnetic force mathematical model is established by the equivalent magnetic circuit method to analyze the coupling of magnetic flux. The distribution characteristics of magnetic flux density are analyzed by the finite-element method (FEM). It is found that the coupling of the magnetic flux and the large magnetic field gradient severely reduce the uniformity of the air-gap magnetic field. The electromagnetic force characteristic is investigated by FEM and measurement experiments. The difference between FEM and experiment results is within 10%. The reasons of driving force fluctuation are explained based on the distribution of air-gap magnetic field.

To date, all AA studies have occurred in the visual domain. The purpose of this study was to explore the boundary conditions of AA by testing if AA also occurs in the auditory domain and, if so, for which attributes. It was found that AA was present when reporting the location (p = .003) and the number of tones (p < .001) of an auditory stimulus, but not when reporting its pitch (p = .383). These findings can be understood in terms of the organisation of the primary cortical areas and help explain the differences between visual working memory and auditory working memory.","Howe, Piers Douglas Lionel; Lee, Serene Bee Wen",Perception,https://doi.org/10.1177/03010066211022175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121505/,13

Here, we aim to assess the safety and effects of NBM-DBS in patients with Lewy-body dementia (LBD), in a randomized, double-blind and crossover clinical trial. METHODS Six patients with mild to moderate LBD (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [7.8] years) were included and operated for bilateral NBM-DBS, and assigned to receive either active or sham NBM-DBS, followed by the opposite condition for 3 months. The primary outcome was the difference in the total free recalls of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) between active versus sham NBM-DBS. Secondary outcomes were assessments of the safety and effects of NBM-DBS on cognition, motor disability, sleep and PET imaging. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the FCSRT with active versus sham NBM-DBS. The surgical procedures were well tolerated in all patients, but we observed significant decreases in Stroop and Benton scores after electrode implantation. We observed no significant difference in other scales between active versus sham NBM-DBS. With active NBM-DBS relative to baseline, phonemic fluency and motor disability significantly decreased. Lastly, the superior lingual gyrus metabolic activity significantly increased with active NBM-DBS. CONCLUSIONS NBM-DBS does not appear to be totally safe for LBD patients with no evidence of cognitive benefit. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with LBD operated for bilateral NBM-DBS, active NBM-DBS stimulation compared to sham stimulation did not significantly change selective recall scores.","Maltête, David; Wallon, David; Bourilhon, Julie; Lefaucheur, Romain; Danaila, Teodor; Thobois, Stéphane; Defebvre, Luc; Dujardin, Kathy; Houeto, Jean-Luc; Godefroy, Olivier; Krystkowiak, Pierre; Martinaud, Olivier; Gillibert, André; Chastan, Mathieu; Vera, Pierre; Hannequin, Didier; Welter, Marie-Laure; Derrey, Stéphane",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000011227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199437/,13

BACKGROUND Many models of wireless pulse oximeters in the present market do not offer possibility of calibration and, therefore, they do not ensure patients' safety in daily clinical practice. DESIGN This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The sample of patients (140) was selected from such hospital units, and all of them had to fulfil inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation. METHODS The instruments used to carry out this research were a monitor (calibrated), two models of portable wireless pulse oximeters (used for 3 years by the nursing staff, without being calibrated), a tympanic thermometer and a weather meter. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to establish the concordance, whereas the Landis-Koch criteria were used to interpret the results. RESULTS The concordance among the three devices was considered as ""good"" (CCC: 0.925 and 0.974 (95%)). The CCC (0.925) for saturation measures was regarded as ""very good""/""almost perfect,"" and the pulse measure was considered as ""very good"" CCC 0.974, providing in both cases a high level of concordance (CCC > 0.91). CONCLUSIONS The overall concordance as regards pulse and oxygen saturation among the three pulse oximeters analysed is considered as ""very good"" according to the Landis-Koch criteria. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE There exists a ""very good"" concordance among two wireless oximeters which have been used by the health staff for 3 years and which did not offer any possibility of calibration and one monitor which belongs to the healthcare institution. This aspect is of crucial importance in daily clinical practice, and it is also relevant to ensure patient's safety.","de la Merced Díaz-González, Candelaria; de la Rosa-Hormiga, Milagros; Ramal-López, Josefa M; González-Henríquez, Juan José; Marrero-Morales, María Sandra",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.14012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793385/,13
63824,Molecular docking revealed the binding of nucleotide/side inhibitors to Zika viral polymerase solved structures.,2018,"INTRODUCTION One of the most common late complications following stoma construction is prolapse. Although the majority of prolapse can be managed conservatively, surgical revision is required with incarceration/strangulation and in certain cases laparotomy and/or stoma reversal are not appropriate. This report will inform surgeons on safe and effective approaches to revising prolapsed stomas using local techniques. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 58 year old female with an obstructing rectal cancer previously received a diverting transverse loop colostomy. On completion of neoadjuvant treatment, re-staging found new lung metastases. She was scheduled for further chemotherapy but incarcerated a prolapsed segment of her loop colostomy. As there was no plan to resect her primary rectal tumor at the time, a local revision was preferred. Linear staplers were applied to the prolapsed stoma in step-wise fashion to locally revise the incarcerated prolapse. Post-operative recovery was satisfactory with no complications or recurrence of prolapse. DISCUSSION We detail in step-wise fashion a technique using linear stapler devices that can be used to locally revise prolapsed stoma segments and therefore avoid a laparotomy. The procedure is technically easy to perform with satisfactory post-operative outcomes. We additionally review all previous reports of local repairs and show the evolution of local prolapse repair to the currently reported technique. CONCLUSION This report offers surgeons an alternative, efficient and effective option for addressing the complications of stoma prolapse. While future studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes, in the short-term, our report confirms the safety and effectiveness of this local technique.","Monette, Margaret M; Harney, Rodney T; Morris, Melanie S; Chu, Daniel I",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2016.08.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668078/,13

Gastrointestinal surgery patients are at high risk for opioid-related adverse events. We conducted a study to assess the impact of an opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia regimen with liposome bupivacaine, compared with the standard of care (intravenous [IV] opioid-based, patient-controlled analgesia [PCA]) on postsurgical opioid use and health economic outcomes in patients undergoing ileostomy reversal. METHODS In this open-label, multicenter study, sequential cohorts of patients undergoing ileostomy reversal received IV opioid PCA (first cohort); or multimodal analgesia including a single intraoperative administration of liposome bupivacaine (second cohort). Rescue analgesia was available to all patients. Primary outcome measures were postsurgical opioid use, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. Incidence of opioid-related adverse events was also assessed. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, underwent the planned surgery, and did not meet any intraoperative exclusion criteria; 16 received liposome bupivacaine-based multimodal analgesia and eleven received the standard IV opioid PCA regimen. The multimodal regimen was associated with significant reductions in opioid use compared with the IV opioid PCA regimen (mean, 20 mg versus 112 mg; median, 6 mg versus 48 mg, respectively; P < 0.01), postsurgical length of stay (median, 3.0 days versus 5.1 days, respectively; P < 0.001), and hospitalization costs (geometric mean, $6482 versus $9282, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION A liposome bupivacaine-based multimodal analgesic regimen resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in opioid consumption, shorter length of stay, and lower inpatient costs than an IV opioid-based analgesic regimen.","Marcet, Jorge E; Nfonsam, Valentine N; Larach, Sergio",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s46467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23901290/,13

In this retrospective study, a convenience series of clinical samples (venous blood treated with EDTA or different stabilizer agents, heel-prick blood in filter paper or cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF)) from 30 infants born to seropositive mothers (13 with congenital CD and 17 noninfected), four recipients of organs from CD donors, six orally-infected cases after consumption of contaminated guava juice and six CD patients coinfected with HIV at risk of CD reactivation (N = 46 patients, 46 blood samples and 1 CSF sample) were tested by T. cruzi Loopamp kit (Tc LAMP) and standardized quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). T. cruzi Loopamp accuracy was estimated using the case definition in the different groups as a reference. Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) was applied to measure the agreement between Tc LAMP (index test) and qPCR (reference test). Sensitivity and specificity of T. cruzi Loopamp kit in blood samples from the pooled clinical groups was 93% (95% CI: 77-99) and 100% (95% CI: 80-100) respectively. The agreement between Tc LAMP and qPCR was almost perfect (κ = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.62-1.00). The T. cruzi Loopamp kit was sensitive and specific for detection of T. cruzi infection. It was carried out from DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples (via frozen EDTA blood, guanidine hydrochloride-EDTA blood, DNAgard blood and dried blood spots), as well as in CSF specimens infected with TcI or TcII/V/VI parasite populations.

We hypothesized that an algorithm-based ECMO program improves the outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock. Between March 2003 and July 2013, 29 patients underwent emergent catheterization for acute myocardial infarction due to left main or proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion complicated with cardiogenic shock (defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg despite multiple inotropes, with or without intra-aortic balloon pump, lactic acidosis). Of 29 patients, 15 patients were treated before July 2010 (Group 1, old program), and 14 patients were treated after July 2010 (Group 2, new program). There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics, including age, sex, coronary risk factors, and left ventricular ejection fraction between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to ECMO was performed in two cases (13%) in Group 1 and four cases (29%) in Group 2. ECMO support was performed in one case (6.7%) in Group 1 and six cases (43%) in Group 2.

METHOD OF STUDY Cultures of primary female GECs were exposed to wildtype (WT), VHS-deleted (vhsB), or UV-inactivated HSV-2. Antiviral pathway induction was evaluated by measuring nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) translocation by immunofluorescent microscopy. Proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferon (IFN) were measured by Luminex or ELISA. Biological activity of IFN-β was evaluated via VSV-GFP bioassay, by blocking secreted IFN-β with neutralizing antibodies and by measuring interferon-stimulated genes by RT-PCR. RESULTS Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in primary GECs in response to replication-competent HSV-2, but suppressed in the presence of the VHS protein. In contrast, upregulation of IFN-β depended on viral replication, but was not affected by VHS. However, the IFN-β produced was biologically active and reduced the viral burden. CONCLUSION Viral factors such as replication and the presence of the VHS protein play important roles in regulating innate antiviral responses against HSV-2 from primary GECs.","Ferreira, Victor H; Nazli, Aisha; Mossman, Karen L; Kaushic, Charu",American journal of reproductive immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.12133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23621693/,13

It continues to spread widely, as the world still lacks specific treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The scenario of COVID-19 in Yemen seems obscure due to the lack of adequate data, therefore, we developed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it online among Yemeni people. The aim of this study was to understand the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Yemen better since there is currently limited published data and limited availability of COVID-19 testing. METHODOLOGY A 34-question web-based survey was distributed on social media outlets targeting people in Yemen. Data aggregation, analysis, and visualization were performed using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS 2,341 individuals reported symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection, with 25.4% reporting a chronic medical condition. Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and immune deficiency were associated with increased severity of the disease, while obesity, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and liver disease were not. Only 37 individuals (1.6%) had a confirmatory COVID-19 PCR test. The presence of high fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and dysphagia were symptoms that tended to be correlated to worse clinical outcomes.

However, there is high variability in hand function in these children, which might be explained by the complexity of motor representations of both hands in the contralesional hemisphere. OBJECTIVE To measure the link between hand function and the size and excitability of motor representations of both hands, and their overlap, in the contralesional hemisphere of children with USCP. METHODS We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure the size and excitability of motor representations of both hands, and their overlap, in the contralesional hemisphere of 50 children with USCP. We correlated these measures with manual dexterity of the affected hand, bimanual performance, and mirror movement strength. RESULTS The main and novel findings were (1) the large overlap in contralesional motor representations of the 2 hands and (2) the moderate positive associations of the size and excitability of such shared-site representations with hand function. Such functional associations were not present for overall size and excitability of representations of the affected hand. CONCLUSIONS Greater relative overlap of the affected hand representation with the less-affected hand representation within the contralesional hemisphere was associated with better hand function. This association suggests that overlapping representations might be adaptively ""yoked,"" such that cortical control of the child's less-affected hand supports that of the affected hand.","Marneweck, Michelle; Kuo, Hsing-Ching; Smorenburg, Ana R P; Ferre, Claudio L; Flamand, Veronique H; Gupta, Disha; Carmel, Jason B; Bleyenheuft, Yannick; Gordon, Andrew M; Friel, Kathleen M",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,https://doi.org/10.1177/1545968317745991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303031/,13

METHODS One hundred and fifty-nine women underwent the procedure between August 2010 and August 2014. One hundred and forty-four patients completed the follow up assessment. At each visit, the prolapse symptoms were assessed using the prolapse quality-of-life (P-QOL) questionnaire and objectively with the use of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) score. The subjective outcomes were also evaluated with the use of the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII) questionnaires. Perioperative complications and further surgery for prolapse were evaluated. Women who conceived following the procedure were evaluated for pregnancy outcomes and prolapse recurrence. RESULTS Pre-operatively, 85% (135/159) had uterine prolapse ≥ stage 2. Postoperatively, 95.1% (137/144) of women had anatomical success rate defined as stage 0 uterine descent. Eighty-two percent (118/144) of women reported cure of prolapse symptoms and feeling ""much better"" or ""very much better"" on postoperative PGII assessment. Eight women (5%) became pregnant following the laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy- seven had full term pregnancies and one had a miscarriage. Six out of the seven (86%) had stage 0 apical prolapse and PGII of ""much better"" at 6 months postpartum. One patient had symptomatic prolapse recurrence and underwent perineorrhaphy at 3 years. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single sheet mesh sacrohysteropexy is associated with subjective and objective improvement in prolapse symptoms and QoL that is maintained up to 48 months. Laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy can be offered to women desiring future fertility; however, further research is needed to advise on best surgical approach in women of childbearing age. Neurourol.

This study reports integration of an advanced fermentation approach (self-cycling fermentation) with the production of cellulose nanocrystals. Specifically, wood pulp was enzymatically hydrolyzed to yield dissolved sugars, which were fed to a self-cycling fermentation system for ethanol production, and residual solids were used for cellulose nanocrystals production via acid hydrolysis. Self-cycling fermentation achieved stable ethanol production for 10 cycles with significantly greater productivity than batch operation: ethanol volumetric productivity increased by 63-95% and annual ethanol productivity by 96 ± 5%. Additionally, the enzyme hydrolysis approach employed did not impede ethanol fermentation, and the cellulose nanocrystals generated displayed properties consistent with previous studies. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of this co-production strategy to produce both cellulosic ethanol and cellulose nanocrystals from a single feedstock.","Wang, Jie; Chae, Michael; Beyene, Dawit; Sauvageau, Dominic; Bressler, David C",Bioresource technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.124969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740586/,13

This calls for rapid and timely publication of information to promote both its scientific validity and societal value. On the other hand, rapid publication poses a potential threat to the integrity of the information published.

73584,Murine coronavirus delays expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes.,2010,"We previously demonstrated that W proteins from different Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains localize in either the cytoplasm (e.g., NDV strain SG10) or the nucleus (e.g., NDV strain La Sota). To clarify the mechanism behind these cell localization differences, we overexpressed W protein derived from four different NDV strains or W protein associated with different cellular regions in Vero cells. This revealed that the key region for determining W protein localization is 180-227aa. Further experiments found that there is a nuclear export signal (NES) motif in W protein 211-224aa. W protein could be transported into the nucleus via interaction with KPNA1, KPNA2, and KPNA6 in a nuclear localization signal-dependent manner, and W protein containing an NES was transported back to the cytoplasm in a CRM1-independent manner. Interestingly, we observed that the cytoplasm-localized W protein colocalizes with mitochondria. We rescued the NES-deletion W protein NDV strain rSG10-ΔWC/WΔNES using an NDV reverse genetics system and found that the replication ability, virulence, and pathogenicity of an NDV strain were all higher when the W protein cellular localization was in the nucleus rather than the mitochondria. Further experiments revealed that W protein nuclear localization reduced the expression of IFN-β otherwise stimulated by NDV. Our research reveals the mechanism by which NDV W protein becomes localized to different parts of the cell and demonstrates the outcomes of nuclear or cytoplasmic localization both in vitro and in vivo, laying a foundation for subsequent functional studies of the W protein in NDV and other paramyxoviruses.IMPORTANCE In Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the W protein, like the V protein, is a nonstructural protein encoded by the P gene via RNA editing. Compared with V protein, W protein has a common N-terminal domain but a unique C-terminal domain. V protein is known as a key virulence factor and an important interferon antagonist across the family Paramyxoviridae In contrast, very little is known about the function of NDV W protein, and this limited information is based on studies of the Nipah virus W protein. Here, we investigated the localization mechanism of NDV W protein and its subcellular distribution in mitochondria. We found that W protein localization differences impact IFN-β production, consequently affecting NDV virulence, replication, and pathogenicity. This work provides new insights on the differential localization mechanism of NDV W proteins, along with fundamental knowledge for understanding the functions of W proteins in NDV and other paramyxoviruses.","Yang, Yanling; Xue, Jia; Teng, Qingyuan; Li, Xiao; Bu, Yawen; Zhang, Guozhong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02087-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441338/,13

Schematically, two antagonistic and extreme strategies have been proposed, zero-covid and herd immunity. Between the two, often oscillating measures, based on medical but also societal and political considerations, have been taken without any major effect on the course of the epidemic. Vaccines are a game-changer by providing a real opportunity to sustainably protect everyone against infection and eliminate the circulation of the virus. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, the three currently authorized in France, overall induce remarkable protection rates of 95 %, 94 % and 70 % respectively. The surprise came from that this efficacy was obtained after a rapid development, by targeting only the viral protein S as antigen, and by using the administration of expression vectors innovative in vaccinology, consisting of either messenger RNA or recombinant adenovirus. However, bringing the epidemic under control requires a well-organized mass vaccination campaign. It also requires careful monitoring of many parameters such as the occurrence of adverse events, duration of induced immunity, vaccine efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, interest or not of vaccinating people already infected, vaccination of immunocompromised patients. Vaccination must be accompanied by the maintenance of barrier measures and gestures and an amplification of clinical and biological investigations both to validate its effectiveness on the Covid-19 epidemic and to prepare for future developments in vaccinology.","Agut, Henri",Virologie,https://doi.org/10.1684/vir.2021.0903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112629/,13

However, with the unilateral thoracic approach, it can be difficult to ensure the operative field in the neck and difficult to identify the location of the contralateral phrenic nerve. In 2015, we reported on a robotic subxiphoid thymectomy (RST) in which the camera is inserted from the subxiphoid incision and robotic forceps are inserted from the bilateral intercostal spaces. With this approach, a camera is inserted into a subxiphoid incision which is the midline of the body and a surgical field comparable to that in a median sternotomy can be achieved. This makes it easier to identify the location of the bilateral phrenic nerves and offer the good visualization in the neck area. Here we report on our RST techniques. For a thymectomy without suturing, a subxiphoid, single-port thymectomy is performed because it is minimally invasive. In patients who require suturing, such as with a pericardial patch closure, RST is selected. The RST has excellent operability when performed with a robot, making it suitable for more difficult procedures. In the future, we believe that a robot-assisted thymectomy might become the standard method.","Suda, Takashi",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/jovs.2016.07.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399504/,13

This inhibition is thought to be the result of zinc diffusion across the synaptic cleft and subsequent binding to the extracellular domain of the NMDAR. However, this model fails to incorporate the observed association of the highly zinc-sensitive NMDAR subunit GluN2A with the postsynaptic zinc transporter ZnT1, which moves intracellular zinc to the extracellular space. Here, we report that disruption of ZnT1-GluN2A association by a cell-permeant peptide strongly reduced NMDAR inhibition by synaptic zinc in mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus synapses. Moreover, synaptic zinc inhibition of NMDARs required postsynaptic intracellular zinc, suggesting that cytoplasmic zinc is transported by ZnT1 to the extracellular space in close proximity to the NMDAR. These results challenge a decades-old dogma on how zinc inhibits synaptic NMDARs and demonstrate that presynaptic release and a postsynaptic transporter organize zinc into distinct microdomains to modulate NMDAR neurotransmission.","Krall, Rebecca F; Moutal, Aubin; Phillips, Matthew B; Asraf, Hila; Johnson, Jon W; Khanna, Rajesh; Hershfinkel, Michal; Aizenman, Elias; Tzounopoulos, Thanos",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb1515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937457/,13

81287,Non-optimal codon usage preferences of coronaviruses determine their promiscuity for infecting multiple hosts.,2021-03-23,"UNLABELLED Cavally virus (CavV) and related viruses in the family Mesoniviridae diverged profoundly from other nidovirus lineages but largely retained the characteristic set of replicative enzymes conserved in the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae. The expression of these enzymes in virus-infected cells requires the extensive proteolytic processing of two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, by the viral 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)). Here, we show that CavV 3CL(pro) autoproteolytic cleavage occurs at two N-terminal (N1 and N2) and one C-terminal (C1) processing site(s). The mature form of 3CL(pro) was revealed to be a 314-residue protein produced by cleavage at FKNK1386|SAAS (N2) and YYNQ1700|SATI (C1). Site-directed mutagenesis data suggest that the mesonivirus 3CL(pro) employs a catalytic Cys-His dyad comprised of CavV pp1a/pp1ab residues Cys-1539 and His-1434. The study further suggests that mesonivirus 3CL(pro) substrate specificities differ from those of related nidovirus proteases. The presence of Gln (or Glu) at the P1 position was not required for cleavage, although residues that control Gln/Glu specificity in related viral proteases are retained in the CavV 3CL(pro) sequence. Asn at the P2 position was identified as a key determinant for mesonivirus 3CL(pro) substrate specificity. Other positions, including P4 and P1', each are occupied by structurally related amino acids, indicating a supportive role in substrate binding. Together, the data identify a new subgroup of nidovirus main proteases and support previous conclusions on phylogenetic relationships between the main nidovirus lineages. IMPORTANCE Mesoniviruses have been suggested to provide an evolutionary link between nidovirus lineages with small (13 to 16 kb) and large (26 to 32 kb) RNA genome sizes, and it has been proposed that a specific set of enzymes, including a proofreading exoribonuclease and other replicase gene-encoded proteins, play a key role in the major genome expansion leading to the currently known lineages of large nidoviruses. Despite their smaller genome size (20 kb), mesoniviruses retained most of the replicative domains conserved in large nidoviruses; thus, they are considered interesting models for studying possible key events in the evolution of RNA genomes of exceptional size and complexity.

81527,Molecular virology of hepatitis E virus.,2013,"BACKGROUND Data from interventional studies suggest that a peritoneal flap after pelvic lymph node dissection (LND) during laparoscopic, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) may reduce the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles in transperitoneal approach. However, most of these studies are not conducted in a randomized controlled fashion, thus limiting their scientific value. A recent prospective, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) did not show superiority of a peritoneal flap while further trials are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the presented RCT will be to show that creating a peritoneal flap decreases the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles compared to the current standard procedure without creation of a flap. METHODS/DESIGN PELYCAN is a parallel-group, patient- and assessor-blinded, phase III, adaptive randomized controlled superiority trial. Men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer who undergo transperitoneal RARP with pelvic LND will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups-either with creating a peritoneal flap (PELYCAN) or without creating a peritoneal flap (control). Sample size calculation yielded a sample size of 300 with a planned interim analysis after 120 patients, which will be performed by an independent statistician. This provides a possibility for early stopping or sample size recalculation. Patients will be stratified for contributing factors for the development of postoperative lymphoceles. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles in both groups within 6 months postoperatively. Patients and assessors will be blinded for the intervention until the end of the follow-up period of 6 months. The surgeon will be informed about the randomization result after performance of vesicourethral anastomosis. Secondary outcome measures include asymptomatic lymphoceles at the time of discharge and within 6 months of follow-up, postoperative complications, mortality, re-admission rate, and quality of life assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. DISCUSSION The PELYCAN study is designed to assess whether the application of a peritoneal flap during RARP reduces the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles, as compared with the standard operation technique. In case of superiority of the intervention, this peritoneal flap may be suggested as a new standard of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00016794 .

Therefore, here we aimed to evaluate the superiority of catheter-related outcomes after the application of tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) without fluoroscopy versus unconditioned NTC insertion. Methods We divided the participants into two phases: those receiving NTCs between March 2010 and February 2011 (phase I), and those receiving TCCs or NTCs between March 2011 and February 2012 (phase II). Catheter survival, nurse satisfaction, and reasons for catheter removal were analyzed. Results Two hundred and sixty patients in phase I and 300 patients in phase II were enrolled in this study. The success rate of TCC insertion was 99.2%. The catheter survival rate in phase I was 65.5% at 1 month, while that in phase II was 74.9% at 1 month (p=0.023). We compared catheter survival between TCCs and NTCs for all periods regardless of phase. The TCC survival rate was higher than the NTC survival rate (p<0.001). Catheter-associated problems led to catheter removal in 97 patients (26.6%) in phase I and 68 patients (18.5%) in phase II (p=0.009). Among 14 HD nurses, all reported being satisfied with manipulation during pre-/post-HD, manupulation during HD, and overall. Eleven HD nurses (78.6%) reported being satisfied with the workload. Conclusion Compared with unconditional NTC insertion for HD, TCC insertion without fluoroscopy improved the overall catheter survival and nurse satisfaction rates.","Kang, Seok Hui; Do, Jun Young",Yeungnam University journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.12701/yujm.2019.00465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176972/,13
82593,Identification of a small-molecule entry inhibitor for filoviruses.,2011,"Background Multiple serosurveillance studies have focused on the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the general population and confirmed cases. However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Methods Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. Results With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01). Conclusion Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases. This also reaffirms the need for contact tracing strategy for controlling the inevitable spread of pandemic.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay Kirtikumar; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_1199_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753682/,13

SAMPLE 550 respondent veterinarian members of the Veterinary Information Network (VIN). PROCEDURES An anonymous online survey was used to gather data from VIN-member veterinarians in small animal general practice regarding their perceptions and use of synchronous video-based telemedicine. Two emails to all VIN members were used to distribute the web-based questionnaire. For consistency, only responses from North American veterinarians who reported working in small animal general practice were included in analyses. Responses were collected between September 28, 2020, and October 21, 2020. RESULTS There were 69,488 recipients and 680 respondents (1.0% response rate), 550 of whom had North American internet protocol addresses and reported working in small animal general practice. Not all respondents answered all questions. Use of video-based telemedicine substantially increased among respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most (86/130 [66.2%]) reported little to no difficulty in adopting videoconferencing. Respondents also reported that telemedicine took less time (61/135 [45.2%]) and resulted in less financial compensation (103/135 [76.3%]) than in-person consultation. Several respondents reported concerns regarding legal issues and potential inferiorities of telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results indicated that a substantial proportion of respondents incorporated synchronous video-based telemedicine into their practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite low perceived difficulty in adopting videoconferencing telemedicine, many planned to discontinue it for some clinical applications once the pandemic is over. Further research is required to elucidate the perceptions and challenges in successful use of veterinary telemedicine.","Bishop, Greg T; Rishniw, Mark; Kogan, Lori R",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.258.12.1372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061604/,13

83770,Japanese Encephalitis Virus NS5 Inhibits Type I Interferon (IFN) Production by Blocking the Nuclear Translocation of IFN Regulatory Factor 3 and NF-κB.,2017,"BACKGROUND We previously reported that olaparib led to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival than the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had qualifying alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent. The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported. METHODS In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive olaparib (256 patients) or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy (131 patients). Cohort A included 245 patients with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM, and cohort B included 142 patients with at least one alteration in any of the other 12 prespecified genes. Crossover to olaparib was allowed after imaging-based disease progression for patients who met certain criteria. Overall survival in cohort A, a key secondary end point, was analyzed with the use of an alpha-controlled, stratified log-rank test at a data maturity of approximately 60%. The primary and other key secondary end points were reported previously. RESULTS The median duration of overall survival in cohort A was 19.1 months with olaparib and 14.7 months with control therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.97; P = 0.02). In cohort B, the median duration of overall survival was 14.1 months with olaparib and 11.5 months with control therapy. In the overall population (cohorts A and B), the corresponding durations were 17.3 months and 14.0 months. Overall, 86 of 131 patients (66%) in the control group crossed over to receive olaparib (56 of 83 patients [67%] in cohort A). A sensitivity analysis that adjusted for crossover to olaparib showed hazard ratios for death of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.91) in cohort A, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.11 to 5.98) in cohort B, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.06) in the overall population. CONCLUSIONS Among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib.

83866,Identification of RNA pseudoknot-binding ligand that inhibits the -1 ribosomal frameshifting of SARS-coronavirus by structure-based virtual screening.,2011,"The ability of a host to curb a viral infection is heavily reliant on the effectiveness of an initial antiviral innate immune response, resulting in the upregulation of interferon (IFN) and, subsequently, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs serve to mount an antiviral state within a host cell, and although the specific antiviral function of a number of ISGs has been characterized, the function of many of these ISGs remains to be determined. Recent research has uncovered a novel role for a handful of ISGs, some of them directly induced by IFN regulatory factor 3 in the absence of IFN itself. These ISGs, most with potent antiviral activity, are also able to augment varying arms of the innate immune response to viral infection, thereby strengthening this response. This new understanding of the role of ISGs may, in turn, help the recent advancement of novel therapeutics aiming to augment innate signaling pathways in an attempt to control viral infection and pathogenesis.","Crosse, Keaton M; Monson, Ebony A; Beard, Michael R; Helbig, Karla J",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000484258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186718/,13
85013,Structural Characterization of Human Coronavirus NL63 N Protein.,2017,"To prevent and reduce the transmission of the coronavirus to vulnerable populations, the World Health Organization recommended the restriction of visitors to nursing homes. It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations. National strategies include mass vaccination, the timely provision of guidance documents and interventions from regulatory bodies that are patient-centred, adaptable, and cost effective.","Hartigan, Irene; Kelleher, Ann; McCarthy, Joan; Cornally, Nicola",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/09697330211005078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982626/,13

Herein, we report the synthesis of half-sandwich complexes of Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir bearing the ispinesib-derived N,N-bidentate ligands (R)- and (S)-2-(1-amino-2-methylpropyl)-3-benzyl-7-chloroquinazolin-4(3H)-one and studies on their chemical and biological properties. Using the enantiomerically pure (R)- and (S)-forms of the ligand, depending on the organometallic moiety, either the SM,R or RM,S diastereomers, respectively, were observed in the molecular structures of the Ru- and Os(cym) (cym = η6-p-cymene) compounds, whereas the RM,R or SM,S diastereomers were found for the Rh- and Ir(Cp*) (Cp* = η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) derivatives. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the energy difference between the diastereomers is very small, and therefore a mixture of both will be present in solution. The organometallics exhibited varying antiproliferative activity in a series of human cancer cell lines, with the complexes featuring the (R)-enantiomer of the ligand being more potent than the (S)-configured counterparts. Notably, the Rh and Ir complexes demonstrated high KSP inhibitory activity, even at 1 nM concentration, which was independent of the chirality of the ligand, whereas the Ru and especially the Os derivatives were much less active.","Łomzik, Michał; Hanif, Muhammad; Budniok, Aleksandra; Błauż, Andrzej; Makal, Anna; Tchoń, Daniel M; Leśniewska, Barbara; Tong, Kelvin K H; Movassaghi, Sanam; Söhnel, Tilo; Jamieson, Stephen M F; Zafar, Ayesha; Reynisson, Jóhannes; Rychlik, Błażej; Hartinger, Christian G; Plażuk, Damian",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c00957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003697/,13

The therapeutic goal is to reduce the risk of relapse. Factors associated with relapses can help to manage and prevent relapses. In addition, patients and doctors all pay attention to it. However, there are differences between studies. Our aim is to summarize factors associated with relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, and VIP were searched to identify risk factors about relapses in RRMS, which should be in cohort or case-control studies. This article was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The quality of studies was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis, subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were all performed with Stata. This research has been registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019120502). RESULTS 43 articles were included. Infection, postpartum period, risk gene, stress, and vitamin D were risk factors for relapses in RRMS. Pregnancy period was the protective factor. Among those, infection increased the risk of relapses in infection period (relative risk [RR], 2.07 [confidence interval (CI), 1.64 to 2.60]). Women in the postpartum period increased the risk of relapses compared with women before pregnancy (RR, 1.43 [CI, 1.19 to 1.72]), or women in pregnancy period (RR, 2.07 [CI, 1.49 to 2.88]). Women in the pregnancy period decreased the risk of relapses (RR, 0.56 [CI, 0.37 to 0.84]) compared with women before pregnancy. However, fewer studies, heterogeneity, and sample size were the limitations. CONCLUSION It is reliable to adopt results about infection, pregnancy period, and postpartum period.","Xie, Yao; Tian, Ziyu; Han, Fang; Liang, Shibing; Gao, Ying; Wu, Dahua",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629678/,13

Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with cognitive impairment in older adults. However, less is known regarding the association between CBF and functional decline, and whether CBF predicts functional decline beyond cerebrovascular and metabolic risk factors. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between regional CBF and functional decline in nondemented older adults. METHOD One hundred sixty-six (N = 166) participants without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Pulsed arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging was acquired to quantify resting CBF. Everyday functioning was measured using the Functional Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and annual follow-up visit across three years. RESULTS Adjusting for age, education, sex, cognitive status, depression, white matter hyperintensity volume, cerebral metabolism, and reference (precentral) CBF, linear mixed effects models showed that lower resting CBF at baseline in the medial temporal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal lobe was significantly associated with accelerated decline in everyday functioning. Results were similar after adjusting for conventional AD biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 positivity. Individuals who later converted to dementia had lower resting CBF in the inferior temporal and parietal regions compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION Lower resting CBF in AD vulnerable regions including medial temporal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal lobes predicted faster rates of decline in everyday functioning. CBF has utility as a biomarker in predicting functional declines in everyday life and conversion to dementia.","Sanchez, Danielle L; Thomas, Kelsey R; Edmonds, Emily C; Bondi, Mark W; Bangen, Katherine J",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-200490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831202/,13

Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of-12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of -11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2.","Vijayan, Viswanathan; Pant, Pradeep; Vikram, Naval; Kaur, Punit; Singh, T P; Sharma, Sujata; Sharma, Pradeep",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1802349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741322/,13

EBF practices are known to vary by population and comparable subnational estimates of prevalence and progress across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are required for planning policy and interventions. Here we present a geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2018 across 94 LMICs mapped to policy-relevant administrative units (for example, districts), quantify subnational inequalities and their changes over time, and estimate probabilities of meeting the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) of ≥70% EBF prevalence by 2030. While six LMICs are projected to meet the WHO GNT of ≥70% EBF prevalence at a national scale, only three are predicted to meet the target in all their district-level units by 2030.","Bhattacharjee, Natalia V; Schaeffer, Lauren E; Hay, Simon I",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01108-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083753/,13
91659,Role of the host cell's unfolded protein response in arenavirus infection.,2011,"BACKGROUND The novel coronarvirus disease (COVID-19) has had a major impact on provision of spinal neurosurgery across the world, especially in the UK, with a significant fall in operating and patient volumes, and elective clinical activities. It is unclear whether the pandemic has affected the volume of urgent spinal procedures in the UK, especially surgical decompressions for cauda equina syndrome (CES). METHODS Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of theatre records and electronic operation notes at our institution to identify all procedures performed for CES before (December 2019 to February 2020) and during (March 2020 to May 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent surgical decompressions during the study period. Over half (54.5%) were female and the median age was 45 years (range = 22-78 years). Three in four procedures were performed at L4-5 and L5-S1 levels (79.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of decompressions performed each month [χ2(5)=1.818; p = 0.874]. On the other hand, the number of referrals for suspected or confirmed CES fell by 81.8% between December 2019 and April 2020. CONCLUSIONS Our results did not show any statistically significant decline in the volume of surgical decompressions performed for CES despite the considerable fall in electronic referrals for CES and degenerative spinal conditions. This suggests that patients with critical neurological symptoms continued to present and were treated appropriately despite the restrictions imposed on spinal surgeons during the pandemic.","Jayakumar, Nithish; Ferguson, Lucie; Nissen, Justin; Holliman, Damian",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2020.1861434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345629/,13

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS We obtained clinical data for 41 consecutive outpatient kidney transplant recipients with known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019. Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare characteristics of patients who required hospitalization versus those who did not. RESULTS Of 41 patients, 22 (54%) had confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, and 19 (46%) were suspected cases. Patients most commonly reported fever (80%), cough (56%), and dyspnea (39%). At the end of follow-up, 13 patients (32%) required hospitalization a median of 8 days (range, 1-16) after symptom onset, and 23 (56%) had outpatient symptom resolution a median of 12 days (4-23) after onset. Patients who required hospitalization were more likely to have reported dyspnea (77% versus 21%, P=0.003) and had higher baseline creatinine (median, 2.0 versus 1.3 mg/dl, P=0.02), but there were no other differences between groups.

A multidisciplinary committee was developed and patient centered education implemented to enhance VTE compliance. RESULTS Over 50% of all the patients who developed VTE were non-compliant with chemical prophylaxis. The majority of non-compliance was due to pain. During period 1 there were 12 VTEs in 482 cases, while in period two, 18 VTEs in 2347 cases (2.5% vs. 0.8%; RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.7, p < 0.001).

93513,Innate immune responses in raccoons after raccoon rabies virus infection.,2014,"The United States experienced historically high numbers of measles cases in 2019, despite achieving national measles vaccination rates above the World Health Organization recommendation of 95% coverage with two doses. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission. Our research clearly outlines that finer-scale vaccination data should be collected to prevent a return to endemic measles transmission in the United States.","Masters, Nina B; Eisenberg, Marisa C; Delamater, Paul L; Kay, Matthew; Boulton, Matthew L; Zelner, Jon",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011529117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106403/,13

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival rates and trends of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBC). METHODS Data from SBC patients between 1975 and 2017 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The age-adjusted incidence rates (AAR) were calculated for the overall cases and based on gender, age, race, and histology. Furthermore, the relative survival rates for one, three, and five years, and the rates stratified to the aforementioned selected variables were computed. Besides, we conducted a joint point regression analysis to calculate the annual percent change (APC) and its associated standard error (SE) for AAR and mortality. RESULTS The AAR rate of SBC was 0.019 per 100,000. Higher AAR rates were observed in patients who were in the 65-74-year-age-group, females, Caucasians, and had none mesenchymal subtype. The relative one-year, three-year and five-year-survival rates were 99.58 %, 93.67 %, and 89.10 %, respectively. Lower survival rates were noted in patients who were males, African Americans, and had a mesenchymal subtype. The trend analysis has shown a significant yearly increase (P < 0.001) in AAR of SBC (APC ± SE = 0.0005 %±0.0001), along with a significant yearly decline in mortality rates (APC ± SE= -0.0202 %±0.0029). CONCLUSION Despite the increase in AAR over time, there has been a significant decline in mortality rates over time, which might have been due to the advancement of treatment modalities, improvement in diagnostic imaging, and modification in disease grading.","Dibas, Mahmoud; Doheim, Mohamed Fahmy; Ghozy, Sherief; Ros, Mohamed Hassan; El-Helw, Ghidaa Osama; Reda, Abdullah",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818757/,13

METHODS In this proof-of-principle study, one patient with severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse was implanted with an MR-visible mesh. High-resolution MR images of the pelvis were acquired 6 weeks and 8 months postsurgery. 3D models were created using semiautomatic segmentation techniques. Conformational changes were recorded quantitatively using part-comparison analysis. An ellipticity measure is proposed to record longitudinal conformational changes in the mesh arms. The surface that is the effective reinforcement provided by the mesh is calculated using a novel methodology. The area of this surface is the effective support area (ESA). RESULTS MR-visible mesh was clearly outlined in the images, which allowed us to longitudinally quantify mesh configuration between 6 weeks and 8 months after implantation. No significant changes were found in mesh position, effective support area, conformation of the mesh's main body, and arm length during the period of observation. Ellipticity profiles show longitudinal conformational changes in posterior arms. CONCLUSIONS This paper proposes novel methodologies for a systematic 3D assessment of the position and morphology of MR-visible meshes. A novel semiautomatic tool was developed to calculate the effective area of support provided by the mesh, a potentially clinically important parameter.","Sindhwani, Nikhil; Feola, Andrew; De Keyzer, Frederik; Claus, Filip; Callewaert, Geertje; Urbankova, Iva; Ourselin, Sebastien; D'hooge, Jan; Deprest, Jan",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-015-2681-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25800904/,13

Objective To assess patterns of telehealth use across surgical specialties before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants Insurance claims from a Michigan statewide commercial payer for new patient visits with a surgeon from 1 of 9 surgical specialties during one of the following periods: prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (period 1: January 5 to March 7, 2020), early pandemic (period 2: March 8 to June 6, 2020), and late pandemic (period 3: June 7 to September 5, 2020). Exposures Telehealth implementation owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures (1) Conversion rate defined as the rate of weekly new patient telehealth visits divided by mean weekly number of total new patient visits in 2019. This outcome adjusts for a substantial decrease in outpatient care during the pandemic. (2) Weekly number of new patient telehealth visits divided by weekly number of total new patient visits. Results Among 4405 surgeons in the cohort, 2588 (58.8%) performed telehealth in any patient care context. Specifically for new patient visits, 1182 surgeons (26.8%) used telehealth. A total of 109 610 surgical new outpatient visits were identified during the pandemic. The median (interquartile range) age of telehealth patients was 46.8 (34.1-58.4) years compared with 52.6 (38.3-62.3) years for patients who received care in-person. Prior to March 2020, less than 1% (8 of 173 939) of new patient visits were conducted through telehealth. Telehealth use peaked in April 2020 (week 14) and facilitated 34.6% (479 of 1383) of all new patient visits during that week. The telehealth conversion rate peaked in April 2020 (week 15) and was equal to 8.2% of the 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volume. During period 2, a mean (SD) of 16.6% (12.0%) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 5.1% of 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volumes). During period 3, 3.0% (2168 of 71 819) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 2.5% of 2019 new patient visit volumes). Mean (SD) telehealth conversion rates varied by specialty with urology being the highest (14.3% [7.7%]). Conclusions and Relevance Results from this study showed that telehealth use grew across all surgical specialties in Michigan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While rates of telehealth use have declined as in-person care has resumed, telehealth use remains substantially higher across all surgical specialties than it was prior to the pandemic.","Chao, Grace F; Li, Kathleen Y; Zhu, Ziwei; McCullough, Jeff; Thompson, Mike; Claflin, Jake; Fliegner, Maximilian; Steppe, Emma; Ryan, Andrew; Ellimoottil, Chad",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2021.0979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769434/,13

We aimed to evaluate the impact on mortality of an early assessment of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital (Rozzano-Milan, Lombardy, Italy) is a tertiary centre that has been converted to the management of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were entered in a dedicated database for cohort observational analyses. Outcomes were stratified according to elevated levels (ie, above the upper level of normal) of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or both measured within 24 hours after hospital admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS A total of 397 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included up to 1 April 2020. At the time of hospital admission, 208 patients (52.4%) had normal values for cardiac biomarkers, 90 (22.7%) had elevated both hs-TnI and BNP, 59 (14.9%) had elevated only BNP and 40 (10.1%) had elevated only hs-TnI. The rate of mortality was higher in patients with elevated hs-TnI (22.5%, OR 4.35, 95% CI 1.72 to 11.04), BNP (33.9%, OR 7.37, 95% CI 3.53 to 16.75) or both (55.6%, OR 18.75, 95% CI 9.32 to 37.71) as compared with those without elevated cardiac biomarkers (6.25%). A multivariate analysis identified concomitant elevation of both hs-TnI and BNP as a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 9.93). CONCLUSIONS An early detection of elevated hs-TnI and BNP predicts mortality in patients with COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers should be systematically assessed in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission in order to optimise risk stratification.","Stefanini, Giulio G; Chiarito, Mauro; Ferrante, Giuseppe; Cannata, Francesco; Azzolini, Elena; Viggiani, Giacomo; De Marco, Andrea; Briani, Martina; Bocciolone, Monica; Bragato, Renato; Corrada, Elena; Gasparini, Gabriele L; Marconi, Manuel; Monti, Lorenzo; Pagnotta, Paolo A; Panico, Cristina; Pini, Daniela; Regazzoli, Damiano; My, Ilaria; Kallikourdis, Marinos; Ciccarelli, Michele; Badalamenti, Salvatore; Aghemo, Alessio; Reimers, Bernhard; Condorelli, Gianluigi",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817312/,13

As these small, globular proteins have many interactors, it has been difficult to ensure that methods to visualize ROP in live cells do not affect ROP function. Here, motivated by work in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), we generated a fluorescent moss (Physcomitrium [Physcomitrella] patens) ROP4 fusion protein by inserting mNeonGreen after Glycine 134. Plants harboring tagged ROP4 and no other ROP genes were phenotypically normal. Plants lacking all four ROP genes comprised an unpatterned clump of spherical cells that were unable to form gametophores, demonstrating that ROP is essentially for spatial patterning at the cellular and tissue levels. The functional ROP fusion protein formed a steep gradient at the apical plasma membranes of growing tip cells. ROP also predicted the site of branch formation in the apical cell at the onset of mitosis, which occurs one to two cell cycles before a branch cell emerges. While FRAP studies demonstrated that ROP dynamics do not depend on the cytoskeleton, acute depolymerization of the cytoskeleton removed ROP from the membrane only in recently divided cells, pointing to a feedback mechanism between the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, and ROP.","Cheng, Xiaohang; Mwaura, Bethany W; Chang Stauffer, Sophia R; Bezanilla, Magdalena",The Plant cell,https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.20.00440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917738/,13

In this report, we describe the case of a 59-year-old patient on chronic hemodialysis due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis and complex shunt history with multiple shunt occlusions and revisions. The implantation of an iliac-cuffed tunneled catheter led to complications because the catheter was malpositioned into the left ascending lumbar vein (ALV).

The evidence supports that gas exchange and countering the negative effects of bed rest and immobility are priorities in severely affected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, in recent years, research has focused on poor long-term functional outcomes in patients with ARDS, often associated with ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies. In addition to physical therapists providing respiratory support in the ICU, the literature unequivocally supports the view that early intervention for ICU management of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 needs to focus on reducing contributors to impaired long-term function, with direct attention paid to preventing or managing ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies, in conjunction with respiratory care.","Candan, Sevim Acaroz; Elibol, Nuray; Abdullahi, Auwal",Physiotherapy theory and practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/09593985.2020.1766181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419564/,13

The active correction of misinformation by social media users and an understanding of the drivers of such behavior can help solve this ongoing issue. Drawing on the influence of presumed influence model and cognitive appraisal theory, an online experiment (N = 400) was conducted to examine how exposure to corrective messages with regard to COVID-19 misinformation induced individuals' threat appraisals of the influence of the misinformation on others and how these threat appraisals and the corresponding emotional responses motivated individuals to take corrective actions. The results suggested that people's perceptions of the severity of the influence of misinformation on others engendered anticipated guilt, which, in turn, strengthened their intentions to correct misinformation related to COVID-19. The study offers guidance on how to effectively craft a corrective message to encourage audiences to counter misinformation together.","Sun, Yanqing; Oktavianus, Jeffry; Wang, Sai; Lu, Fangcao",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1888452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601990/,13

103323,A molecular dynamics study on the thermal properties of carbon-based gold nanoparticles.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND There is a need for a bedside functional residual capacity (FRC) measurement method that performs well in intensive care patients during many modes of ventilation including controlled, assisted, spontaneous, and mixed. We developed a modified multiple breath nitrogen washout method for FRC measurement that relies on end-tidal gas fractions and alveolar tidal volume measurements as inputs but does not require the traditional measurements of volume of nitrogen or oxygen. Using end-tidal measurements, not volume, reduces errors from signal synchronization. This study was designed to assess the accuracy, precision, and repeatability of the proposed FRC system in subjects with variable ventilation patterns including some spontaneous effort. METHODS The accuracy and precision of measurements were assessed by comparing the novel N₂ washout FRC values to the gold standard, body plethysmography, in 20 spontaneously breathing volunteers. Repeatability was assessed by comparing subsequent measurements in 20 intensive care patients whose lungs were under controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Compared with body plethysmography, the accuracy (mean bias) of the novel method was -0.004 litre and precision [1 standard deviation (sd)] was 0.209 litre [mean (sd)] [-0.1 (5.9)% of body plethysmography]. The difference between repeated measurements was 0.009 (0.15) litre [mean (sd)] [0.4 (6.4)%]. The coefficient of repeatability was 0.31 litre (12.7%). CONCLUSIONS The modified multiple breath nitrogen washout method for FRC measurement provides improved precision and equivalent accuracy and repeatability compared with existing methods during ventilation with variable ventilation patterns. Further study of the novel N₂ washout method is needed.","Brewer, L M; Orr, J A; Sherman, M R; Fulcher, E H; Markewitz, B A",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aer220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752798/,13

However, prior data from intra-arterialthrombolysis suggested that MCI increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The safety and utility of MCI has not been investigated in the setting of thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed the Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) trial to correlate pre-intervention MCI flow with collateral flow, and to investigate its impact on ICH and clinical outcome after thrombectomy with the Solitaire device. RESULTS MCI was noted in 52% (n=51) of patients with a prevalence for the M2 location of 71% (n=36). Dichotomized correlation demonstrated a strong inverse relationship for partial collaterals with good MCI flow (p=0.004; OR 8.25). None of the MCI variables (presence, number, or grades) correlated with ICH and clinical outcome. The most significant predictors of non-disabled outcome were higher Alberta Stroke Program early CT Score (ASPECTS) (OR 1.61; p=0.0361) and younger age (OR 0.922; p = 0.0109). Higher ASPECTS was also a strong predictor of lower ICH risk (OR 0.501, p=0.0078). CONCLUSIONS Collateral flow inversely correlated with MCI flow in the endovascular arm of the SWIFT PRIME trial. This finding warrants further validation in larger cohorts as MCI may be influenced by individual operator's technique and choice of syringe size. Evaluation of flow and distal anatomy with MCI prior to stent retriever deployment is safe with no evidence of an impact on ICH or clinical outcome.

The advancement of the endovascular technique and devices has ensured that endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms is the first choice in most cases, especially in unruptured ones. Different combinations of treatment modalities and techniques can be used in the management of multiple aneurysms. But in selected patients without subarachnoid hemorrhage, treatment of all aneurysms in one or more sessions with endovascular techniques is less traumatic than that with surgery. In the literature, the maximum number of aneurysms in one patient treated endovascularly and/or surgically is seven. In this case report, we present, with a review of the literature, a patient with eight intracranial aneurysms, all of which were treated in two sessions with various endovascular techniques. A 40-year-old female patient was admitted due to headache. Angiography showed eight aneurysms in the posterior circulation and, bilaterally, in the anterior circulation. All aneurysms were treated endovascularly in two sessions. In the treatment of the aneurysms, different endovascular techniques were used including flow diverters stents, stent-assisted coiling, Y-stent-assisted coiling, and coiling alone.","Akgul, Erol; Onan, Hasan Bilen; Balli, Huseyin Tugsan; Cetinalp, Nuri Eralp",Case reports in neurological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/9637905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668108/,13

Influenza, plague, and trypanosomiasis are classic examples of zoonotic infections that transmit from animals to humans. The multihost ecology of zoonoses leads to complex dynamics, and analytical tools, such as mathematical modeling, are vital to the development of effective control policies and research agendas. Much attention has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission.

METHODS Twelve piglets were divided into 3 groups: (1) TOF model animals (PA band plus pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), (2) pulmonary insufficiency (PI) animals (pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), and (3) control animals (n = 4). A nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape was used to perform the main pulmonary artery banding. Echocardiography was performed 4 months postoperatively. After each animal was euthanized, PA histological analysis was performed in animals with band internalization. RESULTS Significant postsurgical pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular enlargement were present in the TOF and PI, compared with control animals, whereas no significant pulmonary stenosis was observed in TOF animals when compared with PI group. Postmortem examination of all TOF animals revealed the constricting band to be intact but partially internalized into the PA lumen, allowing blood flow around the stenosis. Histological sections of the banded PA in the area of internalization showed a significant disorganization of the medial layer, with significant scarring and fibrotic reaction surrounding the outside of the band and the presence of inflammatory cells suggesting a significant inflammatory response during band internalization. CONCLUSIONS Band internalization may occur after PA banding using a nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape in a chronic porcine model of repaired TOF. This unusual complication was likely due to the type of material used for banding.","Jalal, Zakaria; Roubertie, François; Fournier, Emmanuelle; Dubes, Virginie; Benoist, David; Naulin, Jerome; Delmond, Samantha; Durand, Marlène; Haissaguerre, Michel; Bernus, Olivier; Thambo, Jean-Benoit",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135116668828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28033087/,13

RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality for transplant candidates; interestingly, posttransplant comorbidities play a larger role than immunosuppression status. COVID-19 therapies and vaccinations are well tolerated in pre and postliver transplant patients with few exceptions, although further research is needed regarding effectiveness in this patient population. Provider practice patterns should evolve to minimize contagion during the current pandemic and prepare for an increase in liver disease due to after-shocks of missed diagnosis and progression of liver disease. SUMMARY COVID-19 has spurred new research and technologies to ensure the safety of liver transplant candidates, recipients, and donors, and most COVID-19 therapies are safe in this patient population.

Total nucleic acids from pediatric clinical samples (n = 653) and an hMPV-specific inhibition control (h-IC) were coextracted using the MM and/or the EM. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and real-time molecular beacon detection of hMPV were performed using a NucliSENS EasyQ analyzer (bioMérieux). Positive results were confirmed using an in-house-validated reverse transcriptase PCR ASR-based assay. The inclusion of the h-IC monitored the entire process, including the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection. The percentages of samples with inhibited amplification of the h-IC after initial NA extraction by EM and MM were 1.88% and 3.17%, respectively. After reprocessing of a new aliquot, the final h-IC inhibition rates were 0% (EM) and 1.06% (MM). The limit of detection of the assay was between 2 (EM extraction) and 10 (MM extraction) RNA copies/reaction, and specificity was 100% when testing viral respiratory isolates and clinical samples. hMPV was detected in 5.6% of pediatric samples tested and was also detected in three coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). hMPV was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus in children of 0 to 2 years of age, after RSV.

RESULTS Nineteen (23.8%) patients underwent total laparoscopic vaginoplasty and 61 (76.3%) underwent laparoscope-assisted vaginoplasty. There were 64 (80.0%) primary operations and 16 (20.0%) secondary operations. All of the surgeries were completed successfully and no intraoperative complications occurred. Mean follow-up time was 14 months. Postoperatively, 5 women had vaginal stenosis, while 4 women had no sexual partner during the follow-up period which meant that they could not be assessed completely.

METHODS Retrospective data (1/2008-12/2016) from 238 patients with pelvic fractures were analyzed. Mean patient age was 44 years (SD 20); 66% were male. There were 54 Tile A, 82 Tile B, and 102 Tile C type injuries. The 30-day mortality rate was 15% (36/238). Six observers, three radiologists, and three surgeons with different levels of experience (attending/resident/intern) classified each fracture into one of the 26 second-order subcategories of the Tile classification. Weighted kappa coefficients were used to assess the IORs for the three main categories and nine first-order subcategories. RESULTS The overall IORs of the Tile system for the main categories and first-order subcategories were moderate (kappa = 0.44) and fair (kappa = 0.31), respectively. IOR was fair to moderate among radiologists, but only fair among surgeons. By level of training, IOR was moderate between attendings and between residents, whereas it was only fair between interns. IOR was moderate to substantial (kappa = 0.56-0.70) between the radiology attending and resident. Association of the Tile fracture type with 30-day mortality was present based on two out of six observer ratings. CONCLUSIONS The overall IOR of the Tile classification system is only fair to moderate, increases with the level of rater experience and is better among radiologists than surgeons. In the light of these findings, results from studies using this classification system must be interpreted cautiously. KEY POINTS • The overall interobserver reliability of the Tile pelvic fracture classification is only fair to moderate. • Interobserver reliability increases with observer experience and radiologists have higher kappa coefficients than surgeons. • Interobserver reliability has an impact on the association of the Tile classification system with mortality in two out of six cases.","Zingg, Tobias; Uldry, Emilie; Omoumi, Patrick; Clerc, Daniel; Monier, Arnaud; Pache, Basile; Moshebah, Mohammed; Butti, Fabio; Becce, Fabio",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07247-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901303/,13

A randomized trial was carried out to compare the results of using mesh or no mesh at the time of formation of a colostomy with the clinical identification of PSH as the primary outcome. METHOD In this two-centre randomized trial (Oslo University Hospital and Sykehuset Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway), patients with rectal cancer undergoing open pelvic surgery were randomized to receive a retromuscular synthetic mesh (study group, n = 32) or no mesh (control group, n = 26) at the time of end-colostomy formation. Postoperative follow up was not blinded and included clinical examination and routine CT. RESULTS The median period of follow up was 40 (range: 84) months. There were no differences in demographic variables or complications between the study and control groups. PSH developed in two patients of the study group and in 12 of the control group [OR = 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.30) and hazard ratio 0.134 (95% CI: 0.030-0.603); P < 0.001]. The number needed to treat to avoid one PSH was 2.5 patients. CT demonstrated an increase over time in the size of the fascial orifice in patients with PSH without mesh prophylaxis, in contrast to a stable size in patients with mesh and in the control patients who did not develop PSH.

Over 50% of pregnant women use pregnancy applications (apps) and must search through thousands of pregnancy or women's health-related apps available on app stores. COVID-19 is changing how women receive prenatal care. Mobile health apps may help maintain women's satisfaction with their prenatal care. OBJECTIVE Our objective is to identify pregnancy mobile apps and to evaluate the apps using a modified APPLICATIONS scoring system. METHODS A list of pregnancy apps was identified in the first 20 Google search results using the search term ""pregnancy app."" After excluding irrelevant, inaccurate, malfunctioning, or no longer available apps, all unique apps were downloaded and evaluated with the modified APPLICATION scoring system, which includes both objective and subjective criteria and evaluation of special features. RESULTS A total of 57 unique pregnancy apps were generated. After 28 apps were excluded, the remaining 29 apps were evaluated, with a mean score of 9.4 points out of a maximum of 16. The highest scoring app scored 15 points. Over 60% of apps were not comprehensive with information for every stage of pregnancy or did not contain all four desired components of pregnancy apps: health promotion/patient education, communication, health tracking, and notifications and reminders. Only 24% of apps included a text search field, and only 28% of apps cited literature. CONCLUSIONS Our search yielded many high-scoring apps, but few contained all desired components and features. These identified and rated apps can lessen the burden on pregnant women and providers to find available apps on their own. While healthcare providers should continue to vet apps before recommending them to patients, these findings also highlight that a Google search is a successful way for patients and providers to find useful and comprehensive pregnancy applications.

Current detecting assays of semen stains species identification were not confirmative enough. In this study, we investigated the potential of species identification of semen stains by using attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with advanced chemometrics methods. The effect of substrates types and time since deposition (TSD) were considered in the study.

With the aging population and seemingly increasing outbreak of communicable diseases, it is expected that there will be a continued demand for inpatient/critical care providers. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides a glimpse of a health care system in severe provider shortage. Adult-gerontology acute nurse practitioners (GACNPs) can play a vital part in relieving that shortage. But with the increased role, there is an increased responsibility and need for expansion of AGACNP skill set. This includes the training and utilization of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The case reports and data available from countries that have already combated COVID-19 outbreak show POCUS can play a key part in managing critically ill patients on isolation precautions.

However, research identifying key areas of imbalanced supply and demand of ESs at the urban agglomeration scale is limited. Therefore, in this study, using the Fujian Delta urban agglomeration of China as the research area, based on multi-source data, and analysis tools, such as ArcGIS, ENVI, and GeoDa, we constructed a research framework and indicator system for ESs supply and demand to determine the spatial change law, matching degree, and coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the ESs. On this basis, the key areas of imbalanced supply and demand of ESs were identified, and optimization strategies were proposed. The results showed that (1) there is obvious spatial heterogeneity between ESs supply and demand in the study area, and different degrees of spatial changes occurred with urbanization. Specifically, areas with large changes were concentrated in urban core areas and economic development zones. (2) The matching degree between ESs supply and demand is quite diverse and shows a trend of polarization. Under the influence of urbanization, some cities began facing ESs supply shortages. (3) Overall, the CCD between ESs supply and demand in the study area is in a state of mild incoordination, but with increasing urbanization, some cities have turned into a state of extreme incoordination. Our results indicate that the ESs supply and demand status in some cities at the urban agglomeration scale has become increasingly severe. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on certain ""key areas"" to formulate optimization strategies. For key areas with ""low supply-high demand"" and extreme incoordination, the population and land use intensity should be controlled to reduce the ESs demand level. Meanwhile, for key areas with ""high supply-low demand"" and extreme incoordination, the utilization efficiency of ecological resources should be improved to enhance the ESs supply capacity. The results of this study will help decision-makers optimize the relationship between ESs supply and demand in order to achieve the sustainable development of urban agglomeration.","Xin, Ruhong; Skov-Petersen, Hans; Zeng, Jian; Zhou, Jianhua; Li, Kai; Hu, Jiaqi; Liu, Xiang; Kong, Jiangwei; Wang, Qianwen",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118666/,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who signed informed consent to participate in the study. The erythrocyte membrane -adrenoreactivity index (-ARM) was determined in venous blood samples upon admission to the intensive care unit, one day after admission, 6 and 12 months after the index MI was transferred using the BETA-ARM-AGAT reagent kit (Agat-Med, Russia). RESULTS According to the results of dynamics assessment of -APM during the first day, patients included in the study were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n=14) included patients who had an increase in -APM in the first day, and group 2 (n=21) included patients in whom -ARM either did not change or decreased. At the time of admission to the hospital in the formed groups, there were no differences in the -APM index and clinical and anamnestic characteristics. A day after hospitalization, the value of -APM in group 1 significantly exceeded the same indicator in group 2 (p=0.02). At the periods of 6 and 12 months, the -APM indices in the groups did not differ. In the 2nd group of patients, the progression of chronic heart failure to one or more functional classes (NYHA) was significantly more often compared with the 1st group. CONCLUSION The study showed that on the first day in patients with AMI, both an increase and a decrease in the activity of the sympathoadrenal system are possible with a further leveling of these differences over the next year. For a group of patients with decreased activity of sympathoadrenal system on the first day, a more unfavorable course of heart failure in the post-infarction period is characteristic.","Rebrova, T Y; Muslimova, E F; Alexandrenko, V A; Afanasiev, S A; Garganeeva, A A; Maksimov, I V",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720625/,13

115883,The immune response to a vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector is independent of particulate antigen secretion and protein turnover rate.,2012,"BACKGROUND There is no established noninvasive or invasive diagnostic imaging modality at present that can serve as a 'gold standard' or ""benchmark"" for the detection of the venous anomalies, indicative of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 invasive vs. 2 noninvasive imaging techniques for the detection of extracranial venous anomalies in the internal jugular veins (IJVs) and azygos vein/vertebral veins (VVs) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS The data for this multimodal imaging comparison pilot study was collected in phase 2 of the ""Prospective Randomized Endovascular therapy in Multiple Sclerosis"" (PREMiSe) study using standardized imaging techniques. Thirty MS subjects were screened initially with Doppler sonography (DS), out of which 10 did not fulfill noninvasive screening procedure requirements on DS that consisted of ≥2 venous hemodynamic extracranial criteria. Accordingly, 20 MS patients with relapsing MS were enrolled into the multimodal diagnostic imaging study. For magnetic resonance venography (MRV), IJVs abnormal findings were considered absent or pinpoint flow, whereas abnormal VVs flow was classified as absent. Abnormalities of the VVs were determined only using non-invasive testing. Catheter venography (CV) was considered abnormal when ≥50% lumen restriction was detected, while intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was considered abnormal when ≥50% restriction of the lumen or intra-luminal defects or reduced pulsatility was found. Non-invasive and invasive imaging modality comparisons between left, right and total IJVs and between the VVs and azygos vein were performed. Because there is no reliable way of non-invasively assessing the azygos vein, the VVs abnormalities detected by the non-invasive testing were compared to the azygos abnormalities detected by the invasive testing. All image modalities were analyzed in a blinded manner by more than one viewer, upon which consensus was reached. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using contingency tables denoting the presence or absence of vein-specific abnormality findings between all imaging modalities used individually as the benchmark. RESULTS The sensitivity of CV + IVUS was 68.4% for the right and 90% for the left IJV and 85.7% for the azygos vein/VVs, compared to venous anomalies detected on DS. Compared to the venous anomalies detected on MRV, the sensitivity of CV + IVUS was 71.4% in right and 100% in left IJVs and 100% in the azygos vein/VVs; however, the specificity was 38.5%, 38.9% and 11.8%, respectively. The sensitivity between the two invasive imaging techniques, used as benchmarks, ranged from 72.7% for the right IJV to 90% for the azygos vein but the IVUS showed a higher rate of venous anomalies than the CV. There was excellent correspondence between identifying collateral veins on MRV and CV. CONCLUSIONS Noninvasive DS screening for the detection of venous anomalies indicative of CCSVI may be a reliable approach for identifying patients eligible for further multimodal invasive imaging testing of the IJVs. However, the noninvasive screening methods were inadequate to depict the total amount of azygos vein/VVs anomalies identified with invasive testing. This pilot study, with limited sample size, shows that both a non-invasive and invasive multimodal imaging diagnostic approach should be recommended to depict a range of extracranial venous anomalies indicative of CCSVI. However, lack of invasive testing on the study subjects whose results were negative on the DS screening and of healthy controls, limits further generalizibility of our findings. In addition, the findings from the 2 invasive techniques confirmed the existence of severe extracranial venous anomalies that significantly impaired normal blood outflow from the brain in this group of MS patients.","Zivadinov, Robert; Karmon, Yuval; Dolic, Kresimir; Hagemeier, Jesper; Marr, Karen; Valnarov, Vesela; Kennedy, Cheryl L; Hojnacki, David; Carl, Ellen M; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca; Siddiqui, Adnan H",BMC neurology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2377-13-151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24139135/,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 38 patients with benign thyroid nodules who had received RFA and had available pre- and post-treatment CT images. Changes in the tracheal anteroposterior (AP)/transverse diameter ratio, cross-sectional tracheal area, midline deviation of the trachea, and anterior neck angle after RFA were quantitatively measured using CT. Volume reduction rates (VRRs) for the thyroid gland and nodules were measured using CT and US, respectively, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. The paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment CT-based measurements, and univariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association of VRR with the mean delivered radiofrequency energy, number of RFA sessions, and initial thyroid volume. RESULTS After RFA, the tracheal AP/transverse diameter ratio and midline deviation were significantly decreased while the tracheal area and anterior neck angle were significantly increased (all, p < 0.001). The thyroid volume reduction was also significant (VRR, 42.1% ± 21.1%, p < 0.001), with moderate consistency between the CT-based thyroid VRR and US-based nodule VRR (ICC = 0.68, 95% confidence interval = 0.38-0.83, p < 0.001). The mean delivered radiofrequency energy (p = 0.565), number of RFA sessions (p = 0.209), and initial thyroid volume (p = 0.363) showed no significant association with VRR. CONCLUSION CT-based quantitative assessments may be useful for evaluating improvements in the neck structures after RFA for benign thyroid nodules.","Choi, Yangsean; Jung, So-Lyung; Jang, Jinhee; Shin, Na-Young; Ahn, Kook-Jin; Kim, Bum-Soo","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2020.1779358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480816/,13

Modeling this within rhesus macaques is complicated because human adenoviruses, including human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5), are not endogenous to macaques. Here, we tested whether vaccination with a rhesus macaque-derived adenoviral vector (simian adenovirus 7 [SAdV-7]) enhances mucosal T cell activation within rhesus macaques. Following intramuscular SAdV-7 vaccination, we observed a pronounced increase in SAdV-7-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood and, more dramatically, in rectal mucosa tissue. Vaccination also induced a significant increase in the frequency of activated memory CD4(+) T cells in SAdV-7- and HAdV-5-vaccinated animals in the rectal mucosa but not in peripheral blood. These fluctuations within the rectal mucosa were also associated with a pronounced decrease in the relative frequency of naive resting CD4(+) T cells. Together, these results indicate that peripheral vaccination with an AdV vector can increase the activation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells, potentially providing an experimental model to further evaluate the role of host-vector interactions in increased HIV acquisition after AdV vector vaccination. IMPORTANCE The possibility that vaccination with a human adenovirus 5 vector increased mucosal T cell activation remains a central hypothesis to explain the potential enhancement of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition within the Step trial. In this study, we tested whether vaccination with a rhesus macaque-derived adenoviral vector in rhesus macaques enhances mucosal CD4(+) T cell activation, the main cell target of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV. The results showed that vaccination with an adenoviral vector indeed increases activation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells and potentially increases susceptibility to SIV infection.","Bukh, Irene; Calcedo, Roberto; Roy, Soumitra; Carnathan, Diane G; Grant, Rebecca; Qin, Qiuyue; Boyd, Surina; Ratcliffe, Sarah J; Veeder, Christin L; Bellamy, Scarlett L; Betts, Michael R; Wilson, James M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03850-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829340/,13

117759,Modular Reconfigurable DNA Origami: from 2D to 3D.,2020-09-07,"INTRODUCTION Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and ultimately fatal lung disease. One of the risk factors involved in the acquisition of IPF is viral infections, especially respiratory viruses. In the present study, we investigated the detection of respiratory viruses and the possible relationship between these viruses and IPF. METHODS This cross-sectional study was supported by the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran. A total of 40 respiratory samples (five nasopharyngeal and 35 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) were obtained from IPF patients referred to IUMS hospitals between April 2015 and December 2016. Assays were performed using the CLART Pneumovir DNA array assay, which made it possible to detect five genera of respiratory viruses simultaneously.Results/Key findings. Altogether, 22 of the 40 participants were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, rhino, corona and influenza viruses were found in 2.5 % (1/40), 7.5 % (3/40), 10 % (4/40), 2.5 % (1/40) and 0% (0/40) of cases, respectively. CONCLUSION Determining a correlation between the viruses and IPF is not an easy task, and therefore, this will require more research. In addition, the CLART Pneumovir DNA array can be considered as a useful method for simultaneous detection of several viral respiratory infections.","Keyvani, Hossein; Moghoofei, Mohsen; Bokharaei-Salim, Farah; Mostafaei, Shayan; Javad Mousavi, Seyed-Ali; Monavari, Seyed Hamidreza; Esghaei, Maryam",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.000628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068280/,13

Objective To compare functional outcomes between early and late intervention for intubation-related laryngeal injury. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study involved 29 patients with laryngeal injury resulting from endotracheal intubation who were evaluated at a tertiary care center between May 1, 2014, and June 1, 2018. Ten patients with intubation injury to the posterior glottis who received early treatment (median, 34.7 days to presentation; interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-44.8 days) were compared with 19 patients presenting with posterior glottic stenosis who received late treatment (median, 341.9 days to presentation; IQR, 132.7-376.3 days). Statistical analysis was performed from May 1 to July 1, 2019. Exposures Early intervention, defined as a procedure performed 45 days or less after intubation, and late treatment, defined as an intervention performed greater than 45 days after intubation. Main Outcomes and Measures Patient-specific and intervention-specific covariates were compared between the 2 groups, absolute differences with 95% CIs were calculated, and time to tracheostomy decannulation was compared using log-rank testing. Results The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics and a similar burden of comorbid disease. Ten patients who received early intervention (7 women [70%]; median age, 59.7 years [range, 31-72 years]; median, 34.7 days to presentation [IQR, 1.5-44.8 days]) were compared with 19 patients who received late intervention (11 women [58%]; median age, 53.8 years [range, 34-73 years]; median, 288.8 days to presentation [IQR, 132.7-376.3 days]). Nine of 10 patients (90%) who received early intervention and 11 of 19 patients (58%) who received late interventions were decannulated at last follow-up (absolute difference, 32%; 95% CI, -3% to 68%). Patients who received early treatment required fewer total interventions than patients with mature lesions (mean, 2.2 vs 11.5; absolute difference, 9.3; 95% CI, 6.4-12.1). In addition, none of the patients who received early treatment required an open procedure, whereas 17 patients (90%) with mature lesions required open procedures to pursue decannulation. Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that early intervention for patients with postintubation laryngeal injury was associated with a decreased duration of tracheostomy dependence, a higher rate of decannulation, and fewer surgical procedures compared with late intervention. Patients who underwent early intervention also avoided open reconstruction. These findings may bear relevance to the management of patients requiring extended durations of endotracheal intubation during recovery for critical illness related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.","Lowery, Anne S; Malenke, Jordan A; Bolduan, Alyssa J; Shinn, Justin; Wootten, Christopher T; Gelbard, Alexander",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.4517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507221/,13

Effective sanitation is also important in viral epizootic outbreaks and as a routine, ensuring high hygiene standards on farms. This study examined the use of ammonia at different concentrations and temperatures to disinfect hatchery waste. Inactivation kinetics of high-pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N1 and low-pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N3, as representatives of notifiable avian viral diseases, were determined in spiked hatchery waste. Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, feline coronavirus, and feline calicivirus were used as models for other important avian pathogens, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and avian hepatitis E virus. Bacteriophage MS2 was also monitored as a stable indicator. Coronavirus was the most sensitive virus, with decimal reduction (D) values of 1.2 and 0.63 h after addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) ammonia at 14 and 25°C, respectively. Under similar conditions, high-pathogenic avian influenza H7N1 was the most resistant, with D values of 3.0 and 1.4 h. MS2 was more resistant than the viruses to all treatments and proved to be a suitable indicator of viral inactivation. The results indicate that ammonia treatment of hatchery waste is efficient in inactivating enveloped and naked single-stranded RNA viruses. Based on the D values and confidence intervals obtained, guidelines for treatment were proposed, and one was successfully validated at full scale at a hatchery, with MS2 added to hatchery waste.","Emmoth, Eva; Ottoson, Jakob; Albihn, Ann; Belák, Sándor; Vinnerås, Björn",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02990-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21515734/,13

Strain measures myocardial fibre contraction and relaxation. This study aims to assess the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on functional myocardial parameters, including STE, and to identify potential differences between responders and non-responders. METHODS The study population consisted of 31 consecutive patients undergoing RDN in the context of treatment for resistant hypertension. Patients were included between December 2012 and June 2014. Transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking analysis was performed at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. RESULTS The study population consisted of 31 patients with treatment-resistant hypertension treated with RDN (mean age 64 ± 10 years, 15 men). The total study population could be divided into responders (n = 19) and non-responders (n = 12) following RDN. RDN reduced office blood pressure by 18.9 ± 26.8/8.5 ± 13.5 mmHg (p < 0.001). A significant decrease was seen in LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) (0.47 ± 1.0 mm; p = 0.020), without a significant change in the LV mass index (LVMI). In the total cohort, only peak late diastolic filling velocity (A-wave velocity) decreased significantly by 5.3 ± 13.2 cm/s (p = 0.044) and peak untwisting velocity decreased significantly by 14.5 ± 28.9°/s (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION RDN reduced blood pressure and significantly improved functional myocardial parameters such as A-wave velocity and peak untwisting velocity in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of RDN on myocardial mechanics.","Feyz, Lida; van Dalen, Bas M; Geleijnse, Marcel L; Van Mieghem, Nicolas M; van Domburg, Ron T; Daemen, Joost",Journal of echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12574-017-0336-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28497431/,13
122205,Effect of a Neuropilin-1-Derived Virus Receptor Trap on Enterovirus A71 infection in vitro.,2020-11-02,"OBJECTIVES The amino acid substitutions M1058L and S1060A in the spike protein of feline coronavirus (FCoV) have been postulated to be responsible for the development of the pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The aim of the following study was to investigate the presence of mutated virus in tissue samples of cats with and without FIP. METHODS The study population consisted of 64 cats, 34 of which were diagnosed with FIP and 30 control cats. All cases underwent autopsy, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for FCoV. Furthermore, a genotype-discriminating quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on shavings of paraffin-embedded tissues to discriminate between cats with FIP and controls, and the sensitivity and specificity of this discriminating RT-qPCR were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Specificity of genotype-discriminating RT-qPCR was 100.0% (95% CI 88.4-100.0), and sensitivity was 70.6% (95% CI 52.5-84.9). In cats with FIP, 24/34 tested positive for FIPV. In samples of three control cats and in seven cats with FIP, FCoV was found, but genotyping was not possible owing to low FCoV RNA concentrations. Out of the positive samples, 23 showed the amino acid substitution M1058L in the spike protein and none the substitution S1060A. One sample in a cat with FIP revealed a mixed population of non-mutated FCoV and FIPV (mixed genotype). For one sample genotyping was not possible despite high viral load, and two samples were negative for FCoV. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE As none of the control animals showed FCoV amino acid substitutions previously demonstrated in cats with FIP, it can be presumed that the substitution M1058L correlates with the presence of FIP. FCoV was detected in low concentration in tissues of control animals, confirming the ability of FCoV to spread systemically.

122409,Role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of herpes simplex virus superinfection in Darier's disease.,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND Stent-assisted coiling has expanded the treatment of complex wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. We present our experience with stent-assisted coiling, with an emphasis on procedure-related neurologic complications and the incidence of angiographic recurrence. METHODS A total of 480 patients with 501 aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling between January 2007 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Among the 480 patients, 423 (88%) were treated electively and 57 (11%) were treated in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were 22 (4.58%) overall procedure-related complications, which caused death in 4 patients (0.83%) and morbidity in 4 patients (0.83%). In a logistic regression analysis, the complications differed significantly among the patients with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-7.48; P = 0.03), patients with aneurysms treated with coiling before stenting (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.07-8.81; P = 0.04), and patients treated with multiple stents (OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.02-24.07; P = 0.04). Angiographic follow-up was available for 396 patients (83.4%) for a mean of 13 months. The rates of recanalization and retreatment were 13.9% and 3.5%, respectively. In a logistic analysis, larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete aneurysm occlusion were predictors of recanalization. Clinical follow-up was available for 406 patients (85.6%) for a mean of 44.8 months, and 399 patients (98.3%) achieved a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5. CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted coiling appears to be a safe and effective option for treating complex wide-necked aneurysms. Higher complication rates are associated with coiling before stenting, use of multiple stents, and hypertension. Stent delivery before coil deployment reduces the risk of procedural complications. Larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete occlusion are associated with aneurysm recanalization.","Zheng, Yongtao; Song, Yanbing; Liu, Yingjun; Xu, Qiang; Tian, Yanlong; Leng, Bing",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2016.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27424472/,13
123151,Mycophenolic acid inhibits replication of Japanese encephalitis virus.,2011,"Purpose There is no consensus on the optimal method for intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (EJ) in laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). This study aims to compare 2 established methods of EJ anastomosis in LTG. Materials and Methods A total of 314 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer that underwent LTG in the period from January 2013 to October 2016 were enrolled in the study. In 254 patients, the circular stapler with purse-string ""Lap-Jack"" method was used, and in the other 60 patients the linear stapling method was used for EJ anastomosis. After propensity score matching, 58 were matched 1:1, and retrospective data for patient characteristics, surgical outcome, and post-operative complications was reviewed. Results The 2 groups showed no significant difference in age, body mass index, or other clinicopathological characteristics. After propensity score matching analysis, the linear group had shorter operating time than the circular group (200.3±62.0 vs. 244.0±65.5, P≤0.001). Early postoperative complications in the circular and linear groups occurred in 12 (20.7%) and 15 (25.9%, P=0.660) patients, respectively. EJ leakage occurred in 3 (5.2%) patients from each group, with 1 patient from each group needing intervention of Clavien-Dindo grade III or more. Late complications were observed in 3 (5.1%) patients from the linear group only, including 1 EJ anastomosis stricture, but there was no statistical significance. Conclusions Both circular and linear stapling techniques are feasible and safe in performing intracorporeal EJ anastomosis during LTG. The linear group had shorter operative time, but there was no difference in anastomosis complications.","Kang, So Hyun; Cho, Yo-Seok; Min, Sa-Hong; Park, Young Suk; Ahn, Sang-Hoon; Park, Do Joong; Kim, Hyung-Ho",Journal of gastric cancer,https://doi.org/10.5230/jgc.2019.19.e17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245164/,13

A total of 320 laying hens (36 weeks of age) were divided into 4 treatment groups, with 10 replicates per treatment and 8 hens per replicate. They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05). Supplementation of BC or BCV in the diet resulted in a decreased abdominal fat pad (P < 0.05). In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.","Rattanawut, Jessada; Pimpa, Opart; Venkatachalam, Karthikeyan; Yamauchi, Koh-En",Tropical animal health and production,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-020-02527-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411117/,13

Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been shown to have increased vulnerability and risk to disasters due to links between racism, vulnerability, and economic power, based on disadvantage related to different disaster stages: 1) reduced perception of personal disaster risk; 2) lack of preparedness; 3) reduced access and response to warning systems; 4) increased physical impacts due to substandard housing; 5) likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes; 6) cultural insensitivity on the part of emergency workers; 7) marginalization, lower socio-economic status, and less familiarity with support resources leading to protracted recovery; and 8) diminished standard of living, job loss, and exacerbated poverty during reconstruction and community rebuilding. Moreover, given that psychiatric morbidity is predictable in populations exposed to disasters, mental health and psychosocial support programs should increasingly become a standard part of a humanitarian response. In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare. So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources. Special attention and extra resources must be directed towards vulnerable and marginalized populations. In this editorial we share lessons learned from experiencing disproportionate impact of health crisis and advocate for the notion that recovery efforts must address trauma at individual, interpersonal and community levels, and be based in a healing justice framework.","Shervington, Denese O; Richardson, Lisa",Journal of injury & violence research,https://doi.org/10.5249/jivr.v12i2.1538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361706/,13
123867,An inactivated H5N2 vaccine reduces transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus among native chickens.,2009,"PURPOSE Automatic localization of pneumonia on chest X-rays (CXRs) is highly desirable both as an interpretive aid to the radiologist and for timely diagnosis of the disease. However, pneumonia's amorphous appearance on CXRs and complexity of normal anatomy in the chest present key challenges that hinder accurate localization. Existing studies in this area are either not optimized to preserve spatial information of abnormality or depend on expensive expert annotated bounding boxes. We present a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based machine learning approach for this problem, that is weakly supervised (does not require any location annotations), was trained to retain spatial information, and can produce pixel-wise abnormality maps highlighting regions of abnormality (as opposed to bounding boxes around abnormality). METHODS Our method is based on the Wasserstein GAN framework and to the best of our knowledge, the first application of GANs to this problem. Specifically, from an abnormal CXR as input, we generated the corresponding pseudo normal CXR image as output. The pseudo normal CXR is the ""hypothetical"" normal, if the same abnormal CXR were not to have any abnormalities. We surmise that the difference between the pseudo normal and the abnormal CXR highlights the pixels suspected to have pneumonia and hence is our output abnormality map. We trained our algorithm on an ""unpaired"" dataset of abnormal and normal CXRs and did not require any location annotations such as bounding boxes/segmentations of abnormal regions. Furthermore, we incorporated additional prior knowledge/constraints into the model and showed that they help improve localization performance. We validated the model on a data set consisting of 14,184 CXRs from the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge. RESULTS We evaluated our methods by comparing the generated abnormality maps with radiologist annotated bounding boxes using ROC analysis, image similarity metrics such as normalized cross correlation/mutual information, and abnormality detection rate. We also present visual examples of the abnormality maps, covering various scenarios of abnormality occurrence. Results demonstrate the ability to highlight regions of abnormality with the best method achieving an AUC of 0.77 and a detection rate of 85%. The GAN tended to perform better as prior knowledge/constraints were incorporated into the model. CONCLUSIONS We presented a novel GAN based approach for localizing pneumonia on chest X-rays that 1) does not require expensive hand annotated location ground truth; 2) was trained to produce abnormality maps at the pixel level as opposed to bounding boxes. We demonstrated the efficacy of our methods via quantitative and qualitative results.","Keshavamurthy, Krishna Nand; Eickhoff, Carsten; Juluru, Krishna",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.15185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459001/,13

124213,Inhibition of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2α Impairs an Early Step of Coronavirus Replication in Cell Culture.,2018,"Obesity is considered a worldwide health problem of epidemic proportions. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity, resulting in improved obesity-related co-morbidities and increased overall life expectancy. However, weight recidivism has been observed in a subset of patients post-bariatric surgery. Weight recidivism has significant medical, societal and economic ramifications. Unfortunately, there is a very limited understanding of how to predict which bariatric surgical patients are more likely to regain weight following surgery and how to appropriately treat patients who have regained weight. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the existing literature to assess the incidence and causative factors associated with weight regain following bariatric surgery. An electronic literature search was performed of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane library databases along with the PubMed US national library from January 1950 to December 2012 to identify relevant articles. Following an initial screen of 2,204 titles, 1,437 abstracts were reviewed and 1,421 met exclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were included in this analysis: seven case series, five surveys and four non-randomized controlled trials, with a total of 4,864 patients for analysis. Weight regain in these patients appeared to be multi-factorial and overlapping. Aetiologies were categorized as patient specific (psychiatric, physical inactivity, endocrinopathies/metabolic and dietary non-compliance) and operation specific. Weight regain following bariatric surgery varies according to duration of follow-up and the bariatric surgical procedure performed. The underlying causes leading to weight regain are multi-factorial and related to patient- and procedure-specific factors. Addressing post-surgical weight regain requires a systematic approach to patient assessment focusing on contributory dietary, psychologic, medical and surgical factors.","Karmali, Shahzeer; Brar, Balpreet; Shi, Xinzhe; Sharma, Arya M; de Gara, Christopher; Birch, Daniel W",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-1070-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23996349/,13

124422,"High-throughput, luciferase-based reverse genetics systems for identifying inhibitors of Marburg and Ebola viruses.",2014,"OBJECTIVE Dynamic horizontal instability is considered to be the main reason for poor outcome after treatment for acromioclavicular (ac) joint instability. In this study, we describe a simple technique to quantify this pathology via sonography. METHODS Thirty-six shoulders from 18 patients with ac joint instabilities were examined using modified Alexander views and a standardized sonographic examination. On the Alexander views, overlap of acromion and clavicle (OLAC), glenoid center to posterior clavicle distance (GCPC), and lateral extension (LE) were measured. Afterwards, the results were analyzed and compared with sonography. Posterior translation of the clavicle and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder were evaluated. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 39 ± 14 years (range 19-61 years). We included 4 (22%) Rockwood type 3, 1 (6%) Rockwood type 4, and 13 (72%) Rockwood type 5 lesions. Four (22%) patients were female and 14 (78%) male patients. Posterior clavicle translation of the injured shoulder correlated strongly between OLAC and sonography (r = -0.514, P = .029), and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder correlated very strongly between LE and sonography (r = 0.737, P < .001). CONCLUSION The sonographic measurement technique for horizontal instability presented in this work could help detect horizontal instabilities. While the observation of dynamic horizontal displacement is a strength of this technique, measurements are hindered in cases of high coracoclavicular distances.

BACKGROUND Research-based practice relies on agile and nimble methods to investigate, evaluate, and apply research in project work. This requires the ability to scale methodologies, so they can provide actionable insights in often constrained time lines. Surveys, observations, space analytics, and lit reviews often need to be done in extremely short periods of time. In this article, we share how these processes can be condensed to meet time constraints of project time lines, with the critical reminder not to generalize contextually derived insights. CONCLUSION Combining field research (shadowing and behavior mapping) with user engagement (interviews), user feedback (surveys), and analytics of the plan itself allows designers and owners to understand the relationship between design intent and operational outcome and be resource effective in capital planning projects. Scaling these methods to fit the time and resource availability, and ensuring that results are always reviewed and applied in context, is critical.","Nanda, Upali; Wingler, Deborah",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/1937586720945176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772717/,13

METHODS The review was conducted in accordance with the (PRISMA) guidelines. Five databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials from inception to May 2016. Studies were required to compare a psychological intervention delivered by physiotherapists combined with physiotherapy to physiotherapy alone or usual care. Physiotherapists delivering the interventions must have undergone training by a psychologist or a health professional trained in the delivery of psychological interventions. RESULTS A total of 34 articles met the eligibility criteria, of those, 30 were suitable for meta-analysis. There was low to high quality evidence that physiotherapist delivered psychological intervention combined with physiotherapy decreased pain in the short (26 studies, mean difference=-0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.65 to -0.09) and long term (22 studies, mean difference=-0.38; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.10) and decreased disability in the short term (29 studies, standardized mean difference =-0.14; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.01). Effect sizes were small. Low to high quality evidence demonstrated small to medium effects for some psychological outcomes at short-term and long-term follow-ups.

125599,Effects of inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells and intestinal dendritic cells.,2016,"INTRODUCTION The nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFRT) is a promising tool to monitor analgesia during general anaesthesia. Clinical studies have shown that the NFRT allows to predict movement responses to painful stimuli under a combined anaesthetic regime of sedative and opioid agents. Experimental studies indicated that the NFRT is also able to predict such movement responses under an exclusively sedative regime like propofol mono-anaesthesia. Therefore, we performed this study to investigate the ability of the NFRT to predict movement responses to painful stimuli in patients during a clinical propofol mono-anaesthesia. METHODS We investigated 140 cardiac surgery patients during their postoperative phase under propofol mono-anaesthesia. NFRT and bispectral index (BIS) were determined in each patient right before endotracheal suctioning or painful electrical test stimulation. Prediction probabilities were calculated to quantify how accurate each measure is able to predict movement responses to the stimuli. RESULTS The 124 patients included in the analysis received a median propofol dosage of 3.2 (2.5-3.9) [median (IQR)] mg/kg/h. The included patients showed 287 movement responses after a total of 725 investigated stimuli. The prediction probabilities for positive movement responses were 0.63 (95%CI: 0.59-0.67) for the NFRT and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.65-0.73) for the BIS. CONCLUSIONS The NFRT allows the prediction of movement responses under propofol mono-anaesthesia, which confirms its utility as a monitor to predict movement responses under general anaesthesia. The BIS allows an even more accurate prediction, although it does not reflect the physiological structures of movement suppression, but correlates closely with the dose of propofol.

We wanted to examine correlations between a selection of sociodemographic variables and infection rates in Oslo's districts. MATERIAL AND METHOD Aggregated data on districts obtained from Oslo City Government's statistics database were collated with cumulative figures for PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 as of 3 December 2020. We selected some variables from the living conditions indicators that showed a strong correlation with infection rates. The composite variable 'socioeconomic status' included income, education and labour market attachment. 'Household density' included the proportion of people in cramped living conditions and multi-family households. We performed an unadjusted and adjusted standard multiple linear regression analysis of the impact of immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density on infection rates. RESULTS Immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density were all associated with infection rates in the districts. Pearson's correlation coefficients (95 % CI) were 0.97 (0.93 to 0.99), -0.93 (-0.97 to -0.86) and 0.88 (0.77 to 0.98) respectively, all with p <0.001. In the adjusted model, immigrant ratio was still associated with the infection rate, B = 3.95 (2.16 to 5.73), p <0.001, however there was no longer a statistically significant association between socioeconomic status or household density and infection rates. INTERPRETATION Immigrant ratio seems to be an important risk factor for infection in Oslo. Our analysis suggests that the correlation may be due to factors other than low socioeconomic status and high household density.","Søegaard, Erik Ganesh Iyer; Kan, Zhanna","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.1022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876617/,13
126691,GANP-mediated recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase to cell nuclei and to immunoglobulin variable region DNA.,2010,"Development and improvement of quality control tests for live attenuated vaccines are a high priority because of safety concerns. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) viruses are 6:2 reassortants containing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments from circulating influenza viruses to induce protective immune responses, and the six internal gene segments from a cold-adapted Master Donor Virus (MDV). LAIV candidate viruses for the 2012-2013 seasons, A/Victoria/361/2011-CDC-LV1 (LV1) and B/Texas/06/2011-CDC-LV2B (LV2B), were created by classical reassortment of A/Victoria/361/2011 and MDV-A A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) or B/Texas/06/2011 and MDV-B B/USSR/60/69. In an attempt to provide better identity and stability testing for quality control of LV1 and LV2B, sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays (rRT-PCR) were developed to detect the presence of undesired gene segments (HA and NA from MDV and the six internal genes from the seasonal influenza viruses). The sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays designed for each gene segment ranged from 0.08 to 0.8EID50 (50% of Egg Infectious Dose) per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV1 and from 0.1 to 1EID50 per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV2B. No undesired genes were detected either before or after five passages of LV1 or LV2B in eggs. The complete genome sequencing of LV1 and LV2B confirmed the results of rRT-PCR, demonstrating the utility of the new rRT-PCR assays to provide the evidence for the homogeneity of the prepared vaccine candidate.","Shcherbik, Svetlana; Sergent, Sheila B; Davis, William G; Shu, Bo; Barnes, John; Kiseleva, Irina; Larionova, Natalie; Klimov, Alexander; Bousse, Tatiana",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056261/,13

The aim of this study is to describe laboratory findings in a group of Italian COVID-19 patients in the area of Valcamonica, and correlate abnormalities with disease severity. Methods The final study population consisted of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (70 who died during hospital stay and 74 who survived and could be discharged) between March 1 and 30, 2020, in Valcamonica Hospital. Demographical, clinical and laboratory data were collected upon hospital admission and were then correlated with outcome (i.e. in-hospital death vs. discharge). Results Compared to patients who could be finally discharged, those who died during hospital stay displayed significantly higher values of serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hscTnI), prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and leukocytes (especially neutrophils), whilst values of albumin, hemoglobin and lymphocytes were significantly decreased. In multiple regression analysis, LDH, CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, albumin, APTT and age remained significant predictors of in-hospital death. A regression model incorporating these variables explained 80% of overall variance of in-hospital death. Conclusions The most important laboratory abnormalities described here in a subset of European COVID-19 patients residing in Valcamonica are highly predictive of in-hospital death and may be useful for guiding risk assessment and clinical decision-making.","Bonetti, Graziella; Manelli, Filippo; Patroni, Andrea; Bettinardi, Alessandra; Borrelli, Gianluca; Fiordalisi, Gianfranco; Marino, Antonio; Menolfi, Annamaria; Saggini, Sara; Volpi, Roberta; Anesi, Adriano; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573995/,13

129638,Why does the novel Coronavirus Spike Protein interact so strongly with the human ACE2? A thermodynamic answer.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Sofosbuvir (SOF) based interferon-alfa free antiviral therapy has become the treatment of choice for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Little is known about safety of drug combinations using two nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors in patients with HCV associated advanced cirrhosis. Here, we report frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis associated with acute-on-chronic hepatic decompensation during ribavirin (RBV) plus SOF based antiviral therapy. METHODS Thirty-five patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, and decompensated cirrhosis without and after liver transplantation were treated with SOF based antiviral therapy with and without RBV. Adverse events including lactic acidosis (pH <7.35, lactate >20 mg/dl) were recorded 24 weeks before and during (mean ±SD, 18±11 weeks) antiviral therapy. Efficacy was determined by assessment of serum HCV RNA. RESULTS We observed severe adverse events in 15/35 (43%) patients before (24 weeks) and in 12/35 (34%) patients during antiviral therapy, the majority in association with acute-on-chronic hepatic decompensation. Lactic acidosis occurred in 5/35 (14%) patients during therapy, while no event of lactic acidosis was observed prior to therapy. Lactic acidosis was associated with hepatic decompensation including renal failure and infection, and was severe (pH <7.3) in two patients. CONCLUSIONS RBV in combination with SOF based antiviral therapy in patients with HCV associated advanced cirrhosis may be associated with the development of lactic acidosis. Impaired renal function, and higher MELD/Child-Pugh scores were identified as potential risk factors.","Welker, Martin-Walter; Luhne, Stefan; Lange, Christian M; Vermehren, Johannes; Farnik, Harald; Herrmann, Eva; Welzel, Tania; Zeuzem, Stefan; Sarrazin, Christoph",Journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2015.11.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658684/,13

Seizures or neurological deficits are additional risks, particularly when associated with an encephalocele. Surgical repair of the dural defect through a middle cranial fossa (MCF) approach is a treatment option under these circumstances. This series describes eight individuals who presented with CSF otorrhea and MCF encephaloceles associated with conductive hearing loss. Defects in the tegmen tympani were noted in all patients on preoperative cranial imaging, and six of the eight patients had an associated encephalocele. The average age was 57 years (range 26 to 67) with a male:female ratio of 7:1. Most defects occurred on the left side (6 left/2 right). A standard MCF approach and repair of the dural defect with an autologous dural graft (Durepair or DuraGen, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and a synthetic polymer glue (DuraSeal, Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was performed in each case with universal success. Resolution of the CSF otorrhea was noted in all cases. All cases but one exhibited an improvement in hearing. One patient developed a delayed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis 3 months after surgery that resolved with surgical re-exploration and antibiotic therapy. Facial nerve monitoring was standard. All patients exhibited normal facial function postoperatively. Prophylactic lumbar drain placement was only utilized in the first three patients. The MCF approach is an excellent route to effectively repair CSF leaks and encephaloceles due to tegmen tympani and dural defects.","Braca, John A; Marzo, Sam; Prabhu, Vikram C","Journal of neurological surgery.

129758,Toll-like receptor (TLR)21 signalling-mediated antiviral response against avian influenza virus infection correlates with macrophage recruitment and nitric oxide production.,2017,"Purpose COVID-19 has shifted models of health care delivery, requiring the rapid adoption of telehealth, despite limited evidence and few resources to guide speech-language pathologists. Management of dysarthria presents specific challenges in the telehealth modality. Evaluations of dysarthria typically rely heavily on perceptual judgments, which are difficult to obtain via telehealth given a variety of technological factors such as inconsistencies in mouth-to-microphone distance, changes to acoustic properties based on device settings, and possible interruptions in connection that may cause video freezing. These factors limit the validity, reliability, and clinicians' certainty of perceptual speech ratings via telehealth. Thus, objective measures to supplement the assessment of dysarthria are essential. Method This tutorial outlines how to obtain objective measures in real time and from recordings of motor speech evaluations to support traditional perceptual ratings in telehealth evaluations of dysarthria. Objective measures include pause patterns, utterance length, speech rate, diadochokinetic rates, and overall speech severity. We demonstrate, through clinical case vignettes, how these measures were completed following three clinical telehealth evaluations of dysarthria conducted via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tutorial describes how each of these objective measures were utilized, in combination with subjective perceptual analysis, to determine deviant speech characteristics and their etiology, develop a patient-specific treatment plan, and track change over time. Conclusion Utilizing objective measures as an adjunct to perceptual ratings for telehealth dysarthria evaluations is feasible under real-world pandemic conditions and can be used to enhance the quality and utility of these evaluations.","Sevitz, Jordanna S; Kiefer, Brianna R; Huber, Jessica E; Troche, Michelle S",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_ajslp-20-00243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689471/,13

Advances in the area of prospective MuSC isolation demonstrated the potential of cell transplantation therapy as a regenerative medicine strategy to restore strength and long-term regenerative capacity to aged, injured, or diseased skeletal muscle tissue. However, cell loss during ejection, limits to post-injection proliferation, and poor donor cell dispersion distal to the injection site are amongst hurdles to overcome to maximize MuSC transplant impact. Here, we assess a physical blend of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) as a bioactive, shear thinning hydrogel cell delivery system to improve MuSC transplantation efficiency. Using in vivo transplantation studies, we found that the HAMC delivery system results in a >45% increase in the number of donor-derived fibers as compared to saline delivery. We demonstrate that increases in donor-derived fibers when using HAMC are attributed to increased MuSC proliferation via a CD44-independent mechanism, preventing injected cell active clearance, and supporting in vivo expansion by delaying differentiation. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in donor fiber dispersion when MuSCs were delivered in HAMC. Our study results suggest that HAMC is a promising muscle stem cell delivery vehicle.","Davoudi, Sadegh; Chin, Chih-Ying; Cooke, Michael J; Tam, Roger Y; Shoichet, Molly S; Gilbert, Penney M",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738956/,13

This practice tends to inflate the apparent benefits of interventions with a high risk of mortality. Assessing a composite QoL-death outcome is a potential solution to this problem. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) on a composite endpoint consisting of the occurrence of death or a clinically meaningful decline in QoL defined as an increase of at least eight points in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial. METHODS In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema randomized to receive medical treatment (n = 610) or LVRS (n = 608), we analyzed the survival to the composite endpoint, the hazard functions and constructed prediction models of the slope of QoL decline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The time to the composite endpoint was longer in the LVRS group (2 years) than the medical treatment group (1 year) (P < 0.0001). It was even longer in the subsets of patients undergoing LVRS without a high risk for perioperative death and with upper-lobe-predominant emphysema. The hazard for the composite event significantly favored the LVRS group, although it was most significant in patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema. The beneficial impact of LVRS on QoL decline was most significant during the 2 years after LVRS. CONCLUSIONS LVRS has a significant effect on the composite QoL-survival endpoint tested, indicating its meaningful palliative role, particularly in patients with upper-lobe-predominant emphysema.","Benzo, Roberto; Farrell, Max H; Chang, Chung-Chou H; Martinez, Fernando J; Kaplan, Robert; Reilly, John; Criner, Gerard; Wise, Robert; Make, Barry; Luketich, James; Fishman, Alfred P; Sciurba, Frank C",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200809-1383oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19483114/,13

The data is in the form of absolute numbers and proportions. Using the percentages, retrospective synthetic data of 100 survivors and 100 deaths were generated using random number libraries so that proportions of ages, genders, co-morbidities, and occupations were constant as in the original data. Logistic regression of the four predictor factors of age, sex, co-morbidities and occupation revealed that only age and comorbidities significantly affected mortality. Sex and occupation when adjusted for other factors in the equation were not significant predictors of mortality. Age and presence of co-morbidities correlated negatively with survival with co-efficient of -1.23 and -2.33 respectively. Odds ratio (OR) for dying from COVID-19 for every 10-year increase in age was 3.4 compared to the previous band of 10 years. OR for dying of COVID-19 was 10.3 for the presence of any of the co-morbidities.

As tumor cells secrete proteins into the extracellular environment, some of these proteins reach circulation and could become suitable biomarkers for improving diagnosis or monitoring response to treatment. As many signaling pathways and interaction networks are altered in cancerous tissues by protein phosphorylation, changes in the secretory phosphoproteome of cancer tissues could reflect both disease progression and subtype. To test this hypothesis, we compared the phosphopeptide-enriched fractions obtained from proteins secreted into conditioned media (CM) derived from five luminal and five basal type breast cancer cell lines using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. Altogether over 5000 phosphosites derived from 1756 phosphoproteins were identified, several of which have the potential to qualify as phosphopeptide plasma biomarker candidates for the more aggressive basal and also the luminal-type breast cancers. The analysis of phosphopeptides from breast cancer patient plasma and controls allowed us to construct a discovery list of phosphosites under rigorous collection conditions, and second to qualify discovery candidates generated from the CM studies. Indeed, a set of basal-specific phosphorylation CM site candidates derived from IBP3, CD44, OPN, FSTL3, LAMB1, and STC2, and luminal-specific candidates derived from CYTC and IBP5 were selected and, based on their presence in plasma, quantified across all cell line CM samples using Skyline MS1 intensity data. Together, this approach allowed us to assemble a set of novel cancer subtype specific phosphopeptide candidates for subsequent biomarker verification and clinical validation.","Zawadzka, Anna M; Schilling, Birgit; Cusack, Michael P; Sahu, Alexandria K; Drake, Penelope; Fisher, Susan J; Benz, Christopher C; Gibson, Bradford W",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m113.035485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505115/,13

Currently available EBVS instruments use a scissor-like jaw configuration and closing mechanism, which causes decreasing compression pressure from the proximal to the distal end of the jaws. A new EBVS system is described here which utilizes a different instrument jaw configuration and closing mechanism to enable a more homogeneous pressure distribution despite longer instrument jaws. METHODS Results of jaw pressure distribution measurements as well as sealing experiments with subsequent burst pressure measurements ex vivo on bovine uterine arteries are demonstrated. Furthermore, an in vivo evaluation of the new EBVS system in a canine and porcine model including histological examination is presented. RESULTS The device revealed an even pressure distribution throughout the whole jaw length. The ex vivo burst pressure measurements revealed high average burst pressures, above 300 mmHg, independent of the outer diameter (1 to 7 mm) of the tested vessels. Histological evaluation of sealed vessels 21 days postoperatively demonstrated sealed and fused vessels without adjacent tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS The even pressure distribution leading to a sufficient tissue sealing in combination with the novel closing mechanism and extended jaw length differentiates the novel device from other available EBVS systems. This might offer a reduction of the overall procedure time, which should be further evaluated in a clinical study.","Eick, Stefan; Loudermilk, Brandon; Walberg, Erik; Wente, Moritz N",Annals of surgical innovation and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-1164-7-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24325831/,13

We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand why patients make, and sometimes regret, treatment decisions. METHOD We conducted longitudinal semi-structured interviews at the time of surgery and six months later with 20 patients from 13 UK hospitals. Framework analysis was performed, and themes mapped to: (1) the coping in deliberation framework; (2) an acceptability framework. Results were triangulated with those from structured survey instruments evaluating Shared Decision Making (SDM, best=9) at baseline and Decision Regret (DR, most regret=100) at six months. RESULTS Nine of 20 patients were not offered a choice of treatment, but this was not necessarily seen as negative (SDM median: 4; range: 2-4). Factors that influenced decision making included previous experience and anticipated recovery time. Median (range) DR was 5 (0-50). Those with the highest DR (scores 40-50) were, paradoxically, also amongst the highest scores on SDM (scores 4). Burden of wound care and the disparity between anticipated and actual recovery time were the main reasons for decision regret. CONCLUSION To minimise regret about surgical decisions, people with PSD need better information about the burden of wound care and the risks of recurrence associated with different surgical approaches.","Strong, Emily; Callaghan, Tia; Beal, Erin; Moffatt, Christine; Wickramasekera, Nyantara; Brown, Steven; Lee, Matthew J; Winton, Catherine; Hind, Daniel",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645880/,13

METHODS Prospectively enrolled patients underwent baseline MRI and started endovascular therapy within 12 h of stroke onset. The final angiogram was given a primary arterial occlusive lesion (AOL) recanalization score (0-3), a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score (0-3) and a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score (0-3). The scores were dichotomized into poor revascularization (AOL 0-2, TIMI 0-1 and TICI 0-2a) versus good revascularization (AOL 3, TIMI 2-3, TICI 2b-3). Patients were classified according to whether or not they had target mismatch (TMM). Good outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. RESULTS Endovascular treatment was attempted in 100. A good outcome was achieved in 57% of patients with a TICI score of 2b-3 and in 24% of patients with a TICI score of 0-2a (p=0.001). Patients with TIMI scores of 2-3 and an AOL score of 3 had lower rates of good outcome (44% and 47%, respectively), which were not significantly better than those with TIMI scores of 0-1 or AOL scores of 0-2. In patients with TMM, these rates of good outcome improved with all the scoring systems and were significantly better for TIMI and TICI scores. Patients with a TICI score of 2a had rates of good functional outcome and lesion growth which were not different from those with TICI scores of 0-1 but were significantly worse than those with TICI scores of 2b-3. CONCLUSIONS TIMI 2-3 and TICI 2b-3 reperfusion scores demonstrated improved outcome in patients with tissue mismatch with a small infarct core and a larger hypoperfused region but AOL scores did not. Patients with a TICI score of 2a had a poorer outcome and more lesion growth than those with TICI scores of 2b-3.","Marks, Michael P; Lansberg, Maarten G; Mlynash, Michael; Kemp, Stephanie; McTaggart, Ryan; Zaharchuk, Greg; Bammer, Roland; Albers, Gregory W",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24353330/,13

Oral health inequalities arise from a complex web of health determinants, including social, behavioral, economic, genetic, environmental, and health system factors. Eliminating these inequalities cannot be accomplished in isolation of oral health from overall health, or without recognizing that oral health is influenced at multiple individual, family, community, and health systems levels. For several reasons, this is an opportune time for global efforts targeted at reducing oral health inequalities. Global health is increasingly viewed not just as a humanitarian obligation, but also as a vehicle for health diplomacy and part of the broader mission to reduce poverty, build stronger economies, and strengthen global security. Despite the global economic recession, there are trends that portend well for support of global health efforts: increased globalization of research and development, growing investment from private philanthropy, an absolute growth of spending in research and innovation, and an enhanced interest in global health among young people.

135680,X-ray induced photoreduction of heme metal centers rapidly induces active site perturbations in a protein-independent manner.,2020-07-28,"OBJECTIVE This is the first clinical series using the Tissue Apposition System (TAS) device in a feasibility study of polypectomy as an alternative to laparoscopic colectomy (LC) for endoscopically unresectable polyps. TAS is a novel T-tag system for endoscopic placement of sutures, facilitating closure of larger defects from advanced endoluminal or transluminal endoscopic procedures. Such novel instrumentation may reduce risk and accelerate recovery. METHODS After institutional review board approval, patients with endoscopically unresectable polyps who would otherwise require LC were enrolled. The polyp site was visualized by colonoscopy and resected with laparoscopic assistance, using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or submucosal dissection. After confirming benign disease by frozen section, the polypectomy site was closed by TAS under laparoscopic observation to avoid injury to surrounding structures. Follow-up colonoscopy was performed at 3 months. RESULTS Seven patients were recruited (5 men; mean age, 66 years). Polyps were from 20 to 50 (mean, 30) mm in diameter; six were in the right colon, and three were on the mesenteric border of the bowel. All final pathology was benign. Mean EMR time was 29 min, mean time taken for TAS was 37 min, and mean total operative time was 199 min. Two TAS procedures required conversion to LC (one unresectable polyp and one device failure). Five TAS procedures were completed, with a mean hospital stay of 1.2 days, and no complications. Follow-up colonoscopy revealed healing without polyp recurrence in any case. One patient (initial 5-cm sigmoid polyp) developed a very mild clinically asymptomatic stricture in the sigmoid colon. CONCLUSIONS This initial human experience demonstrates that TAS can be used safely in the colon under laparoscopic control. TAS permits safe closure of defects after endoscopic polypectomy of selected and otherwise unresectable polyps. Such technology may potentially avoid the need for LC and permit rapid recovery with short hospital stay.","Delaney, C P; Champagne, B J; Marks, J M; Sanuk, L; Ermlich, B; Chak, A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1098-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490565/,13
135712,"A strain of porcine deltacoronavirus: genomic characterization, pathogenicity and its full-length cDNA infectious clone.",2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND Limited data are available in Honduras that describe the etiology and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in rural outpatient settings. Better data may lead to improved therapeutic and preventive strategies. The goal of our study was to determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in a rural Honduran population of children. METHODS Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify children < 5 years of age presenting with respiratory symptoms of < 5 days duration. We obtained data on age, sex, medical history, breastfeeding history, symptoms, risk factors, household setting, temperature, respiratory rate and chest examination findings. To assess the association between specific viruses and weather, regional meteorological data were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel. RESULTS From February 2010 through June 2011, 345 children < 5 years of age were enrolled; 17%, 23%, 30% and 31% were <6, 6-11, 12-23 and 24-60 months old, respectively. Including all clinics in the region, 44.5% of patients < 5 years of age with documented respiratory diagnoses were enrolled. At least 1 virus was identified in 75.4% children, of which 7.5% were coinfections; 13.3% were positive for parainfluenza, 11.9% for influenza, 8.1% for human metapneumovirus and 7.5% for respiratory syncytial virus. Rainfall correlated with parainfluenza (P < 0.0001), influenza (P < 0.0001), human metapneumovirus (P = 0.0182) and respiratory syncytial virus (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the spectrum of viruses in ill, rural, Honduran children is similar to that in North and Central America, although the seasonality is typical of some tropical regions.","Schlaudecker, Elizabeth P; Heck, Joan P; Macintyre, Elizabeth T; Martinez, Ruben; Dodd, Caitlin N; McNeal, Monica M; Staat, Mary A; Heck, Jeffery E; Steinhoff, Mark C",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31826052eb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22653487/,13

This pre-specified analysis included Japanese patients in PINNACLE-4. METHODS In this double-blind randomized study (NCT02343458), patients received GFF MDI (18/9.6 μg), glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI (18 μg), formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI (9.6 μg), or placebo MDI twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) over Weeks 12-24. Secondary lung function endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, and safety were assessed. The Japanese subpopulation (n = 150) analyses were exploratory. RESULTS GFF MDI improved change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over Weeks 12-24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean [LSM] differences [95% confidence interval]: 69 [8-131], 60 [-1 to 121], and 275 [180-370] mL, respectively). GFF MDI numerically improved Transition Dyspnea Index focal score and change from baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score versus placebo MDI (LSM differences 0.19 and -3.78, respectively). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in ≤4.5% of patients in any treatment group. CONCLUSIONS GFF MDI improved lung function versus monocomponents and placebo MDI in the Japan subpopulation of PINNACLE-4. The efficacy and safety results were generally consistent with those of the global study population, supporting the use of GFF MDI in Japanese patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD.","Gon, Yasuhiro; Nishi, Koichi; Sato, Kazuhiro; Maes, Andrea; Siddiqui, Shahid; Hayashi, Nobuya; Hirata, Hajime; Martin, Ubaldo J; Reisner, Colin",Respiratory investigation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2020.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917556/,13

This review examines the various forms of psychological distress experienced by EVD survivors, family and community reactions to EVD survivors and EVD survivors' coping mechanisms. METHODS We conducted a literature search of original articles employing Medline (Ovid), PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, EBSCO host academic search complete, PsycINFO (EBSCO) and Embase databases. RESULTS Our search identified 1890 articles of which 24 met our inclusion criteria. Various forms of psychological distress were prevalent among EVD survivors including depression, anxiety, anger, grief, guilt, flashbacks, sadness, worthlessness, substance addiction, suicidal tendencies and self-stigmatisation. Family and community responses to EVD survivors ranged from acceptance to rejection, isolation, stigmatisation and discrimination. EVD survivors' coping strategies included engagement with religious faith, EVD survivors associations and involvement in EVD prevention and control interventions. CONCLUSION Psychological distress, including that resulting from family and community stigma and discrimination, appears common among EVD survivors. Community-based mental health and psychosocial interventions integrated within a broader package of care for EVD survivors that also recognises the physical health challenges are required. Well-designed longitudinal studies can provide clear insights on the nature and trajectory of the psychosocial issues currently experienced by EVD survivors.","James, P B; Wardle, J; Steel, A; Adams, J",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30843627/,13

Current treatments to reduce the risk of haemorrhage include tumour extirpation, angio-embolization, or ablative therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Review of our prospective database revealed 15 patients with intraoperative biopsy confirmed renal AML undergoing RFA from February 2002 to March 2010. Patients underwent either laparoscopic or computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA using either the Cool-tip™ (Covidien, Inc. Boulder, CO, USA) or RITA™ (Angiodynamics(®), Latham, NY, USA) RFA probe. CT at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. RESULTS In all, two male and 13 female patients with seven left-sided and eight right-sided tumours with a mean (range) size of 2.6 (1.0-3.7) cm underwent laparoscopic (five) or CT-guided (10) RFA. No intraoperative complications occurred. Minor complications included transient haematuria and intercostals nerve transection. Surgical complications included pneumonia and myocardial infarction. There was no radiographic evidence of persistent AML (CT enhancement) at a mean follow-up of 21 months. CONCLUSIONS The haemostatic effect of RFA allows renal lesions suspicious for AML to be treated without bleeding complications. Avoids surgical risk of extirpation or embolization. RFA for renal AML is safe and effective.","Castle, Scott M; Gorbatiy, Vladislav; Ekwenna, Obi; Young, Ezekiel; Leveillee, Raymond J",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10376.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22176671/,13
138740,Development of an Aryloxazole Class of Hepatitis C Virus Inhibitors Targeting the Entry Stage of the Viral Replication Cycle.,2017,"Plasmids remain important microbial components mediating the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. To systematically explore the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), a novel strategy using single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was developed. This approach was applied to pooled conjugative plasmids from clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary referral hospital over a 9-month period. The conjugative plasmid pool was obtained from transconjugants that acquired antimicrobial resistance after plasmid conjugation with 53 clinical isolates. The plasmid pool was then subjected to SMRT sequencing, and 82 assembled plasmid fragments were obtained. In total, 124 ARGs (responsible for resistance to β-lactam, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside, among others) and 317 MGEs [including transposons (Tns), insertion sequences (ISs), and integrons] were derived from these fragments. Most of these ARGs were linked to MGEs, allowing for the establishment of a relationship network between MGEs and/or ARGs that can be used to describe the dissemination of resistance by mobile elements. Key elements involved in resistance transposition were identified, including IS26, Tn3, IS903B, ISEcp1, and ISKpn19. As the most predominant IS in the network, a typical IS26-mediated multicopy composite transposition event was illustrated by tracing its flanking 8-bp target site duplications (TSDs). The landscape of the pooled plasmid sequences highlights the diversity and complexity of the relationship between MGEs and ARGs, underpinning the clinical value of dominant HGT profiles.","Jiang, Yan; Wang, Yanfei; Hua, Xiaoting; Qu, Yue; Peleg, Anton Y; Yu, Yunsong","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2020.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385612/,13

However, laparoscopic total gastrectomy for cancer remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine an initial experience with laparoscopic total gastrectomy. METHODS Medical records of 16 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy between September 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed in a retrospective manner. Esophagojejunostomy was completed using a transorally delivered anvil, with double-stapled esophageal anastomosis. RESULTS There were no conversions to open procedures. Two patients (12.5%) required extended resections with en bloc distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, one of whom also underwent transverse colectomy. The median lymph node count for patients who underwent D2 lymphadenectomy (n = 12) for gastric adenocarcinoma was 31. There were no perioperative deaths and the median length of stay was 8 days. There were no anastomotic leaks, but three patients developed anastomotic strictures amenable to dilatation. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive total gastrectomy can be performed safely and with adequate lymphadenectomy.

140687,A17 Molecular characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolated from chronic hepatitis B patients in South Vietnam.,2017,"BACKGROUND Tissue oximetry using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive monitor of cerebral oxygenation. This new technology has been used during cardiac arrest (CA) because of its ability to give measures in low-blood-flow situations. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence regarding the association between the types of NIRS measurements (mean, initial, and highest values) and resuscitation outcomes (return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC], survival to discharge, and good neurologic outcome) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS This review was registered (Prospero CRD42015017380) and is reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched. All studies, except case reports and case series of fewer than five patients, reporting on adults that had NIRS monitoring during CA were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included articles and extracted the data. The outcome effect was standardized using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Twenty nonrandomized observational studies (15 articles and five conference abstracts) were included in this review, for a total of 2,436 patients. We found a stronger association between ROSC and mean NIRS values (SMD = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.74) than between ROSC and initial NIRS measurements (SMD = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.78). There was too much heterogeneity among the highest NIRS measurements group to perform meta-analysis. Only two of the 75 patients who experienced ROSC had a mean NIRS saturation under 30%. Patients who survived to discharge and who had good neurologic outcome displayed superior combined initial and mean NIRS values than their counterparts (SMD = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.34 to 1.92; and SMD = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.14 to 3.10). CONCLUSIONS Patients with good resuscitation outcomes have significantly higher NIRS saturations during resuscitation than their counterparts. The types of NIRS measurements during resuscitation influenced the association between ROSC and NIRS saturation. Prolonged failure to obtain a NIRS saturation higher than 30% may be included in a multimodal approach to the decision of terminating resuscitation efforts (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C-Limited Data).","Cournoyer, Alexis; Iseppon, Massimiliano; Chauny, Jean-Marc; Denault, André; Cossette, Sylvie; Notebaert, Éric",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.12980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028004/,13

The virus was detected in 11 (8.1%) of 136 rabbit fecal samples by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), with a viral load of up to 10(8) copies/ml. RbCoV HKU14 was able to replicate in HRT-18G and RK13 cells with cytopathic effects. Northern blotting confirmed the production of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the HE, S, NS5a, E, M, and N proteins. Subgenomic mRNA analysis revealed a transcription regulatory sequence, 5'-UCUAAAC-3'. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct branch among Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, being most closely related to but separate from the species Betacoronavirus 1. A comparison of the conserved replicase domains showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed <90% amino acid identities to most members of Betacoronavirus 1 in ADP-ribose 1″-phosphatase (ADRP) and nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), indicating that RbCoV HKU14 should represent a separate species. RbCoV HKU14 also possessed genomic features distinct from those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, including a unique NS2a region with a variable number of small open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination analysis revealed possible recombination events during the evolution of RbCoV HKU14 and members of Betacoronavirus 1, which may have occurred during cross-species transmission. Molecular clock analysis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes dated the most recent common ancestor of RbCoV HKU14 to around 2002, suggesting that this virus has emerged relatively recently. Antibody against RbCoV was detected in 20 (67%) of 30 rabbit sera tested by an N-protein-based Western blot assay, whereas neutralizing antibody was detected in 1 of these 20 rabbits.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yip, Cyril C Y; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Huang, Yi; Wang, Ming; Guo, Rongtong; Lam, Carol S F; Tsang, Alan K L; Lai, Kenneth K Y; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Che, Xiao-Yan; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06927-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22398294/,13

145331,Discovery of High Affinity Receptors for Dityrosine through Inverse Virtual Screening and Docking and Molecular Dynamics.,2018,"BACKGROUND Regulation of sodium chloride transport in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron is essential for fluid homeostasis and BP control. The chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin in β-intercalated cells, along with sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) in distal convoluted tubules, complementarily regulate sodium chloride handling, which is controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. METHODS Using mice with mineralocorticoid receptor deletion in intercalated cells, we examined the mechanism and roles of pendrin upregulation via mineralocorticoid receptor in two different models of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation. We also used aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice to examine the role of pendrin regulation in salt-sensitive hypertension. RESULTS Deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells suppressed the increase in renal pendrin expression induced by either exogenous angiotensin II infusion or endogenous angiotensin II upregulation via salt restriction. When fed a low-salt diet, intercalated cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice with suppression of pendrin upregulation showed BP reduction that was attenuated by compensatory activation of NCC. In contrast, upregulation of pendrin induced by aldosterone excess combined with a high-salt diet was scarcely affected by deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells, but depended instead on hypokalemic alkalosis through the activated mineralocorticoid receptor-epithelial sodium channel cascade in principal cells. In aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice showing upregulation of pendrin, potassium supplementation corrected alkalosis and inhibited the pendrin upregulation, thereby lowering BP. CONCLUSIONS In conjunction with NCC, the two pathways of pendrin upregulation, induced by angiotensin II through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in intercalated cells and by alkalosis through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in principal cells, play important roles in fluid homeostasis during salt depletion and salt-sensitive hypertension mediated by aldosterone excess.","Ayuzawa, Nobuhiro; Nishimoto, Mitsuhiro; Ueda, Kohei; Hirohama, Daigoro; Kawarazaki, Wakako; Shimosawa, Tatsuo; Marumo, Takeshi; Fujita, Toshiro",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019080804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034107/,13

Cells with stably integrated GOI are selected and separated from cells without GOI by transfecting CD4/siRNA mRNA regulated by PTSelect™-siRNAs and exploiting the variable expression of CD4 on the cell surface. This study describes the PTSelect™ principle and compares the productivity, doubling time and stability of clones developed by PTSelect™ with conventionally developed clones.

Unfortunately, the proteins/peptides detected by MS are non-recoverable. To obtain the protein identity of a MS peak, additional time-consuming and material-consuming purification steps have to be done. In this study, we developed a magnetic beads-based proteomic fingerprinting method that allowed semi-quantitative proteomic profiling and micropreparative purification of the profiled proteins in parallel. The use of different chromatographic magnetic beads allowed us to obtain different proteomic profiles, which were comparable to those obtained by the ProteinChip surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization technology. Our assays were semi-quantitative. The normalized peak intensity was proportional to concentration measured by immunoassay. Both intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of the normalized peak intensities were in the range of 4-30%.

LOCAL PROBLEM Less than 40% of sheltered and unsheltered homeless people in South Florida, who were interviewed for this project, knew their immunization status and/or were up-to-date with their recommended vaccine histories. METHODS The immunization project implemented a five-step process to provide pneumococcus (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23) and Prevnar 13 vaccinations to a convenience sample of adult homeless men and women (N = 209) participants, who completed the financial eligibility form (J11) during their intake process to admission, for sheltered services from two local clinics. INTERVENTIONS To promote herd immunity, the five-step process was followed. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, initial training was provided to homeless shelter health care providers on vaccine storage, handling, and vaccination. A subsequent 1-week follow-up was completed with participants to determine if any delayed vaccination adverse reactions occurred. RESULTS Descriptive statistics was used to examine data from the initial project implementation. Findings indicated that more African Americans (n = 117) participated in the project than Whites (n = 50), Hispanics (n = 35), or Haitians (n = 7). CONCLUSIONS Homeless individuals experience illnesses that are preventable through involvement with a structured immunization program. Collectively, nurse practitioners can reduce barriers to immunization by increasing vaccine coverage and introducing incremental policy changes that enhance the health status among homeless populations.","Washington-Brown, Linda; Cirilo, Rose Wimbish",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038117/,13

147763,CD81 is a central regulator of cellular events required for hepatitis C virus infection of human hepatocytes.,2008,"BACKGROUND Anastomotic leakage is a serious, sometimes critical complication of upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. The cavity and target drainage tubes are difficult to reach; therefore, a nasogastric tube (NGT) and fasting are required for an extended period. We successfully treated and managed two patients with anastomotic leakage using percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG). CASE PRESENTATION In case 1, a 79-year-old man with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy; 1 week later, he underwent emergent open laparotomy due to panperitonitis attributed to anastomotic leakage-related jejunojejunostomy. We resected the portion between esophagojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy and reconstructed it using the Roux-en-Y technique. On postoperative day (POD) 9, anastomotic leakage was diagnosed at the esophagojejunostomy site and jejunotomy staple line. After using a circular stapler for jejunojejunostomy, a stapled jejunal closure was added. We inserted an NGT and performed aspiration for bowel decompression. As he did not improve within 2 weeks, we decided to perform PTEG to free him of the NGT. We kept performing intermittent aspiration; leakage stopped shortly after, due to effective inner drainage. The PTEG catheter was removed after oral intake was restarted. In case 2, an 81-year-old man with esophagogastric junction cancer underwent resection of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. After shaping the remnant stomach, esophagogastrostomy was performed under the right thoracotomy. On POD 11, anastomotic leakage was identified, along with a mediastinal abscess. We inserted an NGT into the abscess cavity through the anastomotic leakage site. On POD 25, we performed PTEG and inserted a drainage tube, instead of an NGT. Although the abscess cavity disappeared, anastomotic leakage persisted as a fistula. We exchanged the PTEG with a double elementary diet (W-ED) tube with jejunal extension, with the side hole located near the anastomosis. The anastomotic fistula disappeared after treatment. Dysphagia persisted due to disuse atrophy of swallowing musculature; PTEG was useful for enteral feeding, even after the leakage occurred. CONCLUSION Patients are sometimes forced to endure pain for a long time for transnasal inner drainage. Using PTEG, patients will be free of sinus pain and discomfort; PTEG should be helpful for patients withstanding NGT.","Tamamori, Yutaka; Sakurai, Katsunobu; Kubo, Naoshi; Yonemitsu, Ken; Fukui, Yasuhiro; Nishimura, Junya; Maeda, Kiyoshi; Nishiguchi, Yukio",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00965-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833125/,13

It is unknown how cognition changes and relates to functional gain during inpatient rehabilitation. We administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at admission to 77 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation for COVID-19 in a large US academic medical center. Forty-five patients were administered the MoCA at discharge. Functional gain was assessed by change in the quality indicator for self-care (QI-SC). In the full sample, 80.5% of patients exhibited cognitive impairment on admission, which was associated with prior delirium. Among 45 patients with retest data, there were significant improvements in MoCA and QI-SC. QI-SC score gain was higher in patients who made clinically meaningful changes on the MoCA, an association that persisted after accounting for age and delirium history. Cognitive impairment is frequent among COVID-19 patients, but improves over time and is associated with functional gain during inpatient rehabilitation.","Patel, Ruchi; Savrides, Irene; Cahalan, Christine; Doulatani, Gargi; O'Dell, Michael W; Toglia, Joan; Jaywant, Abhishek",International journal of rehabilitation research.

Twenty female NCAA Division II lacrosse athletes (mean ± SD: 20.4 ± 1.8 years; 68.8 ± 8.9 kg; 168.4 ± 6.6 cm; 27.9 ± 3% body fat) recorded dietary intake and wore a physical activity monitor over four consecutive days at five different time points (20 days total) during one academic year. Body composition, bone health, and resting metabolic rate were assessed in conjunction with wearing the monitor during off-season, pre-season, and season-play. Body fat percentage decreased slightly during the course of this study (p = 0.037). Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) (p < 0.001) and activity energy expenditure (AEE) (p = 0.001) energy were found to change significantly over the course of the year, with pre-season training resulting in the highest energy expenditures (TDEE: 2789 ± 391 kcal/day; AEE: 1001 ± 267 kcal/day). Caloric (2124 ± 448 kcal/day), carbohydrate (3.6 ± 1.1 g/kg), and protein (1.2 ± 0.3 g/kg) intake did not change over the course of the year (p > 0.05).

A hierarchy of evidence can be used to assess the strength upon which clinical decisions are made. The efficient approach to finding the best evidence is to identify systematic reviews or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Respiratory therapies that evidence supports include noninvasive ventilation for appropriately selected patients, lung-protective ventilation, and ventilator discontinuation protocols. Evidence does not support use of weaning parameters, albuterol for ARDS, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation for adults. Therapy with equivocal evidence includes airway clearance, selection of an aerosol delivery device, and PEEP for ARDS. Although all tenets of EBM are not universally accepted, the principles of EBM nonetheless provide a valuable approach to respiratory care practice.","Hess, Dean R",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064624/,13

New intraoperative guidance modalities, including near-infrared fluorescence cholangiography, are under evaluation. Initial results showed limitations in visualizing the biliary tree in specific clinical situations. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and potentiality of fluorescence cholecysto-cholangiography performed with a direct injection of indocyanine green (ICG) in the gallbladder and to compare it to systemic injection in such situations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven pigs were included in this non-survival study. In two pigs, the gallbladder was punctured by a percutaneous needle, and 1 mL of ICG in different concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/mL) was sequentially injected. Visibility and pattern of the fluorescent signal around Calot's triangle were examined and compared with those of two control pigs receiving 2.5 mg of intravenous ICG, 30 min prior to the operation. Different scenarios of cholecystitis were modeled using an injection of a mixture of blood and agarose gel around Calot's triangle area in the remaining three pigs, and the applicability of direct intragallbladder injection methods was evaluated. RESULTS The fluorescent signal was identified immediately after intragallbladder injection, and the cystic duct became visible by 0.1 and 1 mg/mL of ICG. The whole cystic duct and the infundibulum of the gallbladder were clearly enhanced by intragallbladder ICG injection, but not by systemic injection. In the cholecystitis models, the cystic duct could be identified only after partial dissection, and fluorescence visualization of the gallbladder infundibulum provided crucial information to find the correct starting point of dissection. CONCLUSIONS Fluorescence cholecysto-cholangiography through direct intragallbladder ICG injection could rapidly provide an adequate visualization of gallbladder neck and cystic duct and might be a valid option to increase the safety of cholecystectomy in case of cholecystitis.","Liu, Yu-Yin; Kong, Seong-Ho; Diana, Michele; Lègner, Andras; Wu, Chun-Chi; Kameyama, Noriaki; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4608-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511116/,13

OBJECTIVE To examine relationships between suicide and acute inpatient psychiatric bed occupancy and other community, hospital and patient factors. METHODS Retrospective cohort study using administrative and publicly available data for contextual community factors. The study sample included all veterans enrolled in VHA primary care in 2011-2016 associated with 111 VHA hospitals with acute inpatient psychiatric units. Acute psychiatric bed occupancy, as a measure of access to care, was the main exposure of interest and was categorised by quarter as per cent occupied using thresholds of ≤85%, 85.1%-90%, 90.1%-95% and >95%. Hospital-level analyses were conducted using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts for hospital, modelling number of suicides by quarter with a negative binomial distribution. RESULTS From 2011 to 2016, the national incidence of suicide among enrolled veterans increased from 39.7 to 41.6 per 100 000 person-years. VHA psychiatric bed occupancy decreased from a mean of 68.2% (IQR 56.5%-82.2%) to 65.4% (IQR 53.9%-79.9%). VHA hospitals with the highest occupancy (>95%) in a quarter compared with ≤85% had an adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR) for suicide of 1.10 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.19); no increased risk was observed for 85.1%-90% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) or 90.1%-95% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) compared with ≤85% occupancy. Of hospital and community variables, suicide risk was not associated with number of VHA or non-VHA psychiatric beds or amount spent on community mental health. Suicide risk increased by age categories, seasons, geographic regions and over time. CONCLUSIONS High VHA hospital occupancy (>95%) was associated with a 10% increased suicide risk for veterans whereas absolute number of beds was not, suggesting occupancy is an important access measure. Future work should clarify optimal bed occupancy to meet acute psychiatric needs and ensure adequate bed distribution.","Kaboli, Peter J; Augustine, Matthew R; Haraldsson, Bjarni; Mohr, Nicholas M; Howren, M Bryant; Jones, Michael P; Trivedi, Ranak",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400537/,13

Shared language must be clear enough to help, not hinder people working together as they ultimately come to mutual understanding of roles, responsibilities, and actions in their joint work. Based on an iterative lexicon development process, the authors developed and propose a definitional framework as an aid to navigating among related population and community health terms. These terms are defined, similarities and differences clarified, and then organized into 3 categories that reflect goals, realities, and ways to get the job done. Goals include (a) health as well-being for persons, (b) population health as that goal expressed in measurable terms for groups, and (c) community health as population health for particular communities of interest, geography, or other defining characteristic-groups with shared identity and particular systemic influences on health. Realities are social determinants as influences, health disparities as effects, and health equity as both a goal and a design principle. Ways to get the job done include health care delivery systems for enrollees and public health in population-based civic activities-with a broad zone of collaboration where streams of effort converge in partnership with served communities. This map of terms can enable people to move forward together in a broad zone of collaboration for health with less confusion, ambiguity, and conflict.","Peek, C J; Westfall, John M; Stange, Kurt C; Liaw, Winston; Ewigman, Bernard; DeVoe, Jennifer E; Green, Larry A; Polverento, Molly E; Bora, Nirali; deGruy, Frank V; Harper, Peter G; Baker, Nancy J",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546952/,13

The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation.","Mohammad Didarul Alam, Mirza; Zahedul Alam, Mohammad; Abidur Rahman, Syed; Khadijeh Taghizadeh, Seyedeh",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705856/,13
153770,Small molecule strategies to harness the unfolded protein response: where do we go from here?,2020-09-04,"The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl plays important roles in T cell development and immune responses; however, the mechanism is poorly understood. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcriptional regulator of type I IFN-dependent immune responses against DNA and RNA viruses. The data in this study show that IRF3 is physically associated with c-Abl in vivo and directly binds to c-Abl in vitro. IRF3 is phosphorylated by c-Abl and c-Abl-related kinase, Arg, mainly at Y292. The inhibitor AMN107 inhibits IFN-β production induced by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), and Sendai virus in THP-1 and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage cells. IRF3-induced transcription of IFN-β is significantly reduced by the mutation of Y292 to F. Moreover, AMN107 suppresses gene expression of absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and subsequently reduces inflammasome activation induced by cytosolic bacteria, dsDNA, and DNA viruses. Consistent with this finding, Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain (Ft LVS), which is known as an activator of AIM2 inflammasome, induces death in significantly more C57BL/6 mice treated with the Abl inhibitor AMN107 or c-Abl/Arg small interfering RNA than in untreated mice. This study provides new insight into the function of c-Abl and Arg in regulating immune responses and AIM2 inflammasome activation, especially against Ft LVS infection.","Luo, Fengyan; Liu, Hainan; Yang, Shasha; Fang, Yi; Zhao, Zhihu; Hu, Yong; Jin, Yanwen; Li, Ping; Gao, Ting; Cao, Cheng; Liu, Xuan",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30842273/,13

All patients were discharged home. None of the 50 contacts tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION Resolution of the fever was accompanied by an increase in oxygen requirements and respiratory rate also lasting several days. This was followed by resolution of all symptoms and return to normal.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Hinedi, Kareem",Journal of chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/1120009x.2018.1429236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385908/,13

Is one exercise training modality better than the others for improving these outcomes? DESIGN Systematic review with network meta-analysis of randomised trials. PARTICIPANTS Adults requiring haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. INTERVENTION Aerobic training, resistance training, combined training and control (no exercise or placebo). OUTCOME MEASURES Aerobic capacity, arterial blood pressure at rest, and haemodialysis efficiency. RESULTS Thirty-three trials involving 1254 participants were included. Direct meta-analyses were conducted first. Aerobic capacity improved significantly more with aerobic training (3.35 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.91) and combined training (5.00 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 3.50 to 6.50) than with control. Only combined training significantly reduced systolic (-9 mmHg, 95% CI -13 to -4) and diastolic (-5 mmHg, 95% CI -6 to -3) blood pressure compared to control. Only aerobic training was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency (Kt/V 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20). However, when network meta-analysis was conducted, there were some important different findings. Both aerobic training and combined training again elicited greater improvements in aerobic capacity than control. For systolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to control. For diastolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to aerobic training and control. No modality was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency. Combined training was ranked as the most effective treatment for aerobic capacity and arterial blood pressure. CONCLUSION Combined training was the most effective modality to increase aerobic capacity and blood pressure control in people who require haemodialysis. This finding helps to fill the gap created by the lack of head-to-head comparisons of different modalities of exercise in people with end-stage renal disease.

Kidney disease is a non-communicable disease (NCD) and currently affects around 850 million people worldwide. One in ten adults has chronic kidney disease (CKD). The global burden of CKD is increasing, and is projected to become the 5th most common cause of years of life lost globally by 2040. CKD is a major cause of catastrophic health expenditure. The costs of dialysis and transplantation consume 2-3% of the annual healthcare budget in high-income countries. Crucially, kidney disease can be prevented and progression to end-stage kidney disease can be delayed with appropriate access to basic diagnostics and early treatment. This year World Kidney Day continues to raise awareness of the increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and to strive for kidney health for everyone, everywhere. During the pandemic with COVID 19 patients kidneys are also damaged, apart from the respiratory tract and other organs. It can lead to an increase in acute renal failure and consequent chronic kidney insufficiency, as well as number of deaths. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the renal function in each patient with COVID 19 virus. In the Republic of North Macedonia from 2006 to present day nephrologists and other medical personnel devoted to the early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of renal disease have participated in the activities of the World Kidney Day. These activities were supported by the Macedonian Society of Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation and Artificial Organs, the Department of Nephrology at the Medical Faculty, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, non-governmental nephrology organizations (NEFRON) and the media. There were lectures and presentation devoted to the various theme of the WKD, publications in journals, as well as activities for examination of the renal function of patients in the medical centers. The activities during the WKD contributed to the improvement of the nephrological protection of the citizens of the Republic of N.

Several techniques have been described for treating these depressed scars, but none of these can fulfil the optimal results. AIM Evaluating the aesthetic outcome of using a double vest lipodermal flaps for treating depressed facial scars. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 25 patients with depressed facial scars who underwent scar revision. Their mean age was 31 years. Under local anaesthesia, the scarred area was de-epithelialised and double dart lipodermal flaps were used for revision. Visual analogue and Vancouver scar scales were used as subjective and objective parameters of evaluation, respectively. RESULTS All the patients followed up for five to eight months. No complications were observed during the scar healing period. Patients satisfaction according to the visual analogue scale showed an average value of 8. The mean total scale according to the Vancouver scar scale was 2.6. CONCLUSION The new technique of using double vest lipodermal flaps is simple and offers a promising alternative for revising depressed scars.","Qassim, Y N; Ali, A A; Alfeehan, M J; Albayati, W K",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.0154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735124/,13

The VIP has been shown as a cost-effective intervention to significantly reduce CVD mortality. However, little is known about the effectiveness of a digital solution to tailor risk communication strategies for supporting behavioral change. STAR-C aims to develop and evaluate a technical platform for personalized digital coaching that will support behavioral change aimed at preventing CVD. Methods: STAR-C employs a mixed-methods design in seven multidisciplinary projects, which runs in two phases during 2019-2024: (i) a formative intervention design and development phase, and (ii) an intervention implementation and evaluation phase. In the 1st phase, STAR-C will model the trajectories of health behaviors and their impact on CVDs (Project 1), evaluate the role of the social environment and social networks on behavioral change (Project 2) and assess whether and how social media facilitates the spread of health information beyond targeted individuals and stimulates public engagement in health promotion (Project 3). The findings will be utilized in carrying out the iterative, user-centered design, and development of a person-tailored digital coaching platform (Project 4). In the 2nd phase, STAR-C will evaluate the implementation of the coaching programme and its effectiveness for promoting behavioral change and the spreading of health information across social networks and via social media (Project 5). The cost-effectiveness (Project 6) and ethical issues (Project 7) related to the coaching programme intervention will be evaluated. Discussion: The STAR-C research programme will address the knowledge and practice research gaps in the use of information technologies in health promotion and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention programmes in order to narrow the health inequality gaps. Ethics: STAR-C has received approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr. 2019-02924;2020-02985). Dissemination: The collaboration between Umeå University and Region Västerbotten will ensure the feasibility of STAR-C in the service delivery context. Results will be communicated with decision-makers at different levels of society, stakeholders from other regions and healthcare professional organizations, and through NGOs, local and social media platforms.","Ng, Nawi; Eriksson, Malin; Guerrero, Esteban; Gustafsson, Carina; Kinsman, John; Lindberg, Jens; Lindgren, Helena; Lindvall, Kristina; Lundgren, Anna Sofia; Lönnberg, Göran; Sahlen, Klas-Göran; Santosa, Ailiana; Richter Sundberg, Linda; Weinehall, Lars; Wennberg, Patrik",Frontiers in public health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.593453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732674/,13

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of digitoxigenin and its topical formulation for wound healing; (2) Methods: In the in vitro study, the human dermal fibroblast cells were treated with digitoxigenin and collagen synthesis was assessed. In the in vivo study, digitoxigenin was applied to excisional full-thickness wounds in rats immediately after wounding and remained for three days, and wound open was evaluated over 10 days. A digitoxigenin formulation for topical administration was prepared, and the in vitro release and in vivo wound healing effect were investigated; (3) Results: The expression of procollagen in human dermal fibroblast was significantly increased with the exposure to 0.1 nM digitoxigenin. Topical application of digitoxigenin in olive oil or alginate solution for three days significantly decreased the wound open in rats. Similarly, topical administration of the developed digitoxigenin formulation for three days also significantly increased wound healing. No wound healing effects were observed at days 7 and 10 after wounding when digitoxigenin was not applied; and, (4) Conclusions: It was possible to deliver digitoxigenin using the developed formulation. However, the wound healing effect of digitoxigenin and its mechanisms need to be further investigated in future studies.","Feng, Xinchi; Wang, Cuifen; Xu, Yunhui; Turley, Joel; Xie, Zijian; Pierre, Sandrine V; Hao, Jinsong",Bioengineering,https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering5010021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510580/,13

A challenge to understanding the inner workings of these complex magnetoelectric multiferroics is the multitude of distinct Fe centres and their associated environments. This is because macroscopic techniques characterize average responses rather than the role of individual iron centres. Here, we combine optical absorption, magnetic circular dichroism and first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of high-temperature magnetism in these superlattices and the charge-ordering pattern in the m = 3 member. In a significant conceptual advance, interface spectra establish how Lu-layer distortion selectively enhances the Fe2+ → Fe3+ charge-transfer contribution in the spin-up channel, strengthens the exchange interactions and increases the Curie temperature. Comparison of predicted and measured spectra also identifies a non-polar charge ordering arrangement in the LuFe2O4 layer. This site-specific spectroscopic approach opens the door to understanding engineered materials with multiple metal centres and strong entanglement.","Fan, Shiyu; Das, Hena; Rébola, Alejandro; Smith, Kevin A; Mundy, Julia; Brooks, Charles; Holtz, Megan E; Muller, David A; Fennie, Craig J; Ramesh, Ramamoorthy; Schlom, Darrell G; McGill, Stephen; Musfeldt, Janice L",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19285-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33149138/,13

OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility of methods to conduct a larger multisite trial to determine the long-term effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery compared with an intensive diabetes medical and weight management (Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment [Why WAIT]) program for type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 1-year pragmatic randomized clinical trial was conducted in an academic medical institution. Participants included persons aged 21 to 65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed more than 1 year before the study; their body mass index was 30 to 42 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was greater than or equal to 6.5%. All participants were receiving antihyperglycemic medications. INTERVENTIONS RYGB (n = 19) or Why WAIT (n = 19) including 12 weekly multidisciplinary group lifestyle, medical, and educational sessions with monthly follow-up thereafter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of patients with fasting plasma glucose levels less than 126 mg/dL and HbA1c less than 6.5%, measures of cardiometabolic health, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS At 1 year, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c below 6.5% and fasting glucose below 126 mg/dL was higher following RYGB than Why WAIT (58% vs 16%, respectively; P = .03). Other outcomes, including HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean mass, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels, decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased more after RYGB compared with Why WAIT. Improvement in cardiovascular risk scores was greater in the surgical group. At baseline the participants exhibited moderately low self-reported quality-of-life scores reflected by Short Form-36 total, physical health, and mental health, as well as high Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite and Problem Areas in Diabetes health status scores. At 1 year, improvements in Short Form-36 physical and mental health scores and Problem Areas in Diabetes scores did not differ significantly between groups. The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite score improved more with RYGB and correlated with greater weight loss compared with Why WAIT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, RYGB produces greater weight loss and sustained improvements in HbA1c and cardiometabolic risk factors compared with medical management, with emergent differences over 1 year. Both treatments improve general quality-of-life measures, but RYGB provides greater improvement in the effect of weight on quality of life. These differences may help inform therapeutic decisions for diabetes and weight loss strategies in obese patients with type 2 diabetes until larger randomized trials are performed.

163495,Characterization of Critical Determinants of ACE2-RBD Interaction,2021-01-29,"COVID-19 has impacted psychiatric education at many levels from postgraduate training to Continuous Medical Education (CME). We invited participants at the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) who are national representatives to share how COVID-19 has impacted postgraduate training and Continuous Professional Development (CPD) in their countries. They were asked to report the challenges but also the opportunities created by the pandemic and their answers were analysed. Several themes emerged. Challenges in postgraduate training have been absences caused by COVID, redeployment, reduced interactions and postponement of assessments. The mental health of trainees was affected, including burnout. Interestingly in some places, like Denmark, training was less impacted as psychiatry was designated as ‘critical’ and therefore no redeployment. Exams have moved online and there have been concerns about cheating in the new format. In countries where it is obligatory to be uptodate with CME/CPD to maintain medical registration, the usual requirements were waived. Conferences and live events have moved online and webinars became popular and widely accepted. Some positive developments included rapid adoption of technology, for consultations and training, increased relevance of CPD/CME, emphasis on team cohesion and recognition of the need for self-care and team support. The pandemic also fostered international collaboration, e.g. sharing guidelines for new ways of working. Some of the innovations described, mainly related to the adoption of technology and remote working will likely be taken in the future. However, the sentiment remains that live exchanges are valuable and should be resumed as soon as it is safe.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Casanova Dias, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.141,13

Successively, we present the “Dynamic Space-Time Diffusion Simulator in a GIS Environment to Tackle the COVID-19 Emergency” that we have elaborated on the basis of the data provided by the UOC Hygiene and Public Health Service – Local Health Unit Rome 1. Particularly, after describing the main technical process able to predispose the dynamic simulator, we underline the possible added value that it can provide in terms of infection surveillance and monitoring, precision preparedness, support to decision making and territorial screening. For this demonstrative application, we have extracted from the simulator some groups of four digital screenshots which are able to show synoptic photographs in temporal perspective concerning the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Rome (Italy) for the period February 25th-September 26th. Specifically we have selected:-four screenshots for the period February 25th-June 11th, to provide significant evidence about the first three months and a half;-four screenshots for the period March 1st – March 29th, to add an insight into the geographically and statistically meaningful month of March;-four screenshots for the period June 12th-September 26th, to supply an efficacious geovisualisation of the last three months and a half available;-four screenshots for the period February 25th-September 26th, to show a cumulative elaboration aimed at geolocating all the cases recorded in the seven months examined;-four screenshots for the period March 26th-September 26th, with a distinction about the first and second data sets, for a detailed (cumulative) zoom.

The objective was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life course. Design: A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline. All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full text level. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed an association with population level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes. There were no restrictions on year of publication, country or population. Non-English and earthquake related studies were excluded. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (e.g., type of disaster, name of specific event, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes, and measures of effect. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results: A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood. Studies included exposure to natural (60%) and human-made (40%) disasters, with only 3 (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics. Most studies were conducted in North America (62%). Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes, and obesity. Few studies investigated potential mechanisms or identified high risk subgroups. Conclusions: Understanding the long-term consequences of disasters on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course may inform public health strategies for the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review found strong evidence of an increased association between disaster exposure and cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course, although more research is needed to better understand the mechanisms and preventative efforts.

As the key immunogen, the spike protein is frequently mutated with conserved epitopes shielded by glycans. Here, we reveal that spike glycosylation has site-differential effects on viral infectivity and lung epithelial cells generate spike with more infective glycoforms. Compared to the fully glycosylated spike, immunization of spike protein with N-glycans trimmed to the monoglycosylated state (Smg) elicits stronger immune responses and better protection for hACE2 transgenic mice against variants of concern. In addition, a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody was identified from the Smg immunized mice, demonstrating that removal of glycan shields to better expose the conserved sequences is an effective and simple approach to broad-spectrum vaccine development.

However, despite decades of research on RDTs and a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK, few devices are in commercial use. Challenges discussed by RDT developers included identifying commercially-viable targets, and management of the innovation ecosystem, e.g. to create clear pathways to market supporting positive interactions between farmers, vets, and other actors along the value chain. Future support for RDT development could be provided through incorporation in: assured food systems;business service packages provided by centralised laboratories;or animal health monitoring packages related to the spread of AMR. Breeding stock sales could require an accompanying health package including RDTs, vaccines and/or antibiotics, linking to precision agriculture approaches. Unlike the example of RDT development for COVID-19, it seems that the urgency of the issue and the clarity of links between animal and human health outcomes are not yet sufficient to support a fast-tracking programme for the development of RDTs to combat AMR.

164619,Structural analysis of the OC43 coronavirus 2′-O-RNA methyltransferase,2021-03-17,"Abstract Background Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are increasingly adopting low-cost Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapid antigen tests to meet the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Whilst testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard, its widespread use in LMICs is limited by high costs, turnaround times and is not readily available in most places. COVID-19 antigen tests (Ag-RDT) provide a suitable alternative due to their low cost, rapid turnaround time and easy to set up and use. This study aimed to assess the field performance of the NowCheck COVID-19 antigen kit (Ag-RDT) as a point of care test (POCT) in select healthcare facilities in western Kenya. Methods We conducted a prospective multi-facility field evaluation study of the NowCheck COVID-19 rapid antigen test (Ag-RDT) compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (RT-PCR). After obtaining informed consent, trained laboratory technicians collected two pairs of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, both antigen and RT-PCR testing, first for Ag-RDT and next for RT-PCR. We performed Ag-RDTs on-site and shared the results with both the study participants and their healthcare providers within 15-30 minutes. We carried out all RT-PCR tests in a central referral laboratory. The turnaround time for RT-PCR results was typically 24-48 hours. We captured the results of both methods using an electronic digital application. Findings Between December 2020 and March 2021, we enrolled 997 participants who met the Kenyan Ministry of Health COVID-19 case definition. The median age of study participants was 39 years (range one to 80 years), with 54% male. Ag-RDT had a sensitivity of 84.5% (76.0-90.8) and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI: 92.7-95.8) with an accuracy of 94.2% (92.5- 95.6) when a cycle threshold value (Ct value) of [≤]35 was used. The highest sensitivity of 87.7% (77.2-94.5) was observed in samples with Ct values [≤] 30 and the highest specificity of 97.5% (96.2-98.5) at Ct value of <40. Interpretation The NowCheck COVID-19 Ag-RDT showed good performance in field evaluation in multiple healthcare facilities in a developing country. The sensitivity of the kit exceeded the minimum recommended cut-off of 80% as recommended by WHO1. The high specificity of this kit at 94.4% at Ct values [≤]33 and 97.5% at Ct values <40 matched that of real-time PCR, making it a good rule-out test for symptomatic patients with COVID-19- like symptoms. The faster turnaround time to results, lower cost, simple analytical steps requiring no equipment or infrastructure makes antigen testing an attractive field-screening method to meet the high demand for COVID-19 testing.","Onsongo, S.

The image modality more investigated on this subject is computed tomography (CT), however it has some disadvantages: it uses ionizing radiation, requires unique installations along with a complicated process limiting the number of possible tests per equipment, and the economic costs can be prohibitively high for screening a large population. For these reasons, the aim of this study is to investigate thermal images as an alternative modality for diagnosis of COVID-19. The methodology used in this study consisted of using radiomics and moment features extracted from six images obtained from thermal video clips in which optical flow and super resolution were used, these features were classified using traditional machine learning methods. Accuracies were in the range of 0.433-0.524. These first results conducted on thermal images suggest that the use of this type of image modality is unlikely to be favorable for COVID-19 detection. © 2021 ACM.","Canales-Fiscal, M. R.; López, R.

167855,Screening coronavirus and human proteins for sialic acid binding sites using a docking approach,2021,"Repositioning of clinical approved drugs could represent the fastest way to identify therapeutic options during public health emergencies, the majority of drugs explored for repurposing as antivirals for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit. Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly, mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the 4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells with low cytotoxicity and EC50 and EC90 values of 1.2 and 5.3 µM, respectively. In addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs. These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.","Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Dias, Suelen S.

168280,MDA5 autoimmune disease variant M854K prevents ATP-dependent structural discrimination of viral and cellular RNA,2021-02-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to thousands of doctors being redeployed. The especially stressful circumstances of the pandemic may mean that regular debriefing with a supervisor is necessary. The onerous rota may prohibit lengthy meetings but coaching-style conversations may be a valuable adjunct in the communication between trainee and supervisor.We developed a pilot communication skills training - with a focus on coaching skills - to enhance communication between supervisors and trainees.2 sessions facilitated by 2 coaches were held with 22 and 13 participants respectively in the summer of 2019. Participants explored and challenged their assumptions about the positive and negative ways trainees and supervisors interact with each other. The coaches then introduced the SBI feedback framework (Situation – Behaviour – Impact) and the TGROW coaching model. Working in small groups, participants used TGROW to coach one another on issues relating to their role as supervisors, rotating as coach/coachee/observer.TGROW is a solution-focused framework and leadership tool for structuring a coaching conversation. The acronym describes a 5-step coaching process: Topic - Goal - Reality - Options - Will & Way forward. The aim is to catalyse insight and motivation to change and grow through asking powerful questions linked to each of the model’s five steps.65% of our supervisors on the course (n=23) have previously found it difficult to engage with trainees. Following training, 50% of our supervisors felt increased confidence in their communication skills. Attendees found the workshop to be helpful to reflect on the changing medical culture and how coaching can be used to reach across perceived divides and disengagement.Our experience highlights some of the difficulty faced by supervisors when communicating with trainees. Coaching as a communication tool may be especially pertinent when managing the uncertainty faced during this pandemic.","Cheh Kuan, Tai Sullivan Kathleen Tavanyar Jude Wood Eleanor",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.6,13

The construction of generalized local states (GLS) relies on defining distances between time series on the basis of their (non-)linear correlations. We demonstrate the prediction capabilities of our approach based on the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS), the Lorenz-96 (L96) and a combination of both systems. In the mixed system a separation of the time series belonging to the two different systems is made possible with GLS. More importantly, prediction remains possible with GLS, where the LS approach must naturally fail. Applications for the prediction of very heterogeneous time series with GLSs are briefly outlined.","Baur, Sebastian; Rath, Christoph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12333v2.pdf,13
170186,High-throughput miRNA-sequencing of the human placenta: expression throughout gestation,2021-02-04,"The article discusses modern views on the structure of spherical virus capsids, which have the shape of icosahedrons (icosahedral viruses). Each face of icosahedron is composed of a single-layer closest packing of protein globules, which can have different orientation relative to the edges of icosahedron. If the lines of globules are parallel to the edges of icosahedron, then the capsid has a point symmetry group Ih (with symmetry planes), if they are not parallel - the symmetry group I (without planes). From a mathematical point of view, in both symmetry groups there are series that unite equally (up to similarity) arranged capsids. They are connected pairwise by transitions to dual forms (homologous series). A hypothesis is formulated that the largest spherical viruses can have even more diverse and complex capsid structures. Along with icosahedron, their basic forms can be any simple shapes, allowed in Ih and I symmetry groups (8 in total). A suggestion is made that transitions within similarity series and between homologous series have a phylogenetic significance. There are known spherical viruses of both symmetry groups. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has a symmetry group Ih and belongs to a well-known series. The crystallographic approach allows to construct a strict morphological classification of spherical viruses. This is important for their early recognition and separate examination. The article demonstrates practical application of crystal morphology in the study of viral systems - an urgent problem of geoecology and life protection.","Voytekhovsky, Y.

170231,Elucidating the viral and host factors enabling the cross-species transmission of primate lentiviruses from simians to humans,2020-10-13,"Background: The rapid global spread of COVID-19 required swift action to provide people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) with reliable information. Important issues included the risk of infection and severe illness, (continued) use of medication, temporary closure of clinics, and organization of (semi-) virtual care. People with limited health literacy are a particularly vulnerable group that might have difficulty accessing, understanding, and applying health information. Objectives: To evaluate (a) key aspects of crisis communication and (b) explicit consideration of people's health literacy needs in communication to people with RMDs during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Methods: We conducted an explorative qualitative study including seven interviews in May and June 2020 with representatives of organisations (a mixed regional/academic hospital, the association for RMD professionals and two patient organisations) responsible for information provision to people with RMDs in the Netherlands. Interviewees were asked about preparedness (1) and strategy (2) for crisis communication, and content (3) and reach (4) of communication, considering principles of good crisis communication and health literacy. In addition, through systematic screening of websites, social media and emails, we identified and analysed 13 written communications provided to people with RMDs by these organisations during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed comprehensibility and applicability with the Dutch adapted version of the Patient Education Materials Assessment tool (PEMAT), the outcome being a percentage of adherence to 24 criteria. We assessed difficulty level using an online assessment application (Figure 1), with Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) level B1 being the highest acceptable level. Results: While admittedly being underprepared, respondents generally perceived their crisis communication as adequate. They quickly adapted to people's needs and changing circumstances and attempted to adapt written and verbal communication to people with limited health literacy. Respondents reported challenges related to the scientific uncertainty, lack of reach, difficulty simplifying information, and being unsure if their communication approach was adequate. Textual assessment showed great variation in applicability (range 60-100%) and comprehensibility (range 58-100%) of these texts, and 69% of communications were more difficult than B1-level. Considering principles of crisis communication and health literacy, we propose several lessons to be learned for future crises (Table 1). Conclusion: The rheumatology organisations mostly adhered to principles of crisis communication, and made efforts to adapt information to their audience's needs, including health literacy needs. Nevertheless, important recommendations were drawn which are potentially also relevant for other clinical fields.","Bakker, M.

Lockdown measures imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial reductions in observed Asian aerosol loadings. Here, we use bottom-up estimates of anthropogenic emissions based on national mobility data from Google and Apple, along with simulations from the ECHAM6-HAMMOZ state-of-the-art aerosol-chemistry-climate model to investigate the impact of the reduced aerosol and gases pollution loadings on the ISM. We show that the decrease in anthropogenic emissions led to a 4 W m−2 increase in surface solar radiation over parts of South Asia, which resulted in a strengthening of the ISM. Simultaneously, while natural emission parameterizations are kept the same in all our simulations, the anthropogenic emission reduction led to changes in the atmospheric circulation, causing accumulation of dust over the Tibetan plateau (TP) during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. This accumulated dust has intensified the warm core over the TP that reinforced the intensification of the Hadley circulation. The associated cross-equatorial moisture influx over the Indian landmass led to an enhanced amount of rainfall by 4% (0.2 mm d−1) over the Indian landmass and 5%–15% (0.8–3 mm d−1) over central India. These estimates may vary under the influence of large-scale coupled atmosphere–ocean oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). Our study indicates that the reduced anthropogenic emissions caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 restrictions had a favourable effect on the hydrological cycle over South Asia, which has been facing water scarcity during the past decades. This emphasizes the need for stringent measures to limit future anthropogenic emissions in South Asia for protecting one of the world’s most densely populated regions.","Fadnavis, Suvarna Sabin T.

As the most reliable epidemic diagnosis, we propose the PCR test positive rate. Examining the COVID-19 epidemic in Tokyo shows that the positive rate follows the epidemic accurately, without being affected by medical institution closures or the psychology of people. By comparing with the change of the positive rate, we argue that the psychology of people was the cause of the observed asymmetry and shallow valleys in the number of confirmed cases. We discuss that the positive rate as large as 1-5% in the valleys of the epidemic implies that many people are already infected and immune. The observed fact that the positive rate followed the number of positives accurately and the value lower than those reported in the test-negative design studies of influenza are attributable to the government policy of finding as many patients as possible. We mention three possibilities as the causes of the repeated COVID-19 epidemic in Japan.","Tomie, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.15.21263609v1?rss=1,13

Its activation by cGAMP upon the presence of cytosolic DNA stimulates the production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines which are crucial for protecting cells from infections. STING signaling pathway can also influence both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting mechanisms, rendering it an appealing target for drug design. In the human population, several STING variants exist and exhibit dramatic differences in their activity, impacting the efficiency of the host defense against infections. Understanding the differential molecular mechanisms exhibited by these variants is of utmost importance notably towards personalized medicine treatments against diseases such as viral infections (COVID-19, Dengue…), cancers, or auto-inflammatory diseases. Owing to micro-seconds scale molecular modeling simulations and post-processing by contacts analysis and Machine Learning techniques, we reveal the dynamical behavior of four STING variants (wild type, G230A, R293Q, and G230A-R293Q) and we rationalize the variability of efficiency observed experimentally. Our results show that the decrease of STING activity is linked to a stiffening of key-structural features of the binding cavity, together with changes of the interaction patterns within the protein.","Morere, Jeremy; Hognon, Cécilia; Miclot, Tom; Jiang, Tao; Dumont, Elise; Barone, Giampaolo; Bignon, Emmanuelle; Monari, Antonio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452045,13

However, in the context of coastal areas, coastal resources seem to be ignored in the tourism production and consumption process. In relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this article discusses how sharing economy practices may sustain coastal resources through ecotourism, applying a sharing-economy theory that emphasizes changes in the new form—a circular economy—rather than a single traditional Airbnb model or ecotourism model. This study proposes a coastal sustainable development structure model based on the integration between the sharing economy and ecotourism with three modes—positive economic effects, positive economic pressures, and sustainable coastal development—and uses coastal residents’ expectations of their living conditions as moderating factors to investigate the impact of the circular economy on coastal sustainability. We developed a survey-based model that included 303 samples from the indigenous residents of 13 provinces throughout the Vietnam Mekong Delta. The results show that the integration of ecotourism with the Airbnb model has a positive effect on residents’ living conditions, supporting sustainable local development. However, the advancement of technology and residents’ awareness involves barriers to coastal development because the process of modernization is still limited in coastal areas. More specifically, in the case of the Vietnam Mekong Delta, our results suggest that limited technical knowledge and language ability stand as barriers to coastal businesses, showing that the lack of inter-regional connectivity limits the magnitude of local tourism in coastal areas. These findings are useful for assessing residents’ living conditions so that coastal development can work towards poverty reduction. Finally, the establishment and expansion of policies by local authorities can be an indispensable part of coastal economic development by limiting the negative effects of the abuse of natural resources and facilitating family businesses in coastal zones in an effort towards the integration of economic development and social and environmental responsibility.","He, Jianjia Thi Hoai Thuong Mai",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137493,13

In particular, COVID-19 has led to changes in cancer treatment for patients (pts) infected with COVID, which may have long-term implications for both COVID and cancer-related outcomes. In this retrospective analysis, we describe changes in cancer management over time for cancer pts diagnosed with COVID-19 at two academic institutions in Northern California. Methods: Adult and pediatric pts diagnosed with COVID19 receiving active cancer management, defined as therapy/surgery/diagnostics within 3 weeks of COVID diagnosis, were identified through the EMR. Patients whose care was affected by COVID-19 were identified and analyzed for significant intra-group differences with regards to management type, treatment intent, and the time of COVID-19 diagnosis ('early' was defined as March to June 2020 and 'late' as July 2020 to January 2021). The duration and characteristics of such changes were compared across subgroups. Chi-squared test was used to compare the incidence of delays between subgroups. Results: Among 134 COVID-positive pts on active cancer management, 83 (62%) had significant changes in management that consisted primarily of treatment delays. More delays were identified in patients treated with curative intent earlier in the course of the pandemic compared to later (OR 4.1, p=0.022). This difference was not seen among pts treated with palliative intent. In addition, pts on oral (PO) therapy were significantly less likely to have treatment changes than those on IV/IM therapy (OR 0.32, p=0.005). This difference was driven by a decrease in management changes for those on PO therapy in the later time period (OR 0.27, p=0.026). Pts diagnosed later were more likely to have delays due to clinical reasons rather than institutional policy (OR 6.2, P&lt;.005). The median delay in both time frames was 21 days. Comparison of subgroups is shown in the table. Conclusions: We found significant changes in management of cancer pts with COVID-19 that evolved over time. Oncologists have become increasingly willing to continue therapy for cancer pts treated with curative intent and pts on oral therapy. Changes in cancer therapy have become more frequently related to patient clinical status, and less so due to institutional policies. It will be important to analyze how these changes in management are ultimately reflected in cancer outcomes in order to equip patients and oncologists to react to the next pandemic.","Glover, M.; Wu, J.; Kwon, D.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) helps reduce the spread of disease among the population and prevent pandemic scenarios. There are nanoparticles (NPs) with biocidal properties that can improve the functionality of PPE. This article discusses the achievements in developing nanostructured biocides and methods for functionalizing textile materials using NPs from such kind of compounds. This will allow the production of PPE of a new generation with the capabilities of active health protection.

177953,Chikungunya virus requires an intact microtubule network for efficient viral genome delivery,2020-03-25,"Inflammatory control is critical to recovery from respiratory viral infection. Acetylcholine (ACh) secreted from non-neuronal sources, including lymphocytes, plays an important, albeit underappreciated, role in regulating immune-mediated inflammation. This study was designed to explore the role of ACh in acute viral infection and recovery. Using the murine model of influenza A, cholinergic status in the lungs and airway was examined over the course of infection and recovery. The results showed that airway ACh remained constant through the early stage of infection and increased during the peak of the acquired immune response. As the concentration of ACh increased, cholinergic lymphocytes appeared in the airway and lungs. Cholinergic capacity was found primarily in CD4 T cells, but also in B cells and CD8 T cells. The cholinergic CD4+ T cells bound to influenza-specific tetramers at the same frequency as their conventional (i.e., non-cholinergic) counterparts. In addition, they were retained in the lungs throughout the recovery phase and could still be detected in the resident memory regions of the lung up to two months after infection. Histologically, cholinergic lymphocytes were found in direct physical contact with activated macrophages throughout the lung. When ACh production was inhibited, mice exhibited increased tissue inflammation, altered lung architecture, and delayed recovery. Together, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role for ACh in the transition from active immunity to recovery and pulmonary repair following respiratory viral infection.","Horkowitz, Alexander P.; Schwartz, Ashley V.; Alvarez, Carlos A.; Herrera, Edgar B.; Thoman, Marilyn L.; Chatfield, Dale A.; Osborn, Kent G.; Feuer, Ralph; George, Uduak Z.; Phillips, Joy A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.184226,13
178237,Towards complete and error-free genome assemblies of all vertebrate species,2020-05-22,"The value of the company is influenced by a large group of factors that experts should take into account, in the evaluation process, and incorporate into their calculations. The paper is based on the knowledge and experience gained from more than 15 years of forensic practice and more than 60 expert opinions related to determining the value of the company. It clearly states, in selected two representative companies, how significantly creative accounting can influence the final value of the company. Therefore, it is necessary to think about how to eliminate these possible interventions in the process of valuing the company. Background: Creative accounting is an important issue that is being addressed worldwide. It can have significant impacts in many areas, but in the article, we focus specifically on the area of determining the value of the company in the companies of the Slovak Republic. Methods: Several methods are used, such as specifically selected methods of creative accounting, methods of determining the general value of the company’s assets, specifically the property method, and the business method were applied to companies. Subsequently, selected methods of determining creative accounting were used in the work. The Beneish model and the Piotroski model were selected for the needs of the expert’s methodological procedures. Results: From all the findings in our study, it follows that interventions in accounting can have a significant impact on the resulting value of the company. It depends on what kind of intervention is applied to the accounts and whether the expert is able to detect it. Conclusions: The result of the research, which is described in the article, is a proposal for the use of selected methods of detection of creative accounting by experts in the evaluation process. The paper proposes a coefficient of creative accounting, which adjusts the resulting value of the company. It is the first design created by longer-term research. In the process of determining the value of the company in the conditions of the Slovak Republic, interventions of this kind have not yet been applied to the final value. The proposed coefficient is one of several proposals that were the result of the dissertation.","Adámiková, Eva Čorejová Tatiana",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070327,13

When the pandemic came, everything else in our lives moved online, and we encountered new challenges with both our teaching and our scholarship. We were tasked with transitioning our theatre students to a virtual environment while conducting research for our book. We knew what was successful for us, as working online had helped our own practice, but would it be effective for students? And was it possible to write a scholarly book without access to academic libraries and archives? Our experiences over the past year reminded us that it shouldn't require a pandemic to rethink best practices in teaching and research. While the lessons we learned were because of a restructured academic environment, the issues we addressed existed previously and were often ignored.

179268,Gap junction internalization and processing in vivo: a 3D immuno-electron microscopy study,2020-06-30,"Purpose: To determine the incidence of COVID 19 in a series of registered patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, treated by TUR-BT and intravesical BCG. Patients and method: We analysed 127 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, in the medium/high risk group, registered between 2001-2020. The patients and families have been contacted by phone. In this interval, 32 patients deceased (cardiovascular pathologies, non-urologic neoplasia, tumour progression), 95 patients are still alive, 24 women and 71 men. The average age was 61.7 (16-86), the majority being over 50, included in the high-risk group for COVID-19. The patients were resected endoscopically and received a cytostatic instillation within the first 6 hours. Reresection of the tumour bed was practiced in pT1patients. The adjuvant treatment with BCG was used in the induction form at each relapse and maintenance (22 patients), respectively. Until 2005, we used the local strain (Cantacuzino Clinical Institute), after that, the strain from Bulgaria (Calgevax) and Medac (Germany). Results: 95 patients are still alive. Tumour relapses were registered in 34 patients. 3 patients registered tumour progression, resolved through radical cystectomy (2) and irradiation. In 3 cases, upper tract urothelial tumours were registered (nephroureterectomy with perimeatic cystectomy). 63 patients underwent induction treatment, while 22 underwent maintenance treatment. Complications: Intolerance to BCG in 4 patients, BCG cystitis in 5 patients, arthritis in 1 patient, septic status in 2 patients. In the analysed batch of patients, no COVID-19 cases have been registered. Conclusions: It appears that the intravesical administration of BCG represents an immunologic booster (confirmable through PPD), resulting in a reduction of the COVID-19 infection incidence. © 2019 Journal of Innovation Management.

179587,RNA secondary structure packages evaluated and improved by high-throughput experiments,2021-09-02,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder in which sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization triggers red blood cell sickling, chronic hemolysis, anemia and episodic vaso-occlusion. Complications include cumulative organ damage and disability as well as accelerated mortality. OxbrytaTM is a first-in-class therapy that increases hemoglobin (Hb) levels and reduces markers of hemolysis and is FDA-approved for treatment of SCD in patients 12 years of age or older. We report here the single-center experience of patient-perceived benefit in 27 consecutive patients treated with OxbrytaTM tablets for at least 8 weeks. Methods: We collected clinical data on 27 consecutive patients with SCD at The University of Texas Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center under an approved data collection protocol for standard-of-care clinical data. All patients with at least 8 weeks of data collection are included. The Standing Data Collection Protocol was amended to allow collection of Patient Global Impression - Improvement scale (PGI-I) data. Four patients did not have complete laboratory and PGI-I data. Data analysis was done on 23 patients for whom there is information on Hb, retic %, CGI-I, and PGI-I. Seventeen of the patients had complete laboratory data while 23 patients provided PGI-I information. Laboratory test frequency was limited by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Results: Twenty-three patients whose data were analyzed ranged in age from 20 to 66 years, with 65 % being female. HbS genotypes were 91 % SS and 9 % Sβ°-thalassemia. No patient had Sβ+-thalassemia or hemoglobin SC. Table 1 shows the impact of OxbrytaTM on key laboratory parameters. The Hb improved with treatment to a degree comparable to that seen in the HOPE Trial. The healthcare provider assessed each patient for improvement with OxbrytaTM treatment using the 7-point Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I). In addition, each patient provided an assessment of improvement with OxbrytaTM treatment using the 7-point PGI-I scale. Figure 1 shows the results of these assessments. Most patients report substantial improvement which correlates with the clinician impression. We noticed that for some of the patients who reported significant clinical improvement (very much better or much better symptoms) hemoglobin values declined or improved only slightly from baseline (Figure 2). Hence, Hb increase of > 1 g/dL is not needed for clinical improvement. About 30% of the patients reported mild to moderate diarrhea, that was managed with reduction in OxbrytaTM dose until diarrhea improved followed by titration back to recommended dose. For more severe diarrhea, OxbrytaTM was interrupted for 2 to 3 days followed by restart at a lower dose. Conclusions: This study is the first to utilize the 7-point PGI-I scale and CGI-I to assess SCD improvement with OxbrytaTM treatment. Figure 1 shows patient and clinician assessment of change in symptoms or clinical status with OxbrytaTM therapy. Most patients report substantial improvement, which correlates with the clinician impression. The majority of patients (16/23;70%) reported much improved or very much improved symptoms while 22% reported minimally improved and only 8% reported no change in symptoms. The clinician impression correlated well with patients' impression of their improvement. Most of the responses, (19/23;83%), were much improved and very much improved;whereas, 13% were minimally improved and 4% no change. Some patients also mentioned that their energy level improved significantly and that they had less pain at their typical sites of chronic pain while on OxbrytaTM therapy. In this study, patient hemoglobin values improved with treatment to a degree comparable to that seen in the HOPE Trial. Figure 2 shows that clinical improvement can occur for patients whose hemoglobin declined or improved only slightly from baseline. Our data collection is limited due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions;most of the patients were unable to have laboratory assessments as frequently as desired. In summary, our s udy suggests that most sickle cell disease patients perceive benefit with OxbrytaTM therapy in terms of improvement in their condition and level of functioning.

Section 3 and 27(1) of this Act activated the responsible Minister in consultation with other Ministers to issue regulations in response to the disaster. The declaration exposed the already criticised Act to scrutiny by the public. Therefore, this study investigated the Metropolitan Disaster Management Centres that coordinate local events and support the provincial and national disaster management centres, their perceptions concerning the disaster management legislation that mandates them. The study recognised a gap in this regard and saw it imperative to give the disaster managers a voice and a platform to express their opinion concerning the heavily criticised legislation. A model of the policy implementation process guided the study investigation. This model argues that implementation of policies tends to generate tensions, which result in a disruption of the policy formulators’ expectations. The research uses some of the model’s variables to measure the perceptions of disaster managers. Using an interview guide, the researchers conducted virtual interviews with the disaster managers. Scholarly and media articles review concerning the Act formed part of the data collection. The study finds that the disaster managers perceive the disaster management legislation as a very useful guide, an excellent piece of legislation and trust it regardless of the criticism it received.

We report measurements of aerosol and droplet concentrations generated when playing woodwind and brass instruments and comparisons with breathing, speaking, and singing. These measurements were conducted in a room with zero number concentration aerosol background in the 0.5-20 μm diameter size range, allowing clear attribution of detected particles to specific activities. A total of 13 instruments were examined across 9 participants. Respirable particle number concentrations and size distributions for playing instruments are consistent with those from the participant when breathing, based on measurements with multiple participants playing the flute and piccolo as well as measurements across the entire cohort. Due to substantial interparticipant variability, we do not provide a comparative assessment of the aerosol generated by playing different instruments, instead considering only the variation in aerosol yield across all instruments studied. Both particle number and mass concentrations from playing instruments are lower than those from speaking and singing at high volume, and no large droplets &gt;20 μm diameter are detected. Combined, these observations suggest that playing instruments generates less aerosol than speaking or singing at high volumes. Moreover, there is no difference between the aerosol concentrations generated by professional and amateur performers while breathing, speaking, or singing, suggesting conclusions for professional singers may also apply to amateurs.

Moreover, epistasis has long been recognized as a significant component in understanding evolution of complex genetic systems. We present a backward coalescent model EpiSimRA, that builds multiple loci selection, with multi-way (k-way) epistasis for any arbitrary k. Starting from arbitrary extant populations with epistatic sites, we trace the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), sampling relevant recombination and coalescent events. Our framework allows for studying different complex evolutionary scenarios in the presence of selective sweeps, positive and negative selection with multiway epistasis. We also present a forward counterpart of the coalescent model based on a Wright-Fisher (WF) process which we use as a validation framework, comparing the hallmarks of the ARG between the two. We provide the first framework that allows a nose-to-nose comparison of multiway epistasis in a coalescent simulator with its forward counterpart with respect to the hallmarks of the ARG. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, that EpiSimRA is consistently superior in term of performance (seconds vs. hours) in comparison to the forward model without compromising on its accuracy.

182186,An Accurate Free Energy Method for Solvation of Organic Compounds and Binding to Proteins,2020-05-28,"Accurate prediction of the stock price is necessary for efficient financial decision making and reconstruction planning, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Meanwhile, the ARIMA model with neural network approach is a hybrid statistical model that has been used widely in finance and statistics. It could solve the non-linearity problem in ARIMA. However, based on the unreliable sampling variation, the unbalance between the linearity and nonlinearity parts in the hybrid model could lead to inaccurate prediction. This matter motivates the purpose of this study, where the authors aim to balance the linearity and nonlinearity of the hybrid model towards predicting the Islamic investment during the Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO). In this study, Islamic investment is analyzed using statistical based model of ARIMA. In order to balance linearity and nonlinearity parts of ARIMA which is outperforming the unreliable sampling variation, the aggregating bootstrap approach is used on ARIMA. The resampled linearity and nonlinearity parts will be declared as inputs of neural network system in order to predict the Islamic investment. Resampled nonlinearity part will be generated in this system and its sampling variation is examined. In addition, the performance of model procedure is estimated. It shows that the aggregating bootstrap gives smaller bias values and generates small weights in neural network system. In terms of prediction, applying the resampled procedure in neural network system eventually increases the precision of prediction estimation where it reduces the error estimation of MAE and MSE. Also, the prediction values continually align with actual values of investment at MCO phase. Balancing the linearity and nonlinearity part using the aggregating bootstrap in major procedure of prediction field contributes to high precise prediction of Islamic investment return estimation. The uncertainty of investment returns during MCO phase is a challenging phase and affects Malaysia financial trading. By considering using alternative procedure proposed in this study, i.e. helps in providing accuracy of investment prediction returns, a well-construct financial decisions and plans could be structured during MCO. However, this study limits to examine the effect of aggregating bootstrap. For further research, it is suggested to apply prediction on 10 years returns of Islamic investment using the proposed method. © 2021 Horizon Research Publishing.

She demonstrates that the incompleteness of EU citizenship rights generated policy failures, which in turn triggered litigation and provided European courts the opportunity to push the meaning of EU citizenship forward - all in keeping with the failing forward framework. At the other end of the continuum, in areas where the EU has very little or no competence such as defense and security or neighborhood policy, while supranational actors may seek to leverage the crisis to press for a greater EU role, they may not be in the position to exercise much leverage over national decision-makers. Apart from areas like trade and competition, where EU authority is very extensive, and areas like defense and foreign policy, where it is minimal, most other policy domains the EU is engaged with - from Economic and Monetary Union, to most regulatory policies - fall into the middle of the spectrum where policy competences are shared between the EU and the Member States.

Vaccines’ development against this provided a beacon of hope. India approved different vaccines under emergency use authorization but distribution of vaccines and vaccination of huge population was a challenging task. We attempted to review the vaccination program from an ethics perspective. Methods The core ethical principles of healthcare and other tenets put forth in discussion papers on addressing ethical issues in pandemic influenza planning, ethical considerations in developing a public health response to pandemic influenza and World Health Organization (WHO) Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination were used to identify the ethical concerns in the vaccination program of the country. Relevant ministry guidelines, documents, websites etc., were accessed. Results The program tried addressing many of the ethical principles laid out in various international documents. Approving indigenously produced vaccines upheld the principle of utility while prioritizing health care workers for vaccination was an example of reciprocity. However, vaccine approval without availability of trial results in public domain raised apprehensions and lacked transparency. Lack of well-defined mechanism to facilitate vaccination for socially disadvantaged groups compromises equity. Conclusion Overall, the program fared well on most aspects of ethical principles, but there were few gaps which still exist. These should be taken care of as the country advances further into vaccination program to garner enhanced public trust in the scientific, regulatory and administrative authorities.","Sharma, Priyanka; Pardeshi, Geeta",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402121003349; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121003349?v=s5,13

Governments all over the world have begun to strengthen biosafety measures, and there is an urgent need for effective materials to deal with biosafety threats. Antimicrobial material is an important component of biosafety materials, and is committed to solve the thorny biosafety problem of microbial infections. Traditional antimicrobial strategies include sterilization, antimicrobial adhesion and antimicrobial composite. The traditional strategy is mainly based on sterilization, which takes effect quickly. However, the antimicrobial agents used in materials are easy to lose, thus making poor biocompatibility. What′s worse, it may lead to microbial resistance issue. Therefore, the development of new antimicrobial strategies is of great significance. The stereochemical strategy is based on the reversible recognition of the microbes on a material surface, allowing the microbes to autonomously leave the surface when they distinguish the stereochemical signals of the materials. This strategy, in line with the development trend, can effectively inhibit the adhesion, propagation and spread of various microorganisms. This review briefly summarizes the research progress of antibacterial materials in the past five years, and the current researches of stereochemical antimicrobial strategies. The new concept for a management and control of microbial behavior is further discussed. © 2021, Science in China Press. All rights reserved.","Xie, Z. X.; Zhang, P.

Pregnant and postpartum women are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, increased stress, depression, and anxiety. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the perception of food insecurity (FI) and perceived stress in pregnant and postpartum women with rheumatic disease during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted. Patients from to the pregnancy and rheumatic diseases clinic of the University Hospital Dr. José E. González in Northeast Mexico evaluated between August to October 2020 were included. The Spanish validated versions of the Household Food Security Access Scale (HFIAS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were applied by telephonic interview. The WHO recommendations were employed to determine the appropriate intake for each food group in a week. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine normality of the data. The Spearman correlation coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 29 women were included. Six (20.6%) women were found to have moderate or severe degrees of food insecurity. In addition, 12 (40.30%) perceived moderate and severe levels of stress in the PSS-10. No relationship was found between food insecurity and perceived stress (p= 0.059). The food groups that exceeded the recommended weekly frequency were oils and sugars exceeded 3.9 and 2.9 frequencies, respectively. Conclusion: We found that 20.6% women suffered household food insecurity and 40.3% suffered moderate and severe levels of stress. No relationship was found between food insecurity with the HIFAS scale and perceived stress measures with the PSS-10. We found that oils and sugars exceeded more by the double of the recommended frequency per week.","Espinosa Banuelos, L. G.; Ancer Rodríguez, P. R.; Herrera López, M. G.; Skinner Taylor, C.

183337,Virus-specific and bystander CD8 T cells recruited during virus-induced encephalomyelitis.,2005,"Introduction: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was recognised there would be an increased demand on clinicians to provide patients and relatives with bad news. The national ban on hospital visiting rapidly changed the way in which this news would be delivered. In recognition of these new challenges, our team sought to design a teaching course that could be implemented quickly and cost effectively, with the aim of improving clinician's confidence around these difficult skills. Methods: A teaching programme was created using senior geriatric and palliative care clinicians as simulated patients, open to any grade and speciality. Learners were required to break bad news (BBN) without any visual feedback, to simulate skills required when using the telephone. Surveys were collected to determine self -assessed confidence across four domains (Table 1) before, immediately after and 4-20 weeks after the course. Participants were asked to rank their confidence for each skill on a 5 point scale with 1 being very unsure and 5 being very confident. Results: Pre-teaching scores showed an average of 3 (neither confident nor unsure) across all domains. After the course all domains improved, most notably around discussing end of life (EoL) care and discussing information over the phone. Conclusion: This project has highlighted a lack of confidence across all skill levels when it comes to BBN. This confidence is easily improved by a short, cost-effective teaching course. It remains to be seen if this improved confidence translates to better communication with relatives.

The proposed methodology considers quantum computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating from physics and utilizes quantum programming as an educational tool to reinforce the learning process. Background: Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity. Intended outcomes: This study aims to inform academics and organizations interested in introducing quantum computing to a diverse group of participants on an educational approach. It is intended that the proposed methodology would facilitate people from diverse backgrounds to enter the field Application design: The introductory quantum physics content is bypassed and the quantum computing concepts are introduced through linear algebra instead. Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by the participants. Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.","Salehi, Ozlem; Seskir, Zeki; Tepe, .Ilknur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13552v4.pdf,13

Cel badawczy: Głównym celem artykułu jest podjęcie refleksji nad stanem samorządności w Polsce, w szczególności przeprowadzenie krytycznej oceny poziomu autonomii finansowej jednostek samorządu terytorialnego w Polsce. Metoda badawcza: Artykuł rozpoczyna przegląd literatury odnoszącej się do kluczowych z punktu widzenia tematu koncepcji - subsydiarności, decentralizacji oraz autonomii finansowej. W artykule pojawiają się m.in. odniesienia do wybranych podejść do operacjonalizacji pojęcia 'autonomii finansowej' i pomiaru jej poziomu, w oparciu o które prowadzona jest dalsza analiza i dyskusja. Wnioski: Artykuł kończy się wezwaniem do zainicjowania powszechnej debaty nad przyszłością polskiego samorządu terytorialnego. Debata taka wydaje się być niezbędna w świetle dotychczasowych trendów oraz spodziewanych w niedalekiej przyszłości skutków omawianych w tekście zmian przepisów prawa jak również wpływu pandemii koronawirusa, które stopniowo, lecz nieubłagalnie prowadzą do erozji modelu samorządności, który trzy dekady temu oparty został na założeniu o kluczowej roli znacznej autonomii finansowej.Alternate abstract:Background: Past changes in Polish local and regional governments' financial autonomy give rise to the question whether local and regional governments in Poland still have sufficient financial autonomy to perform in line with the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity. Dimensions of special concern are revenue as well as selected recent legislation changes' potential future impact on Polish local and regional governments' financial autonomy in terms of both revenue and expenditure. Research purpose: The main objective of the article is to reflect upon the notion of local and regional self-governance, and to critically assess the current degree of financial autonomy of local and regional governments in Poland. Methods: The article starts with a review of literature covering key concepts - subsidiarity, fiscal decentralisation, and local governments' financial autonomy. Some of the approaches used to operationalise and measure financial autonomy are also highlighted and later used in the analysis and discussion. Conclusions: The article ends with a call for general debate on the future of local and regional governments in Poland as the past trends and expected future developments - in light of discussed legislation changes as well as the potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic - demonstrate the gradual erosion of the local governance model, which was founded three decades ago on a premise of strong financial autonomy.","TuraŁa, Maciej",Studia Prawno-Ekonomiczne,https://doi.org/10.26485/spe/2020/117/18,13
184521,Vaccines: all things considered.,2006,"This policy brief argues that the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the fractures in the contemporary global socio-technical order and offers the prospects of several different alternative futures. The policy brief explores the pandemic through the lens of the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions. The pandemic is framed as a meta-transition event at the landscape level of unprecedented scale, pace, and pervasiveness such that it permeates all socio-technical regimes simultaneously. The prospects for the future are then defined on a matrix that compares the strength of civil society and that of economic structures. The result is four distinct scenarios that are linked to contemporary discourses on socio-economic futures: business as usual; managed transition; chaotic transition; and managed degrowth. The scenarios are presented as a starting point for policy discussion and the engagement of societal actors to define social and economic possibilities for the future, and the implications that the different futures would have for ecological burdens. It is concluded that the COVID 19 pandemic can act as a catalytic event in which the legitimacy and efficacy of existing economic and political structures will be challenged and reshaped, and hence is an opportunity to redefine the ecological burdens our activities create.","Wells, Peter; Abouarghoub, Wessam; Pettit, Stephen; Beresford, Anthony",Sustainability Sci.

Adherent cell-mediated protection.",1980,"Although several vaccination campaigns have been launched to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the primary treatment of suspected infected people is still symptomatic. In particular, the analysis of images derived from computed tomography (CT) appears to be useful for retrospectively analyzing the novel coronavirus and the chest injuries it causes. The growing body of literature on this topic shows the predominance of supervised learning methods that are typically adopted to automatically discriminate pathological patients from normal controls. However, very little work has been done from an unsupervised perspective. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline for automatic clustering of CT scans of COVID-19 patients based on deep learning. A pre-trained convolutional neural network is used for feature extraction;then, the extracted features are used as input to a deep embedding clustering model to perform the final clustering. The method was tested on the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan dataset that not only provides scans of COVID patients but also of patients with other lung conditions. The results obtained indicate that the radiological features of COVID patients largely overlap with those of other lung diseases. Unsupervised approaches to COVID analysis are promising, as they reduce the need for hard-to-collect human annotations and allow for deeper analysis not tied to a binary or multiclass classification task. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bemportato, P.; Casalino, G.; Castellano, G.; Vessio, G.","18th International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence, MDAI 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85529-1_19,13

Thus, electric carsharing is encouraged to be adopted for daily trips, and the operators propose the friend-invitation promotion scheme for the membership expansion. This study explores the effectiveness of this scheme and the characteristics of the scheme participants and their invited friends (e.g., age, friend-invitation pattern, and EV rental pattern). The analysis found that 28.4% of these invited friends would make at least one EV rental after registration, whereas 30.4% of the other members who registered in the same period would do so, indicating that these invited friends were less active. Therefore, suggestions are given based on the EV rental pattern of these invited friends (preferring a longer journey using a smaller but cheaper EV) to enhance the effectiveness of the friend-invitation promotion scheme.","Xie, Jiemin Sun Tuo Yang Shuangjian",Journal of Advanced Transportation,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6577439,13

This was alongside all the disruption with their personal lives and blurred boundaries between home and work.Research indicates that some established benefits of Balint groups include;feeling more supported and more validated;better interpersonal outcomes in the Doctor- patient encounter;higher feelings of job satisfaction and generally feeling less isolated and less burnt out. (Kieldmand & Holmstrom 2008;Benson & McGrath 2005).We hope that the experience of Balint support group will be a start of peer emotional support group among medical staff in acute services where a safe, confidential space is created and continued to grow among group members. This is prioritising compassion at the heart of leadership and utilising creative ways of empowering employees and promoting staff wellbeing in such crisis.A qualitative study will be conducted half way into running the groups focusing on subjective experience of the attendees as well as burnout indicators.We anticipate poor initial engagement will be an issue due to stigma, exhaustion and lack of exposure to Balint.In crisis such as Covid-19 pandemic leaders has to be innovative using resources smartly and also inclusive on welcoming and promoting new ideas in order to support staff wellbeing.Introduction of Balint group to other specialities will offer them tools to maintain a safe confidential peer support system at the time of crisis as well as normal times in order to reduce burn out.","Self, Mary Mehrpooya Neda",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.150,13

Methods SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the CDC (USA) real-time RT-PCR primers, probes and protocols. Cytokine concentrations were measured using commercial reagents based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results TNF-α median levels were greater in COVID19 (+) symptomatic group (5.88 (1.36 - 172.1) pg/ml) compared to COVID19 (−) symptomatic individuals (2.87 (1.45 – 69.9) pg/ml) (p=0.0003). No significant differences were shown in IL-6 median values between COVID-19 (+) and (−) symptomatic patients (5.40 (1.7 - 467) pg/ml and 6.07 (1.57 – 466.6) pg/ml respectively).

Conclusions We found a statistically significant association between the production of local TNF-α and the presence of the virus in early stages of infection. IL-6 showed high levels in swabs from some symptomatic patients but independent from SARS-CoV-2 presence and viral load, individual’s age and gender. On the contrary, TNF-α evaluation confirmed the presence of inflammatory response but mostly related to COVID-19.

Going online for months surely tests the ability of educators to deliver student centered and interactive learning in a challenging environment. Learner centeredness, in general, implies learning in which the learner’s responsibilities and activities are emphasized compared to that of the instructor’s. This does not mean that the educator’s role is weakened. Professors must be active in providing feedback about misconceptions and confusions to help students grow into experts. They should also clarify the relation between class projects with the course objectives and the real world, and help students with low competencies develop strategies for solving open-ended problems. Students want to think like an expert and apply their skills for solving real world problems. They also desire academic growth by modeling deep insight from their professors. The educator’s role for providing meaningful guidance has become more critical than ever especially for first or second year students who may need more scaffolding for their intellectual development. However, when online classes are carried out for a prolonged time, students’ self-regulation subsides, and the yearn for ‘togetherness’ rises, making it difficult to maintain learner centeredness.

These signals could act by directing retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment or by preventing exit from the TGN. To investigate the mechanism of localization of yeast TGN proteins, we used the heterologous protein A-ALP (consisting of the cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [DPAP A] fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of the vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), which localizes to the yeast TGN. Insertion of the aromatic residue–based TGN localization motif (FXFXD) of DPAP A into the cytosolic domain of ALP results in a protein that resides in the TGN. We demonstrate that the FXFXD motif confers Golgi localization through retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment by detecting a post-Golgi processed form of this protein in the TGN. We present an assay that uncouples retrieval-mediated Golgi localization from static retention-based localization, allowing measurement of the rate at which proteins exit the yeast TGN. We also demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of DPAP A contains additional information, separate from the retrieval motif, that slows exit from the TGN. We propose a model for DPAP A localization that involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which the FXFXD motif directs retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment, and a second that slows the rate at which DPAP A exits the TGN.","Bryant, Nia J.; Stevens, Tom H.",J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2134822/,13

New therapeutic strategies employ a wide range of molecular tools such as bacterial plasmids containing transgenic inserts, RNA interference and aptamers. A nucleic-acid based constitution confers a lower immunogenic potential and as result of the high stringency selection of large molecular variety, these drugs have high affinity and selectivity for their targets. However, nucleic acids have poor biostability thus requiring chemical modifications and delivery systems to maintain their activity and ease their cellular internalization.

186575,Differential susceptibility of cultured neural cells to the human coronavirus OC43.,1985,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has brought deteriorating physical and mental burdens to health care workers (HCWs) in Indonesia, mainly attributed to the lack of protection and screening among HCWs, patients’ concealment of their travel and medical history, and perceived social stigma and discrimination. Hence, we deliver our perspectives and recommendations based on the current situation in Indonesia to enforce their safeties. We encourage stakeholders to implement a systematic approach by employing stringent prevention strategies, ensuring adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) provision and equitable PPE distribution, and routine HCWs screening to prevent nosocomial clusters, in addition to the provision of psychosocial support to HCWs by offering social aids and psychological sessions. Furthermore, social stigma and discrimination toward HCWs and patients should also be addressed and mitigated, thus preventing concealments of patients’ history and alleviating emotional burdens. We believe that providing continuous support to HCWs would lead to key benefits in ensuring a winning battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: HCWs are pivotal players in winning the battle against the COVID- 19 pandemic. Ensuring their safety and well-being will enable them to deliver better healthcare services, thus resulting in mutual benefit for themselves, the patients, and the nation’s recovery.","Lazarus, Gilbert; Meyer, Markus; Depfenhart, Markus; Tjahjadi, Angela Kimberly; Dewayanti, Santi Rahayu; Dakota, Iwan; Siswanto, Bambang Budi",J Clin Transl Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445625/,13

The results were compared with those obtained from the identical anatomical sites of 2 HIV-1-seropositive patients without ""oral hairy leukoplakia"", 3 clinically healthy HIV-1-seronegative patients, and 2 HIV-1-negative patients suffering from oral leukoplakia on their lateral tongues. In all 3 cases investigated, EBV DNA was detected in cells taken from ""oral hairy leukoplakia"" by filter in situ hybridization. In addition, EBV DNA was found in cells taken from clinically normal epithelia of the tongue as well as in those taken from the 2 leukoplakias mentioned. EBV DNA was regularly detected on the lateral margin of the tongue, but only in one case on the pharyngeal mucosa.

METHODS Normocapnic hypoxia was induced in 40 male Landrace/Large White piglets. Reoxygenation was initiated when the animals developed bradycardia (HR <60 beats/min) or severe hypotension (MAP <15 mmHg). The animals were divided into four groups based on the oxygen (O(2)) concentration used for reoxygenation; groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received 18%, 21%, 40%, and 100% O(2), respectively. The animals were further classified into five groups based on the time required for reoxygenation: A: fast recovery (<15 min); B: medium recovery (15-45 min); C: slow recovery (45-90 min); D: very slow recovery (>90 min), and E: nine deceased piglets. RESULTS Histology revealed changes in all heart specimens. Interstitial edema, a wavy arrangement, hypereosinophilia and coagulative necrosis of cardiomyocytes were observed frequently. No differences in the incidence of changes were observed among groups 1-4, whereas marked differences regarding the frequency and the degree of changes were found among groups A-E. Coagulative necrosis was correlated with increased recovery time: this condition was detected post-asphyxia in 14%, 57%, and 100% of piglets with fast, medium, and slow or very slow recovery rates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The significant myocardial histological changes observed suggest that this experimental model might be a reliable model for investigating human neonatal cardiac hypoxia-related injury. No correlation was observed between the severity of histological changes and the fiO(2) used during reoxygenation. Severe myocardial changes correlated strictly with recovery time, suggesting an unreported individual susceptibility of myocardiocytes to hypoxia, possibly leading to death after the typical time-sequence of events.","Faa, Armando; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Xanthos, Theodoros; Locci, Annalisa; Pampaloni, Pietro; Aroni, Filippia; Papalois, Apostolos; Faa, Gavino; Fanos, Vassilios",Clinics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22666796/,13

The challenges and the quickly rising public interest when a virus is becoming a threat has significantly influenced computational drug discovery. The most obvious example is anti-AIDS research, where HIV protease and reverse transcriptase have triggered enormous efforts in developing and improving computational methods. Methods applied to anti-viral research include (i) ligand-based approaches that rely on known active compounds to extrapolate biological activity, such as machine learning techniques or classical QSAR, (ii) structure-based methods that rely on an experimentally determined 3D structure of the targets, such as molecular docking or molecular dynamics, and (iii) universal approaches that can be applied in a structure- or ligand-based way, such as 3D QSAR or 3D pharmacophore elucidation. In this review we summarize these molecular modeling approaches as they were applied to fight anti-viral diseases and highlight their importance for anti-viral research. We discuss the role of computational chemistry in the development of small molecules as agents against HIV integrase, HIV-1 protease, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the influenza virus M2 channel protein, influenza virus neuraminidase, the SARS coronavirus main proteinase and spike protein, thymidine kinases of herpes viruses, hepatitis c virus proteins and other flaviviruses as well as human rhinovirus coat protein and proteases, and other picornaviridae. We highlight how computational approaches have helped in discovering anti-viral activities of natural products and give an overview on polypharmacology approaches that help to optimize drugs against several viruses or help to optimize the metabolic profile of and anti-viral drug.","Kirchmair, Johannes; Distinto, Simona; Liedl, Klaus Roman; Markt, Patrick; Rollinger, Judith Maria; Schuster, Daniela; Spitzer, Gudrun Maria; Wolber, Gerhard",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21303343/,13

The T lymphocyte subsets were counted by flow cytometry using fluorescence-labeled specific monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS A significant decrease was observed in all SARS patients in their peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte absolute counts [256 (104) x 10(6)/L and 256 (117) x 10(6)/L, respectively], which were also lower than those of the patients infected with HIV, CMV and EBV. All patients infected with HIV, CMV and EBV had significantly higher CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts in comparison with normal controls.

Here we show that SARS-CoV could inhibit both virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling, two key steps of the antiviral response. We mapped a strong inhibitory activity to SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited the activation of all three virus-dependent signaling pathways. We show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited IFN-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 while having little effect on those of STAT2, JAK1, and TYK2. We engineered an attenuated mutant of nsp1 in SARS-CoV through reverse genetics, and the resulting mutant virus was viable and replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective IFN response. However, mutant virus replication was strongly attenuated in cells with an intact IFN response. Thus, nsp1 is likely a virulence factor that contributes to pathogenicity by favoring SARS-CoV replication.","Wathelet, Marc G; Orr, Melissa; Frieman, Matthew B; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17715225/,13

METHODS Pulmonary function tests were performed in 26 SARS convalescent patients regularly every 3 months after their discharge from hospital. The significance of changes in pulmonary function indexes was analyzed. RESULTS Restrictive pulmonary ventilation function and diffusing dysfunction of the lung were found in one third of the patients during third to sixth month from onset. There was a little improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV(1.0)), functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) as convalescent period was prolonged, but no difference was found between different stages (3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months, 12-15 months and 15-17 months). Meanwhile, the FEV(1.0)/FVC showed no significant change. However, there was an obvious improvement in total lung capacity (TLC) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with the elapse of time, and also a significant difference was found between the later stage and the earlier stage. CONCLUSION Pulmonary dysfunction is found among some SARS patients after convalescence presenting mainly as restrictive ventilatory function and diffusing capacity abnormality. These dysfunctions would improve gradually with the elapse of time.","Zheng, Ze-guang; Chen, Rong-chang; Wu, Hua; Liu, Xiao-qing; He, Wei-qun; Xu, Yuan-da; Chen, Si-bei; Li, Yi-min; Zheng, Jin-ping; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970093/,13

189438,Capsid coding sequence is required for efficient replication of human rhinovirus 14 RNA.,1996,"Theiler's virus and Mengo virus are representatives of the Cardiovirus genus within the picornavirus family. Their genome is an 8-kilobase long positive strand RNA molecule. This RNA molecule plays three roles in infected cells: It serves as a messenger RNA, acts as a template for genome replication, and is encapsidated to form progeny virions. We observed that a cis-acting signal required for replication of Theiler's virus was contained within a 130-nt stretch of the region encoding the capsid protein VP2. This RNA sequence does not influence internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation initiation and thus likely acts directly as a signal for the replication complex. We found a similar signal in the VP2-coding sequence of Mengo virus, and both signals could be functionally exchanged. Within the replication element, a 9-nt sequence that is highly conserved among cardioviruses was shown to be essential for replication. This conserved sequence was contained in mostly unpaired regions of the RNA secondary structure predicted for the replication elements of the various cardioviruses. Interestingly, a similar replication element has been reported to occur in the distantly related human rhinovirus type 14, suggesting that such elements could be conserved throughout the picornavirus family. However, the different location of the replication elements in rhinovirus and cardioviruses, and the fact that they were not functionally exchangeable, is raising intriguing questions about the evolution of such signals in picornaviruses.","Lobert, P E; Escriou, N; Ruelle, J; Michiels, T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10500216/,13

Cell-free virions consist of a rod-shaped nucleocapsid (120-150x19-22 nm) similar to that seen in baculoviruses. The virion has a bacilliform shape (170-200x75-88 nm) reminiscent of rhabdoviruses with an envelope containing coronavirus-like spikes (20-25 nm). DF 24/00 replicated well in various fish cell lines. Inhibitor studies with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine indicated that the viral genome consists of RNA and chloroform sensitivity correlated with ultrastructural demonstration of enveloped virions. The buoyant density of the virus determined in sucrose was 1.17-1.19 g/ml. Preliminary biochemical characterization revealed the presence of six antigenic glycoproteins, three of which contain sugars with concanavalin-A specificity. Ultrastructurally, morphogenesis of virus progeny was detected only in the cytoplasm. Nucleocapsids were observed to bud through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus into dilated vesicles. Egress of mature virions occurs primarily by exocytosis and, only very rarely, by budding directly at the plasma membrane. Morphologically similar viruses had previously been isolated from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), blue crab (Callinectis sapidus), European shore crab (Carcinus maenas) and shrimp (Penaeus monodon).

A group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) has been identified in horseshoe bats. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function. The significance of these findings in relation to virus origin, virus recombination, and host switching is discussed.","Ren, Wuze; Qu, Xiuxia; Li, Wendong; Han, Zhenggang; Yu, Meng; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Shu-Yi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Deng, Hongkui; Shi, Zhengli",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18077725/,13

The interface fires occurred within the boundaries of the Interior Health Authority, 1 of 5 health authorities responsible for the delivery of health services in their respective areas of the province. The British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BCCDC) managed the SARS crisis in the province. Both organizations subsequently conducted quality management reviews of their handling of these emergency situations. This article reports on the quality management review of health services delivery during the interface fires and explores the role of physicians during regional emergencies. A similar report was published in the Spring 2004 edition of Quality Management in Health Care on the way SARS was managed at the BCCDC. This article also compares managing a foreseeable emergency situation, such as a wildland-urban interface fire, with managing the unknown, which describes the situation during the initial stages of SARS. The realities confronting the unknown, and the need to manage the situation such that learning and discovery environments are allowed to come into being and evolve rapidly, are discussed.","Lynch, Tim; Dauphinee, Wayne",Quality management in health care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15739578/,13

DESIGN AND SETTING Literature review and two cohort studies in a tertiary care hospital in Toronto, Canada. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS ARDS and SARS patients. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Review articles from the social sciences and medicine are summarized and our own experience with two longitudinal studies is drawn upon to elucidate strategies that can be successfully used to attenuate participant drop-out from longitudinal studies. Three key areas for retention of subjects are identified from the literature: (a) respect for patients: respect for their ideas and their time commitment to the research project; (b) tracking: collect information on many patient contacts at the initiation of the study and outline tracking procedures for subjects lost to follow-up; and (c) study personnel: interpersonal skills must be reinforced, flexible working hours mandated, and support offered. Our 5-year ARDS and 1-year SARS study retention rates were 86% and 91%, respectively, using these methods. CONCLUSIONS Strategies to reduce patient attrition are time consuming but necessary to preserve internal and external validity. When the follow-up system is working effectively, researchers can acquire the necessary data to advance knowledge in their field and patients are satisfied that they have an important role to play in the research project.","Tansey, Catherine M; Matté, Andrea L; Needham, Dale; Herridge, Margaret S",Intensive care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17701161/,13

Cancer specimens and the surrounding normal tissue counterparts were separately collected from cervical cancer patients undergoing type III radical hysterectomy. Paired total RNA (cancer and normal tissues) was isolated and analyzed with cDNA microarrays containing duplicate spots of 7 334 sequence-verified human cDNA clones. Selected differentially expressed genes specific for AC or SC were further verified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Genes, including CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P and MSLN were upregulated in AC. Contrarily, genes involved in epidermal differentiation complex such as S100A9 and ANXA8 were upregulated in SC. Cross-validation of the results using an independent but comparable group of patients with known long-term outcomes (n = 63, median follow-up 70.3 months; range, 4-208 months) showed that the correlation between the selected 6 differentially expressed genes and histology was highly significant. CEACAM5 (p < 0.0001) and TACSTD1 (p = 0.009) were significant prognostic factors by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The combination of cDNA microarray, RTQ-PCR and immunohistochemical results of this study showed that it is possible to define different gene profiles for AC and SC. Moreover, TACSTD1 expression may be a novel poor prognostic factor.","Chao, Angel; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Lee, Yun-Shien; Hsueh, Swei; Chao, An-Shine; Chang, Ting-Chang; Kung, Wei-Hsiang; Huang, Shang-Lang; Chao, Fang-Yu; Wei, Min-Li; Lai, Chyong-Huey",International journal of cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16450401/,13

Genomic RNA was extracted and tailed with adenine residues at the 3' end with poly-A polymerase. Double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized, using the poly-A-tailed RNA as a template and oligo-dT as a primer, and then cloned into the pUC9 plasmid. Virus-specific cDNA sequences, varying in length from 0.5 to 2.5 kilobases (kb), were obtained. One BVDV-specific sequence of cloned cDNA, 1.1 kb in length and with an internal Pst I restriction endonuclease cleavage site, was selected for use as a probe. The cloned cDNA insert was removed from the plasmid either with or without flanking plasmid sequences and labeled with 32P-nucleotides by nick translation for use as hybridization probes for BVDV. The performance of probes of smaller fragments of the insert was compared to that of the intact sequence in hybridization assays. In addition, 2 methods of specimen preparation were compared to establish optimum parameters for hybridization. The hybridization assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than infectivity assays for BVDV in infected cell cultures. Freezing of specimens reduced by 10-fold the sensitivity of hybridization for BVDV target sequences. The probes prepared from the cloned cDNA hybridized with all cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV strains tested but not with uninfected cell cultures, cellular ribosomal RNA, bovine coronavirus, bluetongue virus, or bovine adenovirus 3. Probes prepared with native plasmid DNA did not hybridize with BVDV or uninfected cell cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Potgieter, L N; Brock, K V","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2562207/,13

These challenges include the risk of mixed infections and/or a possible collision of the two epidemics (“twindemia”) with a potentially serious impact on individual health and public health. In this report, we discuss the results of the published stu-dies and conclude that the catastrophic collision of the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 epidemics is unlikely when efficient non-pharmaceutical public health measures are applied to control or mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence, including the extremely low seasonal influenza activity registered in the Southern Hemisphere in 2020. On the other hand, the existence of mixed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections has been demonstrated in humans. The continuing uncertainty about the occurrence and potential severity of these mixed infections emphasizes the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination in the current epidemiological situation and raises the need to: (i) ensure vaccine availability, (ii) facilitate access to safe seasonal influenza vaccination under the conditions of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, and (iii) promote the vaccine to the public.","Mezencev, R; Klement, C; Dluholucký, S","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

Regions vary in terms of their congruence with regional structures for partner agencies, such as emergency management agencies, as well as hospital and health services markets and organizational structure. Some focus on building formal organizational relationships to coordinate and sometimes standardize preparedness and response activities or build regional capacity, while others focus on building informal professional networks. Whatever the approach, strong leadership and trust are required for effective planning, emergency response, and sustainability. This article suggests that regionalization improves emergency preparedness by allowing for more efficient use of resources and better coordination and demonstrated progress in terms of planning and coordination; regional capacity-building, training, and exercises; and development of professional networks.","Stoto, Michael A",Public health reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18763406/,13

In order to understand the acquired tropism of the Beaudette strain, we compared the S protein sequences of several IBV strains. The Beaudette strain was found to contain a putative heparan sulfate (HS)-binding site, indicating that the Beaudette virus may use HS as a selective receptor. To ascertain the requirements of cell-surface HS for Beaudette infectivity, we assayed for infectivity in the presence of soluble heparin as a competitor and determined infectivity in mutant cell lines with no HS or glycosaminoglycan expression. Our results indicate that HS plays a role as an attachment factor for IBV, working in concert with other factors like sialic acid to mediate virus binding to cells, and may explain in part the extended tropism of IBV Beaudette.","Madu, Ikenna G; Chu, Victor C; Lee, Hwajin; Regan, Andrew D; Bauman, Beverley E; Whittaker, Gary R",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17461266/,13

They were fabricated on a microarray and tested with sera from SARS patients. Antigenic screening indicated that recombinant GST-N2 fusion protein, the carboxy-terminus 213aa-423aa of N protein, was strongest positive and weakest non-specific compared with others. An indirect antibody ELISA method was developed and clinical positive and negative sera for their antibodies against GST-N2 fusion protein were assayed. 311 out of the 442 sera from clinical SARS inpatients, as well as 229 out of 302 sera from convalescent patients gave positive reactivities; positive rates were 70.4% and 75.8% respectively. Sera from a total of 2726 non-SARS patients and healthy individuals were tested and the false positive rate was only 0.07%. When the sensitivity control sample was diluted 1 : 64, it yielded OD values above the cutoff value. Reported data showed that this was a relatively high degree of sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV antibody testing. The data indicate that GST-N2 fusion protein, which was screened by protein microarray, may be a valuable diagnostic antigen for the development of serological assays for SARS. In addition, protein microarray assay presents a higher positive rate and sensitivity (86.1% and 1 : 200) compared with the traditional ELISA screening method, and could provide a rapid, parallel and high-throughput antigen screening platform.","Lu, Dan-Dan; Chen, Su-Hong; Zhang, Shi-Meng; Zhang, Min-Li; Zhang, Wei; Bo, Xiao-Chen; Wang, Sheng-Qi",The Analyst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15776156/,13

192075,Identification of residues critical for the human coronavirus 229E receptor function of human aminopeptidase N.,1997,"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS in which the histology and clinical course is similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Disease pathogenesis is primarily due to T-cell-mediated destruction of myelin, which has been attributed to cytopathic effects of the virus, but immune-mediated destruction of myelin mediated via both virus-specific and myelin-specific T cells appear to play the major role. To determine if bone marrow transplantation would be an effective therapy for a virus-initiated autoimmune disease and to better separate viral cytopathic effects from immune-mediated demyelination, we ablated the immune system of TMEV-infected animals with 1,100 cGy total body irradiation, and then the animal's immunity was reconstituted by transplantation of disease-susceptible SJL/J mice with syngeneic marrow or disease-susceptible DBA/2J with marrow from disease-resistant (C57Bl/6 x DBA/2)F1 (B6D2) donors. Hematopoietic transplant performed after onset of disease resulted in 42% mortality in SJL/J syngeneic transplants, 47% mortality in diseased DBA2 recipients restored with marrow from naive B6D2 donors, and 12% in diseased DBA2 recipients receiving marrow from B6D2 donors previously infected with TMEV. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to both virion and myelin proteins was decreased in surviving mice that underwent transplantation; however, CNS viral titers were significantly elevated compared with nontransplanted controls. We conclude that a functional immune system with appropriate T-cell responses are important in prevention of lethal cytopathic CNS effects from TMEV. Relevant to the clinical use of bone marrow transplantation, attempts to ablate the immune system in viral-mediated immune diseases or virus-initiated autoimmune disease may have acute and lethal consequences. Our results raise concern about the attempted use of autologous hematopoietic transplantation in patients with MS, an autoimmune disease with a suspected virus etiology, particularly if the graft is aggressively depleted of lymphocytes.","Burt, R K; Padilla, J; Dal Canto, M C; Miller, S D",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10515897/,13

METHODS Three hundred and fifty-five patients with severe SARS and 841 patients with regular SARS from Beijing were studied. RESULTS Patients with elder age or with comorbid conditions were more likely to develop into severe cases. Data also showed the following characteristics in those severe cases: sustained fever, tachycardia (pulse rate being over 100 per minute), persistent decrease in lymphocytes (< 0.9 x 10(9)/L), increase in neutrophils (> 7.1 x 10(9)/L, 80%), and rapid changes in abnormal chest X-ray. The Cox proportional hazard multi-variable stepwise analysis showed the prediction model of severe SARS included age, comorbid disease, body temperature being still abnormal after 2 days of hospitalization, neutrophil percentage began to increase steadily to more than 80% after 3 days of hospitalization, counts of lymphocytes persisted < 0.9 x 10(9)/L after 4 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS According to patient's age, comorbid conditions, one can effectively predict the development of the severe SARS by closely monitoring temperature, pulse rate, the counts of lymphocytes and percent of neutrophils.","Zhao, Min; Fan, Rong; Jiang, Tian-jun; Chen, Zuo; Xie, Gao-qiang; Xiao, Feng; Wu, Yang-feng; Chen, Bo-wen; Han, De-min",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312431/,13
192639,Reactivity of human coronavirus OC43 and neonatal calf diarrhoea coronavirus membrane-associated antigens.,1982,"The coronavirus membrane (M) protein is the most abundant virion protein and the key component in viral assembly and morphogenesis. The M protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an integral membrane protein with a short ectodomain, three transmembrane segments, and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain facing the interior of the viral envelope. The carboxy terminus of MHV M has previously been shown to be extremely sensitive to mutation, both in a virus-like particle expression system and in the intact virion. We have constructed a mutant, M(Delta)2, containing a two-amino-acid truncation of the M protein that was previously thought to be lethal. This mutant was isolated by means of targeted RNA recombination with a powerful host range-based selection allowed by the interspecies chimeric virus fMHV (MHV containing the ectodomain of the feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein). Analysis of multiple second-site revertants of the M(Delta)2 mutant has revealed changes in regions of both the M protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein that can compensate for the loss of the last two residues of the M protein. Our data thus provide the first genetic evidence for a structural interaction between the carboxy termini of the M and N proteins of MHV. In addition, this work demonstrates the efficacy of targeted recombination with fMHV for the systematic genetic analysis of coronavirus structural protein interactions.","Kuo, Lili; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11967315/,13

Molecular genetic studies of JEV are hampered by the lack of a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA clone. We describe here the development of such a clone. A JEV isolate was fully sequenced, and then its full-length cDNA was cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. This was then further engineered so that transcription of the cDNA in vitro would generate synthetic RNAs with authentic 5' and 3' ends. The synthetic RNAs thus produced were highly infectious in susceptible cells (>10(6) PFU/ micro g), and these cells rapidly generated a high titer of synthetic viruses (>5 x 10(6) PFU/ml). The recovered viruses were indistinguishable from the parental virus in terms of plaque morphology, growth kinetics, RNA accumulation, protein expression, and cytopathogenicity. Significantly, the structural and functional integrity of the cDNA was maintained even after 180 generations of growth in Escherichia coli. A single point mutation acting as a genetic marker was introduced into the cDNA and was found in the genome of the recovered virus, indicating that the cDNA can be manipulated. Furthermore, we showed that JEV is an attractive vector for the expression of heterologous genes in a wide variety of cell types. This novel reverse genetics system for JEV will greatly facilitate research into JEV biology. It will also be useful as a heterologous gene expression vector and will aid the development of a vaccine against JEV.","Yun, Sang-Im; Kim, Seok-Yong; Rice, Charles M; Lee, Young-Min",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12743302/,13

We compared qRT-PCR analysis of formalin- and HOPE-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues from Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle by extracting total RNA using a commercial kit (Ambion) and a Trizol method. RNA extracted from HOPE-fixed tissues showed comparable quantities between the commercial kit (82.7-107.9 microg/ml total RNA) and the Trizol method (87-161.1 microg/ml total RNA), displaying a high degree of integrity when analyzed by electrophoresis. RNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues using the commercial kit produced similar concentrations (80.6-145.7 microg/ml total RNA) in comparison to the HOPE tissue; however, the integrity was compromised. Extraction of RNA from the formalin-fixed tissues using Trizol was unsuccessful. Following qRT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), total RNA from HOPE-fixed tissues showed higher levels of target messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (4.05 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using the commercial kit and 6.45 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using Trizol) in comparison to formalin-fixed tissues (5.69 x 10(-4)pg/100 ng total RNA).

PATIENTS All patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy from August 2009 to March 2011. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period. The indications for surgery included symptomatic gallstones (n=43) and gallbladder polyps (n=7). The mean operating time was 78 (standard deviation, 24) minutes. Forty-five of the patients successfully underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, giving a success rate of 90%. In the remaining five patients, additional working ports were constructed to obtain better exposure and dissection around Calot's triangle. On comparing the results of the initial 25 cases to the subsequent 25 cases, in the latter group the operating time was significantly shorter (86 vs 71 minutes; P=0.02), and the success rate was higher (80% vs 100%; P=0.05). During the median follow-up period of 6.8 months, four patients had complications, which included: postoperative urinary retention (n=2), one each with a haematoma and an incisional hernia. No patient endured bile duct injury, postoperative bile leakage, or haemorrhage in our series. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible and safe for treatment of uncomplicated gallbladder diseases.

193831,An acidic cluster of human cytomegalovirus UL99 tegument protein is required for trafficking and function.,2004,"Replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) requires proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein by two viral cysteine proteases, a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro). These proteases are important targets for development of antiviral drugs that would inhibit viral replication and reduce mortality associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV. In this work, we describe the 1.85-A crystal structure of the catalytic core of SARS-CoV PLpro and show that the overall architecture adopts a fold closely resembling that of known deubiquitinating enzymes. Key features, however, distinguish PLpro from characterized deubiquitinating enzymes, including an intact zinc-binding motif, an unobstructed catalytically competent active site, and the presence of an intriguing, ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain. To gain insight into the active-site recognition of the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin and the related LXGG motif, we propose a model of PLpro in complex with ubiquitin-aldehyde that reveals well defined sites within the catalytic cleft that help to account for strict substrate-recognition motifs.","Ratia, Kiira; Saikatendu, Kumar Singh; Santarsiero, Bernard D; Barretto, Naina; Baker, Susan C; Stevens, Raymond C; Mesecar, Andrew D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16581910/,13

This disease is known for its respiratory manifestations. Also, there have been several reports of neurological involvement in patients with COVID-19. In this study, we present a 55-year-old Iranian male patient, who was referred from another medical center with a decreased level of consciousness. Upon admission, only respiratory signs of COVID-19 were observed, but later, some neurological manifestations were also observed, such as an alteration in mental status, disorientation, stupor, and finally coma. In radiological studies, a hemorrhagic encephalopathy pattern was detected. Despite improved oxygenation and alleviation of respiratory symptoms with antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies, cerebral injuries progressed, and the patient died due to severe brain damage.","Malekmohammad, Majid; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Mansourafshar, Babak; Jamaati, Hamidreza",Tanaffos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262805/,13
193897,Three new isolates of porcine respiratory coronavirus with various pathogenicities and spike (S) gene deletions.,1994,"Peritonitis is the established term for infective inflammation of the peritoneum, while serositis generally refers to nonorganismal inflammation in any serous cavity, including the peritoneum. In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) literature, however, culture-negative peritoneal inflammation is referred to as ""sterile"" or ""chemical"" peritonitis. These terms not only imply unwarranted etiologic assumptions, but may also deflect attention from the existence of medical conditions to which the peritoneum is subject. This is evident in CAPD literature where there is little recognition that the peritoneum, as a member of the serosa and a secretor of lamellar bodies, is prey to a wide range of disorders. Thus before, during, and after CAPD, the membrane is liable to fall victim to disease states unconnected with the process of dialysis. Significant peritoneal pathology occurs as part of a pan-serositis, which may be metabolic (uremia, cholesterolosis), autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid disease, acute rheumatism, endocrinopathies), genetic (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), allergic (eosinophilic serositis), and granulomatous in nature. This paper presents a comparative analysis of histopathological presentation and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in all forms of peritoneal serositis. It incorporates recent advances in molecular biology of the membrane into a holistic reappraisal of peritoneal pathology, revealing hitherto unrecognized homologies in peritoneal reaction to diverse disorders.","Dobbie, J W",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8241326/,13
193968,Survival characteristics of airborne human coronavirus 229E.,1985,"Our previous studies showed that tandem Alu repeats inhibited GFP gene expression when they were inserted into the downstream of GFP gene in pEGFP-C1 vector and HeLa cells were then transfected transiently. The sequence named 2F2R (second 60 bp from the 5' end of SV40PolyA antisense strand) eliminated the repression of GFP gene expression induced by Alu repeats when 2F2R was inserted between GFP and Alu repeats. In this study the deletion of 2F2R DNA showed that 45R (45 bp in 2F2R 5'end), 30R (30 bp in 2F2R 5' end) and 22R (22 bp in 2F2R 5' end) activated GFP gene expression, and the activating actions of the double tandem sequences were stronger than those of their corresponding single sequences. Secloop (22 bp near the center in 2F2R) and Poly4 (30 bp in 2F2R 3' end) sequences did not activate GFP gene expression. The activating action of 30R-Poly4 sequence formed by ligating 30R with Poly4 by 9 bp was lower than that of 2F2R. The linking base number between two 22R sequences did not influence the GFP gene expression obviously. Sequence 22R (5'-GTGAAAAAAATGCTTTATTTGT-3') contains an imperfect palindrome sequence and may form an imperfect stem-loop structure including a 3nt loop, 3 bp first stem, 2nt bulge, and 3bp second stem. The mutations changing stem-loop structure of 22R influenced the GFP gene activation significantly and neither the excessively stable nor excessively unstable stem-loop structures were in favour of GFP gene activation, which suggested that the suitably imperfect stem-loop structures had something with gene activation.","Wang, Hong-Gang; Ma, Huan; Li, Zhu; Zhang, Bin; Jing, Xiang-Yang; Zhang, Yuan; Lv, Zhan-Jun",Yi chuan = Hereditas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21482523/,13

Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine has been studying the mechanisms and specificities of individual radiation sensitivity (IRS) formation in professionals who work in the field of ionizing radiation, cancer patients and representatives of other population groups. Our data based on the use of G2-test in in vitro irradiated blood lymphocytes in late G2-period of cell cycle indicated an increased carcinogenic risk in professionals with high IRS. We suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could make significant adjustments in the formation of IRS in professionals who have survived the disease and continue to work with ionizing radiation (IR). Increased systemic inflammatory activity, which persists for a long time in COVID-19 patients, in combination with low-dose range irradiation (professionals who continue to work with IR) and with local irradiation in the high-dose range (radiation therapy for cancer patients) may affect IRS. Repeated determination of IRS in professionals who have had COVID-19 infection, using chromosomal G2-radiation sensitivity assay will answer the question: can SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus affect the IRS? The proposed hypothesis of the radiosensitivity evolution needs further experimental validation using a set of radiobiological indices to clarify the mechanism of IRS formation following COVID-19 infection. The detected changes (increase) of human IRS after COVID-19 must be taken into account for personalized planning of radiotherapy of COVID-19 cancer patients.","Chekhun, V F; Domina, E A",Experimental oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591423/,13

Ten of them, who had significantly lower concentrations of pre-existing antibody than the rest, became infected and eight of these developed colds. A limited investigation of circulating lymphocyte populations showed some lymphocytopenia in infected volunteers. In this group, antibody concentrations started to increase 1 week after inoculation and reached a maximum about 1 week later. Thereafter antibody titres slowly declined. Although concentrations were still slightly raised 1 year later, this did not always prevent reinfection when volunteers were then challenged with the homologous virus. However, the period of virus shedding was shorter than before and none developed a cold. All of the uninfected group were infected on re-challenge although they also appeared to show some resistance to disease and in the extent of infection.

194592,Innate cytokine responses in porcine macrophage populations: evidence for differential recognition of double-stranded RNA.,2006,"Renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone axis has long been known as a regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Yet, local renin-angiotensin II systems have been discovered and novel actions of angiotensin II (AngII) have emerged among which its ability to act as a immunomodulator and profibrotic molecule. The enzyme responsible for its synthesis, Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), is present in high concentrations in lung tissue. In the present paper, we review data from studies of the past decade that implicate AngII and functional polymorphisms of the ACE gene that increase ACE activity with increased susceptibility for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, drugs that inhibit the synthesis of AngII (ACE inhibitors) or that antagonize its actions on its receptors (Angiotensin II receptor blockers -ARBs) have been shown to provide beneficial effects. Another recent discovery reviewed is the presence of a homologue of ACE, ACE2, which cleaves a single amino acid from AngII and forms a heptapeptide with vasodilatory actions, Ang 1-7. The balance between ACE and ACE2 is crucial for controlling AngII levels. ACE and ACE2 also appear to modify the severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with ACE2 playing a protective role. Finally, mention is made to the recent discovery of ACE2 as a receptor for the SARS Corona Virus.","Kaparianos, A; Argyropoulou, E",Current medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756232/,13
195120,"Vaccinia virus entry, exit, and interaction with differentiated human airway epithelia.",2007,"Transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis is an enzyme of unknown function that cross-links proteins to high molecular weight aggregates. Previously, we characterized two intrinsic transglutaminase substrates with inactivating activities against subtilisin and dispase. This report now describes a novel substrate that inhibits papain, bromelain, and trypsin. Papain was the most sensitive protease; thus, the protein was designated Streptomyces papain inhibitor (SPI). To avoid transglutaminase-mediated glutamine deamidation during culture, SPI was produced by Streptomyces mobaraensis at various growth temperatures. The best results were achieved by culturing for 30-50 h at 42 degrees C, which yielded high SPI concentrations and negligibly small amounts of mature transglutaminase. Transglutaminasespecific biotinylation displayed largely unmodified glutamine and lysine residues. In contrast, purified SPI from the 28 degrees C culture lost the potential to be cross-linked, but exhibited higher inhibitory activity as indicated by a significantly lower Ki (60 nM vs. 140 nM). Despite similarities in molecular mass (12 kDa) and high thermostability, SPI exhibits clear differences in comparison with all members of the wellknown family of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitors. The neutral protein (pI of 7.3) shares sequence homology with a putative protein from Streptomyces lavendulae, whose conformation is most likely stabilized by two disulfide bridges. However, cysteine residues are not localized in the typical regions of subtilisin inhibitors. SPI and the formerly characterized dispase-inactivating substrate are unique proteins of distinct Streptomycetes such as Streptomyces mobaraensis. Along with the subtilisin inhibitory protein, they could play a crucial role in the defense of vulnerable protein layers that are solidified by transglutaminase.","Sarafeddinov, Alla; Arif, Atia; Peters, Anna; Fuchsbauer, Hans-Lothar",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715969/,13
195458,Identification of an ATPase activity associated with a 71-kilodalton polypeptide encoded in gene 1 of the human coronavirus 229E.,1997,"Viruses are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune type 1A diabetes in humans. This pathogenic process can be modeled in the BBDR rat, which develops pancreatic insulitis and type 1A-like diabetes after infection with Kilham's rat virus (RV). The mechanism is unknown, but does not involve infection of the pancreatic islets. We first documented that RV infection of BBDR rats induces diabetes, whereas infection with its close homologue H-1 does not. Both viruses induced similar humoral and cellular immune responses in the host, but only RV also caused a decrease in splenic CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in both BBDR rats and normal WF rats. Surprisingly, RV infection increased CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in pancreatic lymph nodes of BBDR but not WF rats. This increase appeared to be due to the accumulation of nonproliferating CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. The results imply that the reduction in splenic CD4(+)CD25(+) cells observed in RV-infected animals is virus specific, whereas the increase in pancreatic lymph node CD4(+)CD25(+) cells is both virus and rat strain specific. The data suggest that RV but not H-1 infection alters T cell regulation in BBDR rats and permits the expression of autoimmune diabetes. More generally, the results suggest a mechanism that could link an underlying genetic predisposition to environmental perturbation and transform a ""regulated predisposition"" into autoimmune diabetes, namely, failure to maintain regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell function.","Zipris, Danny; Hillebrands, Jan-Luuk; Welsh, Raymond M; Rozing, Jan; Xie, Jenny X; Mordes, John P; Greiner, Dale L; Rossini, Aldo A",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12646622/,13

The importance of differences in FIPV serotype on the induction of ADE remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the same or different serotype of FIPV induces ADE in cats. Specific pathogen-free cats were passively immunized with anti-type I or II FIPV antibodies, and we investigated the induction of ADE following subcutaneous inoculation with type I FIPV. Inoculation using FIPV serotype I enhanced the onset of FIP in cats passively immunized with FIPV serotype I-specific antibodies but not in those passively immunized with antibodies to FIPV serotype II. These data suggest that re-infection with the same serotype induces ADE in cats infected with FIPV.","Takano, Tomomi; Kawakami, Chisako; Yamada, Shinji; Satoh, Ryoichi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19122397/,13

Recommended infection control measures for healthcare workers include surgical masks to protect against droplet-spread respiratory transmissible infections and N95 masks to protect against aerosol-spread infections. A literature review was undertaken for evidence of superior protective value of N95 masks or surgical masks for healthcare workers against influenza and extraneous factors influencing conferred protection. METHODS Four scientific search engines using 12 search sequences identified 21 mask studies in healthcare settings for the prevention of transmission of respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Each was critically assessed in accordance with Australian National Health Medical Research Council guidelines. An additional 25 laboratory-based publications were also reviewed. RESULTS All studies reviewed used medium or lower level evidence study design. In the majority of studies, important confounders included the unrecognized impact of concurrent bundling of other infection control measures, mask compliance, contamination from improper doffing of masks, and ocular inoculation. Only three studies directly compared the protective value of surgical masks with N95 masks. The majority of laboratory studies identified both mask types as having a range of filtration efficiency, yet N95 masks afford superior protection against particles of a similar size to influenza. CONCLUSIONS World Health Organization guidelines recommend surgical masks for all patient care with the exception of N95 masks for aerosol generating procedures. Because of the paucity of high-quality studies in the healthcare setting, the advocacy of mask types is not entirely evidence-based. Evidence from laboratory studies of potential airborne spread of influenza from shedding patients indicate that guidelines related to the current 1-meter respiratory zone may need to be extended to a larger respiratory zone and include protection from ocular inoculation.","Gralton, Jan; McLaws, Mary-Louise",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095070/,13

However, little information exists on the outcomes following discharge. A study was undertaken to examine the rates of readmission, recurrent AHRF, and death following discharge and the risk factors associated with them. METHODS A cohort of COPD patients with AHRF who survived after treatment with NIV in a respiratory high dependency unit was prospectively followed from July 2001 to October 2002. The times to readmission, first recurrent AHRF, and death were recorded and analysed against potential risk factors collected during the index admission. RESULTS One hundred and ten patients (87 men) of mean (SD) age 73.2 (7.6) years survived AHRF after NIV during the study period. One year after discharge 79.9% had been readmitted, 63.3% had another life threatening event, and 49.1% had died. Survivors spent a median of 12% of the subsequent year in hospital. The number of days in hospital in the previous year (p = 0.016) and a low Katz score (p = 0.018) predicted early readmission; home oxygen use (p = 0.002), APACHE II score (p = 0.006), and a lower body mass index (p = 0.041) predicted early recurrent AHRF or death; the MRC dyspnoea score (p<0.001) predicted early death. CONCLUSIONS COPD patients with AHRF who survive following treatment with NIV have a high risk of readmission and life threatening events.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: We have analyzed the research results of 2841 patients to determine IgM and IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2. The study included the results of patients in Poltava and nearby villages of Poltava region, obtained during July - December 2020. RESULTS Results: Thus, 84% of patients applied for detection of IgM in the serum of patients with the pathogen COVID-2019. We have found only 135 positive results for the detection of IgM to SARS-CoV-2, which was 5.7% of the total number of people who underwent this study from July to December 2020. Moreover, women received a positive result more often than men. The IP samples for the detection of IgM to SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of patients averaged 2.5 ± 1.04. It was found that patients went to the laboratory to detect IgG to SARS-CoV-2 with the vast majority among them were residents of Poltava. However, in this case the share of positive results was 47.7%, among which the female population outnumbered the male. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The frequency of detection of positive results on IgM to SARS-CoV-2 is about 6%. The share of positive results on IgG to SARS-CoV-2 was 47.7%, among them 76.2% were women. The frequency of detection of IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 during October-December 2020 significantly exceeds the indices in July-September of the same year.","Marchenko, Alla V; Ananieva, Maiia M; Faustova, Mariia O; Loban', Galina A; Lytovchenko, Iryna Yu; Nikolishyn, Ihor A; Ilenko-Lobach, Nataliia V",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090278/,13

Expanding the knowledge of its course and predictors of mortality is relevant to decision making. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and identify factors associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2013-2014 influenza season. METHODS This is an observational study of a prospective cohort of 70 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 seen in an academic medical center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent mortality predictors. Bootstrap was used for internal model validation. RESULTS This cohort was represented by young adults (43 ± 11 years old). Obesity was present in 62.5% and was not associated with mortality. Mortality at 28 days and at discharge from the respiratory intensive care unit was 14 and 20%, respectively. All patients met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 73% had vasodilatory shock, and 27.1% had acute kidney injury on respiratory intensive care unit admission. We observed a high incidence of intensive care unit-acquired weakness (81.4%). Ventilator-associated pneumonia developed in 47.1% and was not associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for intensive care unit mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.102), white blood cell count (OR = 1.22), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (OR = 1.004) on admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS We described the clinical characteristics and course of a cohort of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and developed a predictive model of mortality based on the covariates age, levels of lactate dehydrogenase, and white cell count on admission to the respiratory intensive care unit.","Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen Margarita; Serna-Secundino, Héctor; García-Olazarán, José Guadalupe; Aguilar-Pérez, Cristina Leticia; Rocha-Machado, Jesús; Campos-Calderón, Luis Fernando; Lugo-Goytia, Gustavo",Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941959/,13

METHODS A retrospective ecological study was undertaken. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in Hong Kong for COPD and indices of air pollutants (sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 microm (PM(10)) and 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))) and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2004 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed using generalised additive models with Poisson distribution, adjusted for the effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. RESULTS Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for COPD with all five air pollutants. Relative risks for admission for every 10 microg/m(3) increase in SO(2), NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5) were 1.007, 1.026, 1.034, 1.024 and 1.031, respectively, at a lag day ranging from lag 0 to cumulative lag 0-5. In a multipollutant model, O(3), SO(2) and PM(2.5) were significantly associated with increased admissions for COPD. SO(2), NO(2) and O(3) had a greater effect on COPD admissions in the cold season (December to March) than during the warm season. CONCLUSION Ambient concentrations of air pollutants have an adverse effect on hospital admissions for COPD in Hong Kong, especially during the winter season. This might be due to indoor exposure to outdoor pollution through open windows as central heating is not required in the mild winter.

A combination of serous, fibrinous and hemorrhagic inflammation was seen in most of the pulmonary alveoli with the engorgement of capillaries and detection of micro-thrombosis in some of these capillaries. Pulmonary alveoli thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, suffered diffuse alveolar damage, experienced desquamation of pneumocytes and had hyaline-membrane formation, fibrinoid materials, and erythrocytes in alveolar spaces. There were thromboembolisms in some bronchial arteries. Furthermore, hemorrhagic necrosis was also evident in lymph nodes and spleen with the attenuation of lymphocytes. Other atypical pathological changes, such as hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration, interstitial cell proliferation and lesions having existed before hospitalization were observed in the liver, heart, kidney and pancreas.

The entire ectodomain of S protein was fused between the gp64 signal peptide and the VSV-G membrane anchor and successfully displayed on the baculovirus surface. Subcutaneous injection with purified S-displayed baculoviruses without adjuvant elicited highly effective production of specific and neutralizing antibodies against S protein in mice. These results confirmed a successful surface display of S protein on baculoviruse, and suggested a potential role of S-displayed baculoviruses as a novel live virus-based vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV.","Feng, Qian; Liu, Yingying; Qu, Xiuxia; Deng, Hongkui; Ding, Mingxiao; Lau, Terence L T; Yu, Albert Cheung-Hoi; Chen, Jianguo",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17184168/,13
197748,Silencing of natural interferon producing cell activation by porcine circovirus type 2 DNA.,2007,"BACKGROUND Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly recognized pathogen associated with respiratory tract disease (RTD). OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of hMPV infection in children hospitalized with RTD and to analyze the virologic and clinical features of hMPV infection. STUDY DESIGN All children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized for RTD were included in this 1-year prospective study. hMPV was detected in nasopharyngeal secretions by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The hMPV F gene amplification products were sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Samples were also tested for other respiratory viruses by both direct immunofluorescence assay and virus culture. RESULTS hMPV, detected in 50 of 589 (8.5%) children, represented the second leading cause of RTD after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infections with hMPV occurred mainly between December and April. hMPV isolates clustered into the 4 subgroups (A1, A2, B1 and B2) currently recognized; the majority (72%) of hMPV isolates belonged to subgroup A1. Among the 35 children infected with hMPV alone, 23 (65.7%) had bronchiolitis, 5 (14.3%) had pneumonia, 2 (5.7%) had asthma exacerbation and 5 (14.3%) had a limited upper RTD. Fifteen (30%) of the hMPV-infected children were coinfected with RSV. As compared with children infected with hMPV or RSV alone, duration of hospitalization and requirement for supplemental oxygen were increased in the hMPV/RSV-coinfected children. CONCLUSIONS hMPV is a frequent cause of RTD in young children. hMPV/RSV coinfection is frequent and could be more severe than a single hMPV or RSV infection.","Foulongne, Vincent; Guyon, Gaël; Rodière, Michel; Segondy, Michel",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16567989/,13

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination nasal spray of ipratropium and xylometazoline for simultaneous treatment of these symptoms. METHODS The trial was a multicenter double-blind, parallel-group, randomized design on patients with common cold symptoms. Patients scored symptoms of runny nose and nasal congestion and recorded adverse events in a diary for up to 7 days. Patients also recorded tissue use. The five test treatments consisted of ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL, and xylometazoline, 1.0 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL, and xylometazoline, 0.5 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL; xylometazoline, 1.0 mg/mL; and placebo solution. RESULTS Eight hundred sixty-four patients were screened and 786 patients received treatment. One day after treatment there was a clear separation between the scores for the placebo and ipratropium treatment groups for rhinorrhea and between the placebo and xylometazoline treatment groups for congestion. Both ipratropium/xylometazoline 1.0 and ipratropium/xylometazoline 0.5 treatments were superior to xylometazoline with respect to rhinorrhea (p < 0.0001) and superior to ipratropium with respect to nasal congestion scores (p < 0.001). Both the ipratropium combination treatments had significantly lower tissue use than the xylometazoline treatment group (p < 0.0001). Adverse events were distributed equally between the treatments, except mucus tinged with blood, epistaxis, nasal passage irritation, and nasal dryness, which had a higher incidence in the three groups that received medicines containing ipratropium. CONCLUSION The results indicate that a combination medicine of ipratropium and xylometazoline is safe and effective for treatment of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion associated with common cold.","Eccles, Ronald; Pedersen, Anette; Regberg, Dan; Tulento, Heikki; Borum, Peter; Stjärne, Pär",American journal of rhinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17283559/,13

We have to analyze the documents on the training of medical professionals in terms of safety as a first step in introducing into the domestic (Ukrainian) medical educational practice of existing international experience in teaching patient safety. PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: The research was based on international documents on patient safety, thematic scientific publications, plans, and programs for the training of medical professionals in Ukraine. Bibliosemantic, systems analysis, mathematical (relative values) research methods were used in the study. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The analysis of thematic plans of separate disciplines in ""Nursing"" specialty has shown, that according to experts, questions of safety of patients should contain more than in 70% of subjects; on the topics of classes safety issues are provided in the range from 45.1% (basics of nursing) to 0.0% (anesthesiology and resuscitation); the actual content of educational and methodical materials was from 14.6% (basics of nursing) to 0.0% (anesthesiology and resuscitation). The time allotted to study disciplines related to occupational safety and health of health workers (life safety, basics of bioethics and biosafety, as well as occupational safety in the industry) is six times higher than the hours of study of the discipline (medical law) related to patient safety in the Working Curriculum (second (master's) level of higher education in the field of knowledge 22 ""health"" specialty 222 ""medicine""). As a result of the analysis of work programs of educational disciplines at all levels of medical specialists training, a sharp discrepancy in the new information support of the educational process was revealed in terms of patient safety.","Naumenko, Oleksandr M; Skaletsky, Yurii M; Didkovskyy, Viacheslav L; Rigan, Mykhailo M; Maluk, Oksana O",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310961/,13

OBJECTIVE To assess the reporting of these protections for several study designs in general medical journals. DESIGN A consecutive series of research papers published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine between February and May 2003 were reviewed for the reporting of ethical approval and patient consent. Ethical approval, name of approving committee, type of consent, data source and whether the study used data collected as part of a study reported elsewhere were recorded. Differences in failure to report approval and consent by study design, journal and vulnerable study population were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Ethical approval and consent were not mentioned in 31% and 47% of manuscripts, respectively. 88 (27%) papers failed to report both approval and consent. Failure to mention ethical approval or consent was significantly more likely in all study designs (except case-control and qualitative studies) than in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Failure to mention approval was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in The New England Journal of Medicine. Failure to mention consent was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in all other journals. No significant differences in approval or consent were found when comparing studies of vulnerable and non-vulnerable participants. CONCLUSION The reporting of ethical approval and consent in RCTs has improved, but journals are less good at reporting this information for other study designs. Journals should publish this information for all research on human participants.","Schroter, S; Plowman, R; Hutchings, A; Gonzalez, A",Journal of medical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17145913/,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective study of pediatric patients with appendicitis treated with TULAA or TPLA between January 2010 and December 2015. Operative time (OT), length of stay, cost, and surgical site infection rate were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Six hundred twenty-five appendectomies were performed [263 TULAA, 362 TPLA: acute (457), gangrenous (39), and perforated (129)]. TULAA had a shorter OT (median, 40 vs. 67 min; P<0.001), a shorter length of stay (median, 20 vs. 23 h; P<0.001), and a lesser cost (median $6266 vs. $8927; P<0.001). Surgical site infection rate was slightly higher in the TULAA group (6% vs. 4%; P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS TULAA had a shorter OT and was less costly than conventional TPLA. TULAA should be considered as the first surgical approach at treating appendicitis in children.","Karam, Paul A; Mohan, Arathi; Buta, Martin R; Seifarth, Federico G","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801689/,13

The data were analyzed by means of panel mixed logit models. RESULTS: The prevention of deaths and financial problems of households had a very strong influence on the uptake of the app. Predicted app uptake rates ranged from 24% to 78% for the worst and best possible app for these societal effects. We found a strong positive relationship between people's trust in government and people's propensity to install the DCT app. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake levels we find are much more volatile than the uptake levels predicted in comparable studies that did not include societal effects in their discrete choice experiments. Our finding that the societal effects are a major factor in the uptake of the DCT app results in a chicken-or-the-egg causality dilemma. That is, the societal effects of the app are severely influenced by the uptake of the app, but the uptake of the app is severely influenced by its societal effects.","Mouter, Niek; Collewet, Marion; de Wit, G Ardine; Rotteveel, Adrienne; Lambooij, Mattijs S; Kessels, Roselinde",Value Health,,13

The old model consisted of Standard Biopsy (SBx), that is random sampling of the prostate gland under ultrasound guidance (TRUS), in subjects with clinical suspicion of PCa. This involves the risk of not diagnosing a high percentage of tumors (up to 30%) and of an incorrect risk stratification. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) has transformed the diagnostic pathway of PCa, not only as an imaging method for detecting suspicious lesions, but also as an intraprocedural guidance for Target Biopsy (MRI-TBx), thus bridging the diagnostic gap. Several single and multicenter randomized trials, such as PROMIS, MRI first, PRECISION and that reported by Van der Leest et al. have confirmed the superiority of the ""MRI pathway"", consisting of mpMRI and MRI-TBx of suspicious lesions, over the ""standard pathway"" of SBx in all patients with elevated PSA and/or positive DRE. MRI-TBx appears to be advantageous in reducing the overall number of biopsies performed, as well as in reducing the diagnosis of clinically insignificant disease while maintaining or improving the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa (cs-PCa). Moreover, it shows a reduction in the diagnosis of ins-PCa, and therefore, of overdiagnosis, when using MRI-TBx without sacrificing performance in the diagnosis of cs-PCa.","Gurgitano, Martina; Ancona, Eleonora; Maresca, Duilia; Summers, Paul Eugene; Alessi, Sarah; Maggioni, Roberta; Liguori, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Marco; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; De Filippo, Massimo; Paolucci, Aldo; Petralia, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,,13
213172,Vaping and Respiratory Viruses: The End for ENDS?,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in December 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Although much of the focus is on respiratory symptoms, recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause pregnancy complications such as pre-term birth and miscarriages; and women with COVID-19 had maternal vascular malperfusion and decidual arteriopathy in their placentas. Here, we report that ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. Further, HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA impaired the full decidualization response, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1. Additionally, in mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial, and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced Ace2 mRNA expression in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen. These data establish a role for ACE2 in endometrial physiology, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to enter endometrial stromal cells and elicit pathological manifestations in women with COVID-19 including an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.","Chadchan, Sangappa B; Popli, Pooja; Maurya, Vineet K; Kommagani, Ramakrishna",Biol. reprod,,13

216132,Genetic diversity and potential recombination between ferret coronaviruses from European and American lineages,2020,"BACKGROUND: An unusual feature of SARS-Cov-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic is that children are less severely affected than adults. This is especially paradoxical given the epidemiological links between poor air quality and increased COVID-19 severity in adults and that children are generally more vulnerable than adults to the adverse consequences of air pollution. OBJECTIVES: To identify gaps in knowledge about the factors that protect children from severe SARS-Cov-2 infection even in the face of air pollution, and to develop a transdisciplinary research strategy to address these gaps. METHODS: An international group of researchers interested in children's environmental health was invited to identify knowledge gaps and to develop research questions to close these gaps. DISCUSSION: Key research questions identified include: what are the effects of SAR-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy on the developing fetus and child; what is the impact of age at infection and genetic susceptibility on disease severity; why do some children with COVID-19 infection develop toxic shock and Kawasaki-like symptoms; what are the impacts of toxic environmental exposures including poor air quality, chemical and metal exposures on innate immunity, especially in the respiratory epithelium; what is the possible role of a ""dirty"" environment in conveying protection - an example of the ""hygiene hypothesis""; and what are the long term health effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection in early life. CONCLUSION: A concerted research effort by a multidisciplinary team of scientists is needed to understand the links between environmental exposures, especially air pollution and COVID-19. We call for specific research funding to encourage basic and clinical research to understand if/why exposure to environmental factors is associated with more severe disease, why children appear to be protected, and how innate immune responses may be involved. Lessons learned about SARS-Cov-2 infection in our children will help us to understand and reduce disease severity in adults, the opposite of the usual scenario.","Sly, Peter D; Trottier, Brittany A; Bulka, Catherine M; Cormier, Stephania A; Fobil, Julius; Fry, Rebecca C; Kim, Kyoung-Woong; Kleeberger, Steven; Kumar, Pushpam; Landrigan, Philip J; Lodrop Carlsen, Karin C; Pascale, Antonio; Polack, Fernando; Ruchirawat, Mathuros; Zar, Heather J; Suk, William A",Environ Health,,13

IL-31 was released by dermal conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2s) recruited to wounds and increased itch sensory neuron sensitivity. Transfer of cDC2s isolated from late-stage wounds into healthy skin was sufficient to induce itching in a manner dependent on IL-31 expression. Addition of the cytokine TGF-ß1, which promotes wound healing, to dermal DCs in vitro was sufficient to induce Il31 expression, and Tgfbr1f/f CD11c-Cre mice exhibited reduced scratching and decreased Il31 expression in wounds in vivo.

225865,Cathepsin B Protease Facilitates Chikungunya Virus Envelope Protein-Mediated Infection via Endocytosis or Macropinocytosis,2020,"Neurologic manifestations associated with Covid-19 are increasingly reported, especially stroke and acute cerebrovascular events. Beyond cardiovascular risk factors associated with age, some young adults without medical or cardiovascular history had stroke as a presenting feature of Covid-19. Suggested stroke mechanisms in this setting are inflammatory storm, subsequent hypercoagulability, and vasculitis. To date, a handful of pediatric stroke cases associated with Covid-19 have been reported, either with a cardioembolic mechanism or a focal cerebral arteriopathy. We report the case of an adolescent who presented with febrile meningism and stupor. Clinical, biological, and radiological features favored the diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome (LS), with Fusobacterium necrophorum infection (sphenoid sinusitis and meningitis) and intracranial vasculitis. The patient had concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite medical and surgical antimicrobial treatment, stroke prevention, and venous thrombosis prevention, he presented with severe cerebrovascular complications. Venous thrombosis and stroke were observed, with an extension of intracranial vasculitis, and lead to death. As both F. necrophorum and SARS-CoV-2 enhance inflammation, coagulation, and activate endothelial cells, we discuss how this coinfection may have potentiated and aggravated the usual course of LS. The potentiation by SARS-CoV-2 of vascular and thrombotic effects of a bacterial infection may represent an underreported cerebrovascular injury mechanism in Covid-19 patients. These findings emphasize the variety of mechanisms underlying stroke in this disease. Moreover, in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we discuss in what extent sanitary measures, namely, lockdown and fear to attend medical facilities, may have delayed diagnosis and influenced outcomes.

226969,"Phosphate Derivatives of 3-Carboxyacylbetulin: SynThesis, In Vitro Anti-HIV and Molecular Docking Study",2020,"An understanding of protective immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for vaccine and public health strategies aimed at ending the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A key unanswered question is whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in protective immunity against reexposure. We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that macaques had high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, humoral and cellular immune responses, and pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. After the initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with after the primary infection. Anamnestic immune responses after rechallenge suggested that protection was mediated by immunologic control. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced protective immunity against reexposure in nonhuman primates.","Chandrashekar, Abishek; Liu, Jinyan; Martinot, Amanda J; McMahan, Katherine; Mercado, Noe B; Peter, Lauren; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Yu, Jingyou; Maliga, Zoltan; Nekorchuk, Michael; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Terry, Margaret; Wrijil, Linda M; Ducat, Sarah; Martinez, David R; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Burke, John S; Slein, Matthew D; Pessaint, Laurent; Van Ry, Alex; Greenhouse, Jack; Taylor, Tammy; Blade, Kelvin; Cook, Anthony; Finneyfrock, Brad; Brown, Renita; Teow, Elyse; Velasco, Jason; Zahn, Roland; Wegmann, Frank; Abbink, Peter; Bondzie, Esther A; Dagotto, Gabriel; Gebre, Makda S; He, Xuan; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Kordana, Nicole; Li, Zhenfeng; Lifton, Michelle A; Mahrokhian, Shant H; Maxfield, Lori F; Nityanandam, Ramya; Nkolola, Joseph P; Schmidt, Aaron G; Miller, Andrew D; Baric, Ralph S; Alter, Galit; Sorger, Peter K; Estes, Jacob D",Science,,13

227576,High throughput in vitro screening of changed algal community structure using the PhotoBiobox,2020,"With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines have reshaped the way that we live our lives. Perhaps the most common and strictly adopted measure has been mask wearing. Mask wearing, whether it be cloth, surgical, or N95, has quickly become the new norm in the ongoing struggle against this pandemic and has been proven to be effective in curbing its high infection rate. There has, however, been growing opposition to these policies by a substantial part of the general population who claims that masks are ineffective and can worsen breathing. To some, the choice to use or not use a mask has morphed into a point of political contention, rather than a choice rooted in concerns for public health. This commentary attempts to investigate the validity of these claims and explore how clinicians can encourage the usage of masks despite the fears and confusion against them.","Ramirez, Arianna Victoria; Ojeaga, Macaulay; Espinoza, Victor; Hensler, Blake; Honrubia, Vincent",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,13

The aim of this research was to characterize the nutritional composition and the flour functional properties, for the use as a potential food source. Seed flour was analysed using a standard enzymatic assay for sugars, acid/neutral detergent analysis for fibre, ether extraction for fat and HPLC for strychnine. Results showed that the seeds contained 41% reducing sugars and 53% fibre. The mineral composition, determined using microwave-assisted acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), showed that the seeds contained high quantities of iron (15.78 mg/100 g) and manganese (9.86 mg/100 g). The flour water absorption index (1.37 g/g) was substantially higher than that of wheat, brown rice and tapioca flours and the oil absorption index showed similarities to the reference flours (1.09 g/g). The flour peak (37,788 RVU) and final viscosities (62,928 RVU) were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than the reference flours. This study was the first to quantify the strychnine content (0.08%) in the seeds. Results suggest that the seeds have good potential for food product development; however, further processing is essential to ensure safety for consumption.","van Rayne, Kiana Kirsty; Adebo, Oluwafemi Ayodeji; Ngobese, Nomali Ziphorah",,,13

This retrospective single-center case series analyzed COVID-19 patients with hypertension, treated with ACEIs/ARBs or CCBs at the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan City, China from 25th January to 15th March 2020. After propensity score matching analysis, 76 patients were selected into two groups. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine factors related to improvement measures and outcome measures by Cox proportional hazard regression models. Among 157 patients with confirmed COVID-19 combined hypertension, including 73 males and 84 females, a median age of 67.28 ± 9.11 vs 65.39 ± 10.85 years. A univariable analysis indicated that clinical classification, lymphocyte count, and interleukin-2 receptor were associated with a lengthened negative time of nucleic acid, with a significant difference between two groups (P = .036). Furthermore, we found no obvious difference in nucleic acid conversion time between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.97, 3.38]; P = .18) in the multivariable analysis as well as chest computed tomography improved time (HR: 0.73; 95% CI [0.45, 1.2]; P = .87), and hospitalization time between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups (HR: 1.06; 95% CI [0.44, 1.1]; P = .83). Our study provided additional evidence of no obvious difference in progress and prognosis between ACEIs/ACEIs and CCBs group, which may suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have scarcely influence on increasing the clinical severe situations of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","Liu, Xiulan; Liu, Yi; Chen, Keliang; Yan, Suying; Bai, Xiangrong; Li, Juan; Liu, Dong",J. med. virol,,13

240461,CCR2 Regulates Vaccine-Induced Mucosal T-Cell Memory to Influenza A Virus,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To characterise current COVID-19-related research activities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov testing interventions relevant to COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and related terms to identify trials registered between 1 December 2019 and 1 May 2020 that test interventions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We classified trials according to intervention type, and report key trial characteristics including recruitment status, location, funder type, target enrolment number, intervention model (single group, randomised or sequential assignment) and projected completion date. RESULTS: Of the 630 identified clinical trials related to COVID-19, 509 (81%) involved the study of drugs or biological agents. Of these trials of drugs and biologics, 305 (60%) use an open-label design, 43 (8%) are single blinded (participant only) and 161 (32%) are double blinded (participant and investigator). 94 (18%) of the drug/biological trials are non-randomised. Either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is administered as part of the study protocol in 152 (30%) of the drug/biological trials. The total planned enrolment for these hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine trials is over 200 000 participants, which represents 65% of the total planned enrolment for all registered trials of drugs or biologics. There are also at least 25 registered trials of azithromycin (n=53), convalescent plasma (n=38), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=30), stem cell treatments (n=29) and tocilizumab (n=25). 142 trials were registered in the first 3 months of 2020, and 488 trials were registered between 1 April and 1 May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a robust research response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though many of the currently planned and ongoing trials focus on a small number of potential therapies, and many also lack essential design features and power necessary to provide accurate treatment effect estimates.","Jones, Christopher W; Woodford, Ashley L; Platts-Mills, Timothy F",BMJ Open,,13

The aim of this study was to systematically review main clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric age. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed database. Papers published between 1 January and 1 May 2020 including children aged 0-18 years were selected. Sixty-two studies and three reviews were included, with a total sample size of 7480 children (2428/4660 males, 52.1%; weighted mean age 7.6 years). Patients showed mainly mild (608/1432, 42.5%) and moderate (567/1432, 39.6%) signs of the infection. About 2% of children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The most commonly described symptoms were fever (51.6%) and cough (47.3%). Laboratory findings were often unremarkable. Children underwent a chest CT scan in 73.9% of all cases, and 32.7% resulted normal. Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%. A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%).Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults.

Our previous study suggested that miR-29b may attenuate AngII-induced renal intestinal fibrosis in vitro. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether recombinant rAAV9-mediated miR-29b delivery protects against AngII-induced renal fibrosis and dysfunction. METHOD: Mice were treated with AngII via osmotic mini-pumps, or phosphate-buffered saline. rAAV9 vectors were produced using the rBac-based system in SF9 cells. rAAV9-miR-29b or rAAV9-control-miR was injected into the kidneys of mice subjected to the model of AngII infusion. The role of miR-29b in renal fibrosis was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and histology. RESULTS: In AngII-induced fibrotic kidney tissue, miR-29b expression was downregulated. rAAV9-miR-29b delivery significantly reversed renal injury as indicated by decreased serum creatinine and injury related gene expression in AngII-infused mice. Regarding organ remodeling, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen type I and type III were significantly decreased in renal tissue from mice delivered rAAV9-miR-29b. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate great potential for use of rAAV9 as an applicable vector for delivery of miR-29b as an antifibrogenic factor for treatment of tubulointerstitial fibrosis-induced renal injury.","Zhang, Ju-Hong; Li, Jing; Ye, Yang; Yu, Wang-Qi",Mol Med,,13

267980,Antivirals that target the host IMPα/ß1-virus interface,2021,"Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are circulating in humans and animals all over the world. Co-infection with these two viruses may aggravate clinical signs. However, the molecular mechanisms of co-infections by these two viruses are incompletely understood. In this study, we applied air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of well-differentiated porcine tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) to analyze the co-infection by a swine influenza virus (SIV, H3N2 subtype) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) at different time intervals. Our results revealed that in short-term intervals, prior infection by influenza virus caused complete inhibition of coronavirus infection, while in long-term intervals, some coronavirus replication was detectable. The influenza virus infection resulted in (i) an upregulation of porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for PRCoV and (ii) in the induction of an innate immune response which was responsible for the inhibition of PRCoV replication. By contrast, prior infection by coronavirus only caused a slight inhibition of influenza virus replication. Taken together, the timing and the order of virus infection are important determinants in co-infections. This study is the first to show the impact of SIV and PRCoV co- and super-infection on the cellular level. Our results have implications also for human viruses, including potential co-infections by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses.","Peng, Ju-Yi; Shin, Dai-Lun; Li, Guangxing; Wu, Nai-Huei; Herrler, Georg",Virulence,,13

272422,Molecular scaffolds from mother nature as possible lead compounds in drug design and discovery against coronaviruses: A landscape analysis of published literature and molecular docking studies,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Despite several interventions, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake remains below acceptable levels in Italy. Among the potential determinants of screening uptake, only a few studies analysed the role of general practitioners (GPs). The aim was to evaluate the variation in screening uptake of the clusters of subjects assisted by single GPs. SETTING: Ancona province, Central Italy. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, including all residents aged 50-69 years, who were offered the public screening programme with biannual faecal immunochemical tests. Demographic (of all GPs) and screening data (of all eligible residents) for years 2018-2019 were collected from the official electronic datasets of the Ancona Local Health Unit. The potential predictors of acceptable screening uptake, including GP's gender, age, and number of registered subjects, were evaluated using random-effect logistic regression, with geographical area as the cluster unit. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 332 GP clusters, including 120,178 eligible subjects. The overall province uptake was 38.0% ± 10.7%. The uptake was lower than 30% in one-fifth of the GP clusters, and higher than 45% in another fifth. At multivariable analysis, the significant predictors of uptake were younger GP age (p = 0.010) and lower number of registered subjects (p < 0.001). None of the GP clusters with 500 subjects or more showed an uptake &#8805;45%. CONCLUSIONS: The wide variation across GPs suggests they might substantially influence screening uptake, highlighting a potential need to increase their commitment to CRC screening. Further research is needed to confirm the role of the number of registered subjects.","Martellucci, Cecilia Acuti; Flacco, Maria E; Morettini, Margherita; Giacomini, Giusi; Palmer, Matthew; Fraboni, Stefania; Pasqualini, Francesca",J Med Screen,,13
272777,Non-optimal codon usage preferences of coronaviruses determine their promiscuity for infecting multiple hosts,2021,"As the world fights to contain and control the spread of the Novel Coronavirus, countries are imposing severe measures from restrictions on travel and social gatherings to complete lockdowns. Lockdowns, though effective in controlling the virus spread, leaves a massive economic impact. In a country like India with 21.9 % of its population below the poverty line, lockdowns have a direct impact on the livelihood of a large part of the population. Our approach conforms to healthcare and state practices of reducing human to human contact, by optimizing the lockdown strategy. We propose resuming economic activities while keeping healthcare facilities from being overwhelmed. We model the coronavirus pandemic as SEIR dynamic model for a set of states as nodes with certain population and analyze the model output before and after complete lockdown. Social distancing that people would willingly follow, in the no lockdown situation is modeled as being influenced with the knowledge of the current number of infection by imitating Granovetter threshold model. We then provide optimal lockdown policy solutions for the duration of ten weeks using NSGA-II optimization algorithm. While there are many studies that focus on modelling the transmission of COVID-19, ours is one of the few attempts to strike a balance between number of infections and economic operations.","Saurabh, Saket; Trivedi, Ayush; Lokesh, Nithilaksh P.; Gaikwad, Bhagyashree",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08273v1.pdf,13
273587,Halting coronavirus polymerase,2020,"Aims: To determine the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaediatric admissions and fracture clinics within a regional integrated care system (ICS). Methods: A retrospective review was performed for all paediatric orthopaedic patients admitted across the region during the recent lockdown period (24 March 2020 to 10 May 2020) and the same period in 2019. Age, sex, mechanism, anatomical region, and treatment modality were compared, as were fracture clinic attendances within the receiving regional major trauma centre (MTC) between the two periods. Results: Paediatric trauma admissions across the region fell by 33% (197 vs 132) with a proportional increase to 59% (n = 78) of admissions to the MTC during lockdown compared with 28.4% in 2019 (N = 56). There was a reduction in manipulation under anaesthetic (p = 0.015) and the use of Kirschner wires (K-wires) (p = 0.040) between the two time periods. The median time to surgery remained one day in both (2019 IQR 0 to 2; 2020 IQR 1 to 1). Supracondylar fractures were the most common reason for fracture clinic attendance (17.3%, n = 19) with a proportional increase of 108.4% vs 2019 (2019 n = 20; 2020 n = 19) (p = 0.007). While upper limb injuries and falls from play apparatus, equipment, or height remained the most common indications for admission, there was a reduction in sports injuries (p < 0.001) but an increase in lacerations (p = 0.031). Fracture clinic management changed with 67% (n = 40) of follow-up appointments via telephone and 69% (n = 65) of patients requiring cast immobilization treated with a 3M Soft Cast, enabling self-removal. The safeguarding team saw a 22% reduction in referrals (2019: n = 41, 2020: n = 32). Conclusion: During this viral pandemic, the number of trauma cases decreased with a change in the mechanism of injury, median age of presentation, and an increase in referrals to the regional MTC. Adaptions in standard practice led to fewer MUA, and K-wire procedures being performed, more supracondylar fractures managed through clinic and an increase in the use of removable cast.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:424-430.","Baxter, Ian; Hancock, Graeme; Clark, Matthew; Hampton, Matthew; Fishlock, Adelle; Widnall, James; Flowers, Mark; Evans, Owain",Bone Jt Open,,13
279272,Method for efficient soluble expression and purification of recombinant human Interleukin-15,2020,"BackgroundmRNA vaccines reduce COVID-19 incidence and severity, but the durability of vaccine-induced immune responses, particularly among the elderly, remains incompletely characterized. MethodsAnti-spike RBD antibody titers, ACE2 competition and virus neutralizing activities were longitudinally assessed in 151 healthcare workers and older adults (overall aged 24-98 years) up to three months after vaccination. ResultsOlder adults exhibited lower antibody responses after one and two vaccine doses for all measures. In multivariable analyses correcting for sociodemographic, chronic health and vaccine-related variables, age remained independently associated with all response outcomes. The number of chronic health conditions was additionally associated with lower binding antibody responses after two doses, and male sex with lower ACE2 competition activity after one dose. Responses waned universally at three months after the second dose, but binding antibodies, ACE2 competition and neutralizing activities remained significantly lower with age. Older adults also displayed reduced ability to block ACE2 binding by the Delta variant. ConclusionsThe humoral immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is significantly weaker with age, and universally wanes over time. This will likely reduce antibody-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant as the pandemic progresses. Older adults may benefit from additional immunizations as a priority.","Brockman, Mark A.; Mwimanzi, Francis M.; Lapointe, Hope R.; Sang, Yurou; Agafitei, Olga; Cheung, Peter; Ennis, Siobhan; Ng, Kurtis; Basra, Simran; Lim, Li Yi; Yaseen, Fatima; Young, Landon; Umviligihozo, Gisele; Omondi, F.

They shall protect the wearer of the mask from particles, droplets and aerosols, but can also prevent the spread of aerosol-transmitted viruses if the wearer becomes infected. Most often, FFP respirators consist of multiple layers of non-woven fabric made from polypropylene. Worldwide, FFP respirators are subject to various regulatory standards that specify physical properties and performance characteristics. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health authorities have temporarily repealed standards for respirators. We report on 46 patients that presented with rhinitis-like symptoms strongly associated to the use of FFP masks. Some of them were obliged to use FFP masks in their work environment. Nasal endoscopy showed edemata of the nasal mucosa that significantly decreased after a period of non-use of FFP masks. Subjectively reported symptom levels decreased after cessation of FFP use for 3 or more days. The presence of polypropylene fibres isolated from nasal rinsing solution was significantly associated with the use of FFP masks in our patients. Material safety and performance deregulation of FFP masks can pose a health risk. Thus, especially healthcare professionals and other individuals with occupational need for FFP masks should be aware of possible hazards that come with COVID-19 pandemic protection measures.","Klimek, Ludger; Huppertz, Tilman; Alali, Ali; Spielhaupter, Magdalena; Hörmann, Karl; Matthias, Christoph; Hagemann, Jan",World Allergy Organ J,,13

Although a major physiological function of PF4 is to promote blood coagulation, this cytokine is involved in innate and adaptive immunity in events when platelets are activated in response to infections. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have abnormal coagulation activities, and severe patients develop higher D-dimer levels. D-dimers are small protein products present in the blood after blood clots are degraded by fibrinolysis. To prevent clotting, heparin is often clinically used in COVID-19 patients. Some clinical procedures for the management of COVID-19 patients may include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which also require the use of heparin. Anti-PF4 antibodies are frequently detected in severe patients and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can also be observed. PF4 and its role in HIT as well as in pathologies seen in COVID-19 patients define a potential therapeutic option of using blocking antibodies in the treatment of COVID-19.","Cai, Zheng; Greene, Mark I; Zhu, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Hongtao",,,13

There is discord between guidelines for hypoxemia management in COVID-19. Both noninvasive management and intubation present risk to patients and staff and potentially overwhelm hospital mechanical ventilator capacity. The use of HFNO has been particularly controversial in the UK, with oxygen infrastructure failure. We discuss our experience of managing COVID-19 with HFNO and awake self-prone positioning. We focus upon the less-usual case of an eighteen-year-old female to illustrate the type of patient where HFNO may be used when perhaps earlier intubation once was. It is important to consider the wider implications of intubation. We have used HFNO as a bridge to intubation or as definitive management. As we await clinical trial evidence, HFNO with self-prone positioning has a role in COVID-19 for certain patients. Response parameters must be set and reviewed, oxygen infrastructure considered, and potential staff droplet exposure minimised.

We use publicly available monthly data from January 2011 through April 2020 on all-cause death counts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and employment from the Current Population Survey to estimate excess all-cause mortality and employment displacement in April 2020 in the United States. We report results nationally and separately by state and by age group. Nationally, excess all-cause mortality was 2.4 per 10,000 individuals (about 30% higher than reported COVID deaths in April) and employment displacement was 9.9 per 100 individuals. Across age groups 25 y and older, excess mortality was negatively correlated with economic damage; excess mortality was largest among the oldest (individuals 85 y and over: 39.0 per 10,000), while employment displacement was largest among the youngest (individuals 25 to 44 y: 11.6 per 100 individuals). Across states, employment displacement was positively correlated with excess mortality (correlation = 0.29). However, mortality was highly concentrated geographically, with the top two states (New York and New Jersey) each experiencing over 10 excess deaths per 10,000 and accounting for about half of national excess mortality. By contrast, employment displacement was more geographically spread, with the states with the largest point estimates (Nevada and Michigan) each experiencing over 16 percentage points employment displacement but accounting for only 7% of the national displacement. These results suggest that policy responses may differentially affect generations and geographies.","Polyakova, Maria; Kocks, Geoffrey; Udalova, Victoria; Finkelstein, Amy",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,13

Besides, loading, capacity, body, morphological, chest and dactyl-thorax indexes were also measured. The results showed that there were not significant differences between castrated and non-castrated animals for almost all measured characteristics. However, castrated horses had greater liveweight, thorax perimeter and index capacity than non-castrated animals.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to both the public health and the durability of our health care systems and will profoundly affect the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The objective of this article is to provide a natural history of COVID-19-including virology, epidemiology, and transmission patterns-and a guide for plastic surgeons regarding patient and resource management. METHODS: The authors reviewed existing literature regarding COVID-19, both primary research and secondary reviews, by means of PubMed queries, and recommendations from relevant professional organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons and American Society of Plastic Surgeons). The literature and recommendations were summarized to provide a specific guide for plastic surgeons. RESULTS: Internationally, over 5.7 million cases and 357,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at the time of writing. No pharmacologic treatments have been identified, but epidemiologic strategies were identified to prevent viral spread, preserve health care resources, and protect patients and surgeons globally. Specific recommendations for plastic and reconstructive surgeons include postponing elective cases and transitioning to telecommunication platforms for patient consultations and education. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to the public health and the durability of health care systems in the contemporary era. Although plastic and reconstructive surgery may seem relatively remote from the pandemic in direct patient care and exposure, our field can significantly enhance health care resource management.","MacKenzie, Ethan L; Poore, Samuel O",Plast Reconstr Surg,,13

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: All ICUs in Iceland (Landspitali University Hospital and Akureyri Regional Hospital). PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the ICU for management of coronavirus disease 2019 between March 14, 2020, and April 13, 2020, with follow-up through May 5, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were admitted to the ICU for coronavirus disease 2019 out of 1,788 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cases, rendering an overall admission ratio of 1.5% (95% CI, 1.0-2.2%). The population rate of ICU admission for coronavirus disease 2019 was 7.4 (95% CI, 4.9-10.8) admissions per 100,000 individuals. The hospital mortality of patients admitted to the ICU was 15% (95% CI, 4-34%), and the mortality of patients receiving mechanical ventilation was 19% (95% CI, 4-46%). CONCLUSIONS: We report a lower overall ratio of ICU admissions for coronavirus disease 2019 among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients and a lower hospital mortality for patients treated in the ICU for coronavirus disease 2019 compared with initial reports from Italy and China. Our results could be explained by the early adoption of widespread testing and a successful national response to the pandemic.","Kristinsson, Bjarki; Kristinsdottir, Linda B; Blondal, Asbjorn T; Thormar, Katrin M; Kristjansson, Mar; Karason, Sigurbergur; Sigvaldason, Kristinn; Sigurdsson, Martin I",Crit Care Med,,13

The pressure of caring for patients is amplified in the setting of a virus with human-human transmission and no specific lifesaving treatment. Handling life and death situations while simultaneously putting one's own life at risk contributes to an actual sense of danger. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used every day by healthcare personnel (HCP) to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing care. PPE helps protect health care workers from potentially infectious patients and materials, toxic medications, and other potentially dangerous substances used in healthcare delivery.

METHODS: Weekly national survey of paediatricians with an open-ended questionnaire. RESULTS: During the 6-week study survey period, the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit received 33 reports about 55 instances where paediatricians believed care may have been compromised, about half (56%) relating to infants aged from birth to 6 weeks. Compromised care was for acute presentations in 75%, acute complications of a chronic illness in 14%, with 11% for chronic conditions. Paediatricians reported the outcome as moderately severe (short-term morbidity, increased length of stay, higher level of care) in 38 cases (69%) and in a further 4 (7%) as severe (potential to be life-threatening or result in permanent disability). CONCLUSION: Despite clear messaging, hospital avoidance and reduced access to primary and secondary care were associated with significant potential harm for children in New Zealand during a strict lockdown, with newborn infants disproportionately affected. During the implementation of interventions to eliminate community transmission of COVID-19, New Zealand paediatricians note the importance of face-to-face post-natal visits for newborns and primary care services for children with acute illness, to avoid preventable harm.","Duncanson, Mavis; Wheeler, Benjamin J; Jelleyman, Timothy; Dalziel, Stuart R; McIntyre, Peter",J. paediatr. child health,,13

We previously demonstrated frequent pauci- and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) during the UK's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020).

In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

353437,A synthetic STING agonist inhibits the replication of human parainfluenza virus 3 and rhinovirus 16 through distinct mechanisms,2020,"We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. An important finding of this study is that a central agency (FEMA) can act as a coordinator for sharing critical resources that are in short supply over time to add efficiency in the system. Moreover, through properly managing risk-aversion of different entities (states) additional efficiency can be gained. An additional implication is that ramping up production early in the planning cycle allows to reduce shortfall significantly. An optimal timing of this production ramp-up consideration can be based on a cost-benefit analysis.","Mehrotra, Sanjay; Rahimian, Hamed; Barah, Masoud; Luo, Fengqiao; Schantz, Karolina",Nav Res Logist,,13

The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of complications and mortality in obese patients with COVID-19 are of diverse nature. Inflammation plays a central role in obesity. Metabolic alterations seen in obese patients are related to an inflammatory response, and several studies report elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in obese patients. Also, deregulated expression of adipokines, such as leptin and resistin, increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 that contribute to increased vascular leukocyte adhesiveness and additional oxidative stress. Additionally, it is now recognized that the chronic impairment of systemic vascular endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including obesity, when intensified by the detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 over the endothelium, may explain their worse outcomes in COVID-19. In fact, vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to a unfavorable response of the endothelium to the infection by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic environment in obesity may also provide a link to the increased cardiovascular events in these patients.","De Lorenzo, A.; Estato, V.; Castro-Faria-Neto, H.

356834,Hepatitis B Virus Core Protein Mediates the Upregulation of C5α Receptor 1 via NF-κB Pathway to Facilitate the Growth and Migration of Hepatoma Cells,2020,"BACKGROUND: Face mask use has increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers (HCW) wear masks for prolonged periods and are prone to adverse effects. Very little is known about face-mask-associated itch. METHODS: This Internet survey study investigated the prevalence, intensity and clinical characteristics of itch related to the use of face masks by HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were subsequently compared to the students' group. RESULTS: A total of 1156 HCW completed the survey. Among them, 31.6% (365) reported suffering from itch associated with face mask use. Itch was more frequent among females. Moreover, subjects who reported sensitive skin, atopic predispositions and facial dermatoses tended to report itch more frequently. The worst case of itch in the seven days prior to the study, assessed with the numeric rating scale (NRS), was 4.6 ± 2.0 points. Itch prevalence increased along with the duration of face mask use, being 34.6% among those who wore masks for more than 4 h. HCW reported itch significantly more frequently than students. CONCLUSIONS: Face-mask-associated itch is a frequent problem among HCW in the COVID-19 pandemic. Itch sensation may cause scratching, which may decrease necessary protection during the pandemic.","Krajewski, Piotr K; Matusiak, Lukasz; Szepietowska, Marta; Bialynicki-Birula, Rafal; Szepietowski, Jacek C",,,13

Antibiotics and antiviral medicines are essential medicines for the therapy of infectious diseases. This study aims to evaluate their availability, cost and affordability of AaAMs against infectious diseases in 41 public hospitals from 2013 to 2019 in Nanjing, China. METHODS: Data on the availability and price of 17 antibiotics and 6 antiviral medicines in 41 public hospitals were obtained from the Jiangsu Institute of Medicine Information. We adopted the WHO/Health Action International method to measure the availability, cost and affordability of these medicines. RESULTS: The availability of selected medicines against infectious diseases was relatively low; the median availability of originator brands was near-zero and that of lowest-priced generics during the survey period less than 50%. The total availability of medicines was poor in primary hospitals as compared to secondary and tertiary hospitals. The median daily-defined dose cost of originator brands was expensive (range from 66.11 RMB to 107.83 RMB), whereas that of lowest price generics was fairly acceptable at < 8 RMB. The affordability of most surveyed medicines was reasonable, which showed significant improvement over time, but the daily cost of a few medicines for originator brands exceeded the average daily wage. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the affordability of medicines surveyed was acceptable, while the availability was too low. There should be a great concern for improving the reserve system of anti-infective medicines in healthcare institutions. Policy should focus on improving the availability of generic drugs in hospitals and encouraging preferentially prescribed.","Zhu, Yulei; Xu, Xinglu; Fang, Wenqing; Wang, Ying; Dai, Huizhen; Li, Xin",Trop Med Int Health,,13

METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Medical Departments (MD) or Intensive Care Units (ICU), and 54 healthy controls. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were included (mean age 60.4±16.1 years, 68.5% male); 33.7% admitted to ICU. Twenty-four patients (26.9%) were enrolled before thromboprophylaxis administration; 45 patients (50.6%) received standard and 20 (22.5%) intermediate sub-therapeutic dose thromboprophylaxis. Overall, patients with COVID-19 showed a TG profile comparable to that of healthy subjects (i.e. comparable peak height, endogenous thrombin potential [ETP] with and without TM). The only exception was lag time and time to peak, prolonged in COVID-19 patients vs. controls. MD patients showed a similar TG profile to healthy controls, and ICU patients showed significantly decrease ETP (p=0.030) compared to MD. As for thromboprophylaxis, TG profile was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients without thromboprophylaxis vs. controls and vs. those with thromboprophylaxis. In this latter group, ETP inhibition was significantly decreased (p=0.0003) and positively correlated with anti-Xa activity (r=0.49, p=0.0017). However, patients with thromboprophylaxis had similar TG profile vs. controls. Intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis more effectively inhibited TG in severe COVID-19 patients by increasing ETP inhibition via ETP with TM reduction vs. standard dose. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients showed increased TG at diagnosis. Standard thromboprophylaxis reduced TG to levels of healthy controls. Intermediate sub-therapeutic thromboprophylaxis more effectively inhibited TG by decreasing ETP with TM.","Campello, Elena; Bulato, Cristiana; Spiezia, Luca; Boscolo, Annalisa; Poletto, Francesco; Cola, Marco; Gavasso, Sabrina; Simion, Chiara; Radu, Claudia Maria; Cattelan, Annamaria; Tiberio, Ivo; Vettor, Roberto; Navalesi, Paolo; Simioni, Paolo",Clin. chem. lab. med,,13

370096,The multifarious role of 14-3-3 family of proteins in viral replication,2020,"Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a key concern, and evaluating the effect of testing and infection prevention and control strategies is essential for guiding policy in this area. Using a within-hospital SEIR transition model of SARS-CoV-2 in a typical English hospital, we estimate that between 9 March 2020 and 17 July 2020 approximately 20% of infections in inpatients, and 73% of infections in healthcare workers (HCWs) were due to nosocomial transmission. Model results suggest that placing suspected COVID-19 patients in single rooms or bays has the potential to reduce hospital-acquired infections in patients by up to 35%. Periodic testing of HCWs has a smaller effect on the number of hospital-acquired COVID-19 cases in patients, but reduces infection in HCWs by as much as 37% and results in only a small proportion of staff absences (approx. 0.3% per day). This is considerably less than the 20-25% of staff that have been reported to be absent from work owing to suspected COVID-19 and self-isolation. Model-based evaluations of interventions, informed by data collected so far, can help to inform policy as the pandemic progresses and help prevent transmission in the vulnerable hospital population.

This study aimed to examine the livelihoods, coping strategies, and access to healthcare among SR based on registration status and accompanying formal assistance. A mixed-method approach with more emphasis on the qualitative design was adopted. A purposive convenient sampling approach was used to recruit SR from informal tented settlements (ITS) in the Beqaa region in Lebanon. Data collection included 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) that were conducted with participants, who were further divided into three groups: registered refugees with assistance, registered without assistance and unregistered. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from humanitarian organizations. All interviews and FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. SR were highly dependent on formal assistance when received, albeit being insufficient. Regardless of registration status, refugees resorted to informal livelihood strategies, including informal employment, child labor, early marriage, and accruing debt. Poor living conditions and food insecurity were reported among all SR. Limited healthcare access and high out-of-pocket costs led to limited use of antenatal care services, prioritizing life-threatening conditions, and resorting to alternative sources of healthcare. Severity of these conditions and their adverse health consequences were especially pronounced among unregistered refugees. Our findings shed light on the economic and health disparities among marginalized SR, with the lack of registration and formal assistance increasing their vulnerability. More tailored and sustainable humanitarian programs are needed to target the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups.","Nabulsi, Dana; Ismail, Hussein; Abou Hassan, Fida; Sacca, Lea; Honein-AbouHaidar, Gladys; Jomaa, Lamis",PLoS One,,13

Both the pandemic and the measures taken to combat it can affect individuals' mental health. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these. METHOD: The study was performed using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. RESULTS: In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. CONCLUSION: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.","Özdin, Selçuk; Bayrak Özdin, Sükriye",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,13

The helicase protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents an attractive target for drug discovery since inhibition of helicase activity can suppress viral replication. Using in silico approaches, we have identified drugs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 helicase based on the presence of amino acid arrangements matching binding sites of drugs in previously annotated protein structures. The drugs exhibiting an RMSD of &#8804; 3.0 Å were further analyzed using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and post-MD analyses. Using these approaches, we found 12 drugs that showed strong interactions with SARS-CoV-2 helicase amino acids. The analyses were performed using the recently available SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure (PDB ID: 5RL6). Based on the MM-GBSA approach, out of the 12 drugs, two drugs, namely posaconazole and grazoprevir, showed the most favorable binding energy, - 54.8 and - 49.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, of the amino acids found conserved among all human coronaviruses, 10/11 and 10/12 were targeted by, respectively, grazoprevir and posaconazole. These residues are part of the crucial DEAD-like helicase C and DEXXQc_Upf1-like/ DEAD-like helicase domains. Strong interactions of posaconazole and grazoprevir with conserved amino acids indicate that the drugs can be potent against SARS-CoV-2. Since the amino acids are conserved among the human coronaviruses, the virus is unlikely to develop resistance mutations against these drugs. Since these drugs are already in use, they may be immediately repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Abidi, Syed Hani; Almansour, Nahlah Makki; Amerzhanov, Daulet; Allemailem, Khaled S; Rafaqat, Wardah; Ibrahim, Mahmoud A A; la Fleur, Philip; Lukac, Martin; Ali, Syed",Sci Rep,,13

Here, we show that NHP is biosynthesized in several other plant species in response to microbial attack, generally together with its direct metabolic precursor pipecolic acid and the phenolic immune signal salicylic acid. For example, NHP accumulates locally in inoculated leaves and systemically in distant leaves of cucumber in response to Pseudomonas syringae attack, in Pseudomonas-challenged tobacco and soybean leaves, in tomato inoculated with the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, in leaves of the monocot Brachypodium distachyon infected with bacterial (Xanthomonas translucens) and fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae) pathogens, and in M. oryzae-inoculated barley. Notably, resistance assays indicate that NHP acts as a potent inducer of acquired resistance to bacterial and fungal infection in distinct monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Pronounced systemic accumulation of NHP in leaf phloem sap of locally inoculated cucumber supports a function for NHP as a phloem-mobile immune signal. Our study thus generalizes the existence and function of an NHP resistance pathway in plant systemic acquired resistance.","Schnake, Anika; Hartmann, Michael; Schreiber, Stefan; Malik, Jana; Brahmann, Lisa; Yildiz, Ipek; von Dahlen, Janina; Rose, Laura E; Schaffrath, Ulrich; Zeier, Jürgen",,,13

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and gain important new insights of a group interviewing method with vulnerable people and their support group, adapted and transferred online during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This research examines the experiences of 35 participants (nine family groups composed of parents and young people), involved in a research project that explores a sensitive topic, youth alcohol consumption and family communication, that was moved online during lockdown. Researcher reflections on running group interviews face-to-face prior to COVID- 19 and online during lockdown are included in the data. Findings: Thematic analysis of participant interviews and researcher reflections reveals four key benefits and three limitations of online group interviews with vulnerable people and their support group. The benefits include being comfortable, non-intrusive and safe; engaging and convenient; online communication ease and easy set-up. The limitations relate to lack of non-verbal communication, poor set-up, and privacy and access issues. Practical implications: The global environment is uncertain and being able to implement effective qualitative research online is essential for TSR and service research in the future. This paper provides a step by step procedure for an innovative online group interviewing technique that can be used by TSR and qualitative service researchers. Originality/value: Conducting research during a pandemic has provided unprecedented insights into qualitative research approaches and methodology. This paper contributes to literature on service and TSR methodology by providing a framework for researchers to investigate vulnerable groups online in an effective, safe and non-intrusive way.

Meanwhile, a large prophylaxis study of HCQ sulfate for COVID-19 has been initiated in the United States. HCQ offered a promising efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, but the optimal administration is still being explored. METHODS: Use the keyword 'Hydroxychloroquine' to conduct a literature search in PubMed to collect relevant literature on the mechanism of action of HCQ, clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, precautions for clinical use and drug interactions, and extract and organize information. RESULTS: This paper reviews the mechanism, clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, exposure-response relationship and precautions and drug interactions of HCQ, and summarized dosage recommendations for HCQ sulfate. CONCLUSION: It has been proved that HCQ, which has an established safety profile, is effective against SARS-CoV-2 with sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence. Data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed worldwide.","Cui, Cheng; Tu, Siqi; En, Valerie Sia Jie; Li, Xiaobei; Yao, Xueting; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",,,13

401798,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on protein structures and intraviral protein-protein interactions,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has greatly changed the way surgery is delivered. In particular, current guidelines and policies have highlighted the need to use high level Personal Protective Equipment to reduce the risk of viral infection during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. In particular, it was felt that the laparoscopic approach was at higher risk of viral transmission due to the chimney effect of the smoke escape from the trocars during and after the procedure. However, with this being a new and largely unknown viral agent, guidelines have been based on speculation and extrapolation from previous studies conducted in completely different situations, and led to anxiety amongst surgeons and theatre staff. We decided to conduct a systematic review of the Literature to try to clarify whether inhalation of surgical smoke can increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A thorough search of the relevant Literature was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and the most relevant papers on this topic were selected for qualitative analysis. Duplicates, review, personal opinions and guidelines have been excluded. Quantitative analysis has not been performed due to the lack of homogeneous high-quality studies. RESULTS: Literature search identified 740 papers but only 34 of them were suitable for qualitative analysis. The quality of those studies is generally quite low. We were not able to find any evidence directly linking surgical smoke with viral transmission, other than in patients with active HPV infection. DISCUSSION: Inhalation of surgical smoke can be generally hazardous, and therefore the use of PPE during surgical operations must be recommended in any case. However, the present systematic review of the existent Literature did not identify any significant evidence of the risk of viral transmission with the surgical smoke, therefore the current guidelines restricting the use of laparoscopy and/or diathermy during the current Covid-19 pandemic may be considered excessive and non-evidence based.","Antunes, Diandra; Lami, Mariam; Chukwudi, Agbim; Dey, Abhishek; Patel, Mahul; Shabana, Amanda; Shams, Mohamed; Slack, Zoe; Bond-Smith, Giles; Tebala, Giovanni",Surg.

401800,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on protein structures and intraviral protein-protein interactions,2020,"Replication of the â¼30 kb-long coronavirus genome is mediated by a complex of non-structural proteins (NSP), in which NSP7 and NSP8 play a critical role in regulating the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity of NSP12. The assembly of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP12 proteins is highly dynamic in solution, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We report the crystal structure of the complex between NSP7 and NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2, revealing a 2:2 heterotetrameric form. Formation of the NSP7-NSP8 complex is mediated by two distinct oligomer interfaces, with interface I responsible for heterodimeric NSP7-NSP8 assembly, and interface II mediating the heterotetrameric interaction between the two NSP7-NSP8 dimers. Structure-guided mutagenesis, combined with biochemical and enzymatic assays, further reveals a structural coupling between the two oligomer interfaces, as well as the importance of these interfaces for the RdRP activity of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex. Finally, we identify an NSP7 mutation that differentially affects the stability of the NSP7-NSP8 and NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complexes leading to a selective impairment of the RdRP activity. Together, this study provides deep insights into the structure and mechanism for the dynamic assembly of NSP7 and NSP8 in regulating the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with important implications for antiviral drug development.","Biswal, Mahamaya; Diggs, Stephen; Xu, Duo; Khudaverdyan, Nelli; Lu, Jiuwei; Fang, Jian; Blaha, Gregor; Hai, Rong; Song, Jikui",Nucleic Acids Res,,13

A large proportion of ""COVID-survivors"" - and not only elderly patients - suffers from ""post-COVID-syndrome"". Risk factors are preexisting somatic multimorbidity, cognitive and cerebral changes together with pneumonia and hypoxemia, intensive care treatment and confusional states during the acute phase of illness. Post-COVID cognitive deficits usually manifest as a frontal dysexecutive syndrome combined with fatigue and dysphoria and/or with attentional and memory deficits. Several pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID encephalopathy are understood, but no specific treatment strategies have been established so far. We assume that general practitioners, psychiatrists, neurologists and social workers will need to take care of the activation, reintegration and expert appraisals of patients with post-COVID fatigue and cognitive deficits during the years to come.","Berlit, Peter; Frölich, Lutz; Förstl, Hans",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,13

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of a stepping exergame program on gait speed, balance, mobility, reaction time, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and daily life functioning in people with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks, three times weekly, 15 min of exergaming versus watching preferred music videos. The exergame device consisted of a pressure-sensitive step training platform on which participants performed stepping movements to play the games. The device automatically adapted the training level to the participants' capabilities. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), step reaction time test (SRTT), Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL), and Katz Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. A Quade's non-parametric ANCOVA controlling for baseline values with post hoc Bonferroni correction (p < 0.00625) was used to analyze pre- and post-differences between the groups. Partial eta-squared (Î·2p) effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-five of 55 randomized inpatients with mild to moderate MNCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score = 17.2 ± 4.5; aged 70-91; 35 women) completed the study. The exergame group (n = 23) demonstrated improvements in gait speed (p < 0.001, Î·2p = 0.41), total SPPB (p < 0.001, Î·2p = 0.64), SRTT (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.51), MoCA (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.38), and reductions in CSDD (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.43) compared to the control group (n = 22). There were no differences in NPI (p = 0.165, Î·2p = 0.05), DQoL (p = 0.012, Î·2p = 0.16), and ADL (p = 0.008, Î·2p = 0.16) post-intervention scores between the experimental and control group, albeit DQol and ADL measures showed large effect sizes in the exergame group. The mean attendance rate was 82.9% in the exergame group and 73.7% in the music control group. There were no study-related adverse events reported by the participants, nor observed by the research team. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot RCT suggest that an individually adapted exergame training improves lower extremity functioning, cognitive functioning and step reaction time and symptoms of depression in inpatients with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities.

METHODS: 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. RESULTS: Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices. CONCLUSION: Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung.","Shang, Yalei; Xu, Chuanjun; Jiang, Fengli; Huang, Renjun; Li, Yonggang; Zhou, Ying; Xu, Feng; Dai, Hui",Int J Infect Dis,,13

Here, for the first time, we report the crucial role of cathepsin L (CTSL) in patients with COVID-19. The circulating level of CTSL was elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was positively correlated with disease course and severity. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, CTSL is a promising target for new anti-COVID-19 drug development.","Zhao, Miao-Miao; Yang, Wei-Li; Yang, Fang-Yuan; Zhang, Li; Huang, Wei-Jin; Hou, Wei; Fan, Chang-Fa; Jin, Rong-Hua; Feng, Ying-Mei; Wang, You-Chun; Yang, Jin-Kui",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,13

METHODS: Descriptive study of the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients attended in a 10-week confinement period. Reported satisfaction of the participating patients and doctors was evaluated through an online survey. RESULTS: In the 10-week period, 291 ophthalmologic telemedicine consultations were performed. The main reasons for consultation were inflammatory conditions of the ocular surface and eyelids (79.4%), followed by administrative requirements (6.5%), non-inflammatory conditions of the ocular surface (5.2%), strabismus suspicion (3.4%) and vitreo-retinal symptoms (3.1%). According to previously defined criteria, 22 patients (7.5%) were referred to immediate face-to-face consultation. The level of satisfaction was high, both in doctors (100%) and in patients (93.4%).

425017,"Lipase immobilization with support materials, preparation techniques, and applications: Present and future aspects",2020,"As COVID-19 vaccines become available, supply is expected to initially fall short of demand. In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued guidance on which groups should be prioritized to receive vaccines. For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.","Lemke, Michael K",Am J Ind Med,,13

METHODS: Patients who had an active DFU during the COVID-19 emergency were included. All participants were managed using a specific triage system driven both by ulcer'severity and concomitant co-diseases. Subjects with severely complicated DFUs were urgently referred to hospital regardless of the concomitant comorbidities. Subjects with complicated DFUs received outpatient evaluation (within 48-72 h) and were admitted to hospital if required (revascularization, surgical intervention, intravenous antibiotic therapy); after the first outpatient visit or hospitalization, patients were followed according to the number of comorbidities (in the case of 3 or more comorbidities patients were followed up by telemedicine). Patients with uncomplicated DFUs were managed by telemedicine after outpatient evaluation. Healing, major amputation, death and rate of COVID-19 infection were evaluated. The minimum follow-up was 1 month. RESULTS: The study group included 151 patients. The mean age was 69.9 ± 14.2 years, 58.9% were male and 91.4% had type 2 diabetes; 58.7% had severely complicated, 21% complicated and 20.3% uncomplicated DFUs.

Due to the significance of determining the risk factors for getting COVID-19 among MS patients, the present study was designed to assess the risk of infection following the pulse steroid therapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all MS patients that received corticosteroids in Tehran from December 2019 to August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic spread. The subjects' clinical records including their sex, age, the type of MS, the type of medication, the number of days using corticosteroids, the status of prednisolone intake, and the number of days receiving prednisolone after the corticosteroid therapy were obtained. Moreover, main outcomes such as COVID-19 infection and the occurrence of death were recorded by patient's visits and follow-up phone calls. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by physicians according to the clinical performance of RT-PCR, chest CT scan, and antibody tests. RESULTS: Totally, 133 MS cases participated in the study, and the pulse therapy was completed for 104 (78.2%) patients up to 5-7 days. 89 (66.9%) cases used the prednisolone tablet following the pulse therapy. Overall, the infection by Covid-19 was observed in 8 (6%) cases, among whom 5 (71.4%) cases received the pulse therapy for 5-7 days and 4 (57.1%) cases had a history of taking the prednisolone tablet. The age of less than 40 years (OR = 1.03; 95% CI (0.23-4.51)), male sex (OR = 0.35; 95% CI (0.03-3.34)), and the RRMS type (OR = 2.87; 95% CI (0.52-15.72)) had no effect on the risk of Covid-19 infection. In addition, there was not statistically significant difference between subjects with the short-term pulse therapy duration (3-4 days) (OR 0.68 (0.12-3.74) and those with the long-term pulse therapy duration (5-7 days). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed between subjects taking prednisolone (OR = 1.62 (0.34-7.61) and those not taking prednisolone. Furthermore, there was no significant association between different medication groups and the risk of Covid-19 infection (p < 0.05). No death occurred due to Covid-19 infection among the subjects. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was more common among female and younger patients as well as patients with a longer duration of the pulse therapy and prednisolone intake. There was no significant association between the pulse steroid therapy in MS patients and the risk of infection by COVID-19 in the Iranian population.","Naser Moghadasi, Abdorreza; Shabany, Maryam; Heidari, Hora; Eskandarieh, Sharareh",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,13

Hence, this study aims to identify the actions of 50 main multilatinas to face the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative content analysis was conducted on newspapers published in Latin America and corporate websites from March 2020 to April 2020, during which the multilatinas took their first actions toward the pandemic. Findings: Results identified 106 actions taken by multilatinas in social, operational, philanthropic and financial areas. This paper analyzes the results, discuss the implications for business theories and develops three theoretical propositions. Practical implications: First, this study can serve as a reference for business decision-makers as it offers guidance in taking actions during a pandemic. Second, it highlights the importance of the speed of responses to unforeseen challenges. The study recommends that business managers include in their contingency plans procedures for addressing unforeseen situations, such as the pandemic, with a focus on increasing their response capacity. Originality/value: The importance of this study lies in understanding multinational enterprises’ (MNEs) initial actions taken during unexpected disasters and rare events. This study fills two important gaps in the business literature that have not been addressed in the Latin American context, namely, the actions taken by MNEs facing a public health disaster and how MNEs cope with disastrous and rare events. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lopez-Morales, J.

444110,Artificial Intelligence in Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data to Foster Precision Oncology,2021,"This study looked into the mechanism through which health education can reduce the fear of being infected with COVID-19 because health education helps individuals to improve their knowledge and attitudes towards a disease. The spread of COVID-19 has escalated the level of fear among public and nurses. Nevertheless, the mechanism that contributes to minimize the fear towards this pandemic remains unexplored. A cross-sectional survey was adopted to test the relationships among public health education, psychological capital, and fear of COVID-19. In total, 243 responses were obtained via online survey from nurses. The results revealed that public health education can reduce one's fear of COVID-19. Psychological capital emerged as a strong explanatory mechanism for the phenomenon. Drawing on spillover theory, public health education seems to reduce fear of COVID-19 with the mediating role of psychological capital. Limitations and future directions are at the end of this paper. The study outcomes revealed that organizations should focus on educating nursing staff to overcome fear of COVID-19. One way to induce positivity among nursing staff is by holding trainings.","Mubarak, Namra; Safdar, Samyia; Faiz, Shazia; Khan, Jabran; Jaafar, Mastura",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,13

With clinician burnout rising, efforts to promote clinician resilience are essential. Within this quality improvement project, an interprofessional debriefing program (Brigham Resilience in COVID-19-pandemic Emergency Forum-BRIEF) was developed within two emergency departments (EDs). An interprofessional group of ED providers led optional, nightly debriefings using a web-based portal to connect with ED clinicians for six weeks. In total, 81 interprofessional staff participated in nightly debriefings with a 47% attendance rate. On average, three participants attended the BRIEF nightly (range = 2-8) to discuss the challenges of social distancing, scarce resources, high acuity, clinician burnout and mental health. Participation increased as rates of COVID-19 positive patients rose. Debriefing leaders provided ED leadership with summaries of clinician experiences and suggestions for improvements. Feedback supported quality improvement initiatives within the ED and greater mental health support for staff. Clinicians and administrators provided positive feedback regarding the program's impact on clinician morale, and clinical processes that promoted the safety and quality of patient care. Optional debriefing with receptive departmental leadership may be a successful tool to support clinicians and hospitals during critical events.","Azizoddin, Desiree R; Vella Gray, Kristen; Dundin, Andrew; Szyld, Demian",J Interprof Care,,13
451556,Molecular Docking Identification for the efficacy of Some Zinc Complexes with Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine against Main Protease of COVID-19,2021,"Residents of long-term care (LTC) homes have suffered disproportionately during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the virus itself and often from the imposition of lockdown measures. Provincial Geriatrics Leadership Ontario, in collaboration with interRAI and the International Federation on Aging, hosted a virtual Town Hall on September 25, 2020. The purpose of this event was to bring together international perspectives from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts to address important themes potentially amenable to timely policy interventions. This article summarizes these themes and the ensuing discussions among 130 attendees from 5 continents. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frail residents of LTC homes reflects a systematic lack of equitable prioritization by health system decision makers around the world. The primary risk factors for an outbreak in an LTC home were outbreaks in the surrounding community, high staff and visitor traffic in large facilities, and crowding of residents in ageing buildings. Infection control measures must be prioritized in LTC homes, though care must be taken to protect frail and vulnerable residents from their overly blunt application that deprives residents from appropriate physical and psychosocial support. Staffing, in terms of overall numbers, training, and leadership skills, was inadequate. The built environment of LTC homes can be configured for both optimal resident well-being and infection control. Infection control and resident wellness need not be mutually exclusive. Improving outcomes for LTC residents requires more staffing with proper training and interprofessional leadership. All these initiatives must be underpinned by an effective quality assurance system based on standardized, comprehensive, accessible, and clinically relevant data, and which can support broad communities of practice capable of effecting real and meaningful change for frail older persons, wherever they chose to reside.","Heckman, George A; Kay, Kelly; Morrison, Adam; Grabowski, David C; Hirdes, John P; Mor, Vince; Shaw, Greg; Benjamin, Sophiya; Boscart, Veronique M; Costa, Andrew P; Declercq, Anja; Geffen, Leon; Sang Lum, Terry Yat; Moser, Andrea; Onder, Graziano; van Hout, Hein",J.

453121,Development of an IPM Strategy for Thrips and Tomato spotted wilt virus in Processing Tomatoes in the Central Valley of California,2020,"Infection with SARS-CoV2 leads to COVID-19, the severity of which derives from the host's immune response, especially the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This coronavirus infects by first binding to the ectoenzyme Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a serine protease acting as the receptor, while another serine protease is necessary for priming the viral spike ""S"" protein required for entering the cells. Repurposing existing drugs for potential anti-coronavirus activity have failed. As a result, there were intense efforts to rapidly produce ways of providing prophylactic active immunization (vaccines) or abortive passive (convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) neutralizing antibodies. The availability of vaccines for COVID-19 have been largely successful, but many questions still remain unanswered. In spite of the original enthusiasm, clinical studies using convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies have shown limited benefit. Moreover, the emergence of Long-COVID syndrome in most infected patients necessitates the development of treatment approaches that may prevent viral entry by blocking both serine proteases involved, as with a liposomal blend of the natural flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.","Theoharides, T C; Lauritano, D; Ronconi, G; Calvisi, V; Conti, P",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,13

METHODS: To evaluate the magnitude of global COVID-19 death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in children aged 0-19 years, a systematic review was conducted for articles and national reports as of December 7, 2020. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020179696). RESULTS: We reviewed 16,027 articles as well as 225 national reports from 216 countries. Among the 3,788 global pediatric COVID-19 deaths, 3,394 (91.5%) deaths were reported from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), while 83.5% of pediatric population from all included countries were from LMIC. The pediatric deaths/1,000,000 children and case fatality rate (CFR) were significantly higher in LMIC than in high-income countries (HIC) (2.77 in LMIC vs 1.32 in HIC; p < 0.001 and 0.24% in LMIC vs 0.01% in HIC; p < 0.001, respectively). The ICU admission/1,000,000 children was 18.80 and 1.48 in HIC and LMIC, respectively (p < 0.001).

458046,Applications of Deep Mutational Scanning in Virology,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on neurology resident training in Italy. METHOD: We created a web-based survey regarding changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of neurology trainees in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. RESULTS: Seventy-nine residents working in Italy completed the survey. A total of 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurologic duties since COVID-19 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on their neurologic training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had or will have a negative effect on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative effect on neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. The COVID-19 outbreak poses many challenges to academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurologic education.

461189,Cascading from SARS-CoV-2 to Parkinson’s Disease through Protein-Protein Interactions,2021,"The challenges presented by the COVID-19 epidemic have created a renewed interest in the development of new methods to combat infectious diseases. A prominent property of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the significant fraction of asymptomatic transmission. This may influence the effectiveness of the standard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected individuals. However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic threshold of epidemic spreading on networks are largely unknown. Here we study the critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic network model in the presence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining. We find that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard contact tracing loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic threshold. However, we also find that recursive contact tracing opens a possibility to contain epidemics with a large fraction of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. In particular, we calculate the required fraction of network nodes participating in the contact tracing for networks with arbitrary degree distributions and for varying recursion depths and discuss the influence of recursion depth and asymptomatic rate on the epidemic percolation phase transition. We test and illustrate our theoretical results using numerical simulations on infection trees and networks. We anticipate recursive contact tracing to provide a basis for digital, app-based contact tracing tools that extend the efficiency of contact tracing to diseases with a large fraction of asymptomatic transmission.","Baumgarten, Lorenz; Bornholdt, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09896v1.pdf,13

463262,Sensitivity and applications of the PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method,2021,"Cell-based drug-delivery systems have gained increasing attention as biocompatible delivery vehicles. Among them, platelets have the intrinsic affinity to the site of inflammation, based on which many platelet-mediated or platelet-membrane-mediated therapeutic carriers have been developed. In this work, platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) are engineered with loading of anti-inflammation therapeutics (TPCA-1) for targeting toward pneumonia treatment. We find that the PEVs showed the excellent capacity to accumulate at the site of pneumonia. These TPCA-1-loaded PEVs significantly inhibited the infiltration of pulmonary inflammatory cells and calmed local cytokine storm syndromes compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that PEVs could selectively target various inflammatory sites, broadening the theragnostic applications of this delivery strategy.Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles were engineered for targeted delivery of anti-inflammation therapeutics to treat pneumonia. This delivery strategy improved therapeutic efficacy, inhibited the pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration, and calmed local cytokine storm syndromes compared with the free drug-treated group.Pneumonia can cause high morbidity and mortality because of uncontrolled inflammation in the lung tissue. Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to saving the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mouse model with acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with [5-(p-fluorophenyl)-2-ureido]thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1), which can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the infiltration of pulmonary inflammatory cells and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic plaque, rheumatoid arthritis, and wounds associated with skin.","Ma, Qingle; Fan, Qin; Xu, Jialu; Bai, Jinyu; Han, Xiao; Dong, Ziliang; Zhou, Xiaozhong; Liu, Zhuang; Gu, Zhen; Wang, Chao",Matter,,13

468034,Identifying requirements for RSK2 specific inhibitors,2021,"RATIONALE: Early empirical antimicrobial treatment is frequently prescribed to critically ill patients with COVID-19, based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of early bacterial identification in intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia, and to characterize its microbiology and impact on outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation >48h were eligible if they had SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia at ICU admission. Bacterial identification was defined by a positive bacterial culture, within 48h after intubation, in endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood cultures, or a positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen test. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 1,050 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2 and 482 in influenza groups). The prevalence of bacterial identification was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia (9.7 vs 33.6%, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.30), adjusted OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.33), p<0.0001). Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 58% and 72% of co-infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pneumonia, respectively. Bacterial identification was associated with increased adjusted hazard ratio for 28-day mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.44), p=0.043). However, no significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to bacterial identification between the two study groups, suggesting that the impact of co-infection on mortality was not different between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial identification within 48h after intubation is significantly less frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia.

469201,Shutting down RNA-targeting CRISPR,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta coronavirus that uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a point of entry. The present review discusses the origin and structure of the virus and its mechanism of cell entry followed by the therapeutic potentials of strategies directed towards SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding, the renin-angiotensin system, and the kinin-kallikrein system. SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding-directed approaches mainly consist of targeting receptor binding domain, ACE2 blockers, soluble ACE2, and host protease inhibitors. In conclusion, blocking or manipulating the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding interface perhaps offers the best tactic against the virus that should be treated as a fundamental subject of future research.","Sharifkashani, Sourena; Bafrani, Melika Arab; Khaboushan, Alireza Soltani; Pirzadeh, Marzieh; Kheirandish, Ali; Yavarpour Bali, Hanie; Hessami, Amirhossein; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Eur J Pharmacol,,13

474111,Yeast as a promising heterologous host for steroid bioproduction,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In Africa, the overall death toll from COVID-19 is reported to be low but there is few individual-level evidence on the severity of the disease. We report the clinical spectrum and outcome of patients monitored in COVID-19 care centers (CCC) in two West-African countries. METHODS: Burkina Faso and Guinea set up referral CCCs to hospitalize all symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, regardless of the severity of their symptoms. We report the data collected from hospitalized patients by November 2020. RESULT: 1805 patients (64% men, median age 41) were admitted with COVID-19. Symptoms lasted for a median of 7 days (IQR 4-11). During hospitalization, 443 (25%) had at least once a SpO2 < 94%, 237 (13%) received oxygen and 266 (15%) corticosteroids. Mortality was 5% overall, and 1%, 5% and 14% in patients aged <40, 40-59 and &#8805;60. In multivariable analysis, the risk of death was higher in men (aOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1;3.6), people aged &#8805;60 (aOR 2.9, 95%CI 1.7;4.8) and those with chronic hypertension (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2;3.4).

480356,Identification of Potential Molecules Against COVID-19 Main Protease Through Structure-Guided Virtual Screening Approach,2020,"Early large-scale swab testing is a fundamental tool for health authorities to assess the prevalence of a virus and enact appropriate mitigation measures during an epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities.","Santini, Alberto",Omega,,13

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the extent to which digital marketing tools were adopted by furniture manufacturers in Malaysia. The effectiveness of digital marketing tools was assessed as an alternative furniture marketing medium by means of a questionnaire distributed to various fumiture suppliers. The results of the questionnaire indicated that the onset on the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital marketing among furniture manufacturers of all sizes. Larger manufacturers had the financial means to make greater investments into digital marketing to utilize it compared to the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Digital marketing by website, email, and social media were the most common mediums used by furniture manufacturers. As for social media applications, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were the common platforms used by furniture manufacturers. Although some furniture manufacturers were familiar with digital marketing, many were not using it effectively due to a lack of skilled workers with the ability to manage such digital marketing tools. Limited financial capital, especially among the SMEs, also made it difficult to enable the adoption of digital marketing.","Ratnasingam, J.; Jegathesan, N.; Ab Latib, H.; Ioras, F.; Mariapan, M.; Liat, L.

487417,Production of a Human Mitochondrial ABC Transporter in E. coli,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Pain is one of the most common symptoms in children who access the Pediatric Emergency Room (PER). However, many studies show that it is poorly evaluated and treated during the triage phase and that in many cases algometric scales aren't used for its evaluation. Faced with this, the Piacenza PER (Italy) implemented the Pain in Pediatric Emergency Room (PIPER) recommendations for the assessment and management of pain from the 1st July 2017. The aim of this study was to detect the possible differences in the trend of the outcomes for the detection and treatment of pain in July-October 2016, 2017, 2018. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was chosen. 811 discharge letters of extremity traumatized children aged 0-9 years were analyzed, of which 309 referred to the 2016 quarter, 243 to the 2017 quarter and 259 to the 2018 quarter. RESULTS: In 2016, the pain of 12 patients was assessed out of a total of 309, in 2017 of 227 out of 243 and in 2018 of 245 out of 259. The Chi Square test about assessed and not assessed pain, gave statistically significant value (p = 1.36E-98), comparing 2016vs2017 and gave not significant value comparing 2017vs2018 (p = 0.58). 4 patients were treated during the triage phase in 2016, 68 in 2017 and 70 in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations introduction has increased the frequency of pain algometric measurements during the triage phase by leading to an improvement in the nursing care outcomes in terms of pediatric pain management.","Granata, Carlotta; Guasconi, Massimo; Ruggeri, Francesca; Bolzoni, Marina; Grossi, Cinzia Franca; Biasucci, Giacomo; Cella, Andrea",Acta Biomed,,13

This sudden widespread shift to home-based teleworking was not anticipated. Consequently, the ability to make provisions to ensure the health and safety of workers was limited. Further, in many cases, the shift to working at home has been involuntary and likely to continue for an extended period. The study presented in this paper aimed to examine the health and well-being experiences in a sample of professional/managerial workers who were engaged in teleworking as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation developed. Data were collected from workers in the Australian construction industry who were required to work from home on alternate weeks to reduce the number of people in project offices. A multiwave survey was conducted at three construction projects. Longitudinal analysis of the data indicated a consistent gradual decline in the mental well-being of participants. The analysis identified a positive and significant relationship between work-life satisfaction and mental well-being and indicated that the effects of work hours, work pressure, work engagement, and work-life interference on mental well-being were mediated by the extent to which participants were satisfied with their work-life balance. Combining these results with qualitative comments made by participants helped to understand their varying experiences during the pandemic and the impact on their mental well-being. The results highlight the importance of considering work-life satisfaction and creating opportunities for improved work-family balance when designing teleworking arrangements. The paper contributes to knowledge and practice by providing the evidence that helps organizations to maximize the health benefits and reduce the risks associated with home-based working during (and potentially beyond) the pandemic. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Pirzadeh, P.; Lingard, H.",Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,,13

The underlying rationale is to prioritize patients in whom suspected disease course would be greatest impacted by endoscopy. We developed a nurse phone call-based process utilizing REDCap®, identifying relevant symptoms categorized by severity, and a validated functional impairment questionnaire for abdominal pain. We abstracted key laboratory and radiological findings also categorized by severity. The order of priority of procedures was established on the basis of a 4-tiered system factoring both presence and severity of symptoms or prior diagnostic testing results. We present the framework that we have adopted toward prioritizing procedures with the assumption that it offers an objective methodology and that can be efficiently and more broadly applied to other similar practice scenarios. Our tool may have wide-ranging implications both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and in other scenarios of limited resource allocation and deserves further investigation.","Kaur, Panamdeep; Attard, Thomas M; Fishman, Douglas S; Zapata, Fernando; Ditsch, Donna; Thomson, Mike; Schurman, Jennifer V",Gastroenterol Nurs,,13

This new pathogen has spread rapidly around more than 200 countries, in which Spain has one of the world's highest mortality rates so far. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. However, some contradictory studies have also been reported in the same research line. In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results. Herein, we report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain. Non-meteorological factors such as population density, population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been considered for the analysis. No evidence suggesting a reduction in COVID-19 cases at warmer mean, minimum and maximum temperatures has been found. Nevertheless, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the existing uncertainty about COVID-19 data, and should not be extrapolated to temperature ranges other than those analysed here for the early evolution period.","Briz-Redón, Álvaro; Serrano-Aroca, Ángel",Sci Total Environ,,13

Covid-19 initiated by an RNA type virus can cause more severe problems later on due to its ability to mutate. Integrated molecular research is required to determine the characteristics and potential of various variants of Covid-19 in mutations. This study was conducted by directing phylogenetic analysis on 17 samples of Covid-19 sequences from several countries taken from the NCBI database and followed by ORF analysis of each Covid-19 sample for further characterization. Based on the study, it is known that from 17 samples of Covid-19 sequences, Covid-19 sequences from Taiwan have the lowest similarity compared to 16 other Covid-19 sequences. These results are confirmed by the ORF analysis of each sample, which shows that the longest ORF in the Covid-19 sequence from Taiwan is an ORF 20 with lengthened by 4405 amino acids, and the shortest ORF is an ORF 38 with lengthened by 50 amino acids. However, 16 other sequence samples have the longest ORF 6, ORF 6, with lengthened by 4405 amino acids and the shortest ORF 44 with lengthened by 50 amino acids. The difference in ORF variation affects the similarity level of Covid-19 sequences from several countries. It is due to variations in ORF that produce amino acid variations that determine the Covid-19 phenotype. © 2021 Author(s).","Rozana, K.; Susanti, E.; Ciptawati, E.; Saputra, I. K.; Kurniawan, D.

This reduction in emissions has created a natural experiment to assess the impact of the emitted precursor control policy on ozone (O$_3$) pollution, which has become a public concern in China during the last decade. In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O$_3$ variations during the COVID-19 in China. Here we found that the O$_3$ formation regime shifted from a VOC-limited regime to a NOx-limited regime due to the lower NOx during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, instead of these changes of the O$_3$ formation region, the significant elevated O$_3$ in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these regions, which was different from previous studies. We suggest that future O$_3$ control policies should comprehensively consider the synergistic effects of O$_3$ formation regime and AOC on the O$_3$ elevation.","Zhu, Shengqiang; Poetzscher, James; Shen, Juanyong; Wang, Siyu; Wang, Peng; Science, Hongliang Zhang Department of Environmental; Engineering,; University, Fudan; Shanghai,; China,; Science, School of Environmental; Science, Nanjing University of Information; Technology,; Nanjing,; University, Shanghai Jiao Tong; Civil, Department of; Engineering, Environmental; University, Hong Kong Polytechnic; Kong, Hong; Eco-Chongming, Institute of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11714v1.pdf,13

The primary aim of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is to determine the impact of an intervention consisting of community-engaged, data-driven selection, and implementation of an integrated set of evidence-based practices (EBPs) on reducing opioid overdose deaths. METHODS: The HCS is a four year multi-site, parallel-group, cluster randomized wait-list controlled trial. Communities (n = 67) in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York and Ohio are randomized to active intervention (Wave 1), which starts the intervention in Year 1 or the wait-list control (Wave 2), which starts the intervention in Year 3. The HCS will test a conceptually driven framework to assist communities in selecting and adopting EBPs with three components: 1) A community engagement strategy with local coalitions to guide and implement the intervention; 2) A compendium of EBPs coupled with technical assistance; and 3) A series of communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma. An implementation science framework guides the intervention and allows for examination of the multilevel contexts that promote or impede adoption and expansion of EBPs. The primary outcome, number of opioid overdose deaths, will be compared between Wave 1 and Wave 2 communities during Year 2 of the intervention for Wave 1. Numerous secondary outcomes will be examined. DISCUSSION: The HCS is the largest community-based implementation study in the field of addiction with an ambitious goal of significantly reducing fatal opioid overdoses.","Walsh, Sharon L.; El-Bassel, Nabila; Jackson, Rebecca D.; Samet, Jeffrey H.; Aggarwal, Maneesha; Aldridge, Arnie P.; Baker, Trevor; Barbosa, Carolina; Barocas, Joshua A.; Battaglia, Tracy A.; Beers, Donna; Bernson, Dana; Bowers-Sword, Rachel; Bridden, Carly; Brown, Jennifer L.; Bush, Heather M.; Bush, Joshua L.; Button, Amy; Campbell, Aimee N.C.; Cerda, Magdalena; Cheng, Debbie M.; Chhatwal, Jag; Clarke, Thomas; Conway, Kevin P.; Crable, Erika L.; Czajkowski, Andrea; David, James L.; Drainoni, Mari-Lynn; Fanucchi, Laura C.; Feaster, Daniel J.; Fernandez, Soledad; Freedman, Darcy; Freisthler, Bridget; Gilbert, Louisa; Glasgow, LaShawn M.; Goddard-Eckrich, Dawn; Gutnick, Damara; Harlow, Kristin; Helme, Donald W.; Huang, Terry; Huerta, Timothy R.; Hunt, Timothy; Hyder, Ayaz; Kerner, Robin; Keyes, Katherine; Knott, Charles E.; Knudsen, Hannah K.; Konstan, Michael; Larochelle, Marc R.; Craig Lefebvre, R.; Levin, Frances; Lewis, Nicky; Linas, Benjamin P.; Lofwall, Michelle R.; Lounsbury, David; Lyons, Michael S.; Mann, Sarah; Marks, Katherine R.; McAlearney, Ann; McCollister, Kathryn E.; McCrimmon, Tara; Miles, Jennifer; Miller, Cortney C.; Nash, Denis; Nunes, Edward; Oga, Emmanuel A.; Oser, Carrie B.; Plouck, Tracy; Rapkin, Bruce; Freeman, Patricia R.; Rodriguez, Sandra; Root, Elisabeth; Rosen-Metsch, Lisa; Sabounchi, Nasim; Saitz, Richard; Salsberry, Pamela; Savitsky, Caroline; Schackman, Bruce R.; Seiber, Eric E.; Slater, Michael D.; Slavova, Svetla; Speer, Drew; Martinez, Linda Sprague; Stambaugh, Leyla F.; Staton, Michele; Stein, Michael D.; Stevens-Watkins, Danelle J.; Surratt, Hilary L.; Talbert, Jeffery C.; Thompson, Katherine L.; Toussant, Kim; Vandergrift, Nathan A.; Villani, Jennifer; Walker, Daniel M.; Walley, Alexander Y.; Walters, Scott T.; Westgate, Philip M.; Winhusen, Theresa; Wu, Elwin; Young, April M.; Young, Greg; Zarkin, Gary A.; Chandler, Redonna K.",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376871620305007; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108335; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871620305007?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248391/,13

590429,Two Inhibitors Against the 3C-Like Proteases of Swine Coronavirus and Feline Coronavirus,2021-07-06,"INTRODUCTION: The measurement of heart rate is commonly used to estimate exercise intensity. However, during endurance performance, the relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption may be compromised by cardiovascular drift. This physiological phenomenon mainly consists of a time-dependent increase in heart rate and decrease in systolic volume and may lead to overestimate absolute exercise intensity in prediction models based on heart rate. Previous research has established that cardiovascular drift is correlated to the increase in core body temperature during prolonged exercise. Therefore, monitoring body temperature during exercise may allow to quantify the increase in heart rate attributable to cardiovascular drift and to improve the estimate of absolute exercise intensity. Monitoring core body temperature during exercise may be invasive or inappropriate, but the external auditory canal is an easily accessible alternative site for temperature measurement. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to assess the degree of correlation between trends in heart rate and in ear temperature during 120 min of steady-state cycling with intensity of 59% of heart rate reserve in a thermally neutral indoor environment. Ear temperature will be monitored both at the external auditory canal level with a contact probe and at the tympanic level with a professional infrared thermometer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee. The results will be submitted for publication in academic journals and disseminated to stakeholders through summary documents and information meetings.","Polsinelli, Giovanni; Rodio, Angelo; Federico, Bruno",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2020-000907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880185/,13
590576,The use of nucleic acid hybridization to detect human coronaviruses,1989,"Case identification, isolation, and contact tracing are fundamental strategies used to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This has led to widespread testing that interrupted the supply chain for testing materials around the world. A prospective study was conducted to compare inexpensive and easily sourced 3-dimensionally (3D)-printed polylactic acid and polyester nasopharyngeal swabs to commercially manufactured swabs for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the study period, 287 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at multiple stages of their illness, were enrolled. The median age for the study population was 47.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 34.4 to 56.6 years), and two-thirds (67.6%) of the subjects were male. The median duration of hospitalization, at the time of sampling, was 13 days (IQR, 10 to 16 days). Overall concordance between the prototype and control swabs was 80.8% (Cohen’s kappa coefficient, 0.61). Most discrepant results were due to prototype-positive control-negative results. When considering all positive results to be true positives, the prototype swab had a higher sensitivity (90.6% versus 80.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7% to 94.0% and 74.7% to 85.7%, respectively; P < 0.015). The cost to produce the prototype swab was estimated to be $0.05 per swab. Polylactic acid 3D-printed polyester-tipped swabs were shown to be effective for nasopharyngeal sample collection. We believe that this design can easily be adopted in countries where commercial swabs are not readily available and can play a vital role in public health efforts for disease control in low-income countries.","Alghounaim, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al Youha, Sarah; Papenburg, Jesse; Alowaish, Osama; AbdulHussain, Ghadeer; Al-Shemali, Rawan; Albuloushi, Ahmad; Alzabin, Saud; Al-Wogayan, Khaled; Al-Mutawa, Yousef; Al-Sabah, Salman",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01668-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817232/,13
590668,Mechano-genomic regulation of coronaviruses and its interplay with ageing,2020-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides an opportunity for near real-time, cost-effective monitoring of community level transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can identify the presence of COVID-19 in the community, but methods are lacking for estimating the numbers of infected individuals based on wastewater RNA concentrations. METHODS: Composite wastewater samples were collected from three sewersheds and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on mass rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater was developed to predict the number of infected individuals. Predictions were compared to confirmed cases identified by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control for the same time period and geographic area. RESULTS: Model predictions for the relationship between mass rate of virus release to the sewersheds and numbers of infected individuals were validated based on estimated prevalence from individual testing. A simplified equation to estimate the number of infected individuals fell within the 95% confidence limits of the model. The unreported rate for COVID-19 estimated by the model was approximately 12 times that of confirmed cases. This aligned well with an independent estimate for the state of South Carolina. CONCLUSIONS: The SEIR model provides a robust method to estimate the total number of infected individuals in a sewershed based on the mass rate of RNA copies released per day. This overcomes some of the limitations associated with individual testing campaigns and thereby provides an additional tool that can be used to better inform policy decisions.","McMahan, C.

591239,Global Patterns of Recombination across Human Viruses,2021-02-15,"Background: Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from international travel is a priority. Travellers from countries with travel restrictions (closed travel-corridors) were required to quarantine for 14 days over Summer 2020 in England. We describe the genomic epidemiology of travel-related cases in England and evaluate the effectiveness of this travel policy. Methods: Between 27/05/2020 and 13/09/2020, probable travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases and their contacts were identified and combined with UK SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. The epidemiology and demographics of cases was identified, and the number of contacts per case modelled using negative binomial regression to estimate the effect of travel restriction, and any variation by age, sex and calendar date. Unique travel-related SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the COG-UK dataset were identified to estimate the effect travel restrictions on cluster size generated from these. The Polecat Clustering Tool was used to identify a travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cluster of infection. Findings: 4,207 travel-related SARS-CoV-2 cases are identified. 51.2% (2155/4207) of cases reported travel to one of three countries; 21.0% (882) Greece, 16.3% (685) Croatia and 14.0% (589) Spain. Median number of contacts per case was 3 (IQR 1-5), and greatest for the 16-20 age-group (9.0, 95% C.I.=5.6-14.5), which saw the largest attenuation by travel restriction. Travel restriction was associated with a 40% (rate ratio=0.60, 95% C.I.=0.37-0.95) lower rate of contacts. 827/4207 (19.7%) of cases had high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes available. Fewer genomically-linked cases were observed for index cases related to countries with travel restrictions compared to cases from non-travel restriction countries (rate ratio=0.17, 95% C.I.=0.05-0.52). A large travel-related cluster dispersed across England is identified through genomics, confirmed with contact-tracing data. Interpretation: This study demonstrates the efficacy of travel restriction policy in reducing the onward transmission of imported cases.

Unfortunately, many lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease with an associated poor prognosis. Recently, the Chinese herb root extract Triptolide/Minnelide (TL) has shown significant promise as a therapeutic agent for NSCLC treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of action regarding TL-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC. We demonstrate that triptolide treatment of A549 and H460 NSCLC cells decreases Caveolin-1 (CAV-1) mRNA/protein expression, resulting in activation of the Akt/Bcl-2-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. CAV-1 down-regulation was triggered by Micro-RNA 204-5p (miR204-5p) up-regulation and could be significantly blocked by pre-treatment with both Sirt-1/Sirt-3 specific siRNA and SIRT-1/SIRT-3 enzyme inhibitors, EX-527 and nicotinamide. Overall, our results provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which TL exerts its cytotoxic effects on NSCLC via CAV-1 down-regulation.

593198,Constant up-regulation of BiP/GRP78 expression prevents virus-induced apoptosis in BHK-21 cells with Japanese encephalitis virus persistent infection,2015-02-26,"BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the pandemic, only few studies focused on longitudinal immune monitoring in critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) whereas their hospital stay may last for several weeks. Consequently, the question of whether immune parameters may drive or associate with delayed unfavorable outcome in these critically ill patients remains unsolved. METHODS: We present a dynamic description of immuno-inflammatory derangements in 64 critically ill COVID-19 patients including plasma IFNα2 levels and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) score measurements. RESULTS: ARDS patients presented with persistently decreased lymphocyte count and mHLA-DR expression and increased cytokine levels. Type-I IFN response was initially induced with elevation of IFNα2 levels and ISG score followed by a rapid decrease over time. Survivors and non-survivors presented with apparent common immune responses over the first 3 weeks after ICU admission mixing gradual return to normal values of cellular markers and progressive decrease of cytokines levels including IFNα2. Only plasma TNF-α presented with a slow increase over time and higher values in non-survivors compared with survivors. This paralleled with an extremely high occurrence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of ARDS in response to SARS-CoV2 infection appears to be strongly associated with the intensity of immune alterations upon ICU admission of COVID-19 patients. In these critically ill patients, immune profile presents with similarities with the delayed step of immunosuppression described in bacterial sepsis.

Our aim is to provide readers with fundamental principles and concepts for the management of sABI and ARDS, and highlight challenges and conflicts encountered while managing concurrent disease. Up to 40 percent of patients with sABI can develop ARDS. While there are trials and guidelines to support the mainstays of treatment for ARDS and sABI independently, guidance on concomitant management is limited. Treatment strategies aimed at managing severe ARDS may at times conflict with the management of sABI. In this narrative review, we discuss the physiological basis and risks involved during simultaneous management of ARDS and sABI, summarize evidence for treatment decisions, and demonstrate these principles using hypothetical case scenarios. Use of invasive or non-invasive monitoring to assess brain and lung physiology may facilitate goal-directed treatment strategies with the potential to improve outcome. Understanding the pathophysiology and key treatment concepts for co-management of these conditions is critical to optimizing care in this high-acuity patient population.","Kim, Jennifer A.; Wahlster, Sarah; LaBuzetta, Jamie Nicole; Nobleza, Christa O’Hana S.; Johnson, Nicholas J.; Rubinos, Clio; Malaiyandi, Deepa; O’Phalen, Kristine H.; Mainali, Shraddha; Sarwal, Aarti; Gilmore, Emily J.",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506794/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.08.066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221038381?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221038381,13

Methods The study included 5 male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between April 3 and April 12, 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Results RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in one of the patient and negative in rest four patients. We also noted positive response to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) specific treatment in SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient. Conclusion It should be kept in mind that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for the prevention of infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment.","Kılıc, Osman; Kalcıoglu, Mahmut Tayyar; Cag, Yasemin; Tuysuz, Ozan; Pektas, Emel; Caskurlu, Hulya; Cetın, Ferihan",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535294/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220304586?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220304586,13
595017,The Evolution and Genetics of Virus Host Shifts,2014-11-06,"Since the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak keeps on spreading all through the world, scientists have been crafting varied technologies mainly focusing on AI for an approach to acknowledge the difficulties of the epidemic. In this current worldwide emergency, the clinical business is searching for new advancements to screen and combat COVID-19 contamination. Strategies used by artificial intelligence can stretch screen the spread of the infection, distinguish highly infected patients, and be compelling in supervising the illness continuously. The artificial intelligence anticipation can further be used for passing dangers by sufficiently dissecting information from past sufferers. International patient support with recommendations for population testing, medical care, notification, and infection control can help fight this deadly virus. We proposed the hybrid deep learning method to diagnose COVID-19. The layered approach is used here to measure the symptom level of the patients and to analyze the patient image data whether he/she is positive with COVID-19. This work utilizes smart AI techniques to predict and diagnose the coronavirus rapidly by the Oura smart ring within 24 h. In the laboratory, a coronavirus rapid test is prepared with the help of a deep learning model using the RNN and CNN algorithms to diagnose the coronavirus rapidly and accurately. The result shows the value 0 or 1. The result 1 indicates the person is affected with coronavirus and the result 0 indicates the person is not affected with coronavirus. X-Ray and CT image classifications are considered here so that the threshold value is utilized for identifying an individual’s health condition from the initial stage to a severe stage. Threshold value 0.5 is used to identify coronavirus initial stage condition and 1 is used to identify the coronavirus severe condition of the patient. The proposed methods are utilized for four weighting parameters to reduce both false positive and false negative image classification results for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.","Poongodi, M.; Hamdi, Mounir; Malviya, Mohit; Sharma, Ashutosh; Dhiman, Gaurav; Vimal, S.",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654480/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-021-01541-4,13

Recent studies have demonstrated the unique features of T cells in neonate mice, such as more sensitive to antigen response and preference toward T helper 2 (Th2) response and regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation. However, the biological characteristics of neonatal age-derived CD4(+) T cells following homeostasis remain unclear. Here we utilized a lineage tracing model of TCRδ(CreER)R26(ZsGreen) to mark neonatal- and adult-derived CD4(+) T cells followed by a combination analysis of activation, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Our results showed that neonatal CD4(+) T cells had higher capacity of activation, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation toward Th2 and T helper 17 (Th17) lineages, accompanied by a reduced potential for T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 9 (Th9), and Treg lineages. In contrast, tracked neonatal CD4(+) T cells exhibited similar characters of above-mentioned of tracked adult cells in adult mice. Therefore, our data support a natural requirement for CD4(+) T cells to acquire fully-equipped functional potentials of adult cells.","Lei, Lei; Zhang, Xingzhe; Yang, Xiaofeng; Su, Yanhong; Liu, Haiyan; Yang, Hang; Wang, Jinli; Zou, Yujing; Wang, Xin; Jiao, Anjun; Zhang, Cangang; Zheng, Huiqiang; Zhang, Jiahui; Zhang, Dan; Shi, Lin; Zhou, Xiaobo; Sun, Chenming; Zhang, Baojun",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777965/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.659744,13

This is necessary for developing and tailoring health messaging to maximize uptake of health information and vaccines. The current study explored students' beliefs and attitudes about vaccines in general, and the new COVID-19 vaccines specifically. This study provides insights into effective health messaging needed to rapidly increase COVID-19 vaccination on college campuses--information that will continue to be informative in future academic years across a broad scope of pathogens. Data were collected via an online cohort survey of college students aged 18 years and older residing on or near the campus of a large public university during fall 2020. Overall, we found COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in college students correlated strongly with some concerns about vaccines in general as well as with concerns specific to COVID-19 vaccines. Taken together, these results provide further insight for message development and delivery, and can inform more effective interventions to advance critical public health outcomes on college campuses beyond the current pandemic.","Small, M.

Restrictions imposed by local governments worldwide have compromised the mobility of patients and decreased the number of physicians in hospitals. Additional requirements in terms of medical staff security further limited the physical contact of doctors with their patients, thereby questioning the traditional methods of clinical examination. Our institution has developed an organization model to translate the essential clinical services into virtual consultation rooms using a telemedicine interface which is commonly available to patients. We provide examples of clinical activity for a maxillofacial surgery department based on teleconsultation. Our experience is summarized and an organization model is drafted in which outpatient consultation offices are translated into virtual room environments. Clinical examples are provided, demonstrating how each subspecialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery can benefit from virtual examinations. The concept of “telesemeiology” is introduced and a checklist is presented to guide clinicians to perform teleconsultations. This paper is intended to provide an organization model based on telemedicine for maxillofacial surgeons and aims to represent an aid for colleagues who are facing the pandemic in areas where lockdown limits the possibility of a physical examination.","Robiony, Massimo; Bocin, Elena; Sembronio, Salvatore; Costa, Fabio; Bresadola, Vittorio; Tel, Alessandro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932911/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186622,13

METHOD: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective resection of colon or rectal cancer without preoperative suspicion of SARS‐CoV‐2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID‐19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30‐day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS‐CoV‐2 and a comparison with prepandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. RESULTS: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. Thirty‐day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS‐CoV‐2 was 3.8% (78/2073) and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS‐CoV‐2 (14/1601, 0.9%) and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS‐CoV‐2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58–14.06), postoperative SARS‐CoV‐2 (16.90, 7.86–36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01–5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32–6.20) and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16–10.21). Compared with prepandemic data, there were fewer anastomotic leaks (4.9% versus 7.7%) and an overall shorter length of stay (6 versus 7 days) but higher mortality (1.7% versus 1.1%). CONCLUSION: Surgeons need to further mitigate against both SARS‐CoV‐2 and anastomotic leak when offering surgery during current and future COVID‐19 waves based on patient, operative and organizational risks.","Glasbey, James C.; Nepogodiev, Dmitri; Simoes, Joana F.

597343,Genetic distance of SARS coronavirus from the recent natural case,2007-02-25,"OBJECTIVE: Studies have documented the significant direct and indirect psychological, social, and economic consequences of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries but little is known on its impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) already facing difficult living conditions and having vulnerable health systems that create anxiety in individuals for themselves and their loved ones. Using a multinational convenience sample from four LMICs (DR Congo, Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo), this study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and associated risk and protective factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1222 individuals (40.9% of women) completed a questionnaire assessing exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, anxiety, and resilience. Analyses were performed to examine the prevalence and predictors of anxiety. RESULTS: Findings showed a pooled prevalence of 24.3% (9.4%, 29.2%, 28.5%, and 16.5% respectively for Togo, Haiti, RDC, and Rwanda, x(2)=32.6, p<.0001). For the pooled data, exposure to COVID-19 (β=.06, p=.005), stigmatization related to COVID-19 (β=.03, p<.001), and resilience (β=-.06, p< .001) contributed to the prediction of Anxiety scores. Stigmatization related to COVID-19 was significant associated to anxiety symptoms in all countries (β=.02, p<.00; β=.05, p = .013; β=.03, p=.021; β=.04, p<.001, respectively for the RDC, Rwanda, Haiti, and Togo). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the needs for health education program in LMICs to decrease stigmatization and the related fears and anxieties, and increase observing of health instructions. Strength-based mental health programs based on cultural and contextual factors need to be developed to reinforce both individual and community resilience and to address the complexities of local eco-systems.","Cénat, Jude Mary; Dalexis, Rose Darly; Guerrier, Mireille; Noorishad, Pari-Gole; Derivois, Daniel; Bukaka, Jacqueline; Birangui, Jean-Pierre; Adansikou, Kouami; Ampidu, Lewis Clorméus; Kokou-Kpolou, Cyrille Kossigan; Ndengeyingoma, Assumpta; Sezibera, Vincent; Auguste, Ralph Emmanuel; Rousseau, Cécile",J Psychiatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035760/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395620309973?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395620309973,13
597817,Coronavirus Endoribonuclease Ensures Efficient Viral Replication and Prevents Protein Kinase R Activation,2021-03-10,"Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through the human nasal mucosa via the principal entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which are highly expressed in the nasal epithelium. Therefore, the biologics targeting host entry factors on human nasal mucosa will be necessary for complete control of SARS-CoV-2. Our data reveal that ACE2 was more abundant in human nasal mucosa than lung tissue. Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcriptions were significantly decreased in nasal epithelium in response to S. epidermidis and were relatively lower in human nasal mucus with large number of S. epidermidis. ACE2 transcription was also reduced in nasal epithelium in response to nasal symbiont S. aureus. This study propose that Staphylococcus species nasal commensals might potentially restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry to the nasal epithelium via down regulation of cellular receptors coupled with reduction of principal host protease.","Ji, Jeong Yeon; Jo, Ara; Won, Jina; Gil, Chan Hee; Shin, Haeun; Kim, Sujin; Jeon, Yung Jin; Kim, Hyun Jik",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604720/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221011408?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004221011408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103172,13

We aimed to provide a detailed description of a UK COVID-19 cohort, focusing on clinical decisions and patient journeys. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the management and 28-day outcomes of 316 consecutive adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large NHS Foundation Trust with a tertiary High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre in the North of England. Findings: Most patients were elderly (median age 75) with multiple comorbidities. One quarter were admitted from residential or nursing care. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, with cough, fever and/or breathlessness in 90.5% of patients. Two thirds of patients had severe disease on admission. Mortality was 81/291 (27.8%). Most deaths were anticipated; decisions to initiate respiratory support were individualised after consideration of patient wishes, premorbid frailty and comorbidities, with specialist palliative care input where appropriate. 22/291 (7.6%) patients were intubated and 11/22 (50%) survived beyond discharge. Multiple logistic regression identified age as the most significant risk factor for death (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.06 - 1.12] per year increase, p < 0.001). Interpretation: These findings provide important clinical context to outcome data. Deaths were anticipated, occurring in patients with advance decisions on ceilings of treatment. Age was the most significant risk factor for death, confirming that demographic factors in the population are a major influence on hospital mortality rates.

598433,"Cloning, expression, and antiviral activity of interferon β from the Chinese microbat, Myotis davidii",2015-12-07,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 114 million COVID-19 cases and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigated the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility. Methods Extreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus. Findings Fifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score greater than 5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. In all 5, antibodies were detected after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Interpretation Extreme older frail individuals and centenarians were able to elicit robust IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The antibodies were able to neutralize the virus. Humoral responses were still detectable after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Together, these data suggest that recovered participants who are of extreme old age would be protected if re-exposed to the same SARS-CoV-2 viral variant. Considering the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to older age groups and long-term care facilities, the humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older age groups is of public health importance and has implications to vaccine responses.

However, there is limited research examining predictors of pandemic-related changes, and the majority of existing research is cross-sectional in nature, which limits causal inference. Given functional links with disease avoidance processes, individual differences in contamination fear may be especially relevant in predicting responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, the present study prospectively examines contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms as predictors of anxiety and safety behaviors in response to COVID-19 in a student sample (N = 108). To examine specificity, anxiety and safety behaviors in response to seasonal influenza are also examined. In the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), coronavirus-related anxiety was higher than flu-related anxiety (d = 1.38). Obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms also increased from before the pandemic (d = 0.4). Although baseline contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms did not significantly predict coronavirus-related anxiety, contamination fear did significantly predict safety behavior usage in response to both COVID-19 and influenza. The specificity of the prospective association between contamination fear and the use of safety behaviors are discussed in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the broader literature on the role of safety behaviors in anxiety.","Knowles, Kelly A.; Olatunji, Bunmi O.",J Anxiety Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137593/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520301377?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887618520301377,13

A high level of similarity was detected between the leader protease of foot-and-mouth-disease virus and the protease of murine hepatitis coronavirus which cleaves the N-terminal p28 protein from the polyprotein. Statistically significant alignment of a portion of the rubella virus polyprotein with cellular papain-like proteases was obtained, leading to tentative identification of the papain-like protease as the enzyme mediating processing of the non-structural proteins of this virus. Specific grouping between the sequences of the proteases of α-viruses, and poty- and bymoviruses was revealed. It was noted that papain-like proteases of positive-stranded RNA viruses are much more variable both in their sequences and in genomic locations than chymotrypsin-related proteases found in the same virus class. A novel conserved domain of unknown function has also been identified which flanks the papain-like proteases of α-, rubi- and coronaviruses.","Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Koonin, Eugene V.; Lai, Michael M.-C.",FEBS Letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1652473/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0014579391810346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014579391810346,13

From this viewpoint, this paper proposes that effective replacement policies should be collaborative ones gathering data from time of operations, mission durations, minimal repairs and maintenance triggering approaches. We firstly discuss replacement policies with time of operations and random arrival times of mission durations, model the policies and find optimum replacement times and mission durations to minimize the expected replacement cost rates analytically. Secondly, replacement policies with minimal repairs and mission durations are discussed in a similar analytical way. Furthermore, the maintenance triggering approaches, i.e., replacement first and last, are also considered into respective replacement policies. Numerical examples are illustrated when the arrival time of the mission has a gamma distribution and the failure time of the unit has a Weibull distribution.

However, respiratory tract infections in nose, larynx and/or bronchi, either viral or bacterial or both, are by far the commonest cause of acute cough. These are especially frequent and hazardous in the elderly, and community living and institutionalisation may aggravate this problem. A variety of viruses and bacteria have been incriminated, with rhinovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Bordetella pertussis being especially important. Viral infections can readily lead to community-acquired pneumonia. Successful diagnosis should point to successful treatment, and in this respect clinical examination and patient history are paramount, supplemented by chest X-ray, viral and bacterial culture and serological testing. Depending on the results of these tests, specific antibacterial therapy may be called for, although there is dispute as to the merits of antibacterial therapy in cases of uncertain diagnosis. Prevention and prophylaxis for influenza and S. pneumoniae infections are now commendably routine in the elderly, especially those in communities. Treatment, as well as the use of antibacterials, may also be directed against the inflammatory and infective processes in the airways. Non-specific antitussive therapy is common and usually highly desirable to prevent the adverse effects of repeated coughing. There have been few advances in antitussive therapy in recent years, opioids and dextromethorphan being the most commonly used agents; they act centrally on the brainstem, but also have a large placebo effect. However they work, they are much appreciated by patients and their partners. Moreover, striking advances in our understanding of the peripheral sensory and central nervous pathways of the cough reflex in recent years should soon lead to a new and more specific choice of agents to inhibit cough.","Widdicombe, John; Kamath, Shankar",Drugs Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15012170/,13

604580,Dynamic RNA Modifications in Posttranscriptional Regulation,2014-10-02,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on nursing practice in intensive care unit (ICU) and, consequently, on workload. OBJECTIVE: To assess the nurse-patient (N:P) ratio required by COVID-19 patients and to identify the factors that influence nursing in this context. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective observational study that evaluated the N:P ratio using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS). SETTING: Three Belgian French-speaking hospitals, including five ICUs. Patients included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in the ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 95 COVID-19 patients and 1,604 non-COVID-19 patients (control group) resulting in 905 and 5,453 NAS measures, respectively. The NAS was significantly higher among the COVID-19 patients than in the control group (p=<0.0001). In the COVID-19 group, these higher scores were also observed per shift and uniformly across the three hospitals. COVID-19 patients required more time in the activities of monitoring and titration (χ2= 457.60, p=<0.0001), mobilisation (χ2= 161.21, p=<0.0001), and hygiene (χ2= 557.77, p=<0.0001). Factors influencing nursing time measured by NAS in the COVID-19 patients were age < 65 years old (p=0.23), the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (p=0.002), a high APACHE II score (p=0.006), and patient death (p=0.002). A COVID-19 diagnosis was independently associated with an increase in nursing time (OR=4.8, 95% CI:3.6-6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalised in the ICU due to COVID-19 require significantly more nursing time and need an average N:P ratio of almost 1:1.","Bruyneel, Arnaud; Gallani, Maria-Cécillia; Tack, Jérôme; d'Hondt, Alain; Canipel, Sebastien; Franck, Stéphane; Reper, Pascal; Pirson, Magali",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162312/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964339720301701?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102967; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0964339720301701,13

This study sought to quantify the change in dental visits in 2020 compared to 2019. Methods This retrospective, observational study examined the percent change in weekly visits to dental offices by state, nationally, and by county-level COVID incidence using geographic information from the mobile applications of 45 million cellular smartphones during 2019 and 2020. Results From March to August 2020, weekly visits to dental offices were 33% lower, on average, than in 2019. Weekly visits were 34% lower, on average, in counties with the highest COVID-19 rates. The greatest decline was observed during the week of April 12, 2020, when there were 66% fewer weekly visits to dental offices. The five states with the greatest declines in weekly visits between 2019 and 2020, ranging from declines of 38 to 53 percent, included California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Conclusions Weekly visits to US dental offices declined drastically during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although rates of weekly visits rebounded substantially by June 2020, rates remain about 20% lower than the prior year as of August 2020. These findings highlight the economic challenges faced by dentist due to the pandemic.","Kranz, Ashley M.; Chen, Annie; Gahlon, Grace; Stein, Bradley D.",J Am Dent Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023093/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817721001380?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2021.02.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002817721001380,13
605751,Virus interactions with bacteria: Partners in the infectious dance,2020-02-11,"Background. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with serious threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed to review the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L alternate receptor and phosphorylated subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny including ""cytokine storm"" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Diculescu, Mircea; Mihai, Catalina; Cijevschi-Prelipcean, Cristina; Burlacu, Alexandru",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20082859v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082859,13

Identifying the primary mediators that initiate the uncontrolled hypercytokinemia is essential for treatments. Mast cells (MCs) are strategically located at the mucosa and beneficially or detrimentally regulate immune inflammations. Here we showed that SARS-CoV-2-triggeed MC degranulation initiated alveolar epithelial inflammation and lung injury. SARS-CoV-2 challenge induced MC degranulation in ACE-2 humanized mice and rhesus macaques, and a rapid MC degranulation could be recapitulated with Spike-RBD binding to ACE2 in cells; MC degranulation alterred various signaling pathways in alveolar epithelial cells, particularly, led to the production of pro-inflammatory factors and consequential disruption of tight junctions. Importantly, the administration of clinical MC stabilizers for blocking degranulation dampened SARS-CoV-2-induced production of pro-inflammatory factors and prevented lung injury. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 initiating lung inflammation, and suggest an off-label use of MC stabilizer as immunomodulators for COVID-19 treatments. Graphical abstract In Brief SARS-CoV-2 triggers an immediate mast cell (MC) degranulation, which initiates the alveolar epithelial inflammation and disrupts the tight junction. MC stabilizers that block degranulation reduce virus-induced lung inflammation and injury. Highlights The binding of RBD of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2-to ACE2 receptor protein triggers an immediate MC degranulation MC degranulation induces transcriptomic changes include an upregulated inflammatory signaling and a downregulated cell-junction signaling MC degranulation leads to alveolar epithelial inflammation and disruption of tight junctions MC stabilizer that inhibits degranulation reduces SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation and injury in vivo","Wu, Meng-Li; Liu, Feng-Liang; Sun, Jing; Li, Xin; He, Xiao-Yan; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Pei, Rong-Juan; Sun, Hao; Zhou, Yan-Heng; Yan, Qi-Hong; Wu, Cai-Xia; Chen, Ling; Yu, Guo-Ying; Chang, Junbiao; Jin, Xia; Zhao, Jincun; Chen, Xin-Wen; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Wang, Jian-Hua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.449680,13

606218,Using Pan RNA-Seq Analysis to Reveal the Ubiquitous Existence of 5′ and 3′ End Small RNAs,2019-02-14,"Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered “facilitating” intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human–human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.","MacLean, Oscar A.; Lytras, Spyros; Weaver, Steven; Singer, Joshua B.; Boni, Maciej F.; Lemey, Philippe; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.; Robertson, David L.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711012/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001115,13

Three further pigs (group 2) received PRRSV alone, two (group 3) received PRV alone, and two (group 4) remained as uninfected controls. Despite the admittedly small numbers of animals, the experiment appeared to throw light on aspects of synergy. Thus, the group 1 pigs showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors. Total cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in all PRRSV-infected pigs, and PRRSV antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages. Total cell numbers in the cerebrospinal fluid of group 1 pigs were considerably greater than those demonstrated in group 3, but no PRV antigen was found. Pigs of groups 1 and 2 showed pulmonary lesions, characterized by interstitial pneumonia and PRRSV antigen immunolabelling. Non-suppurative encephalitis was found in five of the six pigs of groups 1 and 3. In particular, one group 1 animal had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies and associated immunolabelling of PRV antigen. The other three group 1 pigs had prominent malacic lesions, with macrophages. These neuropathological findings strongly suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs enhances the severity of brain lesions caused PRV.","Narita, M.; Ishii, M.",J Comp Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997504000660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15511536/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997504000660,13
606430,AVCpred: an integrated web server for prediction and design of antiviral compounds,2016-09-09,"INTRODUCTION: Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is the first line treatment for hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF) secondary to COPD exacerbation in selected patients. Limited data exist supporting the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) during this clinical setting. The aim of this study is to assess the role of FOB during NIPPV in patients with decompensated COPD acute exacerbation. METHODS: This study is a randomized prospective case control pilot study carried out on 50 patients - admitted to critical care units at Alexandria University Hospital, Egypt - suffering from hypercapnic ARF secondary to COPD exacerbation with Kelly Matthay Score from 2 to 4. All patients received NIPPV. Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups: group I (cases) (25 patients) was subjected to additional intervention of early FOB during the first 6–12 h from admission while group II (control) (25 patients) received the conventional treatment and NIPPV only. Outcome parameters measured were changes in ABG data, duration of NIPPV, rate of its success, ICU stay and mortality as well as the safety of FOB and possible complications. RESULTS: No significant difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding the baseline characteristics. No serious complications happened from FOB, and Oxygen desaturation happened in 4/25 patients (16%), Tachycardia in 2/25 patients (8%). In group I, 23 patients (92%) were successfully weaned from NIPPV versus 16 patients (64%) in group II (p = 0.037). Total duration of NIPPV was 28.52 h in group I versus 56.25 h in group II (p = 0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.84 days in group I versus 8.68 days in group II (p = 0.001). Only 1 patient died in group I versus 3 patients in group II (p = 0.609). CONCLUSION: The early application of FOB during NIPPV in patients with ARF due to COPD exacerbation was shown to be safe. Significant improvement in the outcome of patients who underwent FOB was noticed in terms of improved ABG data, shorter duration of NIPPV, higher percentage of success and shorter ICU stay while no significant difference was detected in mortality.","Rady, W.; Abouelela, A.; Abdallah, A.; Youssef, W.",Egypt J Chest Dis Tuberc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763814001484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288127/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763814001484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2014.06.015,13

Several CPPs were found in the proteome of viruses such as Tat originated from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and VP22 derived from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In the current study, a wide-range of CPPs was identified in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, a new member of coronaviruses family, using in silico analyses. These CPPs may play a main role for high penetration of virus into cells and infection of host. At first, we submitted the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to CellPPD web server that resulted in a huge number of CPPs with ten residues in length. Afterward, we submitted the predicted CPPs to C2Pred web server for evaluation of the probability of each peptide. Then, the uptake efficiency of each peptide was investigated using CPPred-RF and MLCPP web servers. Next, the physicochemical properties of the predicted CPPs including net charge, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), amphipathicity, molecular weight, and water solubility were calculated using protparam and pepcalc tools. In addition, the probability of membrane binding potential and cellular localization of each CPP were estimated by Boman index using APD3 web server, D factor, and TMHMM web server. On the other hand, the immunogenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, hemolytic potency, and half-life of CPPs were predicted using various web servers. Finally, the tertiary structure and the helical wheel projection of some CPPs were predicted by PEP-FOLD3 and Heliquest web servers, respectively. These CPPs were divided into: a) CPP containing tumor homing motif (RGD) and/or tumor penetrating motif (RXXR); b) CPP with the highest Boman index; c) CPP with high half-life (~100 hour) in mammalian cells, and d) CPP with +5.00 net charge. Based on the results, we found a large number of novel CPPs with various features. Some of these CPPs possess tumor-specific motifs which can be evaluated in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the novel and potent CPPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 may be used alone or conjugated to some sequences such as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for vaccine and drug delivery.","Kardani, Kimia; Bolhassani, Azam",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606823/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247396,13
608072,In silico designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct against human coronavirus infections,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children < 5 years globally and the parasite genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of that diarrhea. The global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial and the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. Chemotherapeutic development is dependent on the calf model of cryptosporidiosis, which is the best approximation of human disease. However, the model is not consistently applied across research studies. Data collection commonly occurs using two different methods: Complete Fecal Collection (CFC), which requires use of confinement housing, and Interval Collection (IC), which permits use of box stalls. CFC mimics human challenge model methodology but it is unknown if confinement housing impacts study end-points and if data gathered via this method is suitable for generalization to human populations. METHODS: Using a modified crossover study design we compared CFC and IC and evaluated the impact of housing on study end-points. At birth, calves were randomly assigned to confinement (n = 14) or box stall housing (n = 9), or were challenged with 5 x 10(7) C. parvum oocysts, and followed for 10 days. Study end-points included fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and plasma cortisol. FINDINGS: Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between CFC and IC samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1). Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls. CONCLUSION: Housing method confounds study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis. Due to increased stress data collected from calves in confinement housing may not accurately estimate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics targeting C. parvum.","Graef, Geneva; Hurst, Natalie J.; Kidder, Lance; Sy, Tracy L.; Goodman, Laura B.; Preston, Whitney D.; Arnold, Samuel L.

608447,Characterization of a Structural Intermediate of Flavivirus Membrane Fusion,2007-02-16,"Neonatal brain injury or neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a significant morbidity and mortality factor in preterm and full-term newborns. NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75–100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0–25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category. Our study illustrates that, in addition to standard statistics methodologies, decision-tree approaches could provide a first-step tool for the prognosis of the abnormal outcome in newborns with encephalopathy.","Neamțu, Bogdan Mihai; Visa, Gabriela; Maniu, Ionela; Ognean, Maria Livia; Pérez-Elvira, Rubén; Dragomir, Andrei; Agudo, Maria; Șofariu, Ciprian Radu; Gheonea, Mihaela; Pitic, Antoniu; Brad, Remus; Matei, Claudiu; Teodoru, Minodora; Băcilă, Ciprian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946326/,13

Furthermore, both patient cohorts would prefer RAs for future follow-up (RR = 2.29, [1.96-2.97]; P < .00001). One RCT found the cost to institutions was less in the RA group ($19.05 vs $52.76) and another found the patients would save $9.96 on transportation costs.

PCPs' perspectives on the support they needed in the early stages of a public health crisis can inform future preparedness. Aim: To understand PCPs' experiences of providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic, with focus on personal risk from COVID-19 and testing. Design and Setting: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with PCPs in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece and Sweden, between April and July 2020. Method: Interviews were analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. Results: Eighty interviews were conducted, showing that PCPs tried to make sense of their risk of both contracting and severity of COVID-19 by assessing individual risk factors and perceived effectiveness of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). They had limited access to PPE yet continued providing care as their “duty.” Some PCPs felt that they were put in high-risk situations when patients or colleagues were not flagging symptoms of COVID-19. Not having access to testing in the initial stages of the pandemic was somewhat accepted but when available, was valued. Conclusion: Access to adequate PPE and testing, as well as training for staff and education for patients about the importance of ensuring staff safety is crucial. Given PCPs' varied response in how they appraised personal risk and their tolerance for working, PCPs may benefit from the autonomy in deciding how they want to work during health emergencies.","Wanat, Marta; Hoste, Melanie; Gobat, Nina; Anastasaki, Marilena; Böhmer, Femke; Chlabicz, Slawomir; Colliers, Annelies; Farrell, Karen; Karkana, Maria-Nefeli; Kinsman, John; Lionis, Christos; Marcinowicz, Ludmila; Reinhardt, Katrin; Skoglund, Ingmarie; Sundvall, Pär-Daniel; Vellinga, Akke; Goossens, Herman; Butler, Christopher C.; van der Velden, Alike; Anthierens, Sibyl; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568383/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.726319,13

Technological solutions have been presented as tools to minimize the environmental impacts of the increased volume of disposed food packaging (namely, the development of biodegradable food packaging) as well as to minimize the occurrence of cross-contamination (namely, the incorporation of active antiviral components). KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The consumer behavior in the COVID-19 pandemic requires actions concerning adoption of bioplastics for single-use food packaging. Polylactide (PLA) stands out for high production viability, performance comparable to those of petroleum-based thermoplastics, and carbon neutral life cycle. Moreover, active components including organic compounds (resveratrol, luteolin, myricetin etc.) and metals (e.g., copper, zinc, silver) can mitigate cross-contamination. Therefore, there are opportunities to reduce food packaging-related environmental footprints while also decreasing the occurrence of surface-mediated cross-contamination.","Queiroz de Oliveira, Williara; Cordeiro de Azeredo, Henriette Monteiro; Neri-Numa, Iramaia Angélica; Pastore, Glaucia Maria",Trends Food Sci Technol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224421003496; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224421003496?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092920/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.05.027,13

While some individuals prepared with personal safety supplies such as soap and hand sanitizer, many others did not purchase such preparatory products. There are many health and safety benefits to quick engagement and emergency preparedness in a pandemic, and it is important to identify those who conduct these behaviors. The present study examined who engaged in preparatory purchasing of safety and health care products during the early stages of the spread of COVID-19 and what stimulated this action. Results of a cross-sectional study (N = 344) indicates that possessing, or uncertainty about possessing a COVID-19 risk factor (but not differences in age, gender, race, or income), increased purchasing of preparatory health and safety products. Also, in line with past research on risk, affect, and behavior, worry mediated this relationship. Further, gender moderated the relationship between worry and purchasing, such that worry increased product purchasing for men, who were initially low in worry, but not for women. This study lends additional support to worry as a mediator between risk and safety-related behavior and has implications for understanding factors related to preparatory purchasing of health care products during pandemics.","Clemens, Kelly S.; Matkovic, John; Faasse, Kate; Geers, Andrew L.",Saf Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104894; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834513/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520302915,13
610375,Phage Displayed Peptides to Avian H5N1 Virus Distinguished the Virus from Other Viruses,2011-08-22,"Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an unprecedented increase in public avoidance of hospitals predominantly driven by fear of contracting the virus. Recent publications highlight a re-emergence of rare post–myocardial infarction complications. While mechanical complications are infrequent in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention, they are associated with high mortality rates. The concurrent occurrence of mechanical complications such as left ventricular aneurysm and ventricular septal rupture is an extremely rare entity. We hereby delineate a unique case of a 53-year-old Caucasian male who underwent successful concomitant closure of a ventricular septal rupture, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Due to a delayed initial presentation owing to the patient’s fear of contracting COVID-19, the surgery was carried out 3 months after the myocardial infarction. His postoperative evaluation confirmed normal contractility of the left ventricle and complete closure of the ventricular septal rupture. Six months postoperatively, the patient continues to do well. We also present a literature review of the mechanical complications following delayed presentation of myocardial infarction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This article illustrates that clinicians should remain cognizant of these extremely rare but potentially lethal collateral effects during the ongoing global public-health challenge. Furthermore, it highlights a significant concern regarding the delay in first medical contact due to the reluctance of patients to visit the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Goraya, Muhammad Hassan Naeem; Kalsoom, Sidra; Almas, Talal; Amin, Muhammad Kashif; Hussain, Nadeem; Awan, Junaid Rasul; Ehtesham, Maryam; Niaz, Muhammad Ali; Virk, Hafeez Ul Hassan; Filby, Steven J.",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34259086/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23247096211031135,13

Prior to the 2020 pandemic the Division of Genetics and Metabolism piloted a telemedicine program focused on initial and follow‐up visits in the patients' home. The goals were to increase access to care, decrease missed work, improve scheduling, and avoid the transport and exposure of medically fragile patients. Visits were conducted by physician medical geneticists, genetic counselors, and biochemical dietitians, together and separately. This allowed the program to develop detailed standard operating procedures. At the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, this pilot‐program was deployed by the full team of 22 providers in one business day. Two physicians remained on‐site for patients requiring in‐person evaluations. This model optimized patient safety and workforce preservation while providing full access to patients during a pandemic. We provide initial data on visit numbers, types of diagnoses, and no‐show rates. Experience in this implementation before and during the pandemic has confirmed the effectiveness and value of telemedicine for a highly complex medical population. This program is a model that can and will be continued well‐beyond the current crisis.","Shur, Natasha; Atabaki, Shireen M.; Kisling, Monisha S.; Tabarani, Abir; Williams, Clarence; Fraser, Jamie L.; S.

Current treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia has been modeled from currently established guidelines such as that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 pneumonia, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by severe hypoxia and near-normal respiratory system compliance with a time-related presentation. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 receptor agonist that promotes sedative and anxiolytic effects without the risk of respiratory depression and can provide cooperative or semi-rousable sedation. Patients who are developing ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia have been treated with self-proning intervals in combination with supplementation of oxygenation via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV); however, a few patients have poor tolerance to the devices, leading to poor compliance and eventual worsening respiratory symptoms leading to intubation. In the current case report, we detail how a patient was able to successfully be self-proned with proper tolerance to HFNC and NIPPV while using dexmedetomidine, leading to discharge without the need for further oxygen supplementation at home.","Cruz Salcedo, Elis M; Rodriguez, Lyd-Marie; Patel, Jay; Seevaratnam, Andrew R",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062543/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10430,13

METHODS: This retrospective review included 367 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients underwent CT examination at baseline and/or one or more follow-up CT. Patients were categorized into two clinical types (moderate and severe groups). The severe patients were matched to the moderate patients via propensity scores (PS). The association between total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio and clinical types was analyzed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). RESULTS: Two hundred and seven moderate patients and 160 severe patients were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging variables were balanced using PS analysis to avoid patient selection bias. After PS analysis, 172 pairs of moderate patients were allocated to the groups; there was no difference in the clinical and CT characteristics between the two groups (p > 0.05). A total of 332 patients, including 396 CT scans, were assessed. The impact of total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio with time was significantly affected by clinical types (p for interaction = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively) using GAMM. Total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio of the severe group increased by 14.66 cm(3) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.92 to 25.40) and 0.45% (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.77) every day, respectively, compared to that of the moderate group. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio are independently associated with the clinical types of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: • The impact of total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio over time was significantly affected by the clinical types (p for interaction = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively) using the GAMM. • Total pulmonary infection volume and volume ratio of the severe group increased by 14.66 cm(3) (95% CI: 3.92 to 25.40) and 0.45% (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.77) every day, respectively, compared to that of the moderate group.","Zhang, Tingting; Li, Xiao; Ji, Xiang; Lu, Jianping; Fang, Xu; Bian, Yun",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07860-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855587/,13

We experienced a major Sars-CoV-2 outbreak in our cardiac surgery unit, with several patients that tested positive early after surgery. Here we describe the characteristics, the post-operative course and laboratory findings of these patients, along with the fate of the health-care workers. We also discuss how we reorganize and reallocate hospital resources in order to resume the surgical activity without further positive patients. Methods After diagnosis of the first symptomatic patient, surgery was suspended. Nasopharyngeal swabs were carried out in all patients and health care workers. Sars-CoV-2 positive patients were isolated and monitored throughout the in-hospital stay and followed-up after discharged until death or clinical recovery. Results Twenty patients were found positive to Sars-CoV-2 sometimes after cardiac surgery (mean age 69±10.4 y/o; median EuroSCORE-II 3(IQR 5.1)); median time from surgery to diagnosis was 15 days (IQR 11). Among them eighteen had received cardiac surgery and two of them transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Overall mortality was 15%. Specific COVID-19 related symptoms were identified in 7 patients (35%). Among the twelve health-care workers infected, one developed a bilateral mild-grade interstitial pneumonia. Conclusion COVID-19 infection after cardiac surgery, regardless the time of the onset, is a serious condition. The systemic inflammatory state that follows the extracorporeal circulation may mask the typical COVID-19 laboratory findings, making the diagnosis more problematic. A capillary reorganization of the hospital resources is necessary in order to safely resume the cardiac surgical activity.","Fattouch, Khalil; Corrao, Salvatore; Augugliaro, Ettore; Minacapelli, Alberto; Nogara, Angela; Zambelli, Giulia; Argano, Christiano; Moscarelli, Marco",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33220960/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522320328725?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.09.138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522320328725,13

There have long been anecdotal clinical reports of interactions between penicillins and antimalarial agents, but the nature and mechanisms of these interactions remain to be investigated. In this study, we employed antimicrobial interaction testing methods to study the effect of two antimalarials on the antibacterial activity of ampicillin in vitro. Paper strip diffusion, a modified disc diffusion and checkerboard methods were used to determine the nature of interactions between ampicillin and quinoline antimalarials, chloroquine and quinine, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The impact of antimalarials and ampicillin-antimalarial drug combinations on cell integrity of test bacteria were determined by measuring potassium release. The tested antimalarials did not show substantial antibacterial activity but quinine was bactericidal at high concentrations. Chloroquine and quinine increased ampicillin activity, with increasing concentrations extending the antibacterial’s inhibition zones by 2.7-4.4 mm and from 1.1 to over 60 mm, respectively. Observed interactions were largely additive with Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Indices of >0.5-1 for all ampicillin-antimalarial combinations.

This paper presents the practice in information technology support for a Fangcang shelter hospital in Wuhan, China. The experiences include the deployment strategy of IT infrastructure, the redesign of function modules in the hospital information system (HIS), equipment maintenance and medical staff training. The deployment strategy and HIS modules have ensured smoothness and efficiency of clinical work.

Deployment of network and modification of HIS was finished in the 48 hours before patient admittance. A repair hotline and remote support for equipment and software were available whenever medical workers met with any questions. No engineer ever entered the contaminated areas and no one was infected by the coronavirus during the hospital operation. Up to now, Fangcang shelter hospital is adopted by many regions around the world facing the collapse of their medical systems.

Medical procedures used to treat severe cases such as tracheal intubation, extubation, and tracheal suctioning produce infectious aerosol particles. This presents significant risk for viral exposure of nearby healthcare workers during and following tracheal operations. This study looks at an enclosure to limit exposure for medical personnel to these particles. Methods: A low-cost plastic enclosure was designed to reduce aerosol spread and viral transmission during intubation and extubation procedures. The enclosure consists of clear polycarbonate for maximum visibility. Large side cutouts provide health care providers with ease of access to the patient. Aerosol particle instruments measured the aerosol containment efficacy after applying various types of plastic coverings to seal the side openings. The use of negative pressure was also tested. Results: The enclosure with 2 layers of plastic coverings sealing the side openings reduced total escaped particle number concentrations (diameter > 10 nm) by over 93% at 3 inches away from all openings. Concentration decay experiments indicated that the enclosure without active suction should be left on the patient for 15-20 minutes following a tracheal manipulation to allow sufficient time for >90% of aerosol particles to settle upon interior surfaces. This decreases to 5 minutes when 30 LPM suction is applied. Conclusions: This enclosure is an inexpensive, easily implemented additional layer of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission between patients and healthcare workers.","Monroe, L.

Cardioviruses may cause severe infections of the myocardium in animals, and several studies have associated saffold virus with human disease. As a result, saffold virus has been isolated from different anatomical compartments, including the myocardium, but, until now, it has not been possible to demonstrate the accompanying histopathological signs of inflammation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine if saffold virus is capable of causing invasive infection in the human myocardium. STUDY DESIGN: Using real-time PCR, we retrospectively examined formalin-fixed paraffin embedded cardiac tissue specimens from 150 deceased individuals diagnosed with myocarditis at autopsy. The results were compared with histological findings.

615437,Lipid–protein interactions in virus assembly and budding from the host cell plasma membrane,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Primary aim of the current randomized controlled trial was to test the effectiveness of the parenting intervention ‘Video-feedback to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline’ (VIPP-SD) in a sample of parents of preschool-aged twins, as well as differential susceptibility to intervention efforts, that is, whether more temperamentally reactive parents would profit more from the VIPP-SD than parents with lower reactivity. METHODS: The sample consisted of 202 families with same-sex twins [N = 404 children, mean age 45 months (SD = 6.81)]. Randomization was done at the family level in a 2:3 ratio, with 83 families (41%) randomized to the VIPP-SD group, and 119 families (59%) to the control group. After two pre-tests in year 1 and year 2 of the study, the VIPP-SD was implemented in the third year, with a post-test assessment 1 month after the five intervention sessions. Parental sensitivity was observed during structured play in which parent and child copied a drawing together in a computerized Etch-A-Sketch paradigm. Parental limit-setting was observed in a ‘don’t touch’ task in which the parent required from the child to abstain from playing with attractive toys. Parents interacted with each of their twins in separate sessions. RESULTS: The VIPP-SD intervention had a positive impact on the level of parents’ positive limit-setting in interaction with their preschool twins, and this positive effect was most pronounced when the parents completed at least five intervention sessions. However, the intervention did not enhance parental sensitivity during structured play. Parents with higher reactivity were not more open to the impact of the intervention, thus for this temperamental marker differential susceptibility in adults was not supported. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is unique in targeting families with twin preschoolers, providing proof of principle that coaching parents with video-feedback promotes parental sensitive limit-setting to both children. It remains to be seen whether this finding can be replicated in families with non-twin siblings, or other parental susceptibility markers.

METHODS: The authors evaluated children aged 0–16 y with clinical symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections who were administered rapid strep A test and/or throat culture test and/or respiratory viral panel test, from February 2012 through January 2013 at pediatric department of Acıbadem Maslak Hospital, Turkey. RESULTS: A total of 1654 patients were evaluated; 45.9 % were girls, 54.1 % were boys. Absence of cough and presence of headache were higher in the patients >6 y of age (p 0.0001, p 0.002 respectively). Positive respiratory viral panel test was higher in the patients <2 y of age (p 0.002). Both positive rapid strep A test and positive throat culture test were higher in the patients >6 y of age (p 0.0001). Positivity of rapid strep A or throat culture test were not observed in children <2 y of age. CONCLUSIONS: A clinician should mostly consider viral infections in the etiology of acute respiratory infections in children under 2 y of age and there is no need to rush for the use antibiotherapy. Bacterial etiology should be frequently considered after 6 y of age and rapid use of antibiotheraphy is essential to avoid the complications.","Dut, Raziye; Kocagöz, Sesin",Indian J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-015-1943-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687497/,13
616088,Mitochondrial morphodynamics alteration induced by influenza virus infection as a new antiviral strategy,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has become a prevalent mode of breast cancer screening in recent years. Although older women are commonly screened for breast cancer, little is known about screening outcomes using DBT among older women. OBJECTIVE: To assess proximal screening outcomes with DBT compared to traditional two-dimensional(2-D) mammography among women 67–74 and women 75 and older. DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 67 years and older with no history of prior cancer who received a screening mammogram in 2015. MAIN MEASURES: Use of subsequent imaging (ultrasound and diagnostic mammography) as an indication of recall, breast cancer detection, and characteristics of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis. Analyses used weighted logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. KEY RESULTS: Our study included 26,406 women aged 67–74 and 17,001 women 75 and older who were screened for breast cancer. Among women 75 and older, the rate of subsequent imaging among women screened with DBT did not differ significantly from 2-D mammography (91.8 versus 97.0 per 1,000 screening mammograms, p=0.37). In this age group, DBT was associated with 2.1 additional cancers detected per 1,000 screening mammograms compared to 2D (11.5 versus 9.4, p=0.003), though these additional cancers were almost exclusively in situ and stage I invasive cancers. For women 67–74 years old, DBT was associated with a higher rate of subsequent imaging than 2-D mammography (113.9 versus 100.3, p=0.004) and a higher rate of stage I invasive cancer detection (4.7 versus 3.7, p=0.002), but not other stages. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer screening with DBT was not associated with lower rates of subsequent imaging among older women. Most additional cancers detected with DBT were early stage. Whether detecting these additional early-stage cancers among older women improves health outcomes remains uncertain.

The accumulation of data through a prospective clinical registry enables public health authorities to make informed decisions based on real evidence obtained from surveillance of COVID-19. This registry is also fundamental to providing robust infrastructure for future research surveys. The purpose of this study was to design a registry and its minimum data set (MDS), as a valid and reliable data source for reporting and benchmarking COVID-19. Methods: This cross sectional and descriptive study provides a template for the required MDS to be included in COVID-19 registry. This was done by an extensive literature review and 2 round Delphi survey to validate the content, which resulted in a web-based registry created by Visual Studio 2019 and a database designed by Structured Query Language (SQL). Results: The MDS of COVID-19 registry was categorized into the administrative part with 3 sections, including 30 data elements, and the clinical part with 4 sections, including 26 data elements. Furthermore, a web-based registry with modular and layered architecture was designed based on final data classes and elements. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, COVID-19 registry is the first designed instrument from information management perspectives in Iran and can become a homogenous and reliable infrastructure for collecting data on COVID-19.

We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinical computational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtained with an ensemble of disease active subnetworks. DrugMerge uses differential transcriptomic data on drugs and diseases in the context of a large gene co-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases demonstrate that our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specified disease, in all four cases.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for all investigations in the English language, reporting data on the threshold cycle (C(t)) from real-time RT-PCR assays for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) SARS-CoV-2 genes in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Results: Overall, 703 COVID-19 patients (553 symptomatic and 150 asymptomatic) were analyzed. Five investigations reported the mean age of patients, evidencing that asymptomatic patients were younger than symptomatic patients (34.0 vs. 40.3 years, respectively). Pooled data regarding the levels of expression of the RdRp gene revealed no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Similarly, no differences were observed comparing the mean C(t) values for the E and N genes. Based on real-time RT-PCR data, no differences exist in the viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects considering C(t) values for RdRp, E and N genes’ expression. Asymptomatic subjects may represent a reservoir of the infection and significantly contribute to the maintenance of the pandemic.","Zuin, Marco; Gentili, Valentina; Cervellati, Carlo; Rizzo, Roberta; Zuliani, Giovanni",Infect Dis Rep,https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13030061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287354/,13

We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","Tindale, Lauren; Coombe, Michelle; Stockdale, Jessica E; Garlock, Emma; Lau, Wing Yin Venus; Saraswat, Manu; Lee, Yen-Hsiang Brian; Zhang, Louxin; Chen, Dongxuan; Wallinga, Jacco; Colijn, Caroline",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029983,13

How SARS-CoV-2 regulates cellular responses to escape clearance by host cells is unknown. Autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation pathway for the clearance of various cargoes, including viruses. Here, we systematically screened 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and identified that ORF3a strongly inhibited autophagic flux by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. ORF3a colocalized with lysosomes and interacted with VPS39, a component of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex. The ORF3a–VPS39 interaction prohibited the binding of HOPS with RAB7, which prevented the assembly of fusion machinery, leading to the accumulation of unfused autophagosomes. These results indicated the potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 escapes degradation; that is, the virus interferes with autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Furthermore, our findings will facilitate strategies targeting autophagy for conferring potential protection against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Yabin; Sun, Hao; Pei, Rongjuan; Mao, Binli; Zhao, Zhenyu; Li, Huihui; Lin, Yong; Lu, Kefeng",Cell Discov,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-021-00268-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947832/,13

However, to develop safe and effective extracellular vesicles-based therapies, it is crucial to gain fundamental knowledge on key cell biology mechanisms governing the extracellular vesicles-mediated cell-cell exchange of macromolecules. In this review, we present five aspects we believe are worth taking into account before considering extracellular vesicles as candidate vectors of pharmaceutical ingredients in cell-free therapies. ABSTRACT: The use of extracellular vesicles as cell-free therapy is a promising approach currently investigated in several disease models. The intrinsic capacity of extracellular vesicles to encapsulate macromolecules within their lipid bilayer membrane-bound lumen is a characteristic exploited in drug delivery to transport active pharmaceutical ingredients. Besides their role as biological nanocarriers, extracellular vesicles have a specific tropism towards target cells, which is a key aspect in precision medicine. However, the little knowledge of the mechanisms governing the release of a cargo macromolecule in recipient cells and the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade scale-up manufacturing of extracellular vesicles are currently slowing their application as drug delivery nanocarriers. In this review, we summarize, from a cell biologist’s perspective, the main evidence supporting the role of extracellular vesicles as promising carriers in drug delivery, and we report five key considerations that merit further investigation before translating Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) to clinical applications.","Pedrioli, Giona; Piovesana, Ester; Vacchi, Elena; Balbi, Carolina",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10050376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925620/,13

Under these circumstances, it is important to explore various possibilities for the treatment of COVID-19 including herbal medicines. Among various herbal medicines, Soshihotang (SSHT,Xiao Chai Hu Tang in Chinese) has been prescribed to treat various viral diseases and is used in combination with other herbal medicines depending on the patient’s symptoms. METHODS: For conducting the present review, we searched electronic databases focusing on the antiviral effect of SSHT in experimental and clinical study until April 2020. The search keywords included SSHT, constituents of SSHT, and antiviral effect. We also searched for materials related to topic directly from websites and published books. Based on these search results, we summarized the results of the included materials in the form of a narrative review. RESULTS: In a number of recent clinical studies, treatment with SSHT improved the infection status of the respiratory and hepatobiliary systems, and experimental studies demonstrated the antiviral effect of SSHT and its components. Furthermore, SSHT are being used in China—where COVID-19 outbreak first took place—and offer a new option to treat COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Based on the present evidences, it is believed that SSHT is likely to be a new therapeutic option for COVID-19. Conducting further studies might provide improved understanding regarding the use of SSHT in treating COVID-19.","Kwon, Seungwon; Lee, Wonhaeng; Jin, Chul; Jang, Insoo; Jung, Woo-Sang; Moon, Sang-Kwan; Cho, Ki-Ho",Integr Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742920/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100480; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422020301128?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422020301128,13

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations with very strong statistical significances (p value<E– 44). In addition, we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t, 5’UTR_c241t, and NSP3_c3037t into the viral genome, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication.

620426,Characterization of avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic ducks in Vietnam in 2009 and 2010,2011-11-09,"Activated T helper 17 (Th-17) cytokines play a role in the pathophysiology of autoimmune and infectious diseases. While these diseases affect many women of childbearing age, little is known about the effect of these cytokines on placental transporters. As several pro-inflammatory cytokines impact the expression of ABC and SLC placental transporters, we hypothesized that these transporters may be similarly altered by elevated levels of circulating Th-17 cytokines. Cultured term human villous explants were treated with IL-17A, IL-22, or IL-23, alone or in combination. Samples were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The mRNA expression of OATP2B1 was significantly downregulated in explants by all individual cytokines and combination treatments, while decreased protein expression was seen with IL-23 and combination (p < 0.01). Combination treatment decreased the mRNA expression of BCRP and OAT4 but increased that of OCT3 (p < 0.01). Decreased accumulation of the OATP substrate, cascade blue, was seen in IL-23-treated choriocarcinoma JAr cells (p < 0.01). Elevated Th-17 cytokines, which are seen in infectious and autoimmune diseases, affect the expression and activity of OATP2B1, as well as mRNA expression of placental BCRP, OAT4, and OCT3. This dysregulation could impact the fetal exposure to endogenous and exogenous substrates.","Mirdamadi, Kamelia; Kwok, Jacinda; Nevo, Ori; Berger, Howard; Piquette-Miller, Micheline",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203644/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13060881,13
620686,Structural Insights into 5' Flap DNA Unwinding and Incision by the Human FAN1 Dimer,2014-12-11,"BACKGROUND: Against a backdrop of declining tobacco use, e-cigarette markets are growing. The UK now has a higher percentage of e-cigarette users than any other European country. These developments have prompted fierce discussions in scientific, advocacy and policy communities about how best to respond. This article is one of the first to examine the role of evidence in these debates. METHODS: We analysed 121 submissions to two Scottish policy consultations on e-cigarettes (in 2014 and 2015) and undertook interviews with 26 key informants in 2015–2016, following up with a sub-set in 2019–2020. All data were thematically coded, and our analysis was informed by insights from policy studies and the sociology of science. RESULTS: First, we affirm previous research in suggesting that e-cigarettes appeared to have triggered a breakdown of old public health alliances. Second, we demonstrate that, amid concerns about research quality and quantity, actors are guided by normative outlooks (and/or economic interests) in their assessments of evidence. Third, we show that, despite describing e-cigarette debates as contentious and polarised, actors engaging in Scottish policy debates exhibit a spectrum of views, with most interviewees occupying an uncertain ‘middle ground’ that is responsive to new evidence. Fourth, we suggest that the perceived divisiveness of e-cigarette debates is attributed to recurrent media simplifications and tensions arising from the behaviours of some actors with settled positions working to promote particular policy responses (including by strategically enrolling supportive evidence). Fifth, we argue that the actions of these actors are potentially explained by the prospect that e-cigarettes could usher in a new tobacco ‘policy paradigm’. Finally, we show how scientific authority is employed as a tool within these debates. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette debates are likely to reconcile only if a clear majority of participants in the uncertain ‘middle ground’ settle on a more fixed position. Our results suggest that many participants in Scottish e-cigarette debates occupy this ‘middle ground’ and express concerns that can be empirically assessed, implying evidence has the potential to play a more important role in settling e-cigarette debates than previous research suggests.

620994,A review of studies on animal reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus,2007-04-23,"BACKGROUND: During previous pandemics people who use drugs (PWUD) were categorized among the most vulnerable. In the current study, firstly, we wanted to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among PWUD. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the prevalence of these disorders with that of members from the general population who did not use drugs. METHODS: We used a matched cohort design based on two separate repeated cross-sectional online surveys (April and November 2020) among PWUD and the general population. Results of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used as outcome variables. We calculated absolute and relative risks for matched pairs for both affective disorders, and logistic regression to compare affective disorders over both waves for PWUD. RESULTS: In April, the prevalence of affective disorders was similar for PWUD and the general population. In November, the risks for anxiety disorders increased with 64% for PWUD compared to non-PWUD (RR = 1.64, 95%CI 1.42–1.88), whereas the risks for depressive disorders more than doubled (RR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.97–2.67). Having a job and being male were protective factors for PWUD for both anxiety and depressive disorders. LIMITATIONS: As this study used self-reported data, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 give an indication of the presence of anxiety and depression which might differ from a clinician's judgement. CONCLUSIONS: PWUD might be disproportionally affected by COVID-19. Health care providers should be attentive to substance use as an indicator for increased risk of mental health problems.","Van Baelen, Luk; Gremeaux, Lies; Antoine, Jérôme; Bruggeman, Helena; Gisle, Lydia; Plettinckx, Els; De Ridder, Karin",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721008740; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721008740,13

Many therapeutic strategies have been used for these microorganisms, and in this way the recognizing of potential targets of viruses is of particular importance for success. For decades, antibodies and antibody fragments have occupied a significant body of the treatment approaches against infectious diseases. Because of their high affinity, they can be designed and engineered against a variety of purposes, mainly since antibody fragments such as scFv, nanobody, diabody, and bispecific antibody have emerged owing to their small size and interesting properties.

621183,Complete Genome Analysis of Canine Respiratory Coronavirus,2013-01-31,"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to evaluate eyecare needs along with ocular findings in patients treated in intensive care units because of Covid-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients, 58 men and 35 women, who were under follow-up and treatment in intensive care because of COVID-19 infection from 1 January 2021 to 15 February 2021 were included in the study. Detailed eye examinations of the patients were performed with a portable handheld biomicroscope, direct and indirect ophthalmoscope. Cases requiring treatment for eye diseases were identified and treated. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 68.32 ± 9.97 years; 35 patients were followed up and treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and 58 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation support. Mild, moderate, and severe chemosis was observed in 19 patients (20.4%), 10 patients (10.8%) and 4 patients (4.3%), respectively. Conjunctivitis (8.6%) was observed in eight patients. Corneal abrasion was present in seven patients (7.5%). Keratitis secondary to exposure keratopathy was observed in one patient. Eye care and medical treatment were initiated for these patients. We noted eight patients (8.6%) with retinal haemorrhage; however, to the best of our knowledge, these patients may show acute retinal involvement secondary to systemic diseases or have previous retinal findings other than Covid-19 infection or treatments. CONCLUSION: Findings of ocular involvement because of COVID-19 infection were detected in the present study. Retinal haemorrhages were detected in addition to the common findings in viral infections. Especially in patients supported with mechanical ventilation, the detection and treatment of conditions that require eye care for exposure keratopathy are very important for recovering from the disease and the quality of vision.","Ekici Gok, Zarife; Gok, Abdullah; Acun Delen, Leman; Kasapoglu, Umut S; Gurbuz, Esra; Mutlu, Kayhan",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553470/,13

622608,Computational Molecular Docking and X-ray Crystallographic Studies of Catechins in New Drug Design Strategies,2018-08-13,"BACKGROUND: On the 30th September 2009, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine was made available to adults and children aged 10 years and over, in Australia. Acceptance of a novel vaccine is influenced by perceptions of risk including risk of infection, risk of death or severe illness and risk of serious vaccine side-effects. We surveyed a sample of residents from Sydney, Australia to ascertain their risk perception, attitudes towards the pandemic and willingness to accept the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine. METHODS: We sampled residents using a cross-sectional intercept design during the WHO Phase 6. Members of the public were approached in shopping and pedestrian malls to undertake the survey during September and October 2009. The survey measured perceived risk, seriousness of disease, recent behavioural changes, likely acceptance of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine and issues relating to uptake and perceived safety. RESULTS: Of the 627 respondents, the majority felt that they had a ""very low to low"" (332/627, 52.9%) risk of acquiring H1N1. 24.5% (154/627) of respondents believed that the disease would ""very seriously or extremely"" affect their health. Nearly half (305/627, 48.6%) reported that in response to the ""swine flu"" outbreak they had undertaken one or more of the investigated behavioural changes. Overall, the self-reported likelihood of accepting vaccination against novel H1N1 was 54.7% (343/627). CONCLUSIONS: While, most participants did not believe they were at high risk of acquiring pandemic H1N1 2009, over half of the sample indicated that they would accept the vaccine. Participants who were vaccinated against the seasonal influenza were more likely to receive the H1N1 vaccine. Concerns about safety, the possibility of side effects and the vaccine development process need to be addressed.","Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Ward, Kirsten F; Lowbridge, Chris P; Van, Debbie; MacIntyre, C Raina",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20403201/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-99,13

Here, we demonstrated that DP2392-E10 exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting replication of a broad range of influenza A subtypes. In regard to the molecular mechanism, we revealed that DP2392-E10 inhibits nuclear export of both viral NP and nuclear export protein (NEP). More specifically, in vitro pull-down assays revealed that DP2392-E10 directly binds cellular CRM1, which mediates nuclear export of NP and NEP. In silico docking suggested that DP2392-E10 binds at a region close to the HEAT9 and HEAT10 domains of CRM1. Together, these results indicate that the CRM1-mediated nuclear export function of influenza virus represents a new potential target for antiviral drug development, and also provide a core structure for a novel class of inhibitors that target this function.","Chutiwitoonchai, Nopporn; Mano, Takafumi; Kakisaka, Michinori; Sato, Hirotaka; Kondoh, Yasumitsu; Osada, Hiroyuki; Kotani, Osamu; Yokoyama, Masaru; Sato, Hironori; Aida, Yoko",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217301022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399435/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217301022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.04.001,13

For many countries, dedicated vaccination centres are a key part of that effort. However, with no directly comparable historical experience there is little information to guide the operational configuration and management of these sites. In addressing this gap in knowledge, the objective of this study is to demonstrate the value of computer modelling. This is achieved through providing an account of its use in supporting management considerations and decisions at two major vaccination centres, at an early stage of the UK's mass vaccination effort. We report on how modelling insight has influenced the initial setup of one site, including quantification of daily booking numbers. For the same site, we reveal how analysis has informed a significant operational shift in combining two key activities on the vaccination pathway into one. Finally, we describe how, at a second site, modelling has been used to examine pathway stability, in terms of resilience to unforeseen 'shocks' such as delayed arrivals and staff unavailability.

The disease burden has been heterogeneous across regions of the world, with Americas leading in cumulative cases and deaths, followed by Europe, Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa and Western Pacific. Initial responses to COVID-19 also varied between governments, ranging from proactive containment to delayed intervention. Understanding these variabilities allow high burden countries to learn from low burden countries on ways to create more sustainable response plans in the future. METHODS: This study used a mixed-methods approach to perform cross-country comparisons of pandemic responses in the United States (US), Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Italy and China. These countries were selected based on their income level, relative COVID-19 burden and geographic location. To rationalize the epidemiological variability, a list of 14 indicators was established to assess the countries’ preparedness, actual response, and socioeconomic and demographic profile in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: As of 1 April 2021, the US had the highest cases per million out of the nine countries, followed by Brazil, Italy, Germany, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and China. Meanwhile, Italy ranked first out of the nine countries’ total deaths per million, followed by the US, Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, China and Thailand. The epidemiological differences between these countries could be explained by nine indicators, and they were 1) leadership, governance and coordination of response, 2) communication, 3) community engagement, 4) multisectoral actions, 5) public health capacity, 6) universal health coverage, 7) medical services and hospital capacity, 8) demography and 9) burden of non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic manifests varied outcomes due to differences in countries’ vulnerability, preparedness and response. Our study rationalizes why South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, Australia and China performed better than the US, Italy and Brazil. By identifying the strengths of low burden countries and weaknesses of hotspot countries, we elucidate factors constituting an effective pandemic response that can be adopted by leaders in preparation for re-emerging public health threats.","Chen, Yi-Ying; Assefa, Yibeltal",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10885-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33933062/,13

The identification of prognostic factors can help to improve the risk stratification of patients by promptly defining for each the most effective therapy to resolve the disease. The etiological agent causing COVID-19 is a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that enters cells via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a reduction in ACE2 levels, leading to an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and consequently, in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. ERAP1 and ERAP2 are two RAS regulators and key components of MHC class I antigen processing. Their polymorphisms have been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, hypertension, and cancer. Based on their involvement in the RAS, we believe that the dysfunctional status of ERAP1 and ERAP2 enzymes may exacerbate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, aggravating the symptomatology and clinical outcome of the disease.

METHODS: We reviewed entry screening policies adopted by different nations and ascertained dates of official report of the first laboratory-confirmed imported H1N1 case and the first laboratory-confirmed untraceable or 'local' H1N1 case. RESULTS: Implementation of entry screening policies was associated with on average additional 7-12 day delays in local transmission compared to nations that did not implement entry screening, with lower bounds of 95% confidence intervals consistent with no additional delays and upper bounds extending to 20-30 day additional delays.

624009,Evolution and Genetic Diversity of SARSCoV-2 in Africa Using Whole Genome Sequences,2020-07-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Rearing of replacement female calves on a dairy farm is of critical importance to maintain herd sizes, improve the genetic quality of the herd, and remain economically sustainable. A 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. The management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers’ cost to benchmark. The objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. We calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. We found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. The total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per Kg of gain decreased. The ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. In conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning. ABSTRACT: Dairy calves are raised in various housing and feeding environments on dairy farms around North America. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0–2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively.

The virus is still circulating in the world. The abnormal thoracic computerized tomographic (CT) scan findings vary widely among the studies of 2009 H1N1 influenza. We evaluated the thoracic CT findings in patients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection to describe findings compared to previously reported findings, and to suggest patterns that may be suggestive for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in an appropriate clinical setting. METHODS: Retrospectively, the archive of all patients with a diagnosis of 2009 H1N1 influenza A were reviewed, in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, central Iran, between September 23(rd) 2009 to February 20(th) 2010. Out of 216 patients with confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, 26 cases with abnormal CT were enrolled in the study. Radiologic findings were characterized by the type and pattern of opacities and zonal distribution. RESULTS: Patchy infiltration (34.6%), lobar consolidation (30.8%), and interstitial infiltration (26.9%) with airbronchogram (38.5%) were the predominant findings in our patients. Bilateral distribution was seen in 80.8% of the patients. Only one patient (3.8%) showed ground-glass opacity, predominant radiographic finding in the previous reports and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). CONCLUSIONS: The most common thoracic CT findings in pandemic H1N1 were patchy infiltration, lobar consolidation, and interstitial infiltration with airbronchogram and bilateral distribution. While these findings can be associated with other infections; they may be suggestive to 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in the appropriate clinical setting. Various radiographic patterns can be seen in thoracic CT scans of the influenza patients. Imaging findings are nonspecific.","Rostami, Mojtaba; Javadi, Abbas-Ali; Khorvash, Farzin; Mostafavizadeh, Kamyar; Adibi, Atoosa; Babak, Anahita; Ataei, Behrooz; Meidani, Mohsen; Naeini, Alireza Emami; Salehi, Hasan; Avijgan, Majid; Yazdani, Mohammad Reza; Rezaei, Farshid",J Res Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22091280/,13
624760,OASes and STING: Adaptive Evolution in Concert,2015-03-09,"Tylvalosin, a new broad-spectrum, third-generation macrolides, may exert a variety of pharmacological activities. Here, we report on its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as piglet challenged with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Tylvalosin treatment markedly decreased IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE2, TNF-α and NO levels in vitro and in vivo. LPS and PRRSV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the lipid peroxidation in mice lung tissues reduced after tylvalosin treatments. In mouse acute lung injury model induced by LPS, tylvalosin administration significantly attenuated tissues injury, and reduced the inflammatory cells recruitment and activation. The evaluated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and the increased expressions of cPLA2-IVA, p-cPLA2-IVA and sPLA2-IVE were lowered by tylvalosin. Consistent with the mouse results, tylvalosin pretreatment attenuated piglet lung scores with improved growth performance and normal rectal temperature in piglet model induced by PRRSV. Furthermore, tylvalosin attenuated the IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, and blocked the NF-κB p65 translocation. These results indicate that in addition to its direct antimicrobial effect, tylvalosin exhibits anti-inflammatory property and attenuates acute lung injury through suppression of NF-κB activation.","Zhao, Zhanzhong; Tang, Xiangfang; Zhao, Xinghui; Zhang, Minhong; Zhang, Weijian; Hou, Shaohua; Yuan, Weifeng; Zhang, Hongfu; Shi, Lijun; Jia, Hong; Liang, Lin; Lai, Zhi; Gao, Junfeng; Zhang, Keyu; Fu, Ling; Chen, Wei",Biochem Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295214002391; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2014.04.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295214002391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792436/,13

The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to significantly reduce health risks, improve economic and social outcomes, with potential benefits to mental health. PURPOSE: To examine short-term changes in mental distress following the receipt of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Participants included 8,003 adults from the address-based sampled, nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS), surveyed at regular intervals between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2021 who completed at least two waves of the survey. Respondents answered questions about COVID-19 vaccine status and self-reported mental distress as measured with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Fixed-effects regression models were used to identify the change in PHQ-4 scores and categorical indicators of mental distress resulting from the application of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: People who were vaccinated between December 2020 and March 2021 reported decreased mental distress levels in the surveys conducted after receiving the first dose. The fixed-effects estimates show an average effect of receiving the vaccine equivalent to 4% of the standard deviation of PHQ-4 scores (p-value<0.01), a reduction in 1 percentage point (4% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being at least mildly depressed, and of 0.7 percentage points (15% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being severely depressed (p-value = 0.06).

Subjects can contribute to a global public good which benefits all subjects and two local public goods which benefit only subjects of either their own group or the group of the other endowment type. Endowment inequality per-se decreases contributions of subjects with a high endowment to the global public good, but increases cooperation of subjects with a low endowment on their local public good, thereby aggravating income disparities. Exogenously induced role reversal for several periods affects cooperation behavior of subjects with a high endowment positively and induces them to contribute more to the global good. Cooperation in unequal environments thus appears to be more stable when all parties have experienced the public goods game from the disadvantageous perspective.

625531,Chikungunya triggers an autophagic process which promotes viral replication,2011-09-08,"Abstract BACKGROUND: Recent experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza have led to new Respiratory Hygiene and Cough Etiquette (RHCE) recommendations that include use of surgical masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) who come within 3 feet of all patients with symptoms of respiratory infection. In September 2003, prior to these recommendations, eight HCWs at a Pennsylvania tertiary-care hospital developed respiratory symptoms after exposure to an infant with pertussis. We observed that HCWs did not routinely wear masks while caring for patients with cough illness. Anticipating the new recommendations and in an effort to understand potential barriers for implementation, we evaluated perceptions of mask use among HCWs in this hospital. METHODS: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with two groups of nurses and one group of physicians (n1=4, n2=6, n3=9). Based on the discussions, we developed a structured, self-administered questionnaire for distribution to all HCWs present during two consecutive hospital shifts. RESULTS: Overall, 96 of 120 (80%) HCWs responded. Forty-nine (51%) respondents viewed coughing patients as potentially contagious to other patients and HCWs, and 67 (70%) believed that they and their patients would be protected against droplet infections by masks. Forty-three (45%) HCWs perceived obstacles to using mask. Masks were considered a barrier to a trusting provider-patient relationship: 20 HCWs felt that a provider in a mask increased worries among patients, and 26 thought that the mask was a barrier to communicating with patients. Thirty respondents indicated that wearing a mask was uncomfortable and/or a burden. HCWs were less likely to perceive obstacles if they recognized a risk for patient-to-patient transmission (27/35 versus 31/61; P=0.0095). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest several potential barriers among HCWs to mask use, despite a recent pertussis outbreak in the hospital. HCWs may benefit from education regarding the risk of nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens such as SARS, influenza, and pertussis. Patients should be educated on the benefits of HCW mask use and its association with quality medical care.","Calugar∗, A.; Oakes, L.; Ahmed, A.; Jahre, J. J.; Tiwari, T.; McDonald, L.

This study identifies factors differentiating hospitalized patients who recovered promptly vs. survived a prolonged course of illness due to COVID-19. METHODS This was a retrospective study from March-August 2020 of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 which were grouped based on time to recovery: short (≤ 3 days), intermediate (4-10 days), and prolonged (>10 days). Recovery was defined as resolution of fever, tachypnea, hypotension, extubation and return of mental status at baseline. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with prompt recovery. RESULTS Among 508 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 401 (79%) survived. Of those, prompt recovery (within 3 days) was achieved in 43% (174/401) whereas 23% (92/401) recovered after a prolonged period of > 10 days. Overall, median age was 64 y with 73% admitted from home and 25% from a skilled nursing facility. Predictors for prompt recovery upon admission included female sex (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7; p = 0.01), no fever (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; p = 0.03), longer time from symptom onset to hospitalization (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1; p = 0.001), no supplemental oxygen (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0; p = 0.004), no direct ICU admission (OR, 41.7; 95% CI, 2.4-740.4; p = 0.01) and absence of bacterial co-infections (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.0, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS Our study provides relevant data that could help clinicians triage competing resources in health systems that are challenged by the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases by identifying clinical features of COVID-19 patients who may require less intensive management including avoidance of unnecessary antibacterial therapy.","Ny, Pamela; Kelsom, Corey; Chron, Amanda; Lou, Mimi; Nieberg, Paul; Shriner, Kimberly; Huse, Holly; Wong-Beringer, Annie",International journal of clinical practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487380/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14818,13
625880,Bystander CD4 T cells do not mediate demyelination in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus,2003-02-27,"The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths globally. There is an urgent need for robust, scalable monitoring tools supporting resource allocation and stratification of high-risk patients. This research aims to develop and validate prediction models, using the UK Biobank to estimate COVID19 mortality risk in confirmed cases. We developed a random forest classification model using baseline characteristics, pre-existing conditions, symptoms, and vital signs, such that the score could dynamically assess risk of mortality with disease deterioration (AUC: 0.92). The design and feature selection of the framework lends itself to deployment in remote settings. Possible applications include supporting individual-level risk profiling and monitoring disease progression across high volumes of patients with COVID19, especially in hospital-at-home settings. The COVID19 pandemic has precipitated over 100 million confirmed cases and 2.3 million deaths globally. The impact of the pandemic has not been limited to healthcare systems: a ripple effect has resulted in wide-ranging economic and social disruption. Interventions to reduce transmission, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and re-allocation of health resources, are critical to limiting the impact. Although large-scale vaccination programmes have begun, many countries globally will not have widespread access to vaccines until 2023, meaning that non-pharmaceutical interventions are likely to remain indispensable national strategies for some time. COVID19 shows highly varied clinical presentation. A significant proportion (17 to 45%) of cases are asymptomatic and require no specific care. Conversely, reviews of severe complications have found that up to 32% of hospitalized COVID19 patients are admitted to ICU7. Between these two extremes, typical symptoms include fever, continuous cough, anosmia, and dyspnoea, which may range from requiring only self-management at home to inpatient care. Understanding which individuals are most vulnerable to severe disease, and thereby in most need of resources, is critical to limit the impact of the virus. Decision-making at all levels requires an understanding of individuals risk of severe disease. Various patient characteristics, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors have been linked to greater risk of death and/or severe illness following infection. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors have also been linked as risk factors for COVID19 mortality. Once patients are infected with SARS CoV 2, additional physiological parameters, such as symptoms and vital signs, can inform real-time prognostication13. Laboratory testing and imaging can also inform risk stratification for early, aggressive intervention, though this data is only accessible to hospital inpatients, who are likely to be already severely affected. Robust, predictive models for acquisition and prognosis of COVID 1916 18 and resource management have been developed to support risk stratification and population management at scale, offering important insights for organizational decision-making. However, the individual is currently overlooked, and granular, patient-specific risk-scoring could potentially unify decision-making at all levels. Existing individualized risk scores, however, often conflate risk of COVID19 acquisition with risk of mortality following infection, which can limit their utility in patient management. For prediction models to achieve impact at scale, assessment of risk factors should be inexpensive and accessible to the general population, ideally without the need for specialized testing or hospital visits. Such risk prediction tools, enabling improved patient triage, could be used to further increase the efficiency of, and confidence in, hospital at home solutions, which have shown promise in reducing hospital burden throughout the pandemic. Risk scores in these circumstances need to be dynamic and contemporaneous, ideally incorporating symptoms and vital sign data to maximise utility to clinical and research teams. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to develop and validate a population-based prediction model, using a large, rich dataset and a selective, clinically informed approach, which dynamically estimates the COVID19 mortality risk in confirmed diagnoses.","Dabbah, M.

At its start, to limit the spread of this virus, countries, states, and counties have implemented stay-at-home orders and shutdowns. These shutdowns had great impacts on people's well-being and exacerbated social determinants of health. This project aims to identify patient social determinants of health and their associations during the COVID-19 pandemic via telemedicine. METHODS: A total of 104 patients were surveyed within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who had not been seen for at least 4 weeks before March 23, 2020 and who did not have a scheduled visit within 4 weeks of the initial survey. Based on a patient's specific response, resources were then allocated to them. RESULTS: Most patients surveyed identified at least 1 social determinant of health, the most common being financial issues (27%), mental health issues (26%), and access to food (19%). A statistically significant relationship was found between patients who identified finances with access to food, access to medication with struggling to care for themselves or others, and physical wellness with mental health. Lastly, an association was found between those who did not identify any difficulties and wanting more information. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying needed barriers via telemedicine, we can properly allocate resources to those who need it the most and hope to decrease the potential long-term effects of this current pandemic.","Pappan, Nikos; Austin, Scarlett; Venkat, Divya; Thakkar, Payal",Infect Dis Clin Pract (Baltim Md),https://doi.org/10.1097/ipc.0000000000001003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276174/,13

We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response. Methods This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralizing titers. Results 225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p<0.05). Neutralizing antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p<0.05). Conclusions Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralizing antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting most individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection.","Kanji, Jamil N; Bailey, Ashley; Fenton, Jayne; Ling, Sean H; Rivera, Rafael; Plitt, Sabrina; I Sligl, Wendy; Taylor, Sean; Turnbull, LeeAnn; Tipples, Graham; Charlton, Carmen L.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454782/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21010422; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21010422?v=s5,13

Complex issues contribute to these high STI/HIV rates. Our community‐based participatory research (CBPR) partnership conducted a community‐driven needs assessment to inform an intervention addressing STI/HIV disparities and related social determinants of health (SDH) among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour in a high‐incidence STI/HIV community in North Carolina. In 2018, in‐depth interviews were conducted with 21 community members and 29 community organisation representatives to explore needs, priorities and assets. Interview data were analysed using constant comparison, an approach to grounded theory, and an empowerment theory‐based planning process was used to develop multilevel intervention strategies based on findings. Thirteen themes emerged from the interviews that were organised into five domains: health (e.g., limited health services use; need for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender [LGBT]‐friendly providers; prioritisation of mental health and gender transition and limited knowledge of and access to pre‐exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] for HIV); employment (e.g., employment as a priority and relying on sex work to ‘make ends meet’); education (e.g., barriers to education and needs for training to improve employment opportunities); social support (e.g., few welcoming activities and groups; strong informal support networks and little interaction between GBMSM and transgender women) and discrimination (e.g., frequent experiences of discrimination and the impact of frontline staff on services use). Three strategies – community‐based peer navigation, use of social media, and anti‐discrimination trainings for organisations – were identified and integrated into a new intervention known as Impact Triad.

A novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.177) reportedly arose in Spain in the summer of 2020, with subsequent spread across Europe linked to travel by infected individuals. Surveillance and monitoring through the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers insights into the global and local movement of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and can detect introductions of novel variants. Methods We analysed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced for surveillance purposes from specimens received by Public Health Ontario (Sept 6 – Oct 10, 2020), collected from individuals in eastern Ontario, which comprised the study sample. Taxonomic lineages were identified using pangolin (v2.08) and phylogenetic analysis incorporated publicly available genomes covering the same time period as the study sample. Epidemiological data collected from laboratory requisitions and standard reportable disease case investigation was integrated into the analysis. Results Genomic surveillance identified a COVID-19 case with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.177 from an individual in eastern Ontario in late September, 2020. The individual had recently returned from Europe. Genomic analysis with publicly available data indicate the most closely related genomes to this specimen were from Southern Europe. Genomic surveillance did not identify further cases with this lineage. Conclusions Genomic surveillance allowed for early detection of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Ontario which was deemed to be travel related.

The present study investigated the incidence, predisposing factors, and imaging characteristics of vaccine-related axillary lymphadenopathy in patients with thoracic malignancy who underwent CT scans before and after COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods The study included patients with thoracic malignancies who received two doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations and had pre-vaccine and post-vaccine chest CT scans. Post-vaccine chest CT scans were reviewed for increase in size of axillary/subpectoral lymph nodes, comparing to the pre-vaccine scans. The cases with axillary/subpectoral lymphadenopathy were further reviewed independently by two radiologists referring to clinical information, to determine if lymphadenopathy was attributed to vaccinations. Results Vaccine-related axillary/subpectoral lymphadenopathy was noted in 21 of 232 patients (9.0%). The median short axis diameter of the largest node was 7 mm (range: 5-14 mm). The median number of increased nodes was 4 (range: 1-10). The median time to the post-vaccine scan demonstrating lymphadenopathy was 1.7 weeks (range: -2.9 – 6.6) from the 2nd dose. Vaccine-related lymphadenopathy was noted more commonly in woman than in men (18/144, 12.5% vs. 3/88, 3.4%, respectively; p=0.019), and with mRNA-1273 vaccines than BNT162b2 vaccines (6/28, 21% vs. 15/204, 7.4%, respectively; p=0.026). Conclusions The incidence of lymphadenopathy was 9%, with a median onset time of 1.7 weeks after the 2nd vaccine dose. Female sex and vaccine type (mRNA-1273 vaccine) were associated with higher frequency of lymphadenopathy, providing initial observations to inform further investigations in larger cohorts.","Nishino, Mizuki; Hatabu, Hiroto; Ricciuti, Biagio; Vaz, Victor; Michael, Kesi; Awad, Mark M.",J Thorac Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2021.08.761; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556086421031841?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1556086421031841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506955/,13
626866,Group 2 coronaviruses prevent immediate early interferon induction by protection of viral RNA from host cell recognition,2007-04-25,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally medical education involves classroom teaching, small group discussions and bed-side clinics. These have become difficult to conduct in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Video-conferencing software and apps provide pragmatic alternatives for medical education in this scenario. However, the apps are not designed specifically for medical education. In this background, we aimed to review available video-conferencing freeware (platforms/apps) for their suitability in imparting post-graduate medical education. METHODOLOGY: Software and apps were searched on Android and iOS platforms. Freeware were selected based on pre-defined criteria. They were evaluated for features supporting post-graduate medical education like participant numbers, time limit, user comfort and security features. RESULTS: Our search yielded 118 video conferencing software and apps. Of these, 07 free apps met the initial inclusion and exclusion criteria. 'Say Namaste' was included post-hoc. Most apps allowed adequate numbers of participants and were comfortable for users. Only two apps had end-to-end encryption. CONCLUSION: Video-conferencing freeware can serve as a viable alternative for some aspects of medical teaching. Provision of certain additional features would make these apps more effective for post-graduate medical education.","Chail, Amit; Chatterjee, Kaushik; Chauhan, Vinay Singh; Prakash, Jyoti",Ind Psychiatry J,https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_122_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776289/,13

The ZIKV emerged as a major human pathogen due to its association with the impairment of perinatal development and Guillain–Barré syndrome. The occurrence of these severe cases of Zika points to the significance of studies for understanding the molecular determinants of flavivirus pathogenesis. Reverse genetics is a powerful method for studying the replication and determinants of pathogenesis, virulence, and viral attenuation of flaviviruses, facilitating the design of vaccines and therapeutics. However, the main hurdle in the development of infectious clones is the instability of full-length cDNA in Escherichia coli. Here, we described the development of a genetically stable and efficient infectious clone based on the ZIKV Rio-U1 isolated in the 2016 epidemic in Brazil. The employed strategy consisted of cloning the viral cDNA genome into two stable plasmid subclones and obtaining a high-quality cDNA template with increment in DNA mass for in vitro transcription by PCR amplification. The strategy for developing a ZIKV infectious cDNA clone designed in this study was successful, yielding a replicative and efficient clone-derived virus with high similarities with its parental virus, Rio-U1, by comparison of the proliferation capacity in mammal and insect cells. The infection of AG129 immunocompromised mice caused identical mortality rates, with similar disease progression and morbidity in the animals infected with the parental and the cDNA-derived virus. Histopathological analyses of mouse brains infected with the parental and the cDNA-derived viruses revealed a similar pathogenesis degree. We observed meningoencephalitis, cellular pyknosis, and neutrophilic invasion adjacent to the choroid plexus and perivascular cuffs with the presence of neutrophils. The developed infectious clone will be a tool for genetic and functional studies in vitro and in vivo to understand viral infection and pathogenesis better.","de Mello, Iasmim Silva; Fernandes, Déberli Ruiz; Furtado, Nathália Dias; dos Santos, Alexandre Araújo Cunha; dos Santos, Marta Pereira; Ribeiro, Ieda Pereira; Raphael, Lidiane Menezes Souza; Nogueira, Mônica da Silva; da Cruz, Stephanie Oliveira Diaz; Rocha, Adalgiza da Silva; Manso, Pedro Paulo de Abreu; Pelajo-Machado, Marcelo; Bonaldo, Myrna Cristina",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717035/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.639655,13
627179,Non-plaque-forming virions of Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara express viral genes,2016-10-11,"Human Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is upregulated under several stress conditions and pathological situations such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. We previously showed that apoD mRNA expression is induced in growth-arrested cells and demonstrated the specific binding of nuclear proteins to the region −514 to −475 of the promoter. Such region contains a pair of Serum Responsive Elements (SRE), an Ets-Binding Site (EBS) and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE). In this study, we show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind these regulatory elements of the apoD promoter. Specific binding of HnRNP-U and Parp-1 was confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). In a biotin pull-down assay, Kif4 and BUB-3 bind preferentially the SRE1 and the EBS-GRE sites, respectively, while APEX-1 seems recruited indirectly to these elements. We found that the mRNA expression of some of these binding factors is upregulated in growth-arrested cells and that these proteins also transactivate the apoD promoter. In agreement with these results, mutants of APEX-1 and of Parp-1 defective for their DNA-binding and catalytic activities could not transactivate the promoter. The knockdown of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U and the use of specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 and of Parp-1 also inhibited the induction of apoD gene expression. Moreover, ERK1/2 was found activated in a biphasic manner post serum-starvation and the inhibition of Parp-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK2 but not ERK1 for up to 2 h. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities in the growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression.","Levros, Louis-Charles; Carmo, Sonia Do; Edouard, Elsy; Legault, Philippe; Charfi, Cyndia; Rassart, Eric",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493910/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488910001369; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488910001369; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.04.011,13

To attribute NO(2) changes to NO(X) emissions changes over short timescales, one must account for meteorology. We find that meteorological patterns were especially favorable for low NO(2) in much of the U.S. in spring 2020, complicating comparisons with spring 2019. Meteorological variations between years can cause column NO(2) differences of ~15% over monthly timescales. After accounting for sun angle and meteorological considerations, we calculate that NO(2) drops ranged between 9.2 – 43.4% among twenty cities in North America, with a median of 21.6%. Of the studied cities, largest NO(2) drops (>30%) were in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Toronto, and smallest drops (<12%) were in Miami, Minneapolis, and Dallas. These normalized NO(2) changes can be used to highlight locations with greater activity changes and better understand the sources contributing to adverse air quality in each city.","Goldberg, Daniel L.; Anenberg, Susan C.; Griffin, Debora; McLinden, Chris A.; Lu, Zifeng; Streets, David G.",Geophys Res Lett,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl089269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904906/,13

To achieve the objectives of the study, an online survey was conducted, focusing on aspects like psycho-social well-being, safety, financial stability, and work from home implications. We have used exploratory factor analysis (EFA), t-test, and analysis of variance technique to find the underlying factors. The findings suggest that the female population of the society is more vulnerable to social-psychological and organizational stress. In terms of financial stability, private employees are more unstable as compared to government employees. Based on the standard of living, people of type 1 cities are more affected by the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the people of type 2 and type 3 cities. Hence, by and large, female employees, employees working in the private sector, and employees residing in type 1 cities are more likely to have the behavioral manifestation of negative psychological states caused by this pandemic.

CAMO sought to examine the temporal effects of C19 on MOs and care practices across Canada. Methods: Three serial multiple-choice, web-based surveys were conducted in 2020 – from Mar 30th to April 4th (S1), May 6th to May 15th (S2) and Dec 10th to 18th (S3). The surveys were distributed by email to MOs identified through CAMO and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons directory (n=618). Participation was voluntary with no compensation. Descriptive analyses with frequency distributions are reported. Results: The timing for S1 and S3 coincided with the 1st and 2nd C19 waves in Canada. Response rates decreased slightly: 26% S1, 25% S2 and 20% S3. Per table, demographics were similar across surveys: majority of respondents were from a comprehensive cancer centre and in practice for < 15 years. Concerns regarding PPE access and C19 personal risk decreased over time. A high rate of telemedicine was observed in S1 but this notably decreased by S3, despite the 2nd wave. A similar decreasing trend was observed in the proportion of altered chemotherapy plans due to C19. Similar levels of anxiety, depression, lack of focus and concerns for personal wellness were maintained over time. In S3, respondents noted delayed cancer diagnoses and oncologist burnout as the top 2 post-pandemic challenges, and 87% believed their workload would increase. [Formula presented] Conclusions: As the pandemic continues, positive trends can be observed in concerns around PPE access and C19 risk. A high level of telemedicine adoption was observed early in the pandemic but is decreasing, and chemotherapy plans remained unchanged for most patients. Concerns regarding personal wellness remained high across all 3 surveys. Proactive strategies to support physician wellness, mitigate burnout and manage MO workload are needed.

However, actual surveys in kindergartens beyond individual outbreaks are rare. At the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Berlin, Germany, i.e., end of September 2020, we screened SARS-CoV-2 infections among kindergarten children, staff and connected household members. MethodsTwelve kindergartens were randomly selected in the Berlin metropolitan area, and a total of 720 participants were recruited (155 pre-school children, 78 staff, 487 household members). Participants were briefly examined and interviewed, and SARS-CoV-2 infections and anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies were assessed. ResultsSigns and symptoms, largely resembling common cold, were present in 24.2% of children and 28.9% of staff. However, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected among 701 PCR-tested individuals, and only one childcare worker showed IgG seroreactivity (0.15%; 1/672). ConclusionsAgainst a backdrop of increased pandemic activity in the community, this cross-sectional study does not suggest that kindergartens are silent transmission reservoirs. Nevertheless, at increasing pandemic activity, reinforced precautionary measures and repeated routine testing appears advisable.","Thielecke, Marlene; Theuring, Stefanie; Loon, Welmoed van; Hommes, Franziska; Mall, Marcus A.; Rosen, Alexander; Boehringer, Falko; Kalle, Christof von; Kirchberger, Valerie; Kurth, Tobias; Seybold, Joachim; Mockenhaupt, Frank P.; Group, - BECOSS Study",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20245910; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245910v1?rss=1,13

To explore the genomic signatures, we comprehensively analyzed 2,492 complete and/or near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from across the globe to the GISAID database up to 30 March 2020. Genome-wide annotations revealed 1,516 nucleotide-level variations at different positions throughout the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, nucleotide (nt) deletion analysis found twelve deletion sites throughout the genome other than previously reported deletions at coding sequence of the ORF8 (open reading frame), spike, and ORF7a proteins, specifically in polyprotein ORF1ab (n = 9), ORF10 (n = 1), and 3´-UTR (n = 2). Evidence from the systematic gene-level mutational and protein profile analyses revealed a large number of amino acid (aa) substitutions (n = 744), demonstrating the viral proteins heterogeneous. Notably, residues of receptor-binding domain (RBD) showing crucial interactions with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cross-reacting neutralizing antibody were found to be conserved among the analyzed virus strains, except for replacement of lysine with arginine at 378th position of the cryptic epitope of a Shanghai isolate, hCoV-19/Shanghai/SH0007/2020 (EPI_ISL_416320). Furthermore, our results of the preliminary epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 infections revealed that frequency of aa mutations were relatively higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Europe (43.07%) followed by Asia (38.09%), and North America (29.64%) while case fatality rates remained higher in the European temperate countries, such as Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, England and Belgium. Thus, the present method of genome annotation employed at this early pandemic stage could be a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the continuously evolving pandemic situation, the associated genetic variants, and their implications for the development of effective control and prophylaxis strategies.","Islam, M.

Dysfunctions of endothelial cells and platelets are tightly linked in contributing to the systemic inflammatory response that appears to be both a cause and a consequence of COVID-19-associated coagulation disorders and thrombotic events. Indeed, elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines are often associated with abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients. Although treatments with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have shown beneficial effects in decreasing patient mortality with severe COVID-19, additional therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Utilizing the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of natural compounds may provide alternative therapeutic approaches to prevent or reduce the risk factors associated with pre-existing conditions and comorbidities that can worsen COVID-19 patients’ outcomes. In this regard, resveratrol, a natural compound found in several plants and fruits such as grapes, blueberries and cranberries, may represent a promising coadjuvant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. By virtue of its anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, resveratrol would be expected to lower COVID-19-associated mortality, which is well known to be increased by thrombosis and inflammation. This review analyzes and discusses resveratrol’s ability to modulate vascular hemostasis at different levels targeting both primary hemostasis (interfering with platelet activation and aggregation) and secondary hemostasis (modulating factors involved in coagulation cascade).","Giordo, Roberta; Zinellu, Angelo; Eid, Ali Hussein; Pintus, Gianfranco",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26040856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562030/,13

These autoantibodies neutralized most type I IFNs but rarely IFN-beta. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the prevalence of autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with IFN-beta-1b during hospitalization and to analyze their impact on various clinical variables and outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed stored serum/plasma samples and clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated subcutaneously with IFN-beta-1b from March to May 2020, at the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 47 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, 16 of whom (34%) had a critical progression requiring ICU admission. The median age was 71 years, with 28 men (58.6%). Type I IFN-alpha- and omega-neutralizing autoantibodies were found in 5 of 47 patients with severe pneumonia or critical disease (10.6%), while they were not found in any of the 118 asymptomatic controls (p = 0.0016). The autoantibodies did not neutralize IFN-beta. No demographic, comorbidity, or clinical differences were seen between individuals with or without autoantibodies. We found a significant correlation between the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies and higher C-reactive protein levels (p = 5.10e(−03)) and lower lymphocyte counts (p = 1.80e(−02)). No significant association with response to IFN-beta-1b therapy (p = 0.34) was found. Survival analysis suggested that neutralizing autoantibodies may increase the risk of death (4/5, 80% vs 12/42, 28.5%). CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN underlie severe/critical COVID-19 stages in at least 10% of cases, correlate with increased C-RP and lower lymphocyte counts, and confer a trend towards increased risk of death. Subcutaneous IFN-beta treatment of hospitalized patients did not seem to improve clinical outcome. Studies of earlier, ambulatory IFN-beta treatment are warranted.

Due to pauci-symptomatic cases, the virus may spread invisibly in a community. Healthcare systems have repeatedly been challenged with a rapid onset of patients. In the absence of vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like interpersonal distancing were implemented in several countries and have been key to effectively reduce viral spreading. In Germany after an exponential growth of cases numbers in March 2020, NPIs were able to effectively control the pandemic and sufficiently reduced the daily reported new infections allowing for partial release of NPIs. Since these measures were unable to remove the virus entirely from the population, responsible behavior and interpersonal distancing are still required. Methods are needed which can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. To this end, we developed a novel statistical method evaluating the earliest possible events of infections, the contacts between individuals, which is essential for virus transmission. We derived the contact index, an index for the contact intensity of the population from spatial proximity between individuals as proxy for physical interaction based on complex network science. In an application, we estimated the contact index from GPS mobile phone data of about 1 million users in Germany, and investigated its association with infection rates in Germany. The results show that the contact index is able to model the time evolution of new infections of SARS-CoV-2. It shows a strong association with the effective reproduction number of the virus about seven days later in all observed phases in Germany (Pearson correlation r=0.88): 1) the early phase of the first wave with the highest reproduction rate, 2) phase of strict NPIs (lockdown) with the lowest reproduction, 3) release of NPIs accompanied with an increase of reproduction. This work presents the foundation to create a geographic information system that can display daily updated human contact data, which we plan to further extend to a full early warning system for SARS-CoV-2.","Ruediger, S.; Konigorski, S.; Edelman, J.; Zernick, D.; Lippert, C.; Thieme, A.

Typical appearances include patchy ground glass shadowing. Thoracic radiotherapy uses daily cone beam CT imaging (CBCT) to check for changes in patient positioning and anatomy prior to treatment through a qualitative assessment of lung appearance by radiographers. Observation of changes related to COVID-19 infection during this process may facilitate earlier testing improving patient management and staff protection. Methods A tool was developed to create overview reports for all CBCTs for each patient throughout their treatment. Reports contain coronal maximum intensity projection (MIP’s) of all CBCTs and plots of lung density over time. A single therapeutic radiographer undertook a blinded off-line audit that reviewed 150 patient datasets for tool optimisation in which medical notes were compared to image findings. This cohort included 75 patients treated during the pandemic and 75 patients treated between 2014-2017. The process was repeated retrospectively on a subset of the 285 thoracic radiotherapy patients treated between January-June 2020 to assess the efficiency of the tool and process. Results Three patients in the n=150 optimisation cohort had confirmed COVID-19 infections during their radiotherapy. Two of these were detected by the reported image assessment process. The third case was not detected on CBCT due to minimal density changes in the visible part of the lungs. Within the retrospective cohort four patients had confirmed COVID-19 based on RT-PCR tests, three of which were retrospectively detected by the reported process. Conclusion The preliminary results indicate that the presence of COVID-19 can be detected on CBCT by therapeutic radiographers. Implications for practice This process has now been extended to clinical service with daily assessments of all thoracic CBCTs. Changes noted are referred for oncologist review.","Clough, A.; Sanders, J.; Banfill, K.; Faivre-Finn, C.; Price, G.; Eccles, C. L.; Aznar, M.

However, the interaction between COVID‐19 and CVD is unclear. In this systematic review, the available evidence for the crosstalk between COVID‐19 and CVD and its treatment was analysed. A search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infects human cells via angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2. SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause CVD by inducing cytokine storms, creating an imbalance in the oxygen supply and demand and disrupting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system; SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can also lead to the development of CVD through the side effects of therapeutic drugs, psychological factors, and aggravation of underlying CVD. The most common CVDs caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Studies have found that there is an interaction between COVID‐19 and CVD. Underlying CVD is associated with a high risk of mortality in patients with COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can also cause new‐onset CVD. Clinicians need to pay close attention to cardiovascular complications during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID‐19 to reduce patient mortality.","Ye, Qing; Lu, Dezhao; Shang, Shiqiang; Fu, Junfen; Gong, Fangqi; Shu, Qiang; Mao, Jianhua",ESC Heart Fail,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935928/,13

The weekly epidemiological report issued by the WHO pointed out that new coronavirus variants have appeared in 131 countries and regions, which demonstrates that the current epidemic situation is still severe. As of now, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been widespread worldwide for more than one year and poses a serious threat to the health of vulnerable groups such as those with malignancies, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Compared with the general population, cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are more likely to have serious clinical adverse events, leading to higher mortality. There is no doubt that during the COVID-19 epidemic, whether it is with regards to how to prevent infection or how to continue anti-tumor treatment, cancer patients are in a difficult situation. Meanwhile, an international patient with malignant Hodgkin’s lymphoma who was cured after being infected with the new coronavirus surprised us, and it inspires more scientists to explore the relationship between infection, immunity, and tumors. Relevantly, through multi-disciplinary discussion, scientists put forward more new perspectives on the treatment of future tumors and the management of SARS-CoV-2 diseases. In this review, the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients is discussed in detail and the recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and management of cancer patients will be put forward under the challenge of the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be discussed, and we will also put forward our insights on cancer immunity.","Pan, Shuangyue; Jiang, Jiahong; Chen, Zheling; Yang, Liu",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277701/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.673360,13

However, the current practice in TB therapeutics trials is to use composite binary outcomes, which in the absence of standardization may inflate false positive and negative errors in evaluating regimens. The lack of standardization of outcomes is a barrier to the identification of highly efficacious regimens and the introduction of innovative methodologies METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of trials designed to advance new pulmonary TB drugs or regimens for regulatory approval and inform practice guidelines. Trials were primarily identified from the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP). Only trials that collected post-treatment follow-up data and enrolled at least 100 patients were included. Protocols and Statistical Analysis Plans (SAP) for eligible trials from 1995 to the present were obtained from trial investigators. Details of outcome data, both explicit and implied, were abstracted and organized into three broad categories: favorable, unfavorable, and not assessable. Within these categories, individual trial definitions were recorded and collated, and areas of broad consensus and disagreement were identified and described. RESULTS: From 2205 trials in any way related to TB, 51 were selected for protocol and SAP review, from which 31 were both eligible and had accessible documentation. Within the three designated categories, we found broad consensus in the definitions of favorable and unfavorable outcomes, although specific details were not always provided, and when explicitly addressed, were heterogeneous. Favorable outcomes were handled the most consistently but were widely variable with respect to specification. In some cases, the same events were defined differently by different protocols, particularly in distinguishing unfavorable from not assessable events. Death was often interpreted as conditional on cause. Patients who did not complete the study because of withdrawal or loss to follow-up presented a particular challenge to consistent interpretation and analytic treatment of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In a review of 31 clinical trials, we found that outcome definitions were heterogeneous, highlighting the need to establish clearer specification and a move towards universal standardization of outcomes across pulmonary TB trials. The ICH E9 (R1) addendum provides guidelines for undertaking and achieving this goal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020197993. Registration 11 August 2020.

In recent years, the discovery of DNA sensing proteins, including cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16), has led to understanding of how cells evoke strong innate immune responses against incoming pathogens carrying DNA genomes. The signaling stimulated by DNA sensors depends on the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), to enable expression of antiviral proteins, including type I interferon. To facilitate efficient infections, viruses have evolved a wide range of evasion strategies, targeting host DNA sensors, adaptor proteins and transcription factors. In this review, the current literature on virus-induced activation of the STING pathway is presented and we discuss recently identified viral evasion mechanisms targeting different steps in this antiviral pathway.","Christensen, Maria H; Paludan, Søren R",Cell Mol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2016.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26972769/,13

This study aims to assess the frequency of infections, community and hospital-acquired infections, and risk factors for infections and mortality during severe COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study including consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe COVID-19. Competing-risk analyses were used to assess cumulative risk of infections. Time-dependent Cox and fine and gray models were used to assess risk factors for infections and mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to estimate the effect of dexamethasone. RESULTS: We included 100 patients including 34 patients with underlying malignancies or organ transplantation. First infectious event was bacterial for 35 patients, and fungal for one. Cumulative incidence of infectious events was 27% [18–35] at 10 ICU-days. Prevalence of community-acquired infections was 7% [2.8–13.9]. Incidence density of hospital-acquired infections was 125 [91–200] events per 1000 ICU-days. Risk factors independently associated with hospital-acquired infections included MV. Patient’s severity and underlying malignancy were associated with mortality. Dexamethasone was associated with increased infections (36% [20–53] vs. 12% [4–20] cumulative incidence at day-10; p = 0.01). After matching, dexamethasone was associated with hospital-acquired infections (35% [18–52] vs. 13% [1–25] at 10 days, respectively, p = 0.03), except in the subset of patients requiring MV, and had no influence on mortality.

Some policymakers have expressed concern that citizens would not maintain high levels of compliance with these behaviours over the pandemic and would instead exhibit so-called ""behavioural fatigue"". While the concept has been criticized, there have been few tests of behavioural fatigue using data from the COVID-19 pandemic, and none that have tracked individuals' compliance trajectories. Methods: We used longitudinal data on self-reported compliance from 50,851 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected across two waves of the pandemic in the UK (01 April 2020 - 22 February 2021). We modelled typical compliance trajectories using latent growth curve analysis (LGCA) and tested for behavioural fatigue by attempting to identify a set of participants whose compliance decreased substantially over the study period. Results: We selected a four-class LGCA solution. Most individuals maintained high levels of compliance over the pandemic and reported similar levels of compliance across the first and second waves. Approximately one in seven participants had decreasing levels of compliance across the pandemic, reporting noticeably lower levels of compliance in the second wave, a pattern compatible with behavioural fatigue. Individuals with declining compliance levels differed from those with consistently high compliance on multiple characteristics, including (young) age, better physical health, lower empathy and conscientiousness and greater general willingness to take risks. Conclusion: While a minority, not all individuals have maintained high compliance across the pandemic. Decreasing compliance is related to several psychological traits. The results suggest that targeting of behaviour change messages later in the pandemic may be needed to increase compliance.","Wright, L.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.21255336v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255336,13

In case of Senegal, the country was already facing number of challenges at the inception of the pandemic, including high rates of poverty, prevalence of food insecurity, combined with other biophysical and socioeconomic challenges faced generally in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural systems and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal. Particular attention was given to potential vulnerabilities and resilience in the targeted farming systems. METHODS: A survey was developed to better understand smallholder farmer perceptions regarding the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their agriculture practices and social well-being. The survey was administered (between June 5 and June 20) with smallholder farmers (n = 872) in 14 regions covering all agroecological zones. Variables of interest included perceptions of potential impact on farming systems, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Across the three farming systems examined (cropping, livestock, and horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture). The majority of respondents also expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). SIGNIFICANCE: Anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs and socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Results support the need to use farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 and warrants a more in-depth examination of agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihoods and social well-being of families at community and household levels.

638831,Molecular mechanism of anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of Ashwagandha-derived withanolides,2021-06-09,"OBJECTIVES: This audit assesses communication between community optometrists (COs) and hospital eye service (HES) in Scotland and England. METHODS: Optometric referrals and replies were extracted from six practices in Scotland and England. If no reply was found, replies/records were copied from HES records. De-identified referrals, replies and records were audited against established standards, evaluating whether referrals were necessary, accurate and directed to the appropriate professional. The referral rate (RR) and referral reply rate (RRR) were calculated. RESULTS: From 905 de-identified referrals, RR ranged from 2.6 to 8.7%. From COs’ perspective, the proportion of referrals for which they received replies ranged from 37 to 84% (Scotland) and 26 to 49% (England). A total of 88–96% of referrals (Scotland) and 63–76% (England) were seen in the HES. Adjusting for cases when it is reasonable to expect replies, RRR becomes 45–92% (Scotland) and 38–62% (England) with RRR significantly greater in Scotland (P = 0.015). Replies were copied to patients in 0–21% of cases. Referrals were to the appropriate service and judged necessary in ≥90% of cases in both jurisdictions. Accuracy of referral ranged from 89 to 97% (Scotland) and 81 to 98% (England). The reply addressed the reason for referral in 94–100% of cases (Scotland) and 93–97% (England) and was meaningful in 95–100% (Scotland) and 94–99% (England). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the interdisciplinary joint statement on sharing patient information, this audit highlights variable standard of referrals and deficits in replies to the referring COs, with one exception in Scotland. Replies from HES to COs are important for patient care, benefitting patients and clinicians and minimising unnecessary HES appointments.","Shah, Rakhee; Edgar, David F.; Khatoon, Abeeda; Hobby, Angharad; Jessa, Zahra; Yammouni, Robert; Campbell, Peter; Soteri, Kiki; Beg, Amaad; Harsum, Steven; Aggarwal, Rajesh; Evans, Bruce J.

The most common coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms are pneumonia, fever, dry cough, and fatigue. However, some neurological complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection include confusion, cerebrovascular diseases, ataxia, hypogeusia, hyposmia, neuralgia, and seizures. Indeed, a growing literature demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronaviruses; therefore, the infection mechanisms already described in other coronaviruses may also be applicable for SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in the nervous system infection and the neurological involvement is essential to assess possible long-term neurological alteration of COVID-19. Here, we provide an overview of associated literature regarding possible routes of COVID-19 neuroinvasion, such as the trans-synapse-connected route in the olfactory pathway and peripheral nerve terminals and its neurological implications in the central nervous system.","Reza-Zaldívar, Edwin Estefan; Hernández-Sapiéns, Mercedes Azucena; Minjarez, Benito; Gómez-Pinedo, Ulises; Márquez-Aguirre, Ana Laura; Mateos-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Matias-Guiu, Jorge; Canales-Aguirre, Alejandro Arturo",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584720/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.621735,13

In the very old, the value of critical care has been questioned. We aimed to compare the mortality, rates of organ support, and the length of stay in old vs. very old patients with sepsis and septic shock in intensive care. Methods: This analysis included 9,385 patients, from the multi-center eICU Collaborative Research Database, with sepsis; 6184 were old (aged 65–79 years), and 3,201 were very old patients (aged 80 years and older). A multi-level logistic regression analysis was used to fit three sequential regression models for the binary primary outcome of ICU mortality. A sensitivity analysis in septic shock patients (n = 1054) was also conducted. Results: In the very old patients, the median length of stay was shorter (50 ± 67 vs. 56 ± 72 h; p < 0.001), and the rate of a prolonged ICU stay was lower (>168 h; 9 vs. 12%; p < 0.001) than the old patients. The mortality from sepsis was higher in very old patients (13 vs. 11%; p = 0.005), and after multi-variable adjustment being very old was associated with higher odds for ICU mortality (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09–1.59; p = 0.004). In patients with septic shock, mortality was also higher in the very old patients (38 vs. 36%; aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10–2.06; p = 0.01). Conclusion: Very old ICU-patients suffer from a slightly higher ICU mortality compared with old ICU-patients.

Little is known about the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on diseases other than COVID-19 in the South African setting. OBJECTIVE: To describe a cohort of hospitalised patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 that initially tested negative. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalised at Khayelitsha Hospital from April to June 2020, whose initial polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative were included. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision) diagnosis, referral to tertiary level facilities and ICU, and all-cause in-hospital mortality were collected. The 90-day re-test rate was determined and comparisons were made using the χ(2)-test and the independent samples median test. RESULTS: Overall, 261 patients were included: median age 39.8 years, 55.6% female (n = 145). Frequent comorbidities included HIV (41.4%), hypertension (26.4%), and previous or current tuberculosis (24.1%). Nine (3.7%) patients were admitted to ICU and 38 (15.6%) patients died. Ninety-three patients (35.6%) were re-tested and 21 (22.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The top primary diagnoses related to respiratory diseases (n = 82, 33.6%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (n = 62, 25.4%). Thirty-five (14.3%) had a COVID-19 diagnostic code assigned (26 without microbiological confirmation) and 43 (16.5%) had tuberculosis. Older age (p = 0.001), chronic renal impairment (p = 0.03) and referral to higher level of care (all p < 0.001; ICU p = 0.03) were more frequent in those that died.

The objectives of this study were to characterize Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome-wide nucleotide variations, trace ancestries using phylogenetic networks and correlate state-wise distribution of viral haplotypes with differences in mortality rates. A total of 305 whole genome sequences from 19 Indian states were downloaded from GISAID. Sequences were aligned using the ancestral Wuhan-Hu genome sequence (NC_045512.2). A total of 633 variants resulting in 388 amino acid substitutions were identified. Allele frequency spectrum, and nucleotide diversity (π) values revealed the presence of higher proportions of low frequency variants and negative Tajima’s D values across ORFs indicated the presence of population expansion. Network analysis highlighted the presence of two major clusters of viral haplotypes, namely, clade G with the S:D614G, RdRp: P323L variants and a variant of clade L [Lv] having the RdRp:A97V variant. Clade G genomes were found to be evolving more rapidly into multiple sub-clusters including clade GH and GR and were also found in higher proportions in three states with highest mortality rates namely, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.","Bhattacharjee, Bornali; Pandit, Bhaswati",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.122143,13
642671,The role of the envelope protein in the stability of a coronavirus model membrane against an ethanolic disinfectant,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic, as a worldwide threat to public health, has led many governments to impose mobility restrictions and adopt partial or full lockdown strategies in many regions to control the disease outbreak. Although these lockdowns are imposed to save public health by reducing the transmission of the virus, rather significant improvements of the air quality in this period have been reported in different areas, mainly as a result of the reduction in vehicular trips. In this research, the city of Turin in the northern part of Italy has been considered as the study area, because of its special meteorology and geographic location in one of the most polluted regions in Europe, and also its high density of vehicular emissions. A Lagrangian approach is applied to illustrate and analyze the effect of imposing full lockdown restrictions on the reduction of traffic-induced air pollution in the city. To do this, the real-time traffic flow during the lockdown period is recorded, and by utilizing CALPUFF version 7, the dispersion of PM(2.5), Total Suspended Particulate (TSP), Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), NO(x,) and Black Carbon (BC) emitted from all circulating vehicles during and before the lockdown period are compared. Results indicate that the concentration of pollutants generated by road traffic sources (including passenger cars, busses, heavy-duty vehicles, light-duty vehicles, mopeds, and motorcycles) reduced at least 70% (for PM(2.5)) up to 88.1% (for BaP) during the studied period. Concentration maps show that the concentration reduction varied in different areas of the town, mainly due to the characteristics and strength of the emission sources and the geophysical features of the area.","Ravina, Marco; Esfandabadi, Zahra Shams; Panepinto, Deborah; Zanetti, Mariachiara",J Clean Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316101/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621026378?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652621026378; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128425,13

The aim of this study was to describe clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to those with other infective or non-infective etiologies. Methods: We performed a prospective study from March 2020 to February 2021. All patients hospitalized for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively recruited. All patients were evaluated according to a predefined protocol for diagnosis of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary endpoint was evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics associated or not with COVID-19 etiology at time of hospitalization in an emergency department. Results: A total of 1036 patients were included in the study: 717 (69%) patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 319 (31%) without COVID-19, hospitalized for other causes. The main causes of hospitalization among non-COVID-19 patients were acute heart failure (44%) and bacterial pneumonia (45.8%). Overall, 30-day mortality was 9% among the COVID-19 group and 35% in the non-COVID-19 group. Multivariate analysis showed variables (fever > 3 days, dry cough, acute dyspnea, lymphocytes < 1000 × 10(3)/µL, and ferritin > 250 ng/mL) independently associated with COVID-19 etiology. A decision tree was elaborated to early detect COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. Finally, Kaplan–Meier curves on 30-day survival in COVID-19 patients during the first wave (March–May 2020, n = 289 patients) and the second wave (October–February 2021, n = 428 patients) showed differences between the two study periods (p = 0.021). Conclusions: Patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 may show peculiar characteristics at time of hospitalization that could help physicians to distinguish from other infective or non-infective etiologies. Finally, a different 30-day mortality rate was observed during different periods of the pandemic.","Russo, Alessandro; Gentilini Cacciola, Elio; Borrazzo, Cristian; Filippi, Valeria; Bucci, Tommaso; Vullo, Francesco; Celani, Luigi; Binetti, Erica; Battistini, Luigi; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Alessandroni, Maria; Galardo, Gioacchino; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; d’Ettorre, Gabriella",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441304/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081368,13
643062,A parallel genome-wide RNAi screening strategy to identify host proteins important for entry of Marburg virus and H5N1 influenza virus,2015-11-24,"The lungs are exposed to a range of environmental toxins (including cigarette smoke, air pollution, asbestos) and pathogens (bacterial, viral and fungal), and most respiratory diseases are associated with local or systemic hypoxia. All of these adverse factors can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The ER is a key intracellular site for synthesis of secretory and membrane proteins, regulating their folding, assembly into complexes, transport and degradation. Accumulation of misfolded proteins within the lumen results in ER stress, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Effectors of the UPR temporarily reduce protein synthesis, while enhancing degradation of misfolded proteins and increasing the folding capacity of the ER. If successful, homeostasis is restored and protein synthesis resumes, but if ER stress persists, cell death pathways are activated. ER stress and the resulting UPR occur in a range of pulmonary insults and the outcome plays an important role in many respiratory diseases. The UPR is triggered in the airway of patients with several respiratory diseases and in corresponding experimental models. ER stress has been implicated in the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis, and evidence is accumulating suggesting that ER stress occurs in obstructive lung diseases (particularly in asthma), in pulmonary infections (some viral infections and in the setting of the cystic fibrosis airway) and in lung cancer. While a number of small molecule inhibitors have been used to interrogate the role of the UPR in disease models, many of these tools have complex and off-target effects, hence additional evidence (eg, from genetic manipulation) may be required to support conclusions based on the impact of such pharmacological agents. Aberrant activation of the UPR may be linked to disease pathogenesis and progression, but at present, our understanding of the context-specific and disease-specific mechanisms linking these processes is incomplete. Despite this, the ability of the UPR to defend against ER stress and influence a range of respiratory diseases is becoming increasingly evident, and the UPR is therefore attracting attention as a prospective target for therapeutic intervention strategies.","Bradley, Kirsty L; Stokes, Clare A; Marciniak, Stefan J; Parker, Lisa C; Condliffe, Alison M",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2019-213738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077618/,13

The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand transmission of COVID-19 within this community. METHODS: We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey between late-October and early December 2020 prior to the third national lockdown. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and sex. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. FINDINGS: A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. INTERPRETATION: In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date, which was markedly higher than the reported 10% seroprevalence in London at the time of the study. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must past through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This chapter discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation. Fungal diseases included are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis.

A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development, is lacking. In this study, we investigated the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and to form linear antibody epitopes. We created an online database to broadly share the predictions as a resource for the research community. Using this resource, we showed that genetic variations in SARS- CoV-2, though still few for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus. Importantly, we discovered evidence that SARS-CoV-2, along with related coronaviruses, used mutations to evade attack from the human immune system.

643990,Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion,2015-08-26,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) pandemic has pushed health workers to find creative solutions to a global shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE). 3D-printing technology is having an essential role during the pandemic providing solutions for this problem, for instance, modifying full-face snorkel masks or creating low-cost face shields to use as PPE (Ishack and Lipner, 2020 [1]). Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk to COVID19 infection due to the exposure to respiratory droplets and aerosols, especially during the routine nose and mouth examinations where coughing and sneezing happen regularly (Rna et al., 2017 [2]; Tysome and Bhutta, 2020 [3]). The use of a headlight is essential during these examinations. However, to our knowledge, none of the commercially available or 3D-printable face shields are compatible with a headlight. Hence, using a face shield and a headlight at the same time can be very uncomfortable and sometimes impossible. To solve this problem, we have designed a 3D-printable adapter for medical headlights, which can hold a transparent sheet to create a face shield as an effective barrier protection that can be used comfortably with the headlight. The adapter can be printed in different materials with the most commonly used nowadays being the cost-efficient PLA (Polylactic Acid) used for this prototype. The resulting piece weighs only 7 g and has an estimated cost of $0.15 USD. The transparent sheets, typically made from polyester and used for laser printing, can be purchased in any office material store with a standard price of 0.4 USD per unit. After use, the transparent sheet can be easily removed. We trialed the adapter in 7 different headlights. All of these headlights accommodated the printed blocks extremely well. The headlights were used in many different settings, including the ENT clinic, the operating room, the emergency room, the ENT ward and the COVID19 intensive care unit (ICU) for a two weeks period. All doctors using the headlight felt they were fully protected from respiratory droplets, blood, sputum and other fluids. The face shield with the headlight has been found very useful for treating epistaxis, changing tracheostomy cannulas and during routine nasal and oral examinations. The headlight face shield adapter was designed to solve a specific problem among the ENT community; however other specialist can find it useful as well. Nonetheless, manufacturers should take care of specifics problems like this and provide commercially available products to protect the ENT workforce in this new era.","Viera-Artiles, Jaime; Valdiande, José J.",Am J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518019/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070920302702; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102576; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070920302702,13

Although several studies have shown that PRRSV can affect the cell cycle of infected cells, it is still unclear how it manipulates the cell cycle to facilitate its proliferation. In this study, we analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of transcription factors in PRRSV-infected 3D4/21 cells by RNA-sequencing. The result shows that the expression of transcription factor DP2 (TFDP2) is remarkably upregulated in PRRSV-infected cells. Further studies show that TFDP2 contributes to PRRSV proliferation and the PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein induces TFDP2 expression by activating C/EBPβ. TFDP2 positively regulates cyclin A expression and triggers a less proportion of cells in the S phase, which contributes to PRRSV proliferation. This study proposes a novel mechanism by which PRRSV utilizes host protein to regulate the cell cycle to favor its infection. Findings from this study will help us for a better understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis.

Boris Johnson's Premiership was born in an opportunistic assertion of British exceptionalism, and Johnson's initial, fate-tempting reaction to the novel Coronavirus set the UK on the wrong path. Furthermore, the gradual erosion of professionalism in (especially health) policy-making over almost four decades, and the hollowing-out of the health protection infrastructure, both facilitated and accentuated a toxic approach to managing Covid-19.","Paton, Calum","Health economics, policy, and law",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811590/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s174413312000033x,13

In light of the anticipated shortage, a hospital-based 3D-printing platform was implemented in our institution for the production of swabs for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sampling based on the freely available, open-source design provided to the community by University of South Florida’s Health Radiology and Northwell Health System teams as a replacement for locally used commercial swabs. Validation of our 3D-printed swabs was performed with a head-to-head diagnostic accuracy study of the 3D-printed “Northwell model” with the cobas PCR Media(®) swab sample kit. We observed an excellent concordance (total agreement 96.8%, Kappa 0.936) in results obtained with the 3D-printed and flocked swabs, indicating that the in-house 3D-printed swab could be used reliably in the context of a shortage of flocked swabs.

644512,"Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of carbodine, the carbocyclic analogue of cytidine",1990-01-15,"OBJECTIVE The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the treatment of cancer patients, with particular regard to the management of both chemotherapy and side effects. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are amongst the most troublesome side effects that impair patients' adherence to treatments and their quality of life (QoL). NEPA (Akynzeo®), is an oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant [a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), 300 mg] and palonosetron [(5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin or 5HT) type3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), 0.5 mg] which has been shown to be effective in preventing CINV. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective study started before the outbreak of COVID-19 and was carried out during the pandemic period. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose NEPA plus 12 mg of dexamethasone (DEX) in patients treated with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab and Folfirinox. The patients were diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They were divided into two groups: naïve patients and patients previously treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (5HT3-RA) and neurokin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RA). RESULTS During the overall phase, the complete response (CR) rate was 96.8% in naïve patients treated with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab, and 94.6% in patients treated with Folfirinox. During the acute and delayed phases, the CR rate was 92.8% and 94.2%, with Folfoxiri and Bevacizumab, as well as 96.2% and 94.6%, with Folfirinox. There was no adequate control of CINV events in patients on antiemetic prophylaxis with 5HT3-RA or NK1-RA associated with cortisone. During the overall phase, the CR rate was 74.6% with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab and 75.8% with Folfirinox. During the acute and delayed phases, the CR rate was 72.5% and 74.8% with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab, as well as 75.2% and 74.6% with Folfirinox. CONCLUSIONS This study has shown the therapeutic benefits of NEPA in the management and prophylaxis of CINV events, both in naive patients and patients previously treated with 5HT3-RA and NK1-RA. In addition, NEPA has been shown to be safe, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","De Luca, R; Volpe, C; Mistretta, O; Paci, R; Ferrera, G; Caputo, V; Rosati, G; Cicero, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34486707/; https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202108_26552,13

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was conducted for all eligible studies range from inception to February 29, 2020. Studies with control group were included. Treatment group received convalescent plasma therapy, and control group may receive any therapy other than convalescent plasma therapy. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for categorical and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients from 13 studies were included, and seven studies were prospectively designed. Pooled analysis indicated convalescent plasma treatment significantly reduced the mortality by 51% (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.67). Subgroup analyses by publication time, study design, and influenza A revealed similar results. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were stable. In addition, convalescent plasma therapy reduced mechanical ventilation requirement (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59), while it was not associated with less use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.83 to 4.83) and shorter length of hospital stay (MD: −2.20, 95% CI: −4.98 to 0.57 days). Pooled estimates showed there was no difference in serious adverse effects between the convalescent plasma treatment and control groups (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma therapy significantly reduced the mortality and mechanical ventilation requirements of patients with virus-induced severe acute respiratory infections, without serious adverse effects.

645041,Amino Terminal Region of Dengue Virus NS4A Cytosolic Domain Binds to Highly Curved Liposomes,2015-07-21,"Our endocrinology practice needed to protect its highest-risk patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we needed to identify these patients and develop a protocol to keep them out of the hospital (to limit risk of infection and conserve medical resources), and do so without in-person visits. So we used our peer-reviewed software, Diabetes Reporting, to identify 87 patients whose glucose management indicator (GMI) scores were over 9%. The GMI is a method for estimating the laboratory A1C using the patient's actual blood glucose measurements over the past 90 days. A GMI (or A1C) over 9% indicates a heightened risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and, possibly, a slightly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH), the two most common acute complications leading patients with T1D to be hospitalized. We contacted these 87 at-risk patients and enrolled them in a quality improvement project. This project consisted of additional online meetings with their doctors as well as weekly reports generated by Diabetes Reporting for three months, between March 28, 2020 and June 28, 2020. We hypothesized that this heightened communication would reduce the incidence of DKA and SH among the participants by reducing their GMI. As a comparison group, we used data from the T1D Exchange, which showed that, among patients with an A1C over 9%, 6.7% were hospitalized for DKA and 7% experienced SH leading to loss of consciousness in a three-month period. This led us to predict 6 incidences of DKA and 6 incidences of SH among our 87 participants during the three-month period. Instead, we saw 2 incidences of DKA and 1 incidence of SH. Moreover, the mean GMI of our participants dropped from 9.91% to 9.25%, a clinically-significant .66% improvement, which supports the conclusion that our protocol helped avoid acute complications among a cohort of at-risk patients with T1D by improving glycemic control during a time when we were limited to largely online care. This telemedicine protocol merits further research for its potential to improve and lower costs of care for patients with T1D, particularly for those at higher risk for acute complications.","Zeller, William P.; DeGraff, Rachel; Zeller, William",J Clin Transl Endocrinol Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecr.2021.100078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214624521000010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214624521000010?v=s5,13

Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on treating the infected, identifying those at risk and preventing spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that predicts the risk of infection. Several studies emerged suggesting an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection, as well as susceptibility to severe ICU-requiring infection. We found a higher risk associated with blood group B, and a lower risk with blood group AB. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). No association between antibodies and both risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection was found.

In the current article, we try to elucidate various causes behind COVID-19 infection and mortality following COVID-19 vaccination and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘Pandemics’, ‘Vaccines’, ‘Mortality’, ‘deaths’, ‘infections’, and ‘India’ on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate in from January to May 2021. Epidemiology, risk factors, Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination were assessed. RESULTS: A number of factors have been associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection reported after vaccination. A high viral load, comorbidities, mutant strains, Variants of Concern (VOC) leading to Vaccine escape and casual attitude towards COVID Appropriate Behaviors appear to be the most important factors for infection and deaths after COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 Infection and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination are of great concern. Application of COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) before and after vaccination is essential for the population. Effective Vaccines against mutant strains and enhanced vaccination drive are key strategies to avoid this quintessential threat.

645339,Identification of coronaviruses in dogs that segregate separately from the canine coronavirus genotype,2002-12-11,"Circadian clocks control immunity and virus replication, as well as pharmacokinetics and efficacy therapeutics. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of these relationships by measuring circadian gene expression in primary human-derived dermal fibroblast cultures (HDF) after remdesivir exposure. In the current study, we analysed circadian gene expression in a cohort of participants without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis. After ex vivo exposure to remdesivir to human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cultures and dexamethasone synchronization, the rhythmicity of circadian gene expression (Clock, Bmal1, Per1-3, Cry1) was analysed via qRT-PCR. In this study, D-MEQ scores indicated that participants without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis had no evening preference. Remdesivir leads to a slight phase-shift in Clock, Per1 and Per2. Significant different expressions of Bmal1 and Per3 were detected after remdesivir exposure: Bmal1 at ZT8 (t(22) = 3.26, p = 0.004), ZT24 (t(22) = − 2.66, p = 0.015), ZT28 (t(20) = − 2.14, p = 0.045) and Per3 at ZT8 (t(22) = − 4.27, p < 0.001) and ZT12 (t(22) = − 2.61, p = 0.016). A significant difference between chronotype and circadian gene expression for Bmal1, Cry1 and Per3 was observed. The present study shows that remdesivir has an impact on circadian function. It is well known that the circadian rhythm effects sleep and, moreover, sleep quality. The results suggest that remdesivir medication may alter sleep quality in participants without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis and shifts chronotype to eveningness; similar as prevalent in ADHD.","Faltraco, Frank; Palm, Denise; Coogan, Andrew; Uzoni, Adriana; Duwe, Isabell; Simon, Frederick; Tucha, Oliver; Thome, Johannes",J Neural Transm (Vienna),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273024/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-021-02375-3,13

The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is considered to be the standard for DENV detection and quantification due to its high sensitivity. However, qRT-PCR offers only quantification relative to a standard curve and consists of several “in-house” components resulting in interlaboratory variations. We developed and optimized a protocol for applying one-step RT-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) for DENV detection and quantification. The lower limit of detection (LLOD95) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for RT-ddPCR were estimated to be 1.851 log10-copies/reaction and 2.337 log10-copies/reaction, respectively. The sensitivity of RT-ddPCR was found to be superior to qRT-PCR (94.87% vs. 90.38%, p = 0.039) while no false positives were detected. Quantification of DENV in clinical samples was independently performed in three laboratories showing interlaboratory variations with biases <0.5 log10-copies/mL.

Recent case incidence in Ontario, Canada (autumn 2020) has outstripped incidence in seen during the first (spring) pandemic wave; but has been associated with a lower incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths. We hypothesized that differential ICU burden might be explained by increased testing volumes, as well as the shift in mean case age from older to younger. We constructed a negative binomial regression model using only three covariates, at a 2-week lag: log10(weekly cases); log10(weekly deaths); and mean weekly case age. This model reproduced observed ICU admission volumes, and demonstrated good preliminary predictive validity. Furthermore, when admissions were used in combination with ICU length of stay, our modeled estimates demonstrated excellent convergent validity with ICU occupancy data reported by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Our approach needs external validation in other settings and at larger and smaller geographic scales, but appears to be a useful short-term forecasting tool for ICU resource demand; we also demonstrate that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not meaningfully changed in Ontario between the first and second waves, but the demographics of those infected, and the fraction of cases identified, have.","Fisman, D.; Tuite, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.16.20231399v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.20231399,13

Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and there is still an ongoing debate on whether COVID-19 ARDS and its perfusion defect differs from ARDS induced by other causes. Beside pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 β [IL-1β] or IL-6), several main pathological phenomena have been seen because of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction: hypercoagulation reflected by fibrin degradation products called D-dimers, micro- and macrothrombosis and pathological angiogenesis. Direct endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to occur and ACE-2 expression by EC is a matter of debate. Indeed, endothelial damage reported in severely ill patients with COVID-19 could be more likely secondary to infection of neighboring cells and/or a consequence of inflammation. Endotheliopathy could give rise to hypercoagulation by alteration in the levels of different factors such as von Willebrand factor. Other than thrombotic events, pathological angiogenesis is among the recent findings. Overexpression of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) or placental growth factors (PlGF) have been found in plasma or lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an emergency myelopoiesis associated to deregulated immunity and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells, leading to features of acquired hematological malignancies or cardiovascular disease, which are discussed in this review. Altogether, this review will try to elucidate the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications, pathological angiogenesis and EC dysfunction, allowing better insight in new targets and antithrombotic protocols to better address vascular system dysfunction.

As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2.","Yamayoshi, Seiya; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Koga, Michiko; Akasaka, Osamu; Nakachi, Ichiro; Koh, Hidefumi; Maeda, Kenji; Adachi, Eisuke; Saito, Makoto; Nagai, Hiroyuki; Ikeuchi, Kazuhiko; Ogura, Takayuki; Baba, Rie; Fujita, Kensuke; Fukui, Takahiro; Ito, Fumimaro; Hattori, Shin-ichiro; Yamamoto, Kei; Nakamoto, Takato; Furusawa, Yuri; Yasuhara, Atsuhiro; Ujie, Michiko; Yamada, Shinya; Ito, Mutsumi; Mitsuya, Hiroaki; Omagari, Norio; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Imai, Masaki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322035/,13

647543,Class II Fusion Proteins,2013-07-10,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 is a novel threat to patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), whose life expectancy and quality (QoL) are impaired by an increased risk of infections and stress-triggered adrenal crises (AC). If infected, AI patients require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL. METHODS: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55 ± 17 years) completed telematically three questionnaires: the purpose-built “CORTI-COVID”, assessing medical history and concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. RESULTS: COVID-19 occurred in one (0·8% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, mainly depending on “personal health” in primary AI (ρ = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and “economy” in secondary AI (ρ = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients’ QoL. CONCLUSION: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel “CORTI-COVID” questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL.

The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a substrain of high replicative advantage in relation to the remaining VOC substrains. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary). These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.","Grabowski, Frederic; Preibisch, Grzegorz; Gizinski, Stanislaw; Kochanczyk, Marek; Lipniacki, Tomasz",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248906; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248906v1?rss=1,13

We analyzed proportions of clinical spectrum of COVID-19, factors associated with risk of severe COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality. Results Of 2617 patients, three-quarter of the quarantined (N = 1935; 74%) appeared asymptomatic, and only 114 (4.4%) presented with severe COVID-19. Common characteristics among the 682 symptomatics were cough (N = 354; 50.6%), myalgia (N = 212; 31.1%), head ache (N = 196; 28.7%), fever (N = 161; 23.6%), dyspnea (N = 111; 16.3%), anosmia and/or dysgeusia (N = 90; 13.2%), sore throat (N = 87; 12.8%) and chest pain (N = 77; 11.3%). Factors associated with severe COVID-19 were older age [adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.78, 95% CI 1.61 to 1.97; p < 0.0001], diabetes (aRR 2.00, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.32; p = 0.007), cardiovascular diseases (aRR 2.53, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.17; p < 0.0001), malignancy (aRR 4.57, 95% CI 1.62 to 12.87; p = 0.004), surgery/trauma (aRR 23.98, 95% CI 10.35 to 55.57; p < 0.0001), and infection with HIV-1 (aRR 4.24, 95% CI 1.55 to 11.61; p = 005). Factors associated with risk of in-hospital mortality included older age (aRR 2.37, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.95; p < 0.001), malignancy (aRR 6.73, 95% CI 1.50 to 30.16; p = 0.013) and surgery/trauma (aRR 59.52, 95% CI 12.90 to 274.68; p < 0.0001).

649836,Broad-spectrum activity of 8-chloro-7-deazaguanosine against RNA virus infections in mice and rats,1995-03-31,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health issue worldwide and the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been reported previously that HBV invasion can extensively alter transcriptome, the proteome of exosomes and host cell lipid rafts. The impact of HBV on host proteins through regulating their global post-translational modifications (PTMs), however, is not well studied. Viruses have been reported to exploit cellular processes by enhancing or inhibiting the ubiquitination of specific substrates. Nevertheless, host cell physiology in terms of global proteome and ubiquitylome has not been addressed yet. Here by using HBV-integrated HepG2.2.15 model cell line we first report that HBV significantly modify the host global ubiquitylome. As currently the most widely used HBV cell culture model, HepG2.2.15 can be cultivated for multiple generations for protein labeling, and can replicate HBV, express HBV proteins and secrete complete HBV Dane particles, which makes it a suitable cell line for ubiquitylome analysis to study HBV replication, hepatocyte immune response and HBV-related HCC progression. Our previous experimental results showed that the total ubiquitination level of HepG2.2.15 cell line was significantly higher than that of the corresponding parental HepG2 cell line. By performing a Ubiscan quantification analysis based on stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cell lines, we identified a total of 7188 proteins and the protein levels of nearly 19% of them were changed over 2-folds. We further identified 3798 ubiquitinated Lys sites in 1476 host proteins with altered ubiquitination in response to HBV. Our results also showed that the global proteome and ubiquitylome were negatively correlated, indicating that ubiquitination might be involved in the degradation of host proteins upon HBV integration. We first demonstrated the ubiquitination change of VAMP3, VAMP8, DNAJB6, RAB8A, LYN, VDAC2, OTULIN, SLC1A4, SLC1A5, HGS and TOLLIP. In addition, we described 5 novel host factors SLC1A4, SLC1A5, EIF4A1, TOLLIP and BRCC36 that efficiently reduced the amounts of secreted HBsAg and HBeAg. Overall, the HBV-mediated host proteome and ubiquitylome change we reported will provide a valuable resource for further investigation of HBV pathogenesis and host-virus interaction networks.

The objective of this study is to assess the students' anxiety levels. The method we used was a cross-section of the university students in Sudan using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique to assess their anxiety level using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) during the COVID-19 pandemic through an online self-administered questionnaire. Results indicated that of the 478 participants, 75.1% had a low anxiety level, 15.5% had a moderate anxiety level and 9.4% had a potentially concerning level of anxiety. Experiencing no symptoms during the past 14 days was associated with a low level of anxiety. Moreover, experiencing fever, sore throat, and myalgia or fatigue were associated with low to moderate anxiety levels among the participants. While having a relative or a friend diagnosed or suspected with the disease or having headache were associated with a low anxiety level, Thus the conclusion was that not complying with the curfew measures, and the preventive etiquette of covering mouth while coughing or sneezing were associated with potentially concerning levels of anxiety while experiencing fever, sore throat and myalgia were associated with moderate anxiety levels.

Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive treatment potentially increasing the risk of secondary hospital acquired infections in critically ill patients. We conducted an observational retrospective study in three French intensive care units (ICUs) comparing the first and second waves of pandemic to investigate the role of dexamethasone in the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and blood stream infections (BSI). Patients admitted from March to November 2020 with a documented COVID-19 and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥ 48 h were included. The main study outcomes were the incidence of VAP and BSI according to the use of dexamethasone. Secondary outcomes were the ventilator-free days (VFD) at day-28 and day-60, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 151 patients included, 84 received dexamethasone, all but one during the second wave. VAP occurred in 63% of patients treated with dexamethasone (DEXA+) and 57% in those not receiving dexamethasone (DEXA−) (p = 0.43). The cumulative incidence of VAP, considering death, duration of MV and late immunosuppression as competing factors was not different between groups (p = 0.59). A multivariate analysis did not identify dexamethasone as an independent risk factor for VAP occurrence. The occurrence of BSI was not different between groups (29 vs. 30%; p = 0.86). DEXA+ patients had more VFD at day-28 (9 (0–21) vs. 0 (0–11) days; p = 0.009) and a reduced ICU length of stay (20 (11–44) vs. 32 (17–46) days; p = 0.01). Mortality did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive MV, dexamethasone was not associated with an increased incidence of VAP or BSI. Dexamethasone might not explain the high rates of VAP and BSI observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The developmental stage and corolla dehiscence of the flower are the important factors affecting the quality of medicinal ingredients. However, neither the regulatory mechanism controlling chlorogenic acids biosynthesis in L. macranthoides nor the molecular basis of effect of corolla dehiscence on the quality of medicinal materials is fully understood. In this study, metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze the metabolic and transcriptional differences of two different cultivars closed bud type (Bt), and flowering type (Ft), as well as the effect of jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) on chlorogenic acids (CGAs) biosynthesis. In total, large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were filtered among three lines of samples. Gene metabolite correlation analyses revealed a ‘core set’ of 30 genes and 54 genes that were strongly correlated with CGAs biosynthesis and regulating the flowering, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results proved the alterations in the expression levels of genes encoding the pathways involved in CGAs biosynthesis. The ion abundances of CGAs were most significantly increased, while some of the CGAs derived and Caffeoyl-CoA-derived substances showed the most largely reduced abundances in the closed bud type (Bt) compared to the flowering type (Ft). MeJA may leads to the activation of downstream genes in CGAs biosynthesis pathway. Overall, there were significant differences in the transcriptional and metabolic levels of CGAs biosynthesis pathway in flower buds of different flowering cultivars. The redirection of metabolic flux may contribute to increased accumulation of CGAs. However, whether MeJA and flowering have direct effects on the accumulation of CGAs needs further studied. These researches effectively expanded the functional genomic library and provide new insights into CGAs biosynthesis in L. macranthoides.","Pan, Yuan; Zhao, Xiao; Wu, Xiao-li; Wang, Yu; Tan, Jun; Chen, Da-xia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038434/,13

In this sense, the aim of the study was to gather evidence on the factor structure, criterion-related validity, and reliability of the Spanish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in this population. The participants were 400 older adults (mean age = 68.04, SD = 6.41), who were administered the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Revised Mental Health Inventory-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 items, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 items. Structural equation models were estimated, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), bifactor CFA, and structural models with latent variables (SEM). Internal consistency was estimated with composite reliability indexes (CRI) and omega coefficients. A bifactor model with both a general factor underlying all items plus a specific factor underlying items 1, 2, 4, and 5 representing the emotional response to COVID better represents the factor structure of the scale. This structure had adequate fit and good reliability, and additionally fear of COVID had a large effect on mental health. In general, women had more fear than men, having more information on COVID was associated to more fear, while having family or friends affected by COVID did not related to fear of the virus.

653013,Plant lectins are potent inhibitors of coronaviruses by interfering with two targets in the viral replication cycle,2007-03-30,"Diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infections use traditionally either nasopharyngeal washes or swabs. Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is used rarely for viral testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum using a multiplex real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Adults who were admitted or presented to the clinics of Gil Medical Center with acute respiratory symptoms were recruited from 1 November 2012 to 31 March 2013. Paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained from 154 subjects, and RNA was extracted and tested for 16 different respiratory viruses using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The positive rate was 53% (81/154) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 68% (105/154) for sputum (P < 0.001). One hundred thirty‐four viruses were identified for 107 illnesses. Influenza A virus, RSV A, HRV, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus were detected more frequently in sputum samples than in nasopharyngeal swabs (P < 0.001). Importantly, 12 of 44 (27%) influenza A infections and 11 of 27 (41%) RSV infections were positive in only sputum samples. The detection rates of respiratory viruses from sputum samples were significantly higher than those from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults using real‐time multiplex RT‐PCR.

It is tried in current study to evaluate impacts of type 2 diabetes, with and without other comorbidities, on the clinical, para-clinical, and outcome parameters among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A case series was applied, which involved 406 COVID-19 patients admitted in the city of Shiraz, south-central Iran, from February 20 to April 29, 2020. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory finding, chest computed tomography (CT) scan reports, and clinical outcomes of patients with and without type 2 diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Results of the above-mentioned comparison showed that comorbidities such as HTN (35.5% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.001) and CVDs (26.2% vs. 13.4%, P = 0.002) were significantly more prevalent among the diabetic patients. Also, there was not any considerable difference between the chest CT severity parameters of both groups. After excluding all of the comorbidities except diabetes, it was found that the diabetic COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities had lower oxygen saturation level (P < 0.001), higher AST level (P = 0.037), higher BUN (P = 0.005), higher WBC counts (P = 0.025), lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.029), and longer ICU admission duration (0.72 ± 2.83 vs. 1.71 ± 4.68, P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The diabetic COVID patients are at higher risks of hypoxemia, longer ICU stays, and more renal and hepatic dysfunction. These achievements could be useful in order to prevent the deterioration of clinical conditions among diabetic COVID-19 patients; also, they have to be considered in the management strategies.","Estedlal, AliReza; Jeddi, Marjan; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Jahromi, Mehdi Ghaderian; Dabbaghmanesh, Mohammad Hossein",J Diabetes Metab Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277497/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-021-00844-w,13

Moreover, health systems in Saudi Arabia are offering free testing for residents whether Saudi and non-Saudi. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 associated with preventive measures taken in Saudi Arabia and to develop a detailed COVID-19 prevention strategy as a framework for the Saudi Arabia community. Methodology: Population size and age distributions among the country of Saudi Arabia were taken from the 2020 World Population Prospects. Contact patterns were measured using the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health Statistical Annual Report. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that performing screening tests as early as possible to facilitate the rapid detection of infected cases, fast treatment, and instant isolation for suspected cases is the most definitive rejoinder for public health. Moreover, our study revealed the significance of performing preventive measures in reducing infection and death rates around Saudi Arabia by 27%, while in other countries, it reduced the death rate ranging from 10–73%.

Whether COVID-19 vaccination may be linked to the occurrence of myocarditis is unknown. Objective: To describe a group of 7 patients with acute myocarditis over 3 months, 4 of whom had recent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: All patients referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at Duke University Medical Center were asked to participate in a prospective outcomes registry. Two searches of the registry database were performed: first, to identify patients with acute myocarditis for the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30 for 2017 through 2021, and second, to identify all patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis for the past 20 years. Once patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis were identified, data available in the registry were supplemented by additional data collection from the electronic health record and a telephone interview. Exposures: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Occurrence of acute myocarditis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Results: In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, 7 patients with acute myocarditis were identified, of which 4 occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]). All presented with severe chest pain, had biomarker evidence of myocardial injury, and were hospitalized. Coincident testing for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses provided no alternative explanation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were typical for myocarditis, including regional dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement, and elevated native T1 and T2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, magnetic resonance imaging findings were found to be consistent with acute myocarditis in 7 patients; 4 of whom had preceding COVID-19 vaccination.

Aims To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications, using electronic health records data, in a geographically defined population in London. Method Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6,309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time on the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and SLAM service use. Results Of 6,309 patients, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95% CI 1.14 - 2.72).

Exposure to arsenic leads to alterations of the cellular machinery and eventually cell death, depending on the dose and duration of exposure. Oxidative stress induced by arsenic is the major mechanism by which it inflicts cellular toxicity, challenging the survival-support - autophagy and culminating in apoptosis in the thymus and spleen of mice. Curcumin, a potent dietary anti-oxidant with known anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, was assessed for therapeutic benefits. However, the major caveat of this polyphenol is its low water solubility and limited bioavailability. Therefore, Self Nano-Emulsifying Curcumin (SNEC30) was used to treat mice exposed to arsenic. When administered, SNEC30 effectively ameliorated the adverse effects of arsenic in mice, by restoring structural alterations and reducing ROS-mediated cell death, thereby endorsing the importance of nutraceuticals in counteracting heavy metal-induced cellular toxicity.","Jamal, Zarqua; Das, Joydeep; Gupta, Payal; Dhar, Pubali; Chattopadhyay, Sreya; Chatterji, Urmi",Toxicol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354930/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.07.010,13

PEDV is associated with the most severe pathogenesis in one-week-old piglets, with mortality rates reaching 100%. A PEDV strain was isolated from the intestinal tract of diarrheic piglets from a pig farm in Jiangsu Province in March 2016, termed the JS201603 isolate. The isolated virus was confirmed to be PEDV via RT-PCR, electron microscopy, a cytopathic effect assay and sequence analysis. The S and ORF3 genes of the JS201603 isolate were sequenced, revealing that the S gene was associated with a 15-base insertion at 167 nt, 176 - 186 nt, and 427 - 429 nt, as well as a six-base deletion in 487 - 492 nt, indicating that it was a current epidemic variant compared with the classical strain, CV777. No deletion occurred between 245 - 293 nt of the ORF3 gene in the JS201603 isolate compared with the vaccine isolates YY2013 and SQ2014. An experimental infection model indicated that the piglets in the challenge group successively developed diarrhea, exhibiting yellow-colored loose stools with a foul odor. The piglets in the JS201603 isolate challenge group displayed reduced food consumption, lost weight, and in severe cases even died. No abnormalities were observed in the control group. The JS201603 variant isolated in this study contributes to the evolutionary analysis of diarrhea virus. The experimental infection model has established a foundation for further studies on vaccine development.","Zhang, Hewei; Xia, Mingqi; Ju, Decai; Wu, Bai; Ning, Chen; Song, Ni; Feng, Teng; Chen, Feng; Wang, Xin; Wu, Ying; Wang, Wei; Cheng, Shipeng; Jin, Wenjie; Zhang, Shucheng; Zhang, Chunjie; Cheng, Xiangchao; Ding, Ke; Wu, Hua",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3518-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803371/,13

Patients and Methods Data from 82,253 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data (measured 2013-2015), complete covariate data, and linked COVID-19 data from 16th March 2020 to 16th March 2021 were included. Two outcomes were investigated: severe COVID-19 (positive test from in-hospital setting or COVID-19 as primary cause of death); non-severe COVID-19 (positive test from community setting). Logistic regressions were used to assess associations with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total activity, and the intensity gradient. A higher intensity gradient indicates a higher proportion of vigorous activity. Results Average MVPA was 48.1 (32.7) minutes/day. Physical activity was associated with lower odds of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR per SD increase: MVPA 0.75[95% CI, 0.67,0.85]; total 0.83[0.74,0.92]; intensity 0.77[0.70,0.86]), with stronger associations in women (MVPA 0.63[0.52,0.77]; total 0.76[0.64,0.90]; intensity 0.63[0.53,0.74]) than men (MVPA (0.84[0.73,0.97]; total 0.88[0.77,1.01]; intensity 0.88 [0.77,1.00]). In contrast, when mutually adjusted, total activity was associated with higher odds of a non-severe infection (1.10[1.04,1.16]), while the intensity gradient was associated with lower odds (0.91[0.86,0.97]). Conclusion Odds of severe-COVID-19 were ∼25% lower per SD (∼30 minutes/day) MVPA. A greater proportion of vigorous activity was associated with lower odds of severe and non-severe infections. The association between total activity and higher odds of a non-severe infection may be through greater community engagement, thus more exposure to the virus.

655068,A novel pyrosequencing assay for the detection of neuraminidase inhibitor resistance-conferring mutations among clinical isolates of avian H7N9 influenza virus,2014-01-22,"The role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in biology is often recognized during pathogenesis associated with PMN hyper- or hypo-functionality in various disease states. However, in the vast majority of cases, PMNs contribute to resilience and tissue homeostasis, with continuous PMN-mediated actions required for the maintenance of health, particularly in mucosal tissues. PMNs are extraordinarily well-adapted to respond to and diminish the damaging effects of a vast repertoire of infectious agents and injurious processes that are encountered throughout life. The commensal biofilm, a symbiotic polymicrobial ecosystem that lines the mucosal surfaces, is the first line of defense against pathogenic strains that might otherwise dominate, and is therefore of critical importance for health. PMNs regularly interact with the commensal flora at the mucosal tissues in health and limit their growth without developing an overt inflammatory reaction to them. These PMNs exhibit what is called a para-inflammatory phenotype, and have reduced inflammatory output. When biofilm growth and makeup are disrupted (i.e., dysbiosis), clinical symptoms associated with acute and chronic inflammatory responses to these changes may include pain, erythema and swelling. However, in most cases, these responses indicate that the immune system is functioning properly to re-establish homeostasis and protect the status quo. Defects in this healthy everyday function occur as a result of PMN subversion by pathological microbial strains, genetic defects or crosstalk with other chronic inflammatory conditions, including cancer and rheumatic disease, and this can provide some avenues for therapeutic targeting of PMN function. In other cases, targeting PMN functions could worsen the disease state. Certain PMN-mediated responses to pathogens, for example Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), might lead to undesirable symptoms such as pain or swelling and tissue damage/fibrosis. Despite collateral damage, these PMN responses limit pathogen dissemination and more severe damage that would otherwise occur. New data suggests the existence of unique PMN subsets, commonly associated with functional diversification in response to particular inflammatory challenges. PMN-directed therapeutic approaches depend on a greater understanding of this diversity. Here we outline the current understanding of PMNs in health and disease, with an emphasis on the positive manifestations of tissue and organ-protective PMN-mediated inflammation.","Fine, Noah; Tasevski, Nikola; McCulloch, Christopher A.; Tenenbaum, Howard C.; Glogauer, Michael",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.571085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072112/,13

A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. We demonstrate biochemically that NSP1 inhibits translation of model human and SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). NSP1 specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1–40S subunit binding in real time, we determine that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) allosterically modulate the interaction of NSP1 with ribosomal preinitiation complexes in the absence of mRNA. We further elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 proteins from viruses in at least two subgenera of beta-CoVs associate with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.","Lapointe, Christopher P.; Grosely, Rosslyn; Johnson, Alex G.; Wang, Jinfan; Fernández, Israel S.; Puglisi, Joseph D.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017715118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479166/,13

Yet, contact tracing measures face substantive challenges in practice and well-identified evidence about their effectiveness remains scarce. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in COVID-19 contact tracing. Between September 25 and October 2, 2020, a total of 15,841 COVID-19 cases in England (around 15 to 20% of all cases) were not immediately referred to the contact tracing system due to a data processing error. Case information had been truncated from an Excel spreadsheet due to a row limit, which was discovered on October 3. There is substantial variation in the degree to which different parts of England areas were exposed - by chance - to delayed referrals of COVID-19 cases to to the contact tracing system. We show that more affected areas subsequently experienced a drastic rise in new COVID-19 infections and deaths alongside an increase in the positivity rate and the number of test performed, as well as a decline in the performance of the contact tracing system. Conservative estimates suggest that the failure of timely contact tracing due to the data glitch is associated with more than 125,000 additional infections and over 1,500 additional COVID-19-related deaths.

655927,Aerosolized avian influenza virus by laboratory manipulations,2012-08-06,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe pathology of the lower respiratory tract in infants, immunocompromised people, and elderly. Despite decades of research, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV, and many therapeutic drugs are still under development. Detailed understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV infection pathology can accelerate the development of efficacious treatment. Current studies on the RSV pathogenesis are based on the analysis of biopsies from the infected patients; however deeper understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV pathology could be achieved using animal models. Mice are the most often used model for RSV infection because they exhibit manifestations similar to those observed in humans (bronchial obstruction, mucous hypersecretion, and pulmonary inflammation mediated by lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils). Additionally, the use of mice is economically feasible, and many molecular tools are available for studying RSV infection pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. This review summarizes new data on the pathogenesis of RSV infection obtained in mouse models, which demonstrated the role of T cells in both the antiviral defense and the development of lung immunopathology. T cells not only eliminate the infected cells, but also produce significant amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IFNγ. Recently, a new subset of tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM)) was identified that provide a strong antiviral defense without induction of lung immunopathology. These cells accumulate in the lungs after local rather than systemic administration of RSV antigens, which suggests new approaches to vaccination. The studies in mouse models have revealed a minor role of interferons in the anti-RSV protection, as RSV possesses mechanisms to escape the antiviral action of type I and III interferons, which may explain the low efficacy of interferon-containing drugs. Using knockout mice, a significant breakthrough has been achieved in understanding the role of many pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung immunopathology. It was found that in addition to TNFα and IFNγ, the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-33, and TSLP mediate the major manifestations of the RSV pathogenesis, such as bronchial obstruction, mucus hyperproduction, and lung infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells, while IL-6, IL-10, and IL-27 exhibit the anti-inflammatory effect. Despite significant differences between the mouse and human immune systems, mouse models have made a significant contribution to the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the pathology of human RSV infection.","Shilovskiy, Igor P.; Yumashev, Kirill V.; Nikolsky, Alexandr A.; Vishnyakova, Liudmila I.; Khaitov, Musa R.",Biochemistry (Mosc),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838630/; https://doi.org/10.1134/s0006297921030068,13

Furthermore, significant economic losses can result from this disease due to high mortality rates, high medical costs, and low weight gain. To avoid a fatal outcome of the disease, it is crucial that vulnerable calves are identified as early as possible. Interleukin-6 is described as an early and reliable prognostic marker in several diseases. In this study, 20 scouring calves were tested by ELISA for their IL-6 serum concentrations. Samples were collected twice, at the beginning of diarrhea and 7 to 10 d later. Regarding the clinical outcome after 7 to 10 d, calves were classified as recovered or nonrecovered. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to determine the prognostic value of IL-6 for the progress of clinical symptoms. At the beginning of diarrhea, the IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in nonrecovering calves compared with those that recover 7 to 10 d after the onset of diarrhea. Interleukin-6 proved to be a useful additional parameter in the clinical examination. High initial IL-6 values can support the decision for closer monitoring and an adapted therapeutic strategy for the respective calves. This may help to prevent unnecessary animal suffering and reduce economic losses.","Fischer, Stephani; Bauerfeind, Rolf; Czerny, Claus-Peter; Neumann, Stephan",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-10740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216302776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27209135/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030216302776,13

Factors associated with emergency department (ED) visits during the pandemic among especially high-risk individuals are unknown. We used a ""Big Events"" approach, which considers major disruptions that create social instability, to investigate ED use in people experiencing homelessness or housing instability, many of whom use drugs. METHODS Between July and December 2020, we conducted a community-based San Francisco study to compare homeless and unstably housed (HUH) women who did and did not use an ED during the first 10 months of the pandemic. RESULTS Among 128 study participants, 34% had ≥1 ED visit during the pandemic. In adjusted analysis, factors significantly associated with ED use included experiencing homelessness, cocaine use and increased difficulties receiving drug use treatment during the pandemic. CONCLUSION These findings build on the ""Big Events"" approach to considering risk pathways among people who use drugs. They suggest the importance of ensuring access to housing and low-barrier non-COVID health services, including drug treatment, alongside crisis management activities, to reduce the health impacts of public health crises.","Riley, Elise D; Raven, Maria C; Dilworth, Samantha E; Braun, Carl; Imbert, Elizabeth; Doran, Kelly M",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403865/,13

Preventing in-hospital infections is crucial to protect patients and hospital staff. Methods: At the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Heart Center initiated obligatory wearing of surgical face masks for patients and employees, SARS-CoV-2 screening for all patients, and symptom-based testing for employees. In addition, access restriction, closure of outpatient departments, and postponing non-urgent procedures were implemented with community-initiated regulations. Results: During the observation period (03/16/2020–04/27/2020), 1,128 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed in 983 persons (1.1 tests/person; 589 in patients and 394 in hospital employees). Up to 60% of the clinical workforce was tested based on symptoms and risk (62.5% symptoms, 19.3% direct or indirect contact to known COVID-19, 4.5% returnee from risk area, 13.7% without specific reason). Patient testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obligatory (100% tested). The overall prevalence of positive tests during the observation period was 0.4% (n = 5 out of 1,128 tests performed). The incidence of new infections with SARS-CoV-2 was 0.5% (n = 5 out of 983 individuals; three healthcare workers, two patients). No nosocominal infections occurred, despite a mean number of 14.8 in-hospital contacts.

Statins, prescribed primarily for lipid reduction, are known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and have been associated with a reduced mortality rate among COVID-19 patients taking statins as reported in two recent retrospective studies. However, a meta-analysis that included nine studies showed that statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of those with COVID-19. In addition, concerns regarding the use of statins and an increase in COVID-19 infections have been raised, as statins may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our goal was to investigate the effect of statins in COVID-19 patients in a large, diverse patient population across the United States containing nearly 120,000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We used propensity score matching of demographics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare statin-treated patients (N = 2,297) with matched controls (N = 4,594). We observed a small, but statistically significant, decrease in mortality among patients prescribed statins (16.1%) when compared with matched COVID-19-positive controls (18.0 to 20.6%). These results support previous evidence that statins do not increase COVID-19-related mortality and may, in fact, have a mitigating effect on severity of the disease reflected in a slight reduction in mortality. Mixed findings on effects of statins in COVID-19 patients reported in the literature should prompt prospective randomized controlled trials in order to define better who might be advantaged with respect to clinical outcomes.","Marić, Ivana; Oskotsky, Tomiko; Kosti, Idit; Le, Brian; Wong, Ronald J.; Shaw, Gary M.; Sirota, Marina; Stevenson, David K.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.639804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614688/,13

661994,Forecasting the timeframe of coronavirus and human cells interaction with reverse engineering,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory responses play a multiphase role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic stroke (IS). Ruxolitinib (Rux), a selective oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor, reduces inflammatory responses via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Based on its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, we hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate whether inhibition of JAK2 has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Rux, MCC950 or vehicle was applied to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice in vivo and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in vitro. After 3 days of reperfusion, neurological deficit scores, infarct volume and brain water content were assessed. Immunofluorescence staining and western blots were used to measure the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. The infiltrating cells were investigated by flow cytometry. Proinflammatory cytokines were assessed by RT-qPCR. The expression of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was measured by western blots. Local STAT3 deficiency in brain tissue was established with a lentiviral vector carrying STAT3 shRNA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to investigate the interplay between NLRP3 and STAT3 signaling. RESULTS: Rux treatment improved neurological scores, decreased the infarct size and ameliorated cerebral edema 3 days after stroke. In addition, immunofluorescence staining and western blots showed that Rux application inhibited the expression of proteins related to the NLRP3 inflammasome and phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3) in neurons and microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, Rux administration inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, HMGB1, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-6, suggesting that Rux may alleviate IS injury by inhibiting proinflammatory reactions via JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway regulation. Infiltrating macrophages, B, T, cells were also reduced by Rux. Local STAT3 deficiency in brain tissue decreased histone H3 and H4 acetylation on the NLRP3 promoter and NLRP3 inflammasome component expression, indicating that the NLRP3 inflammasome may be directly regulated by STAT3 signaling. Rux application suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome secretion and JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation in the OGD/R model in vitro. CONCLUSION: JAK2 inhibition by Rux in MCAO mice decreased STAT3 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting the expression of downstream proinflammatory cytokines and the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on the NLRP3 promoter, resulting in the downregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome expression.","Zhu, Hua; Jian, Zhihong; Zhong, Yi; Ye, Yingze; Zhang, Yonggang; Hu, Xinyao; Pu, Bei; Gu, Lijuan; Xiong, Xiaoxing",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.714943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367186/,13

Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","Hu, Zhiliang; Song, Ci; Xu, Chuanjun; Jin, Guangfu; Chen, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Ma, Hongxia; Chen, Wei; Lin, Yuan; Zheng, Yishan; Wang, Jianming; hu, zhibin; Yi, Yongxiang; Shen, Hongbing",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619,13

The COVID-19 oral mucocutaneous complications require multidisciplinary management and research for their pathophysiological course and epidemiological significance; therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of the critically ill COVID-19 patients with oral complications. Methods: We described the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the critically ill COVID-19 patients in our ICU department (Banska Bystrica, Slovakia). In addition, we reviewed the current body of evidence in Ovid MEDLINE(®), Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for the oral mucocutaneous complications of ICU patients with COVID-19. Results: Three out of nine critically ill patients (33.3%) in our ICU department presented with oral complications including haemorrhagic ulcers and necrotic ulcers affecting the lips and tongue. The microbiological assessment revealed the presence of opportunistic pathogens, confirming the possibility of co-infection. On reviewing the current literature, two hundred ten critically ill patients were reported to have oral complications due to their stay in the ICU setting. Perioral pressure ulcers were the most common complication, followed by oral candidiasis, herpetic and haemorrhagic ulcers, and acute onset macroglossia. The prolonged prone positioning and mechanical ventilation devices were the primary risk factors for those oral complications, in addition to the immunosuppressive drugs. Conclusions: The multidisciplinary approach is strongly advocated for monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients, thus implying that dermatology and oral healthcare specialists and nurses should be integrated within the ICU teams.","Hocková, Barbora; Riad, Abanoub; Valky, Jozef; Šulajová, Zuzana; Stebel, Adam; Slávik, Rastislav; Bečková, Zuzana; Pokorná, Andrea; Klugarová, Jitka; Klugar, Miloslav",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557130/,13

This paper draws on social amplification theory and the extended parallel process model (EPPM) and assesses the following: (a) how two amplification stations—news media and peoples’ personal networks—influence the risk-related perceptions of people (perceived efficacy and perceived threat) and (b) how these risk-related perceptions impact people’s health-protective behaviors. This study surveyed 1,946 participants. The results indicate that peoples’ exposure to news media significantly and positively predicted both perceived efficacy and perceived threat. It also shows that peoples’ exposure to risk-related information through their personal networks negatively predicted their perceived efficacy, but it positively predicted their perceived threat. The mediating effect of fear was examined, and the result was contradictory to the EPPM. In short, this study reveals the underlying mechanism of individuals’ exposure to risk information, processing, and precautionary measures.","Zhao, Shuguang; Wu, Xuan",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113280/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631116,13
665978,Establishment of a new bovine leukosis virus producing cell line,2004-08-17,"The role of complete lockdowns in reducing the reproduction ratios (Rt) of COVID-19 is now established. However, the persisting reality in many countries is no longer a complete lockdown, but restrictions of varying degrees using different choices of Non-pharmaceutical interaction (NPI) policies. A scientific basis for understanding the effectiveness of these graded NPI policies in reducing the Rt is urgently needed to address the concerns on personal liberties and economic activities. In this work, we develop a systematic relation between the degrees of NPIs implemented by the 26 cantons in Switzerland during March 9 to September 13 and their respective contributions to the Rt. Using a machine learning framework, we find that Rt which should ideally be lower than 1.0, has significant contributions in the post-lockdown scenario from the different activities - restaurants (0.0523 (CI. 0.0517-0.0528)), bars (0.030 (CI. 0.029-0.030)), and nightclubs (0.154 (CI. 0.154-0.156)). Activities which keep the land-borders open (0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178)), and tourism related activities contributed comparably 0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178). However, international flights with a quarantine did not add further to the Rt of the cantons. The requirement of masks in public transport and secondary schools contributed to an overall 0.025 (CI. 0.018-0.030) reduction in Rt, compared to the baseline usage even when there are no mandates. Although causal relations are not guaranteed by the model framework, it nevertheless provides a fine-grained justification for the relative merits of choice and the degree of the NPIs and a data-driven strategy for mitigating Rt.","Sruthi, C.

For steady-state indoor airflow, fast fluid dynamics (FFD) + Markov chain model increased the calculation speed by around seven times compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) + Eulerian model and CFD + Lagrangian model, while achieving the same level of accuracy. However, the indoor airflow could be transient, if there were human behaviors involved like coughing or sneezing and air was supplied periodically. Therefore, this study developed an FFD + Markov chain model solver for predicting transient particle transport in transient indoor airflow. This investigation used two cases, transient particle transport in a ventilated two-zone chamber and a chamber with periodic air supplies, for validation. Case 1 had experimental data for validation and the results showed that the predicted particle concentration by FFD + Markov chain model matched well with the experimental data. Besides, it had similar accuracy as the CFD + Eulerian model. In the second case, the prediction by large eddy simulation (LES) was used for validating the FFD. The simulated particle concentrations by the Markov chain model and the Eulerian model were similar. The simulated particle concentrations by the Markov chain model and the Eulerian model were similar. The computational time of the FFD + Markov chain model was 7.8 times less than that of the CFD + Eulerian model.","Liu, Wei; van Hooff, Twan; An, Yuting; Hu, Simon; Chen, Chun",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041458/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320306910?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320306910; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107323,13
666788,Establishment of a Bluetongue Virus Infection Model in Mice that Are Deficient in the Alpha/Beta Interferon Receptor,2009-04-09,"Lactoferrin (Lf) is a cationic glycoprotein synthetized by exocrine glands and is present in all human secretions. It is also secreted by neutrophils in infection and inflammation sites. This glycoprotein possesses antimicrobial activity due to its capability to chelate two ferric ions per molecule, as well as to interact with bacterial and viral anionic surface components. The cationic features of Lf bind to cells, protecting the host from bacterial and viral injuries. Its anti-inflammatory activity is mediated by the ability to enter inside the nucleus of host cells, thus inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokine genes. In particular, Lf down-regulates the synthesis of IL-6, which is involved in iron homeostasis disorders and leads to intracellular iron overload, favoring viral replication and infection. The well-known antiviral activity of Lf has been demonstrated against DNA, RNA, and enveloped and naked viruses and, therefore, Lf could be efficient in counteracting also SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, we performed in vitro assays, proving that Lf exerts an antiviral activity against SARS-COV-2 through direct attachment to both SARS-CoV-2 and cell surface components. This activity varied according to concentration (100/500 μg/ml), multiplicity of infection (0.1/0.01), and cell type (Vero E6/Caco-2 cells). Interestingly, the in silico results strongly supported the hypothesis of a direct recognition between Lf and the spike S glycoprotein, which can thus hinder viral entry into the cells. These in vitro observations led us to speculate a potential supplementary role of Lf in the management of COVID-19 patients.","Campione, Elena; Lanna, Caterina; Cosio, Terenzio; Rosa, Luigi; Conte, Maria Pia; Iacovelli, Federico; Romeo, Alice; Falconi, Mattia; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Franchin, Elisa; Lia, Maria Stella; Minieri, Marilena; Chiaramonte, Carlo; Ciotti, Marco; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Terrinoni, Alessandro; Iannuzzi, Ilaria; Coppeda, Luca; Magrini, Andrea; Bernardini, Sergio; Sabatini, Stefano; Rosapepe, Felice; Bartoletti, Pier Luigi; Moricca, Nicola; Di Lorenzo, Andrea; Andreoni, Massimo; Sarmati, Loredana; Miani, Alessandro; Piscitelli, Prisco; Valenti, Piera; Bianchi, Luca",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220505/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.666600,13

667624,Ratification vote on taxonomic proposals to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2008),2009-06-03,"INTRODUCTION The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has caused a crisis disrupting health systems worldwide. While efforts are being made to determine the extent of the disruption, the impact on gynecological oncology trainees/training has not been explored. We conducted an international survey of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on clinical practice, medical education, and mental well-being of surgical gynecological oncology trainees. METHODS In our cross-sectional study, a customized web-based survey was circulated to surgical gynecological oncology trainees from national/international organizations from May to November 2020. Validated questionnaires assessed mental well-being. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyse differences in means and proportions. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of variables on psychological/mental well-being outcomes. Outcomes included clinical practice, medical education, anxiety and depression, distress, and mental well-being. RESULTS A total of 127 trainees from 34 countries responded. Of these, 52% (66/127) were from countries with national training programs (UK/USA/Netherlands/Canada/Australia) and 48% (61/127) from countries with no national training programs. Altogether, 28% (35/125) had suspected/confirmed COVID-19, 28% (35/125) experienced a fall in household income, 20% (18/90) were self-isolated from households, 45% (57/126) had to re-use personal protective equipment, and 22% (28/126) purchased their own. In total, 32.3% (41/127) of trainees (16.6% (11/66) from countries with a national training program vs 49.1% (30/61) from countries with no national training program, p=0.02) perceived they would require additional time to complete their training fellowship. The additional training time anticipated did not differ between trainees from countries with or without national training programs (p=0.11) or trainees at the beginning or end of their fellowship (p=0.12). Surgical exposure was reduced for 50% of trainees. Departmental teaching continued throughout the pandemic for 69% (87/126) of trainees, although at reduced frequency for 16.1% (14/87), and virtually for 88.5% (77/87). Trainees reporting adequate pastoral support (defined as allocation of a dedicated mentor/access to occupational health support services) had better mental well-being with lower levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.02) and distress (p<0.001). Trainees from countries with a national training program experienced higher levels of distress (p=0.01). Mean (SD) pre-pandemic mental well-being scores were significantly higher than post-pandemic scores (8.3 (1.6) vs 7 (1.8); p<0.01). CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has negatively impacted the surgical training, household income, and psychological/mental well-being of surgical gynecological oncology trainees. The overall clinical impact was worse for trainees in countries with no national training program than for those in countries with a national training program, although national training program trainees reported greater distress. COVID-19 sickness increased anxiety/depression. The recovery phase must focus on improving mental well-being and addressing lost training opportunities.","Gaba, Faiza; Blyuss, Oleg; Rodriguez, Isabel; Dilley, James; Wan, Yee-Loi Louise; Saiz, Allison; Razumova, Zoia; Zalewski, Kamil; Nikolova, Tanja; Selcuk, Ilker; Bizzarri, Nicolò; Theofanakis, Charalampos; Lanner, Maximilian; Pletnev, Andrei; Gurumurthy, Mahalakshmi; Manchanda, Ranjit",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326158/,13

As strain sensor, a CMOS-integrated chip featuring piezoresistive sensor elements was used which is capable of wireless energy and data transmission. The sensor chip was mounted on a standardized tensile test specimen of stainless steel by a bonding process using reactive multilayer systems (RMS). RMS provide a well-defined amount of heat within a very short reaction time of a few milliseconds and are placed in-between two bonding partners. RMS were combined with layers of solder which melt during the bonding process. Epoxy adhesive films were used as a reference bonding process. Under mechanical tensile loading, the sensor bonded with RMS shows a linear strain sensitivity in the whole range of tested forces whereas the adhesive-bonded sensor has slightly nonlinear behavior for low forces. Compared to the adhesive-bonded chips, the sensitivity of the reactively bonded chips is increased by a factor of about 2.5. This indicates a stronger mechanical coupling by reactive bonding as compared to adhesive bonding.","Schumacher, Axel; Shah, Vraj; Steckemetz, Stefan; Dietrich, Georg; Pflug, Erik; Hehn, Thorsten; Knappmann, Stephan; Dehé, Alfons; Leson, Andreas",J Mater Eng Perform,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11665-021-05993-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305376/,13

670231,"Development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: challenges, risks, and the way forward",2020-12-03,"OBJECTIVE: Emergency medical services (EMS) may serve as a key source of real-time data about the evolving health of COVID-19 affected populations, especially in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) with less rapid and reliable vital statistic registration systems. Although official COVID-19 statistics in Mexico report almost exclusively in-hospital mortality events, excess out-of-hospital mortality has been identified in other settings, including one EMS study in Italy that showed a 58% increase. EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia—low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea—is associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to LMICs. We assess how EMS data can be used in a sentinel capacity in Tijuana, a city on the Mexico-United States border with earlier exposure to COVID-19 than many LMIC settings. METHODS: We calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates (during April 14(th)-May 11(th)) and forecasted 2014–2019 trends. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean (SpO2). RESULTS: An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5–253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred, representing an increase of 145% (70%−338%) compared to forecasted trends. During the same window, only 8 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 274% (119%−1142%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. The highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas, although respiratory cases were more concentrated in high-SES areas. CONCLUSIONS: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported using EMS data in Italy. Increased testing in out-of-hospital settings may be required to determine if excess mortality is being driven by COVID-19 infection, health system saturation, or patient avoidance of healthcare. We also found evidence of worsening rates of hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","Friedman, Joseph; Calderón-Villarreal, Alhelí; Bojorquez, letza; Hernández, Carlos Vera; Schriger, David L.; Hirashima, Eva Tovar",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511518/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20098186; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20098186v1?rss=1,13
670237,Changes in temperature alter the potential outcomes of virus host shifts,2018-10-19,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an enormous loss of lives. Various clinical trials of vaccines and drugs are being conducted worldwide; nevertheless, as of today, no effective drug exists for COVID-19. The identification of key genes and pathways in this disease may lead to finding potential drug targets and biomarkers. Here, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis and LIME as an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in bronchial epithelium cells (primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) and transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells) during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our study detected a network that significantly correlated to the pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection based on identified hub genes in each cell line separately. The novel hub gene signature that was detected in our study, including PGLYRP4 and HEPHL1, may shed light on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, holding promise for future prognostic and therapeutic approaches. The enrichment analysis of hub genes showed that the most relevant biological process and KEGG pathways were the type I interferon signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and defense response to virus categories, all of which play significant roles in restricting viral infection. Moreover, according to the drug–target network, we identified 17 novel FDA-approved candidate drugs, which could potentially be used to treat COVID-19 patients through the regulation of four hub genes of the co-expression network. In conclusion, the aforementioned hub genes might play potential roles in translational medicine and might become promising therapeutic targets. Further in vitro and in vivo experimental studies are needed to evaluate the role of these hub genes in COVID-19.","Karami, Hassan; Derakhshani, Afshin; Ghasemigol, Mohammad; Fereidouni, Mohammad; Miri-Moghaddam, Ebrahim; Baradaran, Behzad; Tabrizi, Neda Jalili; Najafi, Souzan; Solimando, Antonio Giovanni; Marsh, Leigh M.; Silvestris, Nicola; De Summa, Simona; Paradiso, Angelo Virgilio; Racanelli, Vito; Safarpour, Hossein",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10163567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441862/,13
671284,Recovery of Synthetic Zika Virus Based on Rio-U1 Isolate Using a Genetically Stable Two Plasmid System and cDNA Amplification,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Houttuynia cordata Thunb. is an important traditional medical herb in China and other Asian countries, with high medicinal and economic value. However, a lack of available genomic information has become a limitation for research on this species. Thus, we carried out high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing of H. cordata to generate an enormous transcriptome sequence dataset for gene discovery and molecular marker development. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Illumina paired-end sequencing technology produced over 56 million sequencing reads from H. cordata mRNA. Subsequent de novo assembly yielded 63,954 unigenes, 39,982 (62.52%) and 26,122 (40.84%) of which had significant similarity to proteins in the NCBI nonredundant protein and Swiss-Prot databases (E-value <10(−5)), respectively. Of these annotated unigenes, 30,131 and 15,363 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. In addition, 24,434 (38.21%) unigenes were mapped onto 128 pathways using the KEGG pathway database and 17,964 (44.93%) unigenes showed homology to Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae) genes in BLASTx analysis. Furthermore, 4,800 cDNA SSRs were identified as potential molecular markers. Fifty primer pairs were randomly selected to detect polymorphism among 30 samples of H. cordata; 43 (86%) produced fragments of expected size, suggesting that the unigenes were suitable for specific primer design and of high quality, and the SSR marker could be widely used in marker-assisted selection and molecular breeding of H. cordata in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first application of Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to investigate the whole transcriptome of H. cordata and to assemble RNA-seq reads without a reference genome. These data should help researchers investigating the evolution and biological processes of this species. The SSR markers developed can be used for construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps and for gene-based association analyses in H. cordata. This work will enable future functional genomic research and research into the distinctive active constituents of this genus.","Wei, Lin; Li, Shenghua; Liu, Shenggui; He, Anna; Wang, Dan; Wang, Jie; Tang, Yulian; Wu, Xianjin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392108/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084105,13

Use of cutting agents to increase the volume or psychoactive effect has been widely practised under such circumstances. Our patient with opioid use disorder chased heroin with an unknown cutting agent to enhance psychoactive effect from the limited quantities of heroin. He suffered from an abrupt onset sedation, weakness, postural imbalance, slurred speech, cognitive dysfunctions and disinhibited behaviour. Symptoms rapidly reversed following abstinence and initiation of buprenorphine–naloxone. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the adulterant revealed high concentrations of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, alongside the usual cutting agents—caffeine and acetaminophen.

We evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 infection and lockdown on mental and physical health in PWS. At the end of April, 85 adults with PWS completed a self-administered questionnaire, including lockdown conditions, physical activity (PA), ED, and medical and behavioral outcomes. Body weight was measured at home and self-reported. RESULTS: Patients (52.9% women, 44.8% disomic) were assessed, with a mean age of 28.05 ± 8.73 years and body mass index (BMI) of 36.76 ± 10.74 kg/m(2). Seventy percent lived in the Paris region (France) and were confined with their parents. The mean weight change was 0.96 ± 3.28 kg. We compared patients showing weight loss (n = 39, − 3.30 ± 2.93 kg) to patients showing weight gain (n = 22, + 2.35 ± 1.54 kg): the BMI was lower (34.60 ± 9.18 versus 40.45 ± 9.45 kg/m(2), p = 0.02), PA increased (25.6% versus 4.5%, p = 0.04), and EDs improved (51.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.005). Behavioral disorders increased for 12.9% of the cohort. Three individuals (3.5%) were diagnosed with non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with positive effects for most French adults with PWS, with weight loss probably associated with a more favourable environment during this period.

We share the infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during the unexpected outbreak at our hospital. We reviewed all forms of related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers of our hospital. After the onset of outbreak, a multidisciplinary team devised institutional MERS-control guidelines. Two standard operating rooms were converted to temporary negative-pressure rooms by physically decreasing the inflow air volume (−4.7 Pa in the main room and −1.2 Pa in the anteroom). Healthcare workers were equipped with standard or enhanced personal protective equipment according to the MERS-related patient’s profile and symptoms. Six MERS-related patients underwent emergency surgery, including four MERS-exposed and two MERS-confirmed patients. Negative conversion of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests was noticed for MERS-confirmed patients before surgery. MERS-exposed patients were also tested twice preoperatively, all of which were negative. All operative procedures in MERS-related patients were performed without specific adverse events or perioperative MERS transmission.

High prevalence of stress had been previously reported in populations during this context. Many theoretical frameworks had been proposed for explaining the stress process, we aim to proposed and explanatory model for the genesis of perceived stress in Peruvian general population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey in Peruvian general population assessing sociodemographic variables and evaluating mental health conditions by using The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and a numerical rating scale (NRS) for fear of COVID-19. Correlation analysis was conducted for the variables of interest. Two regression models were constructed to explore related factor to the dimensions of perceived stress. Finally, a structural regression model was performed with the independent variables. RESULTS: Data of 210 individuals was analyzed. Ages ranged from 15 to 74 years and 39% were women. Additionally, 65.2% of the participants had at least one mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms). Perceived self-efficacy and positive affect (PA) were correlated, as perceived helplessness with anxious symptoms and negative affect (NA). Regression analysis showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, and NA explained perceived helplessness while positive and NA explained self-efficacy. The structural regression model analysis identified that fear of COVID-19 (composed of fear of infecting others and fear of contagion), predicted mental health conditions (i.e., depressive or anxiety symptoms); also, mental health conditions were predicted by PA and NA. Perceived helplessness and Perceived self-efficacy were interrelated and represented the perceived stress variable. CONCLUSION: We proposed an explanatory model of perceived stress based on two correlated dimensions (self-efficacy and helplessness) in the Peruvian general population during the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with two out of three individuals surveyed having at least one mental health condition.","Boluarte-Carbajal, Alicia; Navarro-Flores, Alba; Villarreal-Zegarra, David",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248770/,13

679005,Influenza Virus Like Particles (VLPs): Opportunities for H7N9 Vaccine Development,2020-05-08,"Influenza viruses are one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens known to humans and pose a significant threat to global public health each year. Annual influenza epidemics are responsible for 3–5 million infections worldwide and approximately 500,000 deaths. Presently, yearly vaccinations represent the most effective means of combating these viruses. In humans, influenza viruses infect respiratory epithelial cells and typically cause localized infections of mild to moderate severity. Neutrophils are the first innate cells to be recruited to the site of the infection and possess a wide range of effector functions to eliminate viruses. Some well-described effector functions include phagocytosis, degranulation, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, while these mechanisms can promote infection resolution, they can also contribute to the pathology of severe disease. Thus, the role of neutrophils in influenza viral infection is nuanced, and the threshold at which protective functions give way to immunopathology is not well understood. Moreover, notable differences between human and murine neutrophils underscore the need to exercise caution when applying murine findings to human physiology. This review aims to provide an overview of neutrophil characteristics, their classic effector functions, as well as more recently described antibody-mediated effector functions. Finally, we discuss the controversial role these cells play in the context of influenza virus infections and how our knowledge of this cell type can be leveraged in the design of universal influenza virus vaccines.","George, Sneha T.; Lai, Jonathan; Ma, Julia; Stacey, Hannah D.; Miller, Matthew S.; Mullarkey, Caitlin E.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199803/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060597,13

Brain development consists of a finely tuned series of spatially and temporally constrained events, which may be affected by exposure to a sub-optimal intra-uterine environment. Evidence suggests brain development may be particularly vulnerable to factors such as maternal nutrition, infection and stress during pregnancy. In this review, we discuss how maternal factors such as these can affect brain development and outcome in offspring, and we also identify evidence which suggests that the outcome can, in many cases, be stratified by socio-economic status (SES), with individuals in lower brackets typically having a worse outcome. We consider the relevant epidemiological evidence and draw parallels to mechanisms suggested by preclinical work where appropriate. We also discuss possible transgenerational effects of these maternal factors and the potential mechanisms involved. We conclude that modifiable factors such as maternal nutrition, infection and stress are important contributors to atypical brain development and that SES also likely has a key role.","Fitzgerald, Eamon; Hor, Kahyee; Drake, Amanda J.",Early Hum Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220306514?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948364/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105190; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220306514,13

A self‐designed questionnaire comprising 10 items measured “personal” and “work‐related” support at the organization. Sociodemographic data were captured using a structured questionnaire. The results showed that the frontline social workers, although resilient, were psychologically distressed in all the three areas of depression, anxiety and stress. The results indicated that those working in the Family Service Centers (FSC) were the most affected. Significant correlations were observed between psychological distress, resilience, and organizational support.

At present, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe consequences on both economic and social infrastructures of the developed and developing countries. Several studies have been conducted and ongoing still to design efficient models for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. The traditional diagnostic models that use reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) is a costly and time-consuming process. So, automated COVID-19 diagnosis using Deep Learning (DL) models becomes essential. The primary intention of this study is to design an effective model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. This research work introduces an automated COVID-19 diagnosis process using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a fusion-based feature extraction model, called FM-CNN. FM-CNN model has three major phases namely, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, Wiener Filtering (WF)-based preprocessing is employed to discard the noise that exists in input chest X-Ray (CXR) images. Then, the pre-processed images undergo fusion-based feature extraction model which is a combination of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRM), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). In order to determine the optimal subset of features, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed. At last, CNN is deployed as a classifier to identify the existence of binary and multiple classes of CXR images. In order to validate the proficiency of the proposed FM-CNN model in terms of its diagnostic performance, extension experimentation was carried out upon CXR dataset. As per the results attained from simulation, FM-CNN model classified multiple classes with the maximum sensitivity of 97.22%, specificity of 98.29%, accuracy of 98.06%, and F-measure of 97.93%.","Shankar, K.; Mohanty, Sachi Nandan; Yadav, Kusum; Gopalakrishnan, T.; Elmisery, Ahmed M.",Cogn Neurodyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-021-09712-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522236/,13

Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving. We propose an evidence-based, risk-stratified protocol in approaching the risk of TE episodes in COVID-19 patients.","Arigondam, Ashok Kumar; Hakeem, Abdul Rahman; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Rela, Mohamed",Arch Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423804/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920313424?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.11.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920313424,13

In this paper, we assessed tests as a policy instrument and policy enactment to contain COVID-19 and potentially reduce mortalities. Study design A model was devised to estimate the factors that influenced the death rate across 121 nations and by income group. Results Nations with a higher proportion of people age 65+ had a higher fatality rate (p = 0.00014). Delaying policy enactment led to a higher case fatality rate (p = 0.0013). A 10% delay time to act resulted in a 3.7% higher case fatality rate. This study found that delaying policies for international travel restrictions, public information campaigns, and testing policies increased the fatality rate. Tests also impacted the case fatality rate, and nations with 10% more cumulative tests per million people resulted in a 2.8% lower mortality rate. Citizens of nations who can access more destinations without the need to have a prior visa have a significant higher mortality rate than those that need a visa to travel abroad (p = 0.0040). Conclusion Tests, as a surrogate of policy action and earlier policy enactment, matter for saving lives from pandemics as such policies reduce the transmission rate of the pandemic.","Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.; Tsigaris, Panagiotis",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620303760; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.08.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620303760?v=s5,13

A “dual-mode” gradient high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed, where the separation was achieved via “dual-mode” gradient by changing both the ternary mobile phase composition (acetonitrile: methanol: water) and the flow rate. This enables a good resolution within a relatively shorter analysis time. The analysis was realized using Zorbax Eclipse XDB column C18, 5 μm (250 × 4.6 mm) and the UV detector was set at 220 nm. The other method is a thin-layer chromatography densitometry method, where the separation was achieved using a mobile phase composed of chloroform: toluene: ethyl acetate: methanol: acetic acid (6: 6: 1: 2: 0.1, by volume). Densitometric detection was performed at 220 nm on silica gel 60 F254 plates.

681908,VGEA: an RNA viral assembly toolkit,2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%.

683111,Inhibition of Hepatitis E Virus Spread by the Natural Compound Silvestrol,2018-06-02,"RATIONALE: The COVID-19 pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to public health. OBJECTIVE: Because the novel coronavirus is highly contagious, the widespread use of preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and eventually vaccination is needed to bring it under control. We hypothesized that accepting conspiracy theories that were circulating in mainstream and social media early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US would be negatively related to the uptake of preventive behaviors and also of vaccination when a vaccine becomes available. METHOD: A national probability survey of US adults (N = 1050) was conducted in the latter half of March 2020 and a follow-up with 840 of the same individuals in July 2020. The surveys assessed adoption of preventive measures recommended by public health authorities, vaccination intentions, conspiracy beliefs, perceptions of threat, belief about the safety of vaccines, political ideology, and media exposure patterns. RESULTS: Belief in three COVID-19-related conspiracy theories was highly stable across the two periods and inversely related to the (a) perceived threat of the pandemic, (b) taking of preventive actions, including wearing a face mask, (c) perceived safety of vaccination, and (d) intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conspiracy beliefs in March predicted subsequent mask-wearing and vaccination intentions in July even after controlling for action taken and intentions in March. Although adopting preventive behaviors was predicted by political ideology and conservative media reliance, vaccination intentions were less related to political ideology. Mainstream television news use predicted adopting both preventive actions and vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Because belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the US. Reducing those barriers will require continued messaging by public health authorities on mainstream media and in particular on politically conservative outlets that have supported COVID-related conspiracy theories.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",Soc Sci Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362030575X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967786/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027795362030575X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113356,13

Despite the high prevalence of these conditions, a mechanistic association of its interactions in COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict 30-day lethality in COVID-19 cases, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity and its role in improving risk prediction. METHODS: We obtained data of suspected, confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to SARS-CoV-2 positivity and mortality due to COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on COVID-19 related outcomes and their interaction with other comorbidities in modifying COVID-19 related lethality. Finally, we built our clinical score to predict 30-day lethality using the previously identified risk factors. RESULTS: Among 49,570 evaluated subjects (at April 19th, 2020), we observed an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n=8,261) in those with diabetes, obesity, male subjects and in patients with diabetes and age <40 years (early-onset). Risk factors for increased lethality in COVID-19 includes early-onset diabetes obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced age, immunosuppression, and chronic kidney disease; we also found that obesity mediates 47.8% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality. Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation. Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age [≥]65 years, diabetes, diabetes & age <40 years, obesity, age <40 years, CKD, pregnancy and immunosuppression and a categorization of low-risk, mild-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk and very high-risk significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.837). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we propose a mechanistic approach to evaluate risk for complication and lethality attributable to COVID-19 in patients with obesity and diabetes patients in a country with high susceptibility. Furthermore, our novel score offers a clinical tool for quick determination of high-risk susceptibility patients in a first contact scenario.","Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Bahena-Lopez, J.

Frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 hotspots have faced numerous challenges, including shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and difficulties acquiring clinical testing. The magnitude of the exposure of healthcare workers and the potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to understand the incidence of infection in this population. To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers, we studied frontline staff working in the Montefiore Health System in New York City. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were tested by RT-qPCR and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The medical, occupational, and COVID-19 exposure histories of participants were recorded via questionnaires. Of the 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers tested, 19 (19.4%) tested positive by RT-qPCR and/or ELISA. Within this group, four (4.1%) were RT-qPCR positive, and four (4.1%) were PCR and IgG positive. Notably, an additional 11 (11.2%) individuals were IgG positive without a positive PCR. Two PCR positive individuals subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms, while all others remained asymptomatic at 2-week follow-up. These results indicate that there is considerable asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare workforce, despite current mitigation policies. Furthermore, presuming that asymptomatic staff are not carrying SARS-CoV-2 is inconsistent with our results, and this could result in amplified transmission within healthcare settings. Consequently, aggressive testing regiments, such as testing frontline healthcare workers on a regular, multi-modal basis, may be required to prevent further spread within the workforce and to patients.","Stock, Ariel D.; Bader, Edward R.; Cezayirli, Phillip; Inocencio, Julio; Chalmers, Samantha A.; Yassari, Reza; Yanamadala, Vijay; Eskandar, Emad",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974370/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00471,13

Little is known about the reliability of QTF-Plus in COVID-19 patients. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and the factors related to an indeterminate QFT-Plus test in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and to analyze its relationship with in-hospital mortality. A retrospective analysis of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients on whom a QTF-Plus assay was performed in a tertiary care public hospital during the first epidemic wave in Spain (March–April 2020). Out of a total of 96 patients included, 34 (35.4%) had an indeterminate result, in all cases due to a lack of response in the mitogen control. Factors related to COVID-19 severity, such as higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (odds ratio [OR] 1.005 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.002–1.008]) and previous administration of corticosteroids (OR 4.477 [95% CI 1.397–14.345]), were independent predictors for indeterminate QFT-Plus assay. Furthermore, indeterminate results were more frequent among COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization (29.1% vs. 64.7%; p = 0.005). We conclude that QFT-Plus assay yielded an unexpected, high prevalence of indeterminate results in severe COVID-19 patients. Factors related to worse COVID-19 outcome, such as LDH, as well as corticosteroid use before the QFT-Plus assay, seem to be predictors for an indeterminate result. The role of an indeterminate QFT-Plus result in predicting COVID-19 severity and mortality should be evaluated.","Solanich, Xavier; Fernández-Huerta, Miguel; Basaez, Celeste; Antolí, Arnau; Rocamora-Blanch, Gemma; Corbella, Xavier; Santin, Miguel; Alcaide, Fernando",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652893/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10050918,13

687298,Complement Decay-Accelerating Factor is a modulator of influenza A virus lung immunopathology,2021-07-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health emergency. In this context, there are major concerns for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly for those treated with immunomodulators, biologics, and Janus Kinase inhibitors. Infection susceptibility is, in fact, one of the reported risks for immunotherapy drugs. This review provides the existing evidence from worldwide case series describing: (a) the risk for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the risk of a severe infection outcome in patients with IBD treated with immunotherapy. Further, the review discusses the potential mechanisms underlying why this group of patients with IBD might be protected from contracting the infection and from a worse disease. From the available data, it appears that these patients should have an enhanced adherence to the recommended preventive measures, suggesting a role in reducing their risk of infection. Furthermore, the immunotherapy may dampen the cytokine storm and inflammation associated with COVID-19. The results of this review seem to confirm that patients with IBD receiving immunomodulators, biologics, or Janus Kinase inhibitors do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe COVID-19.

It is precipitated by an immunological trigger in a susceptible host resulting in immune activation and dysregulation leading to disruption of immune homeostasis, cytokine storm and multi-organ failure. We describe a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated HLH with its typical diagnostic challenges and associated high mortality rate. Certain diagnostic criteria and online tools may help to arrive at an earlier presumptive diagnosis which, in turn, may expedite treatment and lead to better clinical outcomes.","Quadri, Syed P; Jain, Nitesh K; Brandon, Brooke L; Modi, Harshit; Bawaadam, Hasnain",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905485/,13

Brain organoids have already helped efficient modeling of crucial elements of brain development and disorders. Brain organoids’ suitability in modeling glioma has started to emerge, offering another usefulness of brain organoids in disease modeling. Although the current state-of-the organoids mostly reflect the immature state of the brain, with their vast cell diversity, human brain-like cytoarchitecture, feasibility in culturing, handling, imaging, and tractability can offer enormous potential in reflecting the glioma invasion, integration, and interaction with different neuronal cell types. Here, we summarize the current trend of employing brain organoids in glioma modeling and discuss the immediate challenges. Solving them might lay a foundation for using brain organoids as a pre-clinical 3D substrate to dissect the glioma invasion mechanisms in detail.","Mariappan, Aruljothi; Goranci-Buzhala, Gladiola; Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia; Pallini, Roberto; Gopalakrishnan, Jay",Cell Death Differ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262470/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-00679-7,13

Detection of the viral RNA through reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal or throat sample is the preferred method of diagnosis. Recent evidence has suggested that COVID-19 patients can shed the SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks. Herein, we report six cases of COVID-19 who had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 on repeat RT-PCR testing reaching up to 9 weeks. The spectrum of cases described ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A full understanding of the virus’s transmission dynamics needs further research. Prolonged viral shedding currently has unclear implications on the management and isolation decisions—the role of the cycle threshold (Ct) value in guiding therapeutic decisions is yet to be clarified. More data on the relationship between Ct values and viral cultivation are needed, especially in patients with prolonged viral shedding, to understand the virus’s viability and infectivity.","Alsaud, Arwa E.; Nair, Arun Prabhakaran; Matarneh, Ahmad S.; Sasi, Sreethish; El Hassan, Rania; Khan, Fahmi; Coyle, Peter; Abu Khattab, Mohamed; Mohamed, Mouhand F.

This partnership focuses on pandemic preparedness planning, establishing and enhancing influenza surveillance systems, improving laboratory capacity for detection of influenza viruses, estimating the influenza disease burden, and providing evidence to support policies for the introduction and increased use of seasonal influenza vaccines. METHODS: Various published and unpublished data from public and WHO sources, programme indicators of the CDC cooperative agreement and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework were reviewed and analysed. Analyses and review of the programme indicators and published articles enabled us to generate information that was unavailable from only WHO sources. RESULTS: Most (19/22) countries of the Region have established influenza surveillance system; 16 countries in the Region have designated National Influenza Centres. The Region has seen considerable improvement in geographic coverage of influenza surveillance and influenza detection. Virus sharing has improved and almost all of the participating laboratories have achieved a 100% efficiency score in the WHO external quality assessment programme. At least seven countries have estimated their influenza disease burden using surveillance data and at least 17 are now using seasonal influenza vaccines as a control strategy for influenza illness. CONCLUSION: The Region has achieved substantial progress in surveillance and response to seasonal influenza, despite the adverse effects to the health systems of many countries due to acute and protracted emergencies and other significant challenges.","Malik, Mamunur R.; Abubakar, Abdinasir; Kholy, Amgad E.; Buliva, Evans; Khan, Wasiq M.; Lamichhane, Jaya; Moen, Ann; McCarron, Margaret; Zureick, Kinda; Obtel, Majdouline",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119302539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522968/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119302539,13

688890,First evidence of host range expansion in virophages and its potential impact on giant viruses and host cells,2019-09-24,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the length of time elapsed between reports of the same incidents related to avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks published by the WHO and ProMED-mail, the two major global health surveillance systems, before and after the amendment of the International Health Regulations in 2005 (IHR 2005) and to explore the association between country transparency and this timeliness gap. METHODS: We recorded the initial release dates of each report related to avian flu or H1N1 listed on the WHO Disease Outbreak News site and the matching outbreak report from ProMED-mail, a non-governmental program for monitoring emerging diseases, from 2003 to the end of June 2009. The timeliness gap was calculated as the difference in days between the report release dates of the matching outbreaks in the WHO and ProMED-mail systems. Civil liberties scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses were collected to reflect countries’ development and health workforce statuses. Then, logistic regression was performed to determine the correlation between the timeliness gap and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status, controlling for year. RESULTS: The reporting timeliness gap for avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks significantly decreased after 2003. On average, reports were posted 4.09 (SD = 7.99) days earlier by ProMED-mail than by the WHO. Countries with partly free (OR = 5.77) and free civil liberties scores (OR = 10.57) had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than non-free countries. Similarly, countries with very high human development status had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than countries with middle or low human development status (OR = 5.30). However, no association between the timeliness gap and health workforce density was found. CONCLUSION: The study found that the adoption of IHR 2005, which contributed to countries’ awareness of the importance of timely reporting, had a significant impact in improving the reporting timeliness gap. In addition, the greater the civil liberties in a country (e.g., importance of freedom of the media), the longer the timeliness gap.","Tsai, Feng-Jen; Tseng, Eva; Chan, Chang-Chuan; Tamashiro, Hiko; Motamed, Sandrine; Rougemont, André C",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531369/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-8603-9-14,13
688895,High-Throughput Fluorescent Assay for Inhibitor Screening of Proteases from RNA Viruses,2021-06-22,"This article analyzes how the structural factor of asymmetry affects China’s relations with a small power. As the studies of Brantly Womack suggest, asymmetry theory is conducive to deepening the understanding of China’s relations with smaller countries. We argue that an examination of China–Philippines relations from 2010 to 2020 indicates that Beijing has trouble managing its ties with Manila because of the asymmetry in the nature of the relations, which originates in the power and status gaps between them. The asymmetrical structure of this bilateral interplay inclines China to underestimate and neglect the Philippines’ intentions and determination to resist, which has been made especially clear in the South China Sea disputes. As a result, their relationship experienced repeated ups and downs throughout the 2010s, in particular over the maritime sovereignty issue. This study also hints at the complicated situations surrounding China where many medium-sized and small states attempt to maneuver among great powers. Without affinities with such governments in the Indo-Pacific region, it will be difficult for Beijing to achieve a peaceful rise and acquire status as a next-generation superpower.","Yamazaki, Amane; Osawa, Suguru",East Asia (Piscataway),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177250/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12140-021-09370-1,13

It often causes pneumonia in humans. Artificial intelligence models have been helpful for successful analyses in the biomedical field. In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%.

The goal of myogenic stem cell transplant therapy for DMD is to increase dystrophin expression in existing muscle fibers and provide a source of stem cells for future muscle generation. Although syngeneic myogenic stem cell transplants have been successful in mice, allogeneic transplants of myogenic stem cells were ineffective in several human trials. To determine whether allogeneic muscle progenitor cells can be successfully transplanted in an immune tolerant recipient, we induced immune tolerance in two DMD affected (xmd) dogs through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Injection of freshly isolated muscle-derived cells from the HCT donor into either fully or partially chimeric xmd recipients restored dystrophin expression up to 6.72% of wild-type levels, reduced the number of centrally located nuclei, and improved muscle structure. Dystrophin expression was maintained for at least 24 weeks. Taken together, these data indicate that immune tolerance to donor myoblasts provides an important platform from which to further improve myoblast transplantation, with the goal of restoring dystrophin expression to patients with DMD.","Parker, Maura H.; Kuhr, Christian; Tapscott, Stephen J.; Storb, Rainer",Molecular Therapy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616324765; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616324765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500253/; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2008.102,13

However, it should be noted that it is still fast developing. A varying trend in term of the waste amount is identified. Shanghai is showing a ~23% decline in household waste amount; however, Singapore is showing a ~3% increase, and Brno is showing a ~1% increase in household waste amount but ~40% decline in business and industrial waste. Manual sorting and recycling have been reported as restricted due to safety precaution.

The meeting functioned as a platform for free brainstorming, in-depth discussion, and post-meeting synthesizing. Through the meeting, we have reached a consensus that global health can be considered as a general guiding principle, an organizing framework for thinking and action, a new branch of sciences and specialized discipline in the large family of public health and medicine. The word “global” in global health can be subjective or objective, depending on the context and setting. In addition to dual-, multi-country and global, a project or a study conducted at a local area can be global if it (1) is framed with a global perspective, (2) intends to address an issue with global impact, and/or (3) seeks global solutions to an issue, such as frameworks, strategies, policies, laws, and regulations. In this regard, global health is eventually an extension of “international health” by borrowing related knowledge, theories, technologies and methodologies from public health and medicine. Although global health is a concept that will continue to evolve, our conceptualization through group effort provides, to date, a comprehensive understanding.

690608,Complex formation between influenza virus polymerase proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes,1989-07-31,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) encodes a single capping protein, VP4, which catalyzes all reactions required to generate cap1 structures on nascent viral transcripts. Further, structural analysis by X-ray crystallography indicated each catalytic reaction is arranged as a discrete domain, including a nucleoside-2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O MTase). In this study, we have exploited the structural information to identify the residues that are important for the catalytic activity of 2′-O MTase of VP4 and their influence on BTV replication. The effect of these mutations on GMP binding, guanylyltransferase (GTase) and methylase activities were analysed by a series of in vitro biochemical assays using recombinant mutant proteins; subsequently their effects on virus replication were assessed by introducing the same mutations in replicating viral genome using a reverse genetics system. Our data showed that single substitution mutations in the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E were sufficient to abolish 2′-O MTase activity in vitro and to completely abrogate BTV replication in cells; although these mutants retained the upstream GMP binding, GTase and guanine-N7-methyltransferase activities. Mutations of the surrounding substrate-binding pocket (predicted to recruit cap0) had variable effects on in vitro VP4 capping activity. Only triple but not single substitution mutations of these residues in genome resulted in reduced virus replication kinetics. This is the first report investigating the importance of 2′-O MTase function for any member of the Reoviridae and highlights the significance of K-D-K-E tetrad and surrounding residues for the efficiency of 2′-O MTase activity and in turn, for virus fitness.","Stewart, Meredith E.; Roy, Polly",FEBS Open Bio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25834778/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221154631500011X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221154631500011X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fob.2015.02.001,13
