1588,1588,1588,Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population,12.02678,4.0603313,2014-09-19,"INTRODUCTION: Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A (−889), IL1B (−511, +3962), IL1R (1970), IL1RA (11100), IL4RA (+1902), IL12 (−1188), IFNG (+874), TGFB1 (codon 10, codon 25), TNFA (−308, −238), IL2 (−330, +166), IL4 (−1098, −590, −33), IL6 (−174, nt565), and IL10 (−1082, −819, −592)) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group. METHODS: A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit. RESULTS: A comparison between individuals allergic to Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4 (−590) in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10(−8), pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07–0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10(−6), pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42–9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A (−889) (T/T, C, and T) and IL2 (−330) (G/T and T/T) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4RA (+1902) (A and G), IL4 (−590) (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10 (−592) (A/A, C/A, A, and C). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and hypersensitivity to dust mites.","Caniatti, Marcela Caleffi da Costa Lima; Marchioro, Ariella Andrade; Guilherme, Ana Lúcia Falavigna; Tsuneto, Luiza Tamie",PLoS One,309,1
2781,2781,2781,Highly diverse and antimicrobial susceptible Escherichia coli display a naïve bacterial population in fruit bats from the Republic of Congo,11.767668,6.370501,2017-07-12,"Bats are suspected to be a reservoir of several bacterial and viral pathogens relevant to animal and human health, but studies on Escherichia coli in these animals are sparse. We investigated the presence of E. coli in tissue samples (liver, lung and intestines) collected from 50 fruit bats of five different species (Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Rousettus aegyptiacus) of two different areas in the Republic of Congo between 2009 and 2010. To assess E. coli pathotypes and phylogenetic relationships, we determined the presence of 59 virulence associated genes and multilocus sequence types (STs). Isolates were further tested for their susceptibility to several antimicrobial substances by agar disk diffusion test and for the presence of an Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase phenotype. E. coli was detected in 60% of the bats analysed. The diversity of E. coli strains was very high, with 37 different STs within 40 isolates. Occasionally, we detected sequence types (e.g. ST69, ST127, and ST131) and pathotypes (e.g. ExPEC, EPEC and atypical EPEC), which are known pathogens in human and/or animal infections. Although the majority of strains were assigned to phylogenetic group B2 (46.2%), which is linked with the ExPEC pathovar, occurrence of virulence-associated genes in these strains were unexpectedly low. Due to this, and as only few of the E. coli isolates showed intermediate resistance to certain antimicrobial substances, we assume a rather naïve E. coli population, lacking contact to humans or domestic animals. Future studies featuring in depth comparative whole genome sequence analyses will provide insights into the microevolution of this interesting strain collection.","Nowak, Kathrin; Fahr, Jakob; Weber, Natalie; Lübke-Becker, Antina; Semmler, Torsten; Weiss, Sabrina; Mombouli, Jean-Vivien; Wieler, Lothar H.; Guenther, Sebastian; Leendertz, Fabian H.; Ewers, Christa",PLoS One,309,1
3219,3219,3219,viGEN: An Open Source Pipeline for the Detection and Quantification of Viral RNA in Human Tumors,11.784175,4.1175313,2018-06-05,"An estimated 17% of cancers worldwide are associated with infectious causes. The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses. Our viral pipeline could be used in conjunction with additional type of immuno-oncology analysis based on RNA-seq data of host RNA for cancer immunology applications.

4819,4819,4819,Occurrence and Determination of Inositol in the Oviducts of Turkey and Hen,11.926698,4.009679,1969,"ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that the liver is not the main source of angiotensinogen during fetal life in rats, but that the kidney is an important site of fetal angiotensinogen synthesis. In an effort to determine if this phenomenon is specific to the rat or applicable to other species, we compared the ontogenic changes in hepatic and renal angiotensinogen mRNA expression in fetal (60, 90, 118, and 138 d of gestation, term being 145 d), newborn (7 d postnatal), and adult sheep. Total RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized using a full-length rat radiolabeled antisense RNA. Angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were detected in all fetal liver samples and appeared to increase 3-fold from 60 to 138 d gestation and then to decrease after birth. In contrast, angiotensiogen mRNA could not be detected in renal cortical tissue of 118 or 138 d fetuses, or newborn or adult sheep. We conclude that, unlike in the rat, liver angiotensinogen gene expression is detectable during the 2nd trimester of gestation in sheep and is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, in contrast to the fetal rat, angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were undetectable in fetal sheep kidney.","Olson, Ann Louise; Perlman, Stanley; Robillard, Jean E",Pediatr Res,309,1
5564,5564,5564,Rethinking the Significance of Reovirus in Water and Wastewater,11.755732,4.072612,2016-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first reported in 2005. The worldwide presence of HBoV in children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) has been confirmed. This study aimed to understand the prevalence and clinical features of HBoV in children with ARTI in Shanghai and explore the causative implication of HBoV in ARTI. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 349 hospitalized children with ARTI between November 2006 and January 2007. From these children, 351 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected; 325 of the samples were obtained from those with community-acquired ARTI and 26 from those with hospital-acquired ARTI. All samples were routinely screened for seven common respiratory viruses by immunofluorescence and further tested for HBoV by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 16 (4.6%) of the 351 samples, and it was the second most commonly detected virus after respiratory syncytial virus. Three (19%) HBoV-positive samples were dual infection with respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus type 3. Of the 325 children with community-acquired ARTI, HBoV was identified to be positive in 11 (3.4%), of whom 6 were diagnosed with pneumonia with patchy or interstitial infiltrates in the lung indicated by chest radiography, 3 with bronchitis, and 2 with bronchial asthma exacerbation with attendant lung infection. Out of the 26 children with nosocomial ARTI, 5 (19.2%) had bronchitis which was found to be HBoV positive without co-detection of other viruses. The HBoV-positive children were aged 1.7 months to 43 months and their mean age was 13.7 months. Sixteen (100%) children had cough, 11 (68.8%) had wheezing, and 10 (62.5%) had fever. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV was circulating in Shanghai during the study period, and which was detected frequently in children with ARTI. HBoV was found to be associated with community-acquired ARTI and may play a pathogenic role in nosocomial ARTI.","Zeng, Mei; Zhu, Qi-Rong; Wang, Xiao-Hong; Yu, Hui; Shen, Jun",World J Pediatr,309,1

Primary hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder with an allele frequency greater than 10% in individuals of European ancestry, while hemosiderosis is less common but associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality. Iron overload leads to iron deposition in many tissues especially the liver, brain, heart and endocrine tissues. Elevated cardiac iron leads to diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy, and is the primary determinant of survival in patients with secondary iron overload as well as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary hemochromatosis patients. In addition, iron-induced cardiac injury plays a role in acute iron toxicosis (iron poisoning), myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury, Friedreich ataxia and neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with iron overload also routinely suffer from a range of endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and anterior pituitary dysfunction. Despite clear connections between elevated iron and clinical disease, iron transport remains poorly understood. While low-capacity divalent metal and transferrin-bound transporters are critical under normal physiological conditions, L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) are high-capacity pathways of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) uptake into cardiomyocytes especially under iron overload conditions. Fe(2+) uptake through L-type Ca(2+) channels may also be crucial in other excitable cells such as pancreatic beta cells, anterior pituitary cells and neurons. Consequently, LTCC blockers represent a potential new therapy to reduce the toxic effects of excess iron.","Oudit, Gavin Y.; Trivieri, Maria G.; Khaper, Neelam; Liu, Peter P.; Backx, Peter H.",J Mol Med (Berl),309,1

Early recognition and differentiation of diseases mimicking pneumonia are prerequisites for an adequate therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to present the important noninfectious differential diagnoses of pneumonia and to provide the reader with tools for a systematic diagnostic approach. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A literature search was carried out. RESULTS: As alterations in the lungs often result in similar imaging appearances and a differentiation between transudates, exsudates, blood and cells is not feasible by chest X‑ray or CT, a systematic approach is essential to make an appropriate diagnosis. Hence, consideration of the temporal course, predominant pattern, distribution of findings, additional findings and clinical presentation are indispensable.","Wielandner, A.; Agarwal, P.; Toelly, A.; Bardach, C.",Radiologe,309,1

However, it is unknown whether increased TIPE2 is protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether increased TIPE2 can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Three weeks later, ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into BALB/c mice. Twenty-four hours later, lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells and protein, arterial blood was collected for arterial blood gas analysis and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels, and lung issues were collected for histologic examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TUNEL staining, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. RESULTS: We found that TIPE2 overexpression markedly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury, which was evaluated by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio, and total protein expression in the BALF. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression markedly attenuated lung inflammation, as evidenced by the downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the BALF, lung MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression not only dramatically prevented LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice but also blocked LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the increased expression of AAV-mediated TIPE2 in the lungs of mice inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis and suppresses the activation of NF-κB and JNK in a murine model of ALI.","Wu, Xiaojing; Kong, Qian; Zhan, Liying; Qiu, Zhen; Huang, Qin; Song, Xuemin",Inflamm Res,309,1

However, the effects of PFCs on ischemia–reperfusion (IR)-induced lung injury have not been investigated. Typical acute lung injury was induced in rats by 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion in isolated and perfused rat lung model. Rat lungs were randomly assigned to receive PBS (control), 1 % FC-77, IR only, or IR with different doses of FC-77 (0.1 %, 0.5 %, or 1 %). Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), perfusate, and lung tissues were collected to evaluate the degree of lung injury. IR caused a significant increase in the following parameters: pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary filtration coefficient, lung weight gain, lung weight/body weight ratio, wet/dry lung weight ratio, and protein concentration in BALF. TNF-α and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 concentrations in perfusate samples and MDA concentration and MPO activities in lung tissues were also significantly increased. Histopathology showed increased septal thickness and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissues. Furthermore, NF-κB activity was significantly increased in the lungs. However, pretreatment with 1 % FC-77 prior to IR significantly attenuated the increases in these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that systemic FC-77 administration had a protective effect on IR-induced acute lung injury. These protective mechanisms may have been mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB activation and attenuation of subsequent inflammatory response.","Chu, Shi-Jye; Huang, Kun-Lun; Wu, Shu-Yu; Ko, Fu-Chang; Wu, Geng-Chin; Li, Rui-Ying; Li, Min-Hui",Inflammation,309,1

For a normal cellular immune response, the following conditions must be fulfilled: (1) accumulation of white blood cells, (2) their diapedesis through the vessel walls of the inflammatory area affected by an injurious agent, and (3) normal cellular effector functions in the tissue. This cascade of inflammatory processes has recently been shown to be regulated by a group of molecules that are termed adhesion molecules and consist of three subfamilies: selectins, the immunoglobulin supergene family, and integrins. The cellular functions influenced by adhesion molecules include, among others, cytotoxic T-cell responses, CD4-dependent activation of B lymphocytes by T lymphocytes, activation of granulocytes and macrophages, phagocytosis of opsonized particles by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, antigen-presenting function of macrophages, their antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, initiation of a respiratory burst by white blood cells, and activation of fibroblasts. Studies performed in recent years have shown that pathogenetically relevant changes in the expression and function of adhesion molecules are involved in a variety of pulmonary diseases. These changes include the accumulation and activation of alveolar macrophages in smokers, experimentally induced bronchial hyperreactivity in bronchial asthma, accumulation of eosinophils in allergic rhinitis, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, binding of viruses and bacteria to respiratory mucosa, and various mechanisms of acute damage to pulmonary parenchyma. Though their role in tumor development is still unclear, adhesion molecules are obviously involved in determining the route and organotropism of metastases.

The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world, and there is limited information about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the pulmonary findings belonging to a large CCHF patient cohort and to determine if there is any relationship between laboratory findings and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 165 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF and examined through chest X-ray (CXR) due to respiratory symptoms at their first examination and/or during their hospitalization were included in this study. In addition to demographical and laboratory findings of the patients, chest X-rays were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 165 patients examined, 96 were male (58.2%) and 69 were female (41.8%). The mean age was 51.64 ± 17.95 years (4–81 years). Single and/or multiple pathological findings were detected in 93 patients (56.4%) as a result of chest X-ray during their first examination.

METHODS: The orchidectomized (ORX) mice were orally administered with vehicle or captopril at low dose (10 mg/kg) and high dose (50 mg/kg) for six weeks. The distal femoral end, the proximal tibial head and the lumbar vertebra (LV) were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin O/Fast Green and masson-trichrome. Micro-computed tomography was performed to measure bone mineral density (BMD). RESULTS: Treatment with captopril increased trabecular bone area at distal metaphysis of femur, proximal metaphysis of tibia and LV-4, moreover, high dose of captopril significantly elevated trabecular BMD of LV-2 and LV-5. The mRNA expressions of renin receptor, angiotensinogen, carbonic anhydrase II, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased in tibia of ORX mice following treatment with captopril. The administration with captopril enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL mRNA expression, the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and the protein expression of bradykinin receptor-1.

In vitro labeled leukocyte imaging is the radionuclide procedure of choice for most infections in immunocompetent patients. When performed for musculoskeletal infection, complementary bone marrow imaging usually is necessary. Recent data suggest that dual time point imaging might be an alternative to marrow imaging. Several methods of labeling leukocytes in vivo, with agents including antigranulocyte antibodies and antibody fragments, peptides and cytokines, have been investigated, with variable results. These agents are not widely available and none of them are available in the USA. Radiolabeled antibiotics have been investigated as “infection-specific” tracers, but the results to date have been disappointing. Conversely, radiolabeled antimicrobial peptides do hold promise as infection-specific tracers.

Given the incomplete mechanistic understanding of environment-disease interactions, mathematical models that describe them have seldom included the effects of time-varying environmental processes on transmission dynamics and where they have been included, simple generic, periodic functions are usually used. Few examples exist where seasonal forcing functions describe the actual processes underlying the environmental drivers of disease dynamics. Transmission of human schistosomes, which involves multiple environmental stages, offers a model for applying our understanding of the environmental determinants of the viability, longevity, infectivity and mobility of these stages to controlling disease in diverse environments. Here, a mathematical model of schistosomiasis transmission is presented which incorporates the effects of environmental variables on transmission. Model dynamics are explored and several key extensions to the model are proposed.","Remais, Justin",Modelling Parasite Transmission and Control,309,1

Morpholinos are effective, specific, and lack non‐antisense effects. They work in any cell that transcribes and translates RNA, but must be delivered into the nuclear/cytosolic compartment to be effective. Morpholinos form stable base pairs with complementary nucleic acid sequences but apparently do not bind to proteins to a significant extent.

It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E‐related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV‐related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1–4. The discovery of new HEV or HEV‐related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV‐related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear. This review discusses aspects of the detection, molecular virology, zoonotic transmission and origin of HEV and HEV‐related viruses in the context of ‘One Health’ and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family.","Thiry, D.; Mauroy, A.; Pavio, N.; Purdy, M.

These effector leukocytes are equipped with intriguing antimicrobial machinery and consequently display high cytotoxic potential. Accurate neutrophil recruitment is essential to combat microbes and to restore homeostasis, for inflammation modulation and resolution, wound healing and tissue repair. After fulfilling the appropriate effector functions, however, dampening neutrophil activation and infiltration is crucial to prevent damage to the host. In humans, chemoattractant molecules can be categorized into four biochemical families, i.e., chemotactic lipids, formyl peptides, complement anaphylatoxins and chemokines. They are critically involved in the tight regulation of neutrophil bone marrow storage and egress and in spatial and temporal neutrophil trafficking between organs. Chemoattractants function by activating dedicated heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition, emerging evidence suggests an important role for atypical chemoattractant receptors (ACKRs) that do not couple to G proteins in fine-tuning neutrophil migratory and functional responses. The expression levels of chemoattractant receptors are dependent on the level of neutrophil maturation and state of activation, with a pivotal modulatory role for the (inflammatory) environment. Here, we provide an overview of chemoattractant receptors expressed by neutrophils in health and disease. Depending on the (patho)physiological context, specific chemoattractant receptors may be up- or downregulated on distinct neutrophil subsets with beneficial or detrimental consequences, thus opening new windows for the identification of disease biomarkers and potential drug targets.","Metzemaekers, Mieke; Gouwy, Mieke; Proost, Paul",Cell Mol Immunol,309,1

Both the general ability of the rtRPA reaction to occur while in contact with the cured 3D printing materials as well as the residual autofluorescence and fluorescence drift in dependence on post curing of the materials is characterized. We 3D printed monolithic rtRPA microreactors and subjected the devices to different post curing protocols. Residual autofluorescence and drift, as well as rtRPA kinetics, were then measured in a custom-made mobile temperature-controlled fluorescence reader (mTFR). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of storage on the devices over a 30-day period. Finally, we present the single- and duplex rtRPA detection of both the organism-specific Klebsiella haemolysin (khe) gene and the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (bla(NDM-1)) gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results: No combination of 3D printing resin and post curing protocol completely inhibited the rtRPA reaction. The autofluorescence and fluorescence drift measured were found to be highly dependent on printing material and wavelength. Storage had the effect of decreasing the autofluorescence of the investigated materials. Both khe and bla(NDM-1) were successfully detected by single- and duplex-rtRPA inside monolithic rtRPA microreactors printed from NextDent Ortho Clear (NXOC). The reaction kinetics were found to be close to those observed for rtRPA performed in a microcentrifuge tube without the need for mixing during amplification. Singleplex assays for both khe and bla(NDM-1) achieved a limit of detection of 2.5 × 10(1) DNA copies while the duplex assay achieved 2.5 × 10(1) DNA copies for khe and 2.5 × 10(2) DNA copies for bla(NDM-1). Impact: We expand on the state of the art by demonstrating a technology that can manufacture monolithic microfluidic devices that are readily suitable for rtRPA. The devices exhibit very low autofluorescence and fluorescence drift and are compatible with RPA chemistry without the need for any surface pre-treatment such as blocking with, e.g., BSA or PEG.","Behrmann, Ole; Hügle, Matthias; Eckardt, Franz; Bachmann, Iris; Heller, Cecilia; Schramm, Marina; Turner, Carrie; Hufert, Frank T.; Dame, Gregory",Micromachines (Basel),309,1

Atherosclerotic changes, the primary pathological substrate for CVD, are closely related to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is a key therapeutic strategy for CVD management. Statins, as the gold standard in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have shown enhanced cardiac outcomes in many randomized clinical trials. However, often despite the maximum allowed and tolerated dosage of statins, we are not able to reach the target cholesterol levels, and thus patients persist at an increased cardiovascular risk. Recently, most of the large clinical studies in the field of preventive cardiology have focused on proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its activity regulation. PCSK9 plays an essential role in the metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor recirculation to the cell surface. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of PCSK9 by the administration of monoclonal antibodies is capable of significantly reducing LDL levels (up to an additional 60%) as well as reducing the incidence of CVD. However, this treatment procedure of administering the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, most frequently two times a month, has its limitations in terms of time, patient adherence, and nevertheless cost. Administration of active vaccination instead of passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies may be an effective way of controlling blood cholesterol levels. However, clinical data, as well as human testing, are still inadequate. This work aims to provide an overview of PCSK9 vaccines and their potential clinical benefit.","Toth, Stefan; Pella, Dominik; Fedacko, Jan",Cardiol Ther,309,1

Temozolomide (TMZ) is the common chemotherapeutic agent used for GBM treatment. We recently demonstrated that simvastatin (Simva) increases TMZ-induced apoptosis via the inhibition of autophagic flux in GBM cells. Considering the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in the regulation of autophagy, we investigated the involvement of UPR in Simva–TMZ-induced cell death by utilizing highly selective IRE1 RNase activity inhibitor MKC8866, PERK inhibitor GSK-2606414 (PERKi), and eIF2α inhibitor salubrinal. Simva–TMZ treatment decreased the viability of GBM cells and significantly increased apoptotic cell death when compared to TMZ or Simva alone. Simva–TMZ induced both UPR, as determined by an increase in GRP78, XBP splicing, eukaryote initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, and inhibited autophagic flux (accumulation of LC3β-II and inhibition of p62 degradation). IRE1 RNase inhibition did not affect Simva–TMZ-induced cell death, but it significantly induced p62 degradation and increased the microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3)β-II/LC3β-I ratio in U87 cells, while salubrinal did not affect the Simva–TMZ induced cytotoxicity of GBM cells. In contrast, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) inhibition significantly increased Simva–TMZ-induced cell death in U87 cells. Interestingly, whereas PERK inhibition induced p62 accumulation in both GBM cell lines, it differentially affected the LC3β-II/LC3β-I ratio in U87 (decrease) and U251 (increase) cells. Simvastatin sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ-induced cell death via a mechanism that involves autophagy and UPR pathways. More specifically, our results imply that the IRE1 and PERK signaling arms of the UPR regulate Simva–TMZ-mediated autophagy flux inhibition in U251 and U87 GBM cells.","Dastghaib, Sanaz; Shojaei, Shahla; Mostafavi-Pour, Zohreh; Sharma, Pawan; Patterson, John B.; Samali, Afshin; Mokarram, Pooneh; Ghavami, Saeid",Cells,309,1

We aimed to reconstruct global, regional, and national mortality trends for youths aged 15–24 years between 1990 and 2019. METHODS: In this systematic analysis, we used all publicly available data on mortality in the age group 15–24 years for 195 countries, as compiled by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. We used nationally representative vital registration data, estimated the completeness of death registration, and extracted mortality rates from surveys with sibling histories, household deaths reported in censuses, and sample registration systems. We used a Bayesian B-spline bias-reduction model to generate trends in (10)q(15), the probability that an adolescent aged 15 years would die before reaching age 25 years. This model treats observations of the (10)q(15) probability as the product of the actual risk of death and an error multiplier that varies depending on the data source. The main outcome that we assessed was the levels of and trends in youth mortality and the global and regional mortality rates from 1990 to 2019. FINDINGS: Globally, the probability of an individual dying between age 15 years and 24 years was 11·2 deaths (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 10·7–12·5) per 1000 youths aged 15 in 2019, which is about 2·5 times less than infant mortality (28·2 deaths [27·2–30·0] by age 1 year per 1000 live births) but is higher than the risk of dying from age 1 to 5 (9·7 deaths [9·1–11·1] per 1000 children aged 1 year). The probability of dying between age 15 years and 24 years declined by 1·4% per year (90% UI 1·1–1·8) between 1990 and 2019, from 17·1 deaths (16·5–18·9) per 1000 in 1990; by contrast with this total decrease of 34% (27–41), under-5 mortality declined by 59% (56–61) in this period. The annual number of deaths declined from 1·7 million (90% UI 1·7–1·9) in 1990 to 1·4 million (1·3–1·5) in 2019. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of deaths increased by 20·8% from 1990 to 2019. Although 18·3% of the population aged 15–24 years were living in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019, the region accounted for 37·9% (90% UI 34·8–41·9) of all worldwide deaths in youth. INTERPRETATION: It is urgent to accelerate progress in reducing youth mortality. Efforts are particularly needed in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of mortality is increasingly concentrated. In the future, a growing number of countries will see youth mortality exceeding under-5 mortality if current trends continue.

Ten coronary artery specimens from a subject who died from a heart attack were employed. The pathological analysis was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified by RNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to predict possible mechanisms. The proliferation and migration of HCASMCs were induced with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, 68 lncRNAs and 222 mRNAs were identified differentially expressed in atherosclerosis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that the Fanconi anemia pathway may be involved in atherosclerosis. GON4L was found to be the co-localized target gene of LNC_000439, and 14 genes had high correlations with the expression of seven lncRNAs. In addition, nine lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA networks were constructed, and 53 co-expressed gene modules were detected with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). LNC_000684, LNC_001046, LNC_001333, LNC_001538, and LNC_002115 were downregulated, while LNC_002936 was upregulated in proliferation and migration models of HCASMCs. In total, six co-expressed mRNAs were upregulated in HCASMCs. This study suggests that the differentially expressed lncRNAs identified by RNA sequencing and validated in smooth muscle cells may be a target for regulating HCASMC proliferation and migration in atherosclerosis, which will provide a new diagnostic basis and therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Zhou, Yaqing; Zhang, Sheng; Ji, Wenfeng; Gan, Xiongkang; Hua, Lei; Hou, Can; Chen, Jiaxin; Wang, Yanjun; He, Shu; Zhou, Hanxiao; Jia, Enzhi",Front Cell Dev Biol,309,1

Proper formation of the external genitalia requires a highly orchestrated process that involves special cell populations and sexually dimorphic hormone signaling. It is clear what the end result of the sexually dimorphic development is (a penis in the male versus clitoris in the female); however, the cell populations involved in the process remain poorly defined. Here, we used single-cell messenger RNA sequencing in mouse embryos to uncover the dynamic changes in cell populations in the external genitalia during the critical morphogenetic window. We found that overall, male and female external genitalia are largely composed of the same core cellular components. At the bipotential stage of development (embryonic day or E14.5), few differences in cell populational composition exist between male and female. Although similar in cell population composition, genetic differences in key sexual differentiation developmental pathways arise between males and females by the early (E16.5) and late (E18.5) differentiation stages. These differences include discrete cell populations with distinct responsiveness to androgen and estrogen. By late sexual differentiation (E18.5), unique cell populations in both male and female genitalia become apparent and are enriched with androgen- and estrogen-responsive genes, respectively. These data provide insights into the morphogenesis of the external genitalia that could be used to understand diseases associated with defects in the external genitalia.","Amato, Ciro Maurizio; Yao, Humphrey Hung-Chang",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,309,13

Relative age effects (RAE) impact athlete selection processes in the short and long-term performance. The aims of this study were: (i) examine the presence of RAE by gender, competitive level, and playing position, as well as evaluate the impact of RAE on individual (goals, percentage of effectiveness in shots, saves; percentage of effectiveness in saves, assists, turnovers, steals, blocked shots, penalties, minutes played, and minutes played per match) and collective competition performance (final team position); and (ii) analyse the impact of RAE on the evolutionary trends of individual performance in international competitions throughout 16 seasons in Spanish handball (2005–2020). Methods: The sample included 631 Spanish handball players (male: n = 359; female: n = 272). A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to assess whether a skewed birthdate distribution occurred. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of independent measures was used to examine the individual and collective statistical parameters by birth quartiles. A linear regression in a Hopkins sheet were performed to compare individual performance trends. Results: The results revealed RAE in the male formative categories (p < 0.001), as well as the male and female senior categories (p < 0.05). By position, RAE especially affected the “centre-back” in the male formative (p < 0.01) and senior categories (p < 0.05). No significant relationship between RAE and individual performance was found in male formative categories, while an impact of RAE on the “minutes played” was detected in the female senior category (p < 0.05). With regard to collective performance, a higher number of relatively older handball players was observed in the best ranked teams in the male formative categories and in the quarter-final teams in the female formative categories (p < 0.05). Among the male players, relatively older players spent more minutes on the court than relatively younger players, although this advantage dissipated over time and did not lead to better performance. Among the female players, relatively younger players were found to perform better as the level of competitive handball increased. Discussion: These findings are important for talent identification and development policies in sport federations and other elite sport institutions by demonstrating the many unintended consequences of selections to international competitions at the youth level.","de la Rubia, Alfonso; Lorenzo, Alberto; Bjørndal, Christian Thue; Kelly, Adam Leigh; García-Aliaga, Abraham; Lorenzo-Calvo, Jorge",Front Psychol,309,1

Furthermore, the AMR profiles and major virulence genes of 505 E. coli strains isolated from 1-week- and 2-week-old calves were examined, with a comparison made between those treated with antimicrobials (n = 406) and not treated (n = 99) as well as between the two age groups to evaluate the potential effects of treatments on AMR and pathogenicity. Resistance to tetracycline was the most common, followed by resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and flumequine. Treated calves showed a higher rate of AMR and virulence genes. These results highlight the risk of the frequent use of antimicrobials on calf microflora in leading to potentially ineffective treatments. A higher resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, and florfenicol was found in 1-week-old calves, suggesting the environment as a possible AMR source. In conclusion, measures such as improved hygiene in the calving pen, antimicrobial stewardship, and monitoring for resistant pathogens in manure should be promoted to prevent the spread of AMR. ABSTRACT: The health problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) involves several species. AMR surveillance is essential to identify its development and design control strategies; however, available data are still limited in some contexts. The AMR profiles of 2612 E. coli strains isolated over a period of 15 years (2002–2016) from calf enteric cases were analyzed to determine the presence of resistance and their temporal dynamics. Furthermore, the AMR profiles and the presence of the major virulence genes of 505 E. coli strains isolated from 1-week- and 2-week-old calves, 406 treated with antimicrobials and 99 untreated, were analyzed and compared to investigate the potential effects of treatment on AMR and strain pathogenicity. Resistance to tetracycline (90.70%) was the most common, followed by resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (77.70%) and flumequine (72.10%). The significantly higher percentage of AMR and virulence gene expression recorded in treated calves, combined with the statistically higher resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in E. coli with K99, corroborates the notion of resistance being induced by the frequent use of antimicrobials, leading to treatments potentially becoming ineffective. The significantly higher resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, and florfenicol in isolates from 1-week-old calves suggests the role of the environment as a source of contamination that should be investigated further.","Formenti, Nicoletta; Martinelli, Chiara; Vitale, Nicoletta; Giovannini, Stefano; Salogni, Cristian; Tonni, Matteo; Scali, Federico; Birbes, Laura; D’Incau, Mario; Guarneri, Flavia; Pasquali, Paolo; Alborali, Giovanni Loris",Animals (Basel),309,1

Moreover, early life stress has been associated with substance use initiation at a younger age, a risk factor for developing substance use disorders. However, no studies to date have investigated whether NR3C1 methylation can predict substance use in young individuals. This study included adolescents 13–14 years of age that reported no history of substance use at baseline, (N = 1041; males = 46%). Participants contributed saliva DNA samples and were followed in middle adolescence as part of KUPOL, a prospective cohort study of 7th-grade students in Sweden. Outcome variables were self-reports of (i) recent use, (ii) lifetime use, and (iii) use duration of (a) alcohol, (b) tobacco products, (c) cannabis, or (d) any substance. Outcomes were measured annually for three consecutive years. The predictor variable was DNA methylation at the exon 1 F locus of NR3C1. Risk and rate ratios were calculated as measures of association, with or without adjustment for internalizing symptoms and parental psychiatric disorders. For a subset of individuals (N = 320), there were also morning and afternoon salivary cortisol measurements available that were analyzed in relation to NR3C1 methylation levels. Baseline NR3C1 hypermethylation associated with future self-reports of recent use and use duration of any substance, before and after adjustment for potential confounders. The overall estimates were attenuated when considering lifetime use. Sex-stratified analyses revealed the strongest association for cigarette use in males. Cortisol analyses revealed associations between NR3C1 methylation and morning cortisol levels. Findings from this study suggest that saliva NR3C1 hypermethylation can predict substance use in middle adolescence. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","Raffetti, Elena; Melas, Philippe Anastasios; Landgren, Anton Jonatan; Andersson, Filip; Forsell, Yvonne; Lavebratt, Catharina; Galanti, Maria Rosaria",Transl Psychiatry,309,1

Here, we propose an innovative 3D-printed fMRI mouthpiece inspired by children’s pacifiers, allowing human participants to swallow while lying down in an MRI scanner. We used a large sample to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results suggest that the mouthpiece can be used to deliver taste stimuli by showing significant clusters of activation in the insular and piriform cortex, which are regions that have been consistently identified in taste processing. This mouthpiece fulfills several criteria guaranteeing a gustatory stimulus of quality, making the delivery precise and reliable. Moreover, this new pacifier-shaped design is simple and cheap to manufacture, hygienic, comfortable to keep in the mouth, and flexible to use in diverse cases. We hope that this new method will promote and facilitate the study of taste and flavor perception in the context of reward processing in affective neuroscience, and thus, help provide an integrative approach to the study of the emotional nature of rewards.","Munoz Tord, David; Coppin, Géraldine; Pool, Eva R.; Mermoud, Christophe; Pataky, Zoltan; Sander, David; Delplanque, Sylvain",eNeuro,309,1

Our objective was to identify health and management factors affecting swine performance. A1998 survey found six leptospirosis serovars and parvovirus and heavy parasites loads, but no brucellosis or pseudorabies. Our 2016 Artificial Insemination Training focused on improving genetics and resulted in 12 sows bred and 103 piglets born. Oour 2017 Swine Farm Evaluation surveyed 26 farms with an average of 9 sows per farm. Serological samples were tested for antibodies against Porcine Circovirus Type 2b (ELISA, 96% positive), Swine Influenza (ELISA, 31%), Senecavirus (IFA, 27%), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (ELISA, 15%), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (IFA, 15%), and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (ELISA, 4%, 1 pig). o evidence was seen of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (ELISA), Transmissable Gastroenteritis (ELISA) or Pseudorabies (SN). Fecal samples contained Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Stephanurus dentatus, and, less commonly, Strongyles nodular worm, Stronglyloides, Brachylaemus suis, Necator species, Trichuris suis, and Fasciolopsis buski. Ear scrapings and scratching behavior indicated the presence of sarcoptic mange (31% of farms). Most farms fed a 14% grain feed (88% of farms) and local feeds (coconut, vegetables, fruits, 69%); only one farm fed an 18% starter and one fed milk to young pigs. One or more thin pigs were seen on 46% of farms. Waste is managed either by wash down (85% of farms) or as dry litter (42%); some farms used both. Wastewater concerns led to water restriction on 12% of farms. In conclusion, parasites and suboptimal feeding are constraints on pig growth and performance. Management recommendations to improve production should address these, in addition to improving health and genetics.","Zaleski, H; Petznick, T; Hansell, M; Uta, F; Gurr, I",Journal of Animal Science,309,1

Validated CFD methods in the steady-state RANS framework are employed. In general, the reentry ratios of pollutant from a source unit to adjacent units are mostly in the order of 0.1%, but there are still many cases being in the order of 1%. The influence of envelope features is dependent strongly on the interaction between local wind direction and envelope feature. In a downward dominated near-facade flow field, the presence of vertical envelope features forms dispersion channels to intensify the unidirectional spread. Horizontal envelope features help induce the dilution of pollutant to the main stream and weakens largely the vertical interunit dispersion. The large influences caused by the presence of envelope features extend the existing understanding of interunit dispersion based on flat-facade buildings.","Cui, Dongjin; Ai, Zhengtao; Mak, Cheuk-ming; Kwok, Kenny; Xue, Peng",Build Simul,309,1

The invasion phenomena of epidemics have been of tremendous interest among the scientific community over many years, due to its large scale implementation in real world networks. This chapter seeks to make readers understand the critical issues involved in epidemics such as propagation, spread and their combat which can be further used to design synthetic and robust network architectures. The primary concern in this chapter focuses on the concept of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) models with their implementation in scale-free networks, followed by developing strategies for identifying the damage caused in the network. The relevance of this chapter can be understood when methods discussed in this chapter could be related to contemporary networks for improving their performance in terms of robustness. The patterns by which epidemics spread through groups are determined by the properties of the pathogen carrying it, length of its infectious period, its severity as well as by network structures within the population. Thus, accurately modeling the underlying network is crucial to understand the spread as well as prevention of an epidemic. Moreover, implementing immunization strategies helps control and terminate theses epidemics.","Tagore, Somnath",Propagation Phenomena in Real World Networks,309,1

Combating such global diseases requires in-depth knowledge of their epidemiology. The only practical method for discovering global epidemiological knowledge and identifying prophylactic strategies is simulation. However, several interrelated factors, including increasing model complexity, stochastic nature of diseases, and short analysis timeframes render exhaustive analysis an infeasible task. An effective approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues and enable efficient epidemiological analysis is to manually steer bio-simulations to scenarios of interest. Selective steering preserves causality, inter-dependencies, and stochastic characteristics in the model better than “seeding”, i.e., manually setting simulation state. Accordingly, we have developed a novel Eco-modeling and bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The bio-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS permits a human-in-the-loop to steer the simulation to scenarios of interest so that epidemics can be effectively modeled and analyzed. This article discusses mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS along with its software architecture and design. In addition, the article also presents the bio-simulations and multi-faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS to elucidate its ability to forecast timelines, epicenters, and socio-economic impacts of epidemics. Currently, the primary emphasis of SEARUMS is to ease global epidemiological analysis of avian influenza. However, the methodology is sufficiently generic and it can be adapted for other epidemiological analysis required to effectively combat various diseases.","Rao, Dhananjai M.; Chernyakhovsky, Alexander; Rao, Victoria",Human-in-the-Loop Simulations,309,33

Moreover, with the pressure of zoos to become biological conservation mentors, zoos assume five roles as the executor of the relationship between society and nature. First, zoos take on the role of the “model citizen” by conveying a conservation message. They advocate for a sensible, sustainable use of natural resources and promote less wasteful, green-building alternatives. Many zoological institutions are developing organizational plans that include the use of solar, wind, and thermal power in their daily operations. Additionally, they are growing food for the animals, composting, and using recycled materials in their exhibit design. Second, zoos are maintaining a viable and genetically diverse collection. Zoos are managed under the premise that wildlife conservation is of foremost importance. As zoological institutions have become more active in field studies, their research findings are being applied to larger conservation efforts. Moreover, the conservation research that takes place in situ and ex situ is important in saving small fragmented wild populations. Third, zoos directly influence the attitudes and behaviors of the community in relation to the conservation of plants, animals, and habitats. Due to their urban locations within heavily populated cities, zoos have a unique geographic placement within the community. The urban location of zoos provides them with a unique opportunity to influence government policy. Fourth, the zoo is a conservation mentor. Through mentoring efforts, future generations of scientists and citizens will be more aware of the benefits of long-term conservation. As conservation mentors, zoos must lead the public to become citizen conservationist. Fifth, zoos are a place for people to learn basic facts about organisms and their behavior.","Patrick, Patricia G.; Tunnicliffe, Sue Dale",Zoo Talk,309,1

By the time diarrhoea begin, different types of rotavirus particules are present in the enterocytes of the mucosa, and mucus contents of distal intestine are affected. At this stage of the disease, the virus causes epithelial cells in the small intestine to desquamate and changes the secretion of mucus in the small as well as the large intestine.

Non—centered principal component analysis plus varimax rotation (nodal component analysis) is applied to overstory and understory data in order to detect vegetational noda. The overstory data are inherently more structured (i.e., contain more distinct subgroups) than those of the understory. An exception is seen with groups in which Abies balsamea plays a prominent role. These are interpreted as stages in various successions of which only one, a Betula papyrifera to A. balsamea sequence, represents the complete transition from one canopy dominant to another. The understory noda are summarized in terms of the compositional and environmental features of stands belonging to each nodum. Relationships among the understory noda are summarized in a multidimensional scaling ordination which is derived directly from similarity values (conjunction coefficients) representing the overlap between pairs of noda. Two major environmental gradients seem to affect understory composition. These are a site moisture—nutrient concentration gradient and a general fertility—productivity gradient. Canopy composition and understory vegetation are compared by nodal conjunction between the two analyses. Groups of noda, representing wet bog forests and also upland mesic forests, show moderate to good coincidence but beyond this little canopy specificity emerges. These results indicate that overstory—understory coincidence is due primarily to similar site requirements. Understory species' response to an overstory succession is examined. Many abundant herbs seem indifferent to dramatic canopy change. This observation and results from nodal component analysis are discussed with respect to forest fire.","Carleton, T. J.; Maycock, P.

Although succession was essentially continuous, 5 faunal groups are suggested, based on time of appearance and duration of active forms in the pond. Some species were found during virtually the entire aquatic phase, while others completed their life cycles in only 2‐3 weeks. Analysis of growth rates revealed many different patterns between species and groups. Analysis of community structure in terms of trophic status indicated shifts which coincided with the seasonal occurrence of the pond's potential food resources. Comparison of this fauna with that of a similar pond on Vancouver Island, British Columbia (some 2,400 km to the west) showed many similarities in niche occupancy, including 6 species in common. The biological characteristics leading to the success of these cosmopolitan species in temporary aquatic habitats is discussed.","Williams, D. Dudley",,309,1

The inability to effectively contain the virus indicates that our investment and attention in research, prevention, and treatment development for this type of deadly viruses is insufficient, considering it has been 17 years since the brother coronavirus, SARS-CoV outbreak. The biggest lesson learned from the acrimonious past experiences is that humans quickly lose memory and do not continue to support related research when a pandemic is gone. It is the very time for the government, industry, and private foundations to work together to respond to this wake-up call and to take extraordinary measures to sustain the research support and establish comprehensive research centers.

Innate immunity mediated by neutrophils, NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells, complement and microbicidal molecules prevents infection or slows it until adaptive immunity can also respond to the pathogen. Extracellular entities are coated in antibody and cleared by antibody- and complement-mediated mechanisms. Parasitic worms are prevented from anchoring in the host by IgA and IgE antibodies. IgE triggers mast cell, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and the release of toxic mediators. Intracellular bacteria and parasites as well as viruses are eliminated by CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells and γδ T cells secreting cytotoxic cytokines and/or carrying out target cell cytolysis. Macrophage hyperactivation and granuloma formation may be triggered to confine persistent invaders. Th1 and Th17 responses support cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, whereas Th2 responses support humoral immunity against external threats. Each type of pathogen has evolved to evade immune responses by avoiding recognition or inactivating various leukocyte effector mechanisms.",,Primer to the Immune Response,309,1

SOURCES: The main source of data and information for this review was peer-reviewed literature. SYNTHESIS: Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS: Colostrum and transition milk contain an abundance of bioactive molecules that can positively affect gut development and microbiota. There is significant potential for the use of novel feeding strategies and microbial-based products as alternatives to antibiotics. Calves fed an elevated plane of nutrition in the first month of life have greater productivity and growth. However, weaning should take place later in life. Moreover, applying a proper step-down feeding protocol is recommended, as it allows calves to intake and digest sufficient solid feed for growth and minimize distress at weaning.","Fischer, A.J.; Villot, C.; van Niekerk, J.K.; Yohe, T.T.; Renaud, D.L.; Steele, M.A.",,309,1

In such a small area, Taiwan has built 22 incinerators over a short span of time, combusting large amount of municipal solid waste as much as 23,250 tons per day. This study focuses on the history of construction and development of incinerators in Taiwan as well as the characteristics of pollutants, such as heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg), acid gases (NO(x), SO(x), CO, and HCl), and dioxins emitted from the incinerators. Furthermore, the study also covers the generation and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW), and the production of energy in Taiwan. According to Taiwan’s data on pollutant emissions, the emission level of pollutants is under control and meets the stringent regulations of Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Researches have shown that using air pollution control devices (APCDs) in the operation of incinerators provides effective measures for air pollutant control in Taiwan. The main advantage of using incinerators is the generation of electricity (waste-to-energy) during the incineration of municipal solid waste, producing energy that can be consumed by the general public and the industry. Taiwan’s extensive experience in incinerator construction and operation may serve as an example for developing countries in devising waste treatment technology, energy recovery, and the control of contagious viral diseases.","Kuo, Jia-Hong; Tseng, Hui-Hsin; Rao, P.

Such observation has made many people believe that the low-income countries may be more immune to COVID-19. Theories such as warm climate, weaker strain of the virus, and cross-protection by malaria have been popularly put forward. One such interesting theory is that since the general people of the low- income countries are mostly habituated to dwell in lesser hygienic condition and with lesser medical attention throughout their lifetime; hence, they have naturally acquired better immunity and more resilience against many infective diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sought to investigate the above claim by comparing the case fatality rate (CFR) as well as number of cases per million population versus the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity per capita of different countries. RESULTS: We found that while the number of cases showed a slight decline in the lower-income countries, the CFR was independent of the financial condition of the country. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the theory of better immunity in economically poor countries is a misconception. We suggest that people must come out of these misconceptions and resort to strict home isolation.","Roy, Soumya",Indian J Med Sci,309,1

To address this challenge, in this paper we present the first study of entity summarization with user feedback. We consider a cooperative environment where a user reads the current entity summary and provides feedback to help an entity summarizer compute an improved summary. Our approach represents this iterative process as a Markov decision process where the entity summarizer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent. To exploit user feedback, we represent the interdependence of triples in the current summary and the user feedback by a novel deep neural network which is incorporated into the policy of the agent.

Ventilator under-assist may lead to muscle injury, while over-assist may result in muscle atrophy. This provides a good rationale to monitor respiratory drive in ventilated patients. Respiratory drive can be monitored by a nasogastric catheter, either with esophageal balloon to determine muscular pressure (gold standard) or with electrodes to measure electrical activity of the diaphragm. A disadvantage is that both techniques are invasive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the role of surrogate markers for respiratory dive, such as extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of different inspiratory support levels on the recruitment pattern of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles with respect to the diaphragm and to evaluate agreement between activity of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm. METHODS: Activity from the alae nasi, genioglossus, scalene, sternocleidomastoid and parasternal intercostals was recorded using surface electrodes. Electrical activity of the diaphragm was measured using a multi-electrode nasogastric catheter. Pressure support (PS) levels were reduced from 15 to 3 cmH(2)O every 5 min with steps of 3 cmH(2)O. The magnitude and timing of respiratory muscle activity were assessed. RESULTS: We included 17 ventilated patients. Diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity increased in response to lower PS levels (36 ± 6% increase for the diaphragm, 30 ± 6% parasternal intercostals, 41 ± 6% scalene, 40 ± 8% sternocleidomastoid, 43 ± 6% alae nasi and 30 ± 6% genioglossus). Changes in diaphragm activity correlated best with changes in alae nasi activity (r(2) = 0.49; P < 0.001), while there was no correlation between diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid activity. The agreement between diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity was low due to a high individual variability. Onset of alae nasi activity preceded the onset of all other muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity increases in response to lower inspiratory support levels. However, there is a poor correlation and agreement with the change in diaphragm activity, limiting the use of surface electromyography (EMG) recordings of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles as a surrogate for electrical activity of the diaphragm.","Roesthuis, L.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate characteristics and outcomes of newly developed stroke in patients admitted to the non-neurological intensive care units (ICU-onset stroke, IOS). METHODS: A consecutive series of adult patients who were admitted to the non-neurological ICU were included in this study. We compared neurological profiles, risk factors, and mortality rates between patients with IOS and those without IOS. RESULTS: Of 18,604 patients admitted to the ICU for non-neurological illness, 218 (1.2%) developed stroke (ischemic, n = 182; hemorrhagic, n = 36). The most common neurological presentation was altered mental status (n = 149), followed by hemiparesis (n = 55), and seizures (n = 28). The most common etiology of IOS was cardioembolism (50% [91/182]) for ischemic IOS and coagulopathy (67% [24/36]) for hemorrhagic IOS. In multivariable analysis, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.06, P < 0.001), prothrombin time (AOR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98−0.99, P = 0.013), cardiovascular surgery (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.34−2.50, P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (AOR = 6.75, 95% CI = 4.87−9.45, P < 0.001), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.62−4.55, P < 0.001) were related to the development of IOS. Stroke was associated with increased 3-month mortality after hospital discharge (AOR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.58–3.05; P < 0.001), after adjustment for APACHE II and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who developed IOS had characteristics of initial critical illness and managements performed in the ICU as well as neurological presentations.

The brief analysis reveals that agricultural access to bulk ocean freight, rail movement, and trucking has generally improved in the pandemic, bolstered by the reduced demand for these transportation services by other sectors of the economy. The intermodal containerized movement of grains and food products has seen some disruption from the lack of empty containers in North America. The widespread consumer adoption of physical distancing measures has vastly increased the demand for retail food pickup and delivery services to the point where these services are being rationed by long wait times.

This paper proposes a summary of CCT contributions on extraordinary experiences and emphasizes the way these works have used the structural/anti-structural coexistence theory to depict the experiences consumers live through. Then it mobilizes a fiction to improve the understanding of escape.

However, when no one can or does care for vulnerable populations such as children, the mentally and physically disabled, and the elderly, the responsibility falls on the state to protect its citizens. Maltreatment falls into four categories: physical abuse, sexual abuse and exploitation, psychological abuse, and neglect. When an instance of maltreatment is confirmed and other interventions are unsuccessful, the state may assume care and responsibility of children or other vulnerable members. This leads to placement in foster homes or group homes for the children, or assisted living facilities for the adults. Each state has a department focused on family services to oversee these placements and services for the vulnerable individual, as well as to provide services to help the family regain custody and care. Although resources do not ever seem to be entirely sufficient, treatment programs for substance-abusing parents, parent education programs, and guardianship programs for the elderly are all among various interventions across the states in some form or another.","Walker, Lenore E.; Shapiro, David; Akl, Stephanie",Introduction to Forensic Psychology,309,1

Data assimilation (DA) methods aim to best approximate model states with imperfect measurements, where particle Filters (PFs) are commonly used with discrete-event simulations. In this paper, we study three critical conditions of DA using PFs: (1) the time interval of iterations, (2) the number of particles and (3) the level of actual and perceived measurement errors (or noises), and provide recommendations on how to strategically use data assimilation for DDDS considering these conditions. The results show that the estimation accuracy in DA is more constrained by the choice of time intervals than the number of particles. Good accuracy can be achieved without many particles if the time interval is sufficiently short. An over estimation of the level of measurement errors has advantages over an under estimation. Moreover, a slight over estimation has better estimation accuracy and is more responsive to system changes than an accurate perceived level of measurement errors.","Cho, Yubin; Huang, Yilin; Verbraeck, Alexander",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,309,1

We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in a neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary academic medical center from January 2014 to December 2018. Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU who underwent resection of infratentorial lesions as well as tracheostomy were included for analysis. Early tracheostomy was defined as performed on postoperative days 1–10 and late tracheostomy on days 10–20 after operation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the characteristics and outcomes between both cohorts. A total of 143 patients were identified, and 96 patients received early tracheostomy. Multivariable analysis identified early tracheostomy as an independent variable associated with lower occurrence of pneumonia (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09–0.73; p = 0.011), shorter stays in ICUs (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3–0.6; p = 0.03), and earlier decannulation (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4–0.8; p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were observed between the early and late tracheostomy groups regarding hospital mortality (p > 0.999) and the modified Rankin scale after 6 months (p = 0.543). We also identified postoperative brainstem deficits, including cough, swallowing attempts, and extended tongue as well as GCS < 8 at ICU admission as the risk factors independently associated with patients underwent tracheostomy.

African American (AA) children are more obese than White peers and experience many factors that can influence the onset of depressive symptoms. While depression and obesity have been examined in adolescents, there is a paucity of research in AA children. This study examined the relationships among depressive symptoms, obesity, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children. A community sample of 65 AA children completed questionnaires for depressive symptoms and physical activity self-efficacy and also had body mass index (BMI) and BMI Z-scores calculated. Correlational statistics were used to examine associations between variables. Clinically significant total depression scores were present in 22% of children, while 48% were overweight or obese. Overall, children reported high physical activity self-efficacy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher BMI Z-scores. Results also indicated significant correlations between the children’s physical activity self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the associations between depressive symptoms, BMI, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children merit additional examination. Early identification of depression in children may inform future approaches to treatment of psychological and physiological problems within the clinical setting. Screening for childhood depressive symptoms in primary care settings, especially those that specifically treat childhood obesity, can be instrumental in early identification of children with depression.

Few studies combining parasitology and entomology have been conducted despite the need for accurate information to design effective vector control measures. In a Malagasy region of moderate to intense transmission of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, parasitology and entomology have been combined to survey malaria transmission in two nearby villages. METHODS: Community-based surveys were conducted in the villages of Ambohitromby and Miarinarivo at three time points (T1, T2 and T3) during a single malaria transmission season. Human malaria prevalence was determined by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy and real-time PCR. Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches and pyrethrum spray catches and the presence of Plasmodium sporozoites was assessed by TaqMan assay. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence was not significantly different between villages, with an average of 8.0% by RDT, 4.8% by microscopy and 11.9% by PCR. This was mainly due to P. falciparum and to a lesser extent to P. vivax. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence rate as determined by PCR at T2 ([Formula: see text] = 7.46, P = 0.025). Likewise, mosquitoes were significantly more abundant at T2 ([Formula: see text] = 64.8, P < 0.001), especially in Ambohitromby. At T1 and T3 mosquito abundance was higher in Miarinarivo than in Ambohitromby ([Formula: see text] = 14.92, P < 0.001). Of 1550 Anopheles mosquitoes tested, 28 (1.8%) were found carrying Plasmodium sporozoites. The entomological inoculation rate revealed that Anopheles coustani played a major contribution in malaria transmission in Miarinarivo, being responsible of 61.2 infective bites per human (ib/h) during the whole six months of the survey, whereas, it was An. arabiensis, with 36 ib/h, that played that role in Ambohitromby. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a similar malaria prevalence in two nearby villages, the entomological survey showed a different contribution of An. coustani and An. arabiensis to malaria transmission in each village. Importantly, the suspected secondary malaria vector An. coustani, was found playing the major role in malaria transmission in one village. This highlights the importance of combining parasitology and entomology surveys for better targeting local malaria vectors. Such study should contribute to the malaria pre-elimination goal established under the 2018–2022 National Malaria Strategic Plan.

Increasingly, these interventions are provided by staff with different levels of psychological training, such as assistant psychologists (APs). However, there is limited qualitative understanding regarding their experiences of providing technology-assisted CBT. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with APs (n = 14) in primary care settings in Ireland. This qualitative evaluation is part of an ongoing RCT for the CBT game Pesky gNATs (O’Reilly and Coyle, 2015). All data were inductively analysed using qualitative thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke (2006). RESULTS: Five overarching themes were identified: 1) positive experiences, 2) integrating Pesky gNATs with traditional CBT, 3) managing parental ‘buy-in’, 4) implementation complexities, and 5) future perspectives.

Politicalized religious interpretations are also on board to investigate their missionary aspects. I design my argument based on Michael Barnett and Janice Grass Stein’s assumption on the impact of social constructions on establishing sacred and secular concepts and spaces. Thus, I study the UK-based Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) and the Kuwaiti Direct Aid Society (DAS) to examine the influence of their social settings on their humanitarian experiences. My question is “do different social settings shape various humanitarian approach, although of sharing the same religious mission?” I argue that Islamic rules encourage Muslims to be religiously committed to paying charity and showing human and religious solidarity. In this regard, flexible Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence) allows Muslima to set various socially constructed implementations of these religious commitments. Humanitarian relief is not an exception in this regard. Therefore, Islamic FBOs lay down on a continuum based on their socially constructed models which reflect different interpretations of religious texts and their applications to understanding societal issues as well as various employed strategies of these civil society actors.","Khafagy, Riham Ahmed",Int J Humanitarian Action,309,1

This research was concerned with exploring how the infant experienced refuge within a Refuge setting post family violence. Using a non-intrusive, ethically informed, ‘infant led’ approach, this research involved ten infants (aged 3 weeks to 16 months), ten mothers, and 13 staff in eight Refuges from three countries: Australia, Scotland and England. Data was collected through infant observation, interviews with mothers and then staff. Presented is a synthesis of a research methodology which was led by the infant, drew on concepts of ‘inter-subjectivity’ and used a constructivist grounded theory method. Infants were often lost from view within the Refuge setting. The mother, herself traumatised, was expected to be the refuge for her infant. Only the obviously distressed infant was assisted, and where available, from outside specialist workers. It was often too painful for the adults, both mothers and staff, to see or reflect on the infant’s possible trauma. Significantly, in all cases the motivation for each mother to enter Refuge was ensuring their infant’s safety. Concern for their infant or young child can be a powerful catalyst for women leaving a violent relationship. Refuges (Shelters) are in a unique position to respond to the infant in their own right whilst helping to heal and grow the infant/mother relationship.","Bunston, Wendy; Frederico, Margarita; Whiteside, Mary",J Fam Violence,309,1

Risk of death is higher in the elderly and in patients with underlying comorbid conditions. When local incidence of COVID-19 is high, hospital resources are scarce and elective admissions and procedures are placed on hold. Patients with CNSL receiving first-line HD-MTX require admission for monitoring and aggressive hydration to prevent toxicity. This study explores the feasibility of planned-use glucarpidase, a recombinant bacterial enzyme that rapidly reduces serum MTX levels, to facilitate outpatient administration of HD-MTX. Eligible adult patients had isolated CNSL and had previously tolerated inpatient HD-MTX. MTX 3.5 g/m(2) was administered in the outpatient setting with hydration. Patients returned 24 hours after MTX administration for glucarpidase 2000u and additional hydration. MTX level was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 48 hours following MTX administration. To date, seven outpatient HD-MTX treatments have been administered to a total of three patients. In all cases, MTX levels were reduced to < 100 nmol/L at 48 hours. Three treatments resulted in grade 1 elevation of AST/ALT (two patients). One treatment resulted in a grade 2 creatinine increase. Creatinine returned to baseline following additional outpatient hydration. No patients required hospital admission. This study demonstrates feasibility of outpatient HD-MTX administration with planned-use glucarpidase during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently enrolling to a larger study of planned-use glucarpidase for repeated doses of outpatient HD-MTX.","Schaff, Lauren; Lobbous, Mina; Bozza, Alexis; Carlow, Dean; Nabors, Louis; Grommes, Christian",Neuro Oncol,309,0

LLI in South Florida adapted to COVID-19 “stay at home” orders by moving all programming online in March 2020. In May 2020 LLI members, faculty and students designed a research study to understand the experience of LLI members with social isolation and companionship prior to, and during, “stay at home” orders.

Interestingly, social isolation had no significant explanatory variables. However, significant results (p<.05) showed that seniors who isolated alone were 6.7 times more likely to lack companionship compared to those who isolated with a friend or spouse; seniors who reported they are not tech savvy were 8.3 times more likely to lack companionship compared to those who reported they are tech savvy; and that for every additional day of poor mental health respondents had a 1.15 higher odds of lacking companionship.

A potentially important yet underexplored explanation for well-documented racial disparities in ACP is subjective life expectancy (SLE), which may impel or impede ACP. Using Health and Retirement Study data (n=7484), we examined the extent to which perceived chances of living another 10 years (100, 51-99, 50, 1-49, or 0 percent) predict three aspects of ACP (living will (LW), durable power of attorney for health care designations (DPAHC), and discussions). We use logistic regression models to predict the odds of each ACP behavior, adjusted for sociodemographic, health, and depressive symptoms. We found modest evidence that SLE predicts ACP behaviors. Persons who are 100% certain they will be alive in ten years are less likely (OR = .68 and .71, respectively) whereas those with pessimistic survival prospects are more likely (OR = 1.23 and 1.15, respectively) to have a LW and a DPAHC, relative to those with modest perceived survival. However, upon closer inspection, these patterns hold only for those whose LW specify aggressive measures versus no LW. We found no race differences for formal aspects of planning (LW, DPAHC) although we did detect differences for informal discussions. Blacks with pessimistic survival expectations are more likely to have discussions, whereas Latinos are less likely relative to whites. We discuss implications for policies and practices to increase ACP rates.","Lou, Yifan; Carr, Deborah",Innov Aging,309,1

ICAM-1 is expressed on the cell surface of several cell types including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, leucocytes, fibroblasts, and neutrophils. Despite ICAM-1 has been detected on macrophage, little is known about the function and mechanism of macrophage ICAM-1. METHODS: To investigate the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in ICAM-1 regulation, both the protein and cell surface expression of ICAM-1 were measured. The phagocytosis of macrophage was evaluated by flow cytometry and Confocal microscopy. Small interfering RNA and neutralizing antibody of ICAM-1 were used to assess the effect of ICAM-1 on macrophage phagocytosis. TLR4 gene knockout mouse and cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS scavenger were used for the regulation of ICAM-1 expression. ROS was determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: In this study, we reported that macrophage can be stimulated to increase both the protein and cell surface expression of ICAM-1 by LPS. Macrophage ICAM-1 expression was correlated with enhanced macrophage phagocytosis. We found that using ICAM-1 neutralizing antibody or ICAM-1 silencing to attenuate the function or expression of ICAM-1 could decrease LPS-induced macrophage phagocytosis. Furthermore, we found that knocking out of TLR4 led to inhibited cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS production, which in turn, attenuated ICAM-1 expression at both the protein and cell surface levels. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the mechanism of ICAM-1-mediated macrophage phagocytosis is depending on TLR4-mediated ROS production and provides significant light on macrophage ICAM-1 in endotoxemia.","Zhong, Hanhui; Lin, Haitao; Pang, Qiongni; Zhuang, Jinling; Liu, Xiaolei; Li, Xiaolian; Liu, Jinghua; Tang, Jing",Inflamm Res,309,1

His ‘Achche din aane waale hein’ (good days are coming) campaign, which had won him a resounding election victory in 2014 for his first term, suggested that Modi’s primary goal was growth and development for his country and people, and hence also an agenda of economic reform. Focusing specifically on India’s negotiations in the context of the WTO, I show in this paper that India has continued to hold on to its former trade policy priorities and negotiation positions and adopted even more hard-line positions in some cases. Interestingly though, the same policy priorities and negotiation patterns that had ill-served India in the past may now no longer be a liability. This is only in part a credit to the Modi administration per se. Rather, it is mainly due to the rise of the phenomenon of “weaponized interdependence”, which in turn legitimizes—sometimes even necessitates—the securitization of foreign economic policy, and more specifically, trade politics. Taken in this changing context and as other countries also adopt a more market-cautionary approach, India’s historic and oft-reviled trade scepticism and reluctance to integrate in global value chains may yet allow it to have the last rhetorical laugh.","Narlikar, Amrita",Int Polit,309,13

Scientific conjectures invoke science as an intellectual activity poured by experiences and repetition of the objects that look independent of any idealist views (believes in the consensus of mind-dependence reality). The realistic machinery employs in an empiricist exposition of the objective phenomenon by synchronizing the general method to make observational predictions that cover all the phenomena of the particular entity without any exception. The formation of science encloses several epistemological purviews and a succession of conjectures cum refutation that a newer theorem could reinstate. My attempt is to advocate a holistic plea of scientific conjectures that outruns the restricted regulation of experience or testable hypothesis to render the validity of a chain of logical reasoning (deductive or inductive) of basic scientific statements. The milieu of scientific intensification integrates speculation that loads efficiency towards a new experimental dimension where the reality is not itself objective or observers relative; in fact the observed phenomenon divulges in the constructive progression of preferred methods of falsifiability and uncertainty.,"Chakraborty, Sanjit",J,309,1

There are negative attitudes towards elderly people and ageism is extremely common. Young people often know somebody in their families with dementia and most of the time do not know how to handle it. This project designs the first arts‐based schooling strategy for empathy for people with dementia, creates a dementia friendly generation, age‐friendly environments, supports young people to understand dementia. Objective of the project is to develop artistic strategies to strengthen empathic abilities with arts‐based methods & interdisciplinary collaboration between people with & without dementia. Stress is a daily challenge faced by family caregivers working with people with dementia, isolation became another demanding situation. Isolation has an impact on health, therefore workshops were designed for caregivers and students in quarantine to engage in the questions ‘How can art‐based research affect intergenerational well‐being of people with dementia and students? And ‘How can these means encourage the handling of the topic dementia?’ METHOD: Art and design‐based online‐workshops enable family caregivers and students in isolation to take salutogenetic perspectives. Methods of embodied & experiential learning were applied, an interdisciplinary approach as new methodology of teaching awareness about dementia by innovative arts‐based pedagogies. The workshops on Body & Senses engage in body awareness, trigger senses and exploring movement and touch. The workshop Storytelling collects and rewrites memories from different perspectives and narratives. Other workshops create images in innovative ways, through investigating one’s environment, explore documentary material and designing tangible visualization. RESULT: Workshops resulted in positive feedback and knowledge about dementia by all participants. 281 people, aged between 13‐65 participated at these workshops. Most of them were students, others engaged in family care in isolation.

The resulting changes in work and life routines had the potential to substantially perturb typical patterns of urban water use. We present here an analysis of how these pandemic responses affected California’s urban water consumption. Using water demand modeling that fuses an integrated water use database, we first simulated the water use in a business-as-usual (non-pandemic) scenario for essentially all urban areas in California. We then subtracted the business-as-usual water use from the actual use to isolate the changes caused solely by the pandemic response. We found that the pandemic response decreased California’s urban water use by 7.9%, which can be largely attributed to an 11.2% decrease in the commercial, industrial, and institutional sector that more than offset a 1.4% increase in the residential sector. The influence of the stay-at-home practices on urban water use is slightly stronger than the combined influences of all non-pandemic factors. This study covers both metropolitans and suburbs; therefore, the results could also be useful for analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on water use in other urban areas.","Li, Dongyue; Engel, Ruth A.; Ma, Xiaoyu; Porse, Erik; Kaplan, Jonathan D.; Margulis, Steven A.; Lettenmaier, Dennis P.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,309,1

It is assumed that during a pandemic the growth rate in the number of infections in a country occurs similarly to the process of virion replication in an infected organism. The exponent of the growth rate of the number of infection cases reflects not only biomedical parameters of a virus infection but also distinctive features of the social behavior of the population of a country. The dynamics of the change in the growth rate exponents is simulated by a system of relaxation-type ordinary differential equations. In applied mathematics, based on the imbedding method, limit values are forecast for exponents of the growth rate of the number of cases using the currently available experimental data. These values “forecast ahead” are subsequently approached by the actual exponents of growth in the number of infectees. The search for unknown parameters is carried out by minimizing a specially constructed quadratic functional accounting for all confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection.

Since PCV3 is a newly discovered virus, many aspects of its life cycle remain unknown. Porcine kidney epithelial cells are important host targets for PCV3. Here, we used systematic approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell entry and intracellular trafficking of PCV3 in PK15 cells, a cell line of porcine kidney epithelial origin. A large number of PCV3 viral particles were found to colocalize with clathrin but not caveolin-1 after entry, and PCV3 infection was significantly decreased when treated with chlorpromazine, dynasore, knockdown of clathrin heavy chain expression via RNA interference, or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of EPS15 in PCV3-infected cells. After internalization, the viral particles were further observed to colocalize with Rab5 and Rab7, and knockdown of both expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited PCV3 replication. We also found that PCV3 infection was impeded by ammonium chloride treatment, which indicated the requirement of an acidic environment for viral entry. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PCV3 enters PK15 cells through a clathrin- and dynamin-2-mediated endocytic pathway, which requires early and late endosomal trafficking, as well as an acidic environment, providing an insightful theoretical basis for further understanding the PCV3 life cycle and its pathogenesis.","Shi, Ruihan; Hou, Lei; Wei, Li; Quan, Rong; Zhou, Bin; Jiang, Haijun; Wang, Jing; Zhu, Shanshan; Song, Jiangwei; Wang, Dan; Liu, Jue",Front Microbiol,309,1

At the same time, their health directly/indirectly affects human beings as we both share a common environment. The One Health concept makes it imperative that the animals should remain healthy as it will have an impact on our health as well as economy. Animal disease diagnosis, their health monitoring, prevention, and control of diseases are important from this aspect. Tools for rapid diagnosis of animal diseases are crucial for early diagnosis and imposing control measures. Molecular techniques such as, genome sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), DNA microarray, PCR, and real-time PCR are some of the rapid techniques, but they need expertise and sophisticated labs. Conventional methods such as isolation of the pathogen, serological techniques, are laborious and time taking process. Therefore, to overcome the said limitations of conventional and molecular tools, biosensors are the better alternatives as they are rapid and can be used as pen-side diagnostic tests. They can provide test results in a few minutes under field conditions. In this chapter, we give an elaborative description of various types of biosensors and their utility in animal disease diagnostics and health monitoring.","Tewari, Anuj; Jain, Beenu; Brar, Basanti; Prasad, Gaya; Prasad, Minakshi",Biosensors in Agriculture: Recent Trends and Future Perspectives,309,1

However, the impact of the “Fengqiao Experience” on crime prevention in China is understudied internationally. This article examines how the general public have been mobilized and organized for crime prevention in China by conducting a case study of the Fengqiao Police Station in Zhejiang Province. The results show that the Fengqiao Police Station has set an example in adhering to and developing the “Fengqiao Experience,” whose essence is the public mobilization and organization for the public safety in the past few decades and upon which more and more police stations using the example of the Fengqiao style have been built up, which is the extensive application of the policing mass line as well as part of the modernization of social governance in contemporary China.","Cuiye, Kuang; Junling, Liu",Enhancing Police Service Delivery,309,11

Accordingly, school social workers decided among themselves what treatment approaches would be best for remote work with high school students. The holding environment can be an effective treatment approach when working both in person and by phone with adolescents. This chapter applies “the holding environment” to two case vignettes to illustrate its efficacy as a treatment intervention for adolescents in high school settings. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social workers’ provision of services to high school students of residential treatment centers is discussed, with special attention given to the phenomenon of shared trauma.","Osei-Buapim, Cierra","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",309,24

This is in line with the indications of the 2007 EU Charter of Leipzig which calls for integrated planning strategies between rural and urban, small, medium, large, and metropolitan areas. Therefore, an ecological multidisciplinary approach to the territory, using the concept of ecology proposed by the 1950s by Dioxiadis, is suggested, concept then taken up by Appold and Kasarda in the early 1990s. And it is the key word of the Encyclical Laudato Sii for the Care of the Common House of Pope Francis 2015 which refers to the principles of the 1992 Rio Conference based on the centrality of “human ecology” and on the alliance between man and nature, which in 1995 Scandurra had requested in L’ambiente dell’uomo (The Environment of Man). The phenomenological, from the Greek world phenomenon, is the methodological keystone of the paper. The well-being of the person and of the communities must be the objective of those who deal with the development of the territory. Rural areas in this sense can offer great opportunities, generated today by the many technological innovations, both tangible and intangible, potentially available. However, this should not overshadow the need for links that facilitate access to these areas. One of the important positive effects of the presence in rural areas is the reduction of hydrogeological risk thanks to the presence and daily maintenance of them. Among the aspects that raise questions that are difficult to answer is the risk that the more accessible an area becomes, the more there is a threat of its loss of uniqueness. Last but not least, it should be pointed out that the rural areas are a sort of territorial “reserve” for populations that have to abandon their lands due to climate change or who seek a quality of life not possible in large metropolitan areas. All this means that some geographical areas, primarily Calabria, are potentially territories where scenarios can be hypothesized for a different modes of anthropizations indispensable to move toward the objectives of the UN 2020–2030 Charter on sustainable development. In light of the COVID 19 emergency, these indications are even more relevant.","Aragona, Stefano",Smart and Sustainable Planning for Cities and Regions,309,1

Cattle are the primary reservoir of these human pathogens. In this study, 59 Angus crossbred heifers were tested specifically for these seven STEC serogroups using a combination of standard culture, serological, PCR, and cell cytotoxicity methods to determine if comparable results would be obtained. At the time of fecal sampling, the animals were approximately 2 years old and weighed 1000–1200 lbs. The diet comprised of 37% ground alfalfa hay, 25% ground Sudan hay, and 38% ground corn supplemented with trace minerals and rumensin with ad libitum access to water. Non-O157 STEC were isolated from 25% (15/59) of the animals tested using a combination of EC broth, CHROMagar STEC(TM), and Rainbow Agar O157. Interestingly, the O157 serogroup was not isolated from any of the animals. Non-O157 STEC isolates were confirmed to be one of the six adulterant serogroups by serology and/or colony PCR in 10/15 animals with the predominant viable, serogroup being O103. PCR using DNA extracted from feces verified most of the colony PCR results but also identified additional virulence and O-antigen genes from samples with no correlating culture results. Shiga toxin- (Stx-) related cytopathic effects on Vero cells with fecal extracts from 55/59 animals could only be associated with the Stx gene profiles obtained by fecal DNA PCR and not culture results. The differences between culture versus fecal DNA PCR and cytotoxicity assay results suggest that the latter two assays reflect the presence of nonviable STEC or infection with STEC not belonging to the seven adulterant serogroups. This study further supports the use of combinatorial culture, serology, and PCR methods to isolate viable STEC that pose a greater food safety threat.","Kudva, Indira T.; Oosthuysen, Eben R.; Wheeler, Bryan; Loest, Clint A.",Int J Microbiol,309,16

Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2 weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4 weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or ‘self-disclosure’ contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.","Kettner, H.; Rosas, F.

Eligible participants were ≥18 years old, lived in Boston or Fresno, spoke English or Spanish, and shopped at a dollar store within the past month. METHODS: Using convenience sampling, participants were recruited via flyers at 10 dollar stores in low-income neighborhoods in Fresno and Boston and posts in community Facebook groups. Interviews in Boston (n = 25) and Fresno (n = 26) were conducted remotely from August-December 2020. RESULTS: Our participants were primarily low-income, English-speaking women who shopped at dollar stores about once per week. Preliminary qualitative content analysis shows that key shopper motivations included low prices, product variety, and convenience. Shelf-stable foods and snacks were frequently purchased, especially for children. Shoppers in Fresno relied more on dollar stores for groceries and fresh produce, while Boston shoppers primarily purchased shelf-stable foods or snacks. Shoppers in both cities desired increased availability of fresh foods. Shoppers reported fear of shopping, limited stock, financial stress, and fewer trips early in the pandemic. Shopping increased by summer. Shoppers with children reported increased food expenditures during the pandemic, including at dollar stores, as closed schools meant that children consumed meals at home. CONCLUSIONS: Dollar stores continue to be an important food resource despite challenges related to the pandemic. Considering frequent use, food purchases, and desire for more fresh foods among shoppers, dollar stores chains may find a receptive audience for increasing their fresh food stock.

The aim of the present study was to assess if, and how, a limited course of telemedicine did influence the clinical outcome in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). METHODS: IBD patients followed before March 8(th), 2020 were included and divided into 3 groups (Fig.1): group 1, patients on endovenous biologics (EV); group 2, patients on biologics administered subcutaneously (SC); and group 3, patients on conventional treatments (CT) at the start of lockdown. The primary outcome was to assess the occurrence of disease flare in the three groups since only the EV group received face-to-face visits during lockdown. As secondary outcome we assessed the number of control endoscopies performed and the start of new biologic therapies, compared with a reference period in 2019. [Image: see text] RESULTS: A total of 689 patients (CD: 369, UC 320) were included in the study (247 IV, 217 SC and 225 CT, respectively). Telemedicine was more frequently adopted in SC and CS, (p<0.001) both. Treatment delays or transitory stops were more frequent in EV (p<0.001), whereas there was a significantly greater need to change therapy (p= 0.038) and need for steroids (p = 0.008) in the SC group compared with EV (Tab.1). Concerning endoscopies, compared with the reference period in 2019 only 25% of scheduled endoscopies were performed. The only risk factor for disease flare during or shortly after lockdown was belonging to the patient groups subjected to telemedicine (SC and CT groups) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients followed with a face-to-face approach instead of telemedicine, had a lower risk of disease flare during lockdown period. The impact of the important reduction of endoscopic assessments still needs to be assessed.","Viola, A; Giambò, F; Chiappetta, M F; Costantino, G; Pallio, S; Navarra, G; Alibrandi, A; Fries, W",J Crohns Colitis,309,18

The detection of COVID‐19 at the earliest stage is therefore of paramount importance for controlling the pandemic spread and reducing the mortality rate. The real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, the primary method of diagnosis for coronavirus infection, has a relatively high false negative rate while detecting early stage disease. Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID‐19, as seen through medical imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), radiograph (X‐ray), and ultrasound imaging, show individual characteristics that differ from those of healthy cases or other types of pneumonia. Machine learning (ML) applications for COVID‐19 diagnosis, detection, and the assessment of disease severity based on medical imaging have gained considerable attention. Herein, we review the recent progress of ML in COVID‐19 detection with a particular focus on ML models using CT and X‐ray images published in high‐ranking journals, including a discussion of the predominant features of medical imaging in patients with COVID‐19.

The FDA recommends a reading grade of 8. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and improve the accessibility and acceptability of mental health depression app privacy policies. METHODS: A mixed methods study using quantitative and qualitative data to improve the accessibility of app privacy policies. Service users completed assessments and focus groups to provide information on ways to improve privacy policy accessibility, including identifying and rewording jargon. This was supplemented by comparisons of mental health depression apps with social media, music and finance apps using readability analyses and examining whether GDPR affected accessibility. RESULTS: Service users provided a detailed framework for increasing accessibility that emphasised having critical information for consent. Quantitatively, most app privacy policies were too long and complicated for ensuring informed consent (mental health apps mean reading grade = 13.1 (SD = 2.44)). Their reading grades were no different to those for other services. Only 3 mental health apps had a grade 8 or less and 99% contained service user identified jargon. Mental health app privacy policies produced for GDPR weren't more readable and were longer. CONCLUSIONS: Apps specifically aimed at people with mental health difficulties are not accessible and even those that fulfilled the FDA's recommendation for reading grade contained jargon words. Developers and designers can increase accessibility by following a few rules and should, before launching, check whether the privacy policy can be understood.","Jilka, Sagar; Simblett, Sara; Odoi, Clarissa M.; van Bilsen, Janet; Wieczorek, Ania; Erturk, Sinan; Wilson, Emma; Mutepua, Magano; Wykes, Til",Internet Interv,309,1

Furthermore, the role of policy in facilitating and enhancing recruitment to and better skills matching in rural regions is discussed. Based on a survey targeted to the business sections of Swedish municipalities, the results show that recruitment is perceived to be difficult in both rural and nonrural regions and that the difficulty of recruiting for the right skills results in a lack of skills matching and constitutes an obstacle to growth. Rural regions located close to urban areas can to some extent mitigate these recruitment problems, and their locations pose less of a barrier in recruitment processes compared to those of remotely located rural regions. Which policies can help remedy recruitment problems faced in rural regions? In both rural and nonrural regions, incentives for writing off student debt and relocation support for accompanying persons and tandem recruitment are perceived to be the most promising policies. Rural regions are more receptive to the implementation of such policies. Finally, the need for flexibility and policies that can be adapted to the regional demand for labour are stressed.","Nyström, Kristina",Rev Reg Res,309,33

METHODS: This research was a quantitative cross-sectional study in which an online questionnaire was distributed among the target population who were healthy people over 18 years of age that had used or known about the Wateen application. A total of 352 participants responded to the questionnaire. The data collection was carried out between November and December 2020. A basic descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The participants had used the Wateen app to follow the donation record, as a reminder of donation dates, to find lists and blood bank locations, to request blood donation, and to find donation requests on social media. After receiving the blood donation request from the Wateen app, majority of the respondents felt encouraged, motivated, and educated to donate blood, and about blood donation, respectively. Participants also indicated that the application helped them to find donors. Besides, majority of the respondents stated that the Wateen app had reduced the gap between blood donors and the need for blood. However, few participants expressed that they had not received or observed a post about the Wateen application on social media networks. CONCLUSION: The results of this research indicated that there is a general acceptance of the use of the Wateen app among the participants of this study. However, the importance of the Wateen app needs to be further advertised so that it can be used in the blood donation process in all regions of Saudi Arabia. In this way, the people of Saudi Arabia will be more aware of the importance of the Wateen app in the blood donation process, and the goal of the Ministry of Health of bridging the gap between donation centers and blood donors could be achieved.","AlOtaibi, Noot; Alsaleebi, Sarah; Alanezi, Fahad; Alhodaib, Hala; AlThani, Bashair; Aljabri, Duaa; Alsalman, Demah; Al-Fayez, Asma; Saadah, Amjad; Alrawiai, Sumaiah; Alyousif, Norah; Alanzi, Turki",J Blood Med,309,1

There are no published data pertaining to changes in cerebral oxygenation seen with increases in the inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position. Furthermore, the effect anesthetic agents have has not been thoroughly investigated in this context. We plan to test the hypothesis that changes in inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide correlate to a significant change in regional cerebral oxygenation in anesthetized patients in beach chair position. We will also compare the effects that inhaled and intravenous anesthetics have on this process. METHODS/DESIGN This is a prospective within-group study of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the beach chair position which incorporates a randomized comparison between two anesthetics, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The primary outcome measure is the change in regional cerebral oxygenation due to sequential changes in oxygenation and ventilation. A sample size of 48 will have greater than 80% power to detect an absolute 4-5% difference in regional cerebral oxygenation caused by changes in ventilation strategy. The secondary outcome is the effect of anesthetic choice on cerebral desaturation in the beach chair position or response to changes in ventilation strategy. Fifty-four patients will be recruited, allowing for drop out, targeting 24 patients in each group randomized to an anesthetic. Regional cerebral oxygenation will be measured using the INVOS 5100C monitor (Covidien, Boulder, CO). Following induction of anesthesia, intubation and positioning, inspired oxygen fraction and minute ventilation will be sequentially adjusted. At each set point, regional cerebral oxygenation will be recorded and venous blood gas analysis performed. The overall statistical analysis will use a repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey's HSD procedure for post hoc contrasts. DISCUSSION If simple maneuvers of ventilation or anesthetic technique can prevent cerebral hypoxia, patient outcome may be improved. This is the first study to investigate the effects of ventilation strategies on cerebral oxygenation in patients anesthetized in beach chair position.

It examines how the psychological sciences were influenced by image technology, primarily after the two world wars. Taking a closer look at the development of film production and mental imagery experiments as cultural and scientific institutions, this essay examines the challenges psychologists began to face when the paradigm of the trauma film was established in the pursuit of positivist evidence informed by mechanical objectivity. Over the past century, psychological trauma have been explained through the lens of psychiatric sciences and literary critics. However, they were not evenly emphasized and experimental psychology became the mainstream institution to manage trauma in clinical settings. This essay argues that explanations of trauma in the past century have been interdisciplinary. The limitations of trauma-related brain sciences could be ameliorated by re-emphasizing narratives explored in films produced for artistic or moral, rather than scientific, purposes.","Wu, Harry Yi-Jui",Journal of trauma & dissociation : the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation,309,31

We obtained single and double knockout (DKO) human cells of MIC26 and MIC27 and found that DKO show more concentric onion-like cristae with loss of CJs than any single deletion indicating overlapping roles in formation of CJs. Using a combination of complexome profiling, STED nanoscopy, and blue-native gel electrophoresis, we found that MIC26 and MIC27 are dispensable for the stability and integration of the remaining MICOS subunits into the complex suggesting that they assemble late into the MICOS complex. MIC26 and MIC27 are cooperatively required for the integrity of respiratory chain (super) complexes (RCs/SC) and the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex and integration of F1 subunits into the monomeric F1Fo-ATP synthase. While cardiolipin was reduced in DKO cells, overexpression of cardiolipin synthase in DKO restores the stability of RCs/SC.

Our analysis based on numerical characterization studies of 682 complete neuraminidase gene and protein sequences available in the database, updated to March 2009, and which extends our previous work based on a sample of 173 sequences has revealed several interesting features. We have noticed that identical sequences have appeared over significant distances in space and time, raising the need for a deeper understanding of the longevity of such viral strains in the environment. Structural sections like transmembrane, stalk, body, and C-terminal tail regions have shown independent recombinations between strains from various species including human and avian hosts highlighting influenza's flexibility in host selection and recombination. Our analysis confirmed a biased nature in mutational accumulation in structural segments: a highly conserved 50-base C-terminal tail section identified in our earlier paper seems to accumulate mutational changes at a rate of about a fifth to an eighth of transmembrane and stalk regions, although the length is about half of these. Parallel study of the equivalent section to the C-terminal region in protein sequences reveals only 13 separate varieties, and all the other 669 sequences are duplicates to three of these varieties showing the highly conserved nature of this segment. Our analysis of active site related bases and amino acids showed highly conserved characteristic of those constructs, whereas the rest of the segments demonstrated rather large mutational changes. These kinds of high level of mutation in major part of the H5N1 NA sequences and recombinations within structural segments coupled with strong conservation of a few select segments show that the potential of rapid mutations to more virulent forms of this variety of avian flu continue to remain of concern, especially with the possibility of long duration dormancy of some of these viral strains, whereas islands of highly conserved segments could signify potential regions for inhibitor designs.","Ghosh, Ambarnil; Nandy, Ashesh; Nandy, Papiya; Gute, Brian D; Basak, Subhash C",Journal of chemical information and modeling,309,19

Because endurance training stimulates oxygen extraction capacity, we investigated whether endurance athletes are at higher risk to developing hypoxemia and thereby acute mountain sickness symptoms during exercise at simulated high altitude. Elite athletes (ATL; n = 8) and fit controls (CON; n = 7) cycled for 20 min at 100 W (EX100W), as well as performed an incremental maximal oxygen consumption test (EXMAX) in normobaric hypoxia (0.107 inspired O2 fraction) or normoxia (0.209 inspired O2 fraction). Cardiorespiratory responses, arterial Po2 (PaO2), and oxygenation status in m. vastus lateralis [tissue oxygenation index (TOIM)] and frontal cortex (TOIC) by near-infrared spectroscopy, were measured. Muscle O2 uptake rate was estimated from change in oxyhemoglobin concentration during a 10-min arterial occlusion in m. gastrocnemius. Maximal oxygen consumption in normoxia was 70 ± 2 ml·min(-1·)kg(-1) in ATL vs. 43 ± 2 ml·min(-1·)kg(-1) in CON, and in hypoxia decreased more in ATL (-41%) than in CON (-25%, P < 0.05). Both in normoxia at PaO2 of ∼95 Torr, and in hypoxia at PaO2 of ∼35 Torr, muscle O2 uptake was twofold higher in ATL than in CON (0.12 vs. 0.06 ml·min(-1)·100 g(-1); P < 0.05). During EX100W in hypoxia, PaO2 dropped to lower (P < 0.05) values in ATL (27.6 ± 0.7 Torr) than in CON (33.5 ± 1.0 Torr). During EXMAX, but not during EX100W, TOIM was ∼15% lower in ATL than in CON (P < 0.05). TOIC was similar between the groups at any time. This study shows that maintenance of high muscular oxygen extraction rate at very low circulating PaO2 stimulates the development of hypoxemia during submaximal exercise in hypoxia in endurance-trained individuals. This effect may predispose to premature development of acute mountain sickness symptoms during exercise at altitude.","Van Thienen, Ruud; Hespel, Peter",Journal of applied physiology,309,7

This retrospective analysis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage after flow-diverter treatment is a multicenter, retrospective study using a large series of treated patients to analyze factors affecting the occurrence of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters and presenting with delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage were included from December 2007 to December 2014 in 7 participating centers in France. Patient and aneurysm characteristics were recorded as were characteristics of bleeding (size, lateralization, and time to bleed), treatment, and clinical outcome after 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS Delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurred in 11 patients between 1 and 21 days after the procedure. In 10 of these patients, hemorrhages were ipsilateral to the treated aneurysms. Five of the 11 underwent surgery, and 9 of the 11 had good clinical outcomes at 6 months (mRS ≤2). CONCLUSIONS The pathogenesis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurring after flow-diverter treatment remains unclear. The multidisciplinary management of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage yields a relatively low morbidity-mortality rate compared with the initial clinical presentation.","Benaissa, A; Tomas, C; Clarençon, F; Sourour, N; Herbreteau, D; Spelle, L; Gallas, S; Januel, A-C; Gaultier, A L; Pierot, L",AJNR.

This multicenter retrospective study reports angiographic data, complications, and clinical outcome in patients treated with aspiration thrombectomy as the first-line option. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analysed the clinical and procedural data of patients treated from January 2014 to March 2015. Recanalization was assessed according to the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score. Clinical outcome was evaluated at discharge and after 3 months. RESULTS Overall, 152 patients (mean age 68 years) were treated. Sites of occlusion were 90.8% anterior circulation (including 16.4% tandem extracranial/intracranial occlusions) and 9.2% basilar artery. In 79 patients administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was attempted. Recanalization of the target vessel was obtained in 115/152 cases (75.6%) whereas direct aspiration alone was successful in 83/152 cases (54.6%) with an average puncture to revascularization time of 44.67 min. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 7.8% and embolization to new territories in 1.9%. 77 patients (50.6%) had a good outcome at 90-day follow-up: 55/96 in the direct aspiration alone group and 22/56 in the aspiration-stent retriever group.

Objectives To assess factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This multicenter cohort study assessed 2215 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 65 hospitals across the US from March 4 to April 4, 2020. Exposures Patient-level data, including demographics, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction, and hospital characteristics, including number of ICU beds. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes. Results A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [14.5] years; 1436 [64.8%] male; 1738 [78.5%] with at least 1 chronic comorbidity) were included in the study. At 28 days after ICU admission, 784 patients (35.4%) had died, 824 (37.2%) were discharged, and 607 (27.4%) remained hospitalized. At the end of study follow-up (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 8-28 days), 875 patients (39.5%) had died, 1203 (54.3%) were discharged, and 137 (6.2%) remained hospitalized.

METHODS In an open-label trial with blinded assessment of outcomes, we randomly assigned 1900 adults with coma who had had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause to undergo targeted hypothermia at 33°C, followed by controlled rewarming, or targeted normothermia with early treatment of fever (body temperature, ≥37.8°C). The primary outcome was death from any cause at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included functional outcome at 6 months as assessed with the modified Rankin scale. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to sex, age, initial cardiac rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and presence or absence of shock on admission. Prespecified adverse events were pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise, and skin complications related to the temperature management device. RESULTS A total of 1850 patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. At 6 months, 465 of 925 patients (50%) in the hypothermia group had died, as compared with 446 of 925 (48%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.14; P = 0.37). Of the 1747 patients in whom the functional outcome was assessed, 488 of 881 (55%) in the hypothermia group had moderately severe disability or worse (modified Rankin scale score ≥4), as compared with 479 of 866 (55%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09). Outcomes were consistent in the prespecified subgroups. Arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise was more common in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (24% vs. 17%, P<0.001).

66058,66058,66058,Lessons Learned After 15 Years of Circumferential Bodylift Surgery.,12.082719,4.0337386,2016,"BACKGROUND Children with cerebral palsy have impaired muscle growth and muscular contractures that limit their ROM. Contractures have a decreased number of serial sarcomeres and overstretched lengths, suggesting an association with a reduced ability to add the serial sarcomeres required for normal postnatal growth. Contractures also show a markedly reduced number of satellite cells-the muscle stem cells that are indispensable for postnatal muscle growth, repair, and regeneration. The potential role of the reduced number of muscle stem cells in impaired sarcomere addition leading to contractures must be evaluated. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Does a reduced satellite cell number impair the addition of serial sarcomeres during recovery from an immobilization-induced contracture? (2) Is the severity of contracture due to the decreased number of serial sarcomeres or increased collagen content? METHODS The hindlimbs of satellite cell-specific Cre-inducible mice (Pax7; Rosa26; n = 10) were maintained in plantarflexion with plaster casts for 2 weeks so that the soleus was chronically shortened and the number of its serial sarcomeres was reduced by approximately 20%. Subsequently, mice were treated with either tamoxifen to reduce the number of satellite cells or a vehicle (an injection and handling control). The transgenic mouse model with satellite cell ablation combined with a casting model to reduce serial sarcomere number recreates two features observed in muscular contractures in children with cerebral palsy. After 30 days, the casts were removed, the mice ankles were in plantarflexion, and the mice's ability to recover its ankle ROM by cage remobilization for 30 days were evaluated. We quantified the number of serial sarcomeres, myofiber area, and collagen content of the soleus muscle as well as maximal ankle dorsiflexion at the end of the recovery period. RESULTS Mice with reduced satellite cell numbers did not regain normal ankle ROM in dorsiflexion; that is, the muscles remained in plantarflexion contracture (-16° ± 13° versus 31° ± 39° for the control group, -47 [95% CI -89 to -5]; p = 0.0322). Serial sarcomere number of the soleus was lower on the casted side than the contralateral side of the mice with a reduced number of satellite cells (2214 ± 333 versus 2543 ± 206, -329 [95% CI -650 to -9]; p = 0.044) but not different in the control group (2644 ± 194 versus 2729 ± 249, -85 [95% CI -406 to 236]; p = 0.9737). The degree of contracture was strongly associated with the number of sarcomeres and myofiber area (r =0.80; p = 0.0077) rather than collagen content. No differences were seen between groups in terms of collagen content and the fraction of muscle area. CONCLUSIONS We found that a reduced number of muscle stem cells in a transgenic mouse model impaired the muscle's ability to add sarcomeres in series and thus to recover from an immobilization-induced contracture. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The results of our study in transgenic mouse muscle suggests there may be a mechanistic relationship between a reduced number of satellite cells and a reduced number of serial sarcomeres. Contracture development, secondary to impaired sarcomere addition in muscles in children with cerebral palsy may be due to a reduced number of muscle stem cells.","Dayanidhi, Sudarshan; Kinney, Matthew C; Dykstra, Peter B; Lieber, Richard L",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,309,8

In the period thereafter, provision of palliative care was regionally expanded. This upgrade included the establishment of palliative medicine consultation services (PMCS), combining general and specialized palliative care on an outpatient basis. A follow-up place of death survey took place in 2017. The aim was to depict the trends in place of death between 2001 and 2017. A second goal was to determine how often outpatient PMCS were used by persons who died in 2017. METHODS Descriptive analysis of place of death as specified in all death certificates (2001, 2011, 2017) issued in the cities of Bochum and Münster and the districts of Borken and Coesfeld. Comparison of pseudonymized data on deceased patients (2017) treated by the PMCS of Münster and Coesfeld with the place of death database to ascertain the rate of PMCS care at the end of life. RESULTS A total of 38 954 death certificates were analyzed, and 5887 deaths were compared with PCMS data. The distribution of place of death was as follows: (2001, 2011, 2017; age standardized; %): own residence 27.8; 23.3; 21.3; hospital: 55.8; 51.8; 51.8; palliative care unit: 0.0; 1.0; 6.2; hospice: 1.9; 4.5; 4.8; nursing home: 13.1; 18.6; 20.4; other: 1.2; 1.2; 1.5. The rate of PMCS use was 28.8% (1694/5887). CONCLUSION Over the period 2001-2017, the proportion of people who died at home or in the hospital went down, while the number who died in a palliative care unit, hospice, or nursing home increased. In the city of Münster and the district of Coesfeld, one fourth of the people who died in 2017 received PMCS care at the end of life.","Dasch, Burkhard; Zahn, Peter K",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,309,16

Historically, select patients with adrenal oligometastases have been treated with adrenalectomies which can offer durable local control and reasonable survival rates. SABR is a promising noninvasive treatment alternative to surgery capable of delivering ablative doses of radiation to the tumor with the goal of achieving durable local control of adrenal metastases. We report on a case of a patient who underwent initial surgical resection for a locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma and subsequently developed an early, biopsy-proven, oligometastatic recurrence in the adrenal gland. He underwent chemotherapy and SABR using CyberKnife to the adrenal metastasis and is in remission 7 years after treatment with no late toxicity. Fractionated SABR is an attractive noninvasive alternative to surgery for adrenal metastases.

Small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) play critical roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses by regulating target gene expression, but their roles in drought stress tolerance in apple (Malus domestica) are poorly understood. Here, we identified various snRNAs and their targets from the wild apple species Malus sieversii via high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis. Forty known microRNAs (miRNAs) and eight new snRNAs were differentially expressed in response to 2 or 4 h of drought stress treatment. We experimentally verified the expression patterns of five selected miRNAs and their targets. We established that one miRNA, mdm-miR171i, specifically targeted and degraded SCARECROW-LIKE PROTEINS 26.1 (MsSCL26.1) transcripts. Both knockout of mdm-miR171i and overexpression of MsSCL26.1 improved drought stress tolerance in the cultivated apple line 'GL-3' (M. domestica Borkh.) by regulating the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, especially that of MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (MsMDHAR), which functions in ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism under drought stress. Transient expression analysis demonstrated that MsSCL26.1 activates MsMDHAR transcription by positively regulating the activity of the P1 region in its promoter. Therefore, the miR171i-SCL26.1 module enhances drought stress tolerance in apple by regulating antioxidant gene expression and AsA metabolism.","Wang, Yantao; Feng, Chen; Zhai, Zefeng; Peng, Xiang; Wang, Yanyan; Sun, Yueting; Li, Jian; Shen, Xiaoshuai; Xiao, Yuqin; Zhu, Shengjiao; Huang, Xuewang; Li, Tian Hong",Plant physiology,309,16

At the present time, elective laparoscopic repair is the first choice for treatment of ITS. There is a lack of evidence in the long-term quality of life after a hiatal hernia repair for an intrathoracic stomach. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing a hiatal hernia repair for an intrathoracic stomach between January 2004 and January 2015. Additionally, to a hiatal closure, the patients received an antireflux procedure. Outcome measures included patient characteristics, operative details, complications, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. All patients were sent a quality of life questionnaire to assess long-term quality of life and patient satisfaction. A higher quality of life score represents a better quality of life. RESULTS Eighty-six patients underwent laparoscopic repair for ITS, from which, one patient died during surgery. Eighty-five patients were contacted and 81 completed the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 95.3 %. At a median follow-up of 2.7 years (range 0.1-9.6), the mean quality of life score was 13.5 (standard deviation 2.8). The mean overall satisfaction was 8.4. There were four recurrences: three in the first 12 days after surgery and one in 2.4 years. CONCLUSIONS Very good results in patient satisfaction and symptom reduction were achieved after a median follow-up of 2.7 years in this laparoscopic repair of the intrathoracic stomach single center experience study.

The study aimed to analyze the level of physical activity by identifying the training methods used during the social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-eight Brazilian athletes (both sex, 14.7 ± 1.68 years) answered and adapted the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (I-PAQ) through an online platform. Participants were asked to report their level of physical activity before and during the period of social distance. 67.7% of the interviewed athletes said they were able to adapt their sports training to the isolation environment under the guidance of a distance physical education professional. Only 4.38% of the sample was not training under such supervision and, therefore, inactive. Among the activities performed in the isolation environment, calisthenics was the primary practice (Effect Size: ƒ2 = 0.50, p <0.0001) and the sport practiced at home was the secondary practice (Effect Size: ƒ2 = 0.27, p = 0.004).

METHODS We developed a multidisciplinary steering committee to uncover barriers to palliative care referral and developed a pilot program, called the Warm Handoff. Through ongoing collaboration and midpilot feedback sessions, we identified several additional barriers and opportunities to increase access to palliative care. RESULTS Clinicians used the initial Warm Handoff process only 20 times over a period of 7 months. Of those calls, 10 were for issues outside of those that the Warm Handoff pilot was intended to address. During the pilot, we identified lack of access to urgent visits and clinician telephone availability for clinical case discussion as additional barriers to access. Increased collaboration led to the creation of a clinical provider of the day (CPOD) care model, which allowed for a notable increase in the capacity to see urgent consults. After this intervention, we observed an average of 19 patients seen urgently per month. In addition, there was a trend toward increasing referrals from breast oncology after the initiation of the CPOD. CONCLUSION A CPOD model, developed via close oncology/palliative care collaboration, resulted in increased utilization of palliative care services.","Lally, Kate; Chua, Isaac S; Lin, Nancy U; Siegel, Jocelyn; Bernacki, Rachelle",JCO oncology practice,309,26

Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy provides modest benefit to patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Recently, a FOLFIRINOX regimen revealed improved response in overall and progression-free survival over single-agent gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer, but there is still much needed advancement in the systemic treatment of pancreatic cancer. There is a growing interest in the development of novel agents, while our understanding of molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to expand. With identification of various molecular pathways in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, potential targets for drug development have been pursued with the use of monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. Although preclinical studies with multiple targeted therapies demonstrated encouraging results in pancreatic cancer, only erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, showed a marginal survival benefit in a phase III clinical trial, when combined with gemcitabine. As further signaling pathways and their importance in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis are better understood, further clinical trials will need to be designed to study these targeted agents as single agents, in combination with other novel agents or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this review, we present the current knowledge on targeted therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its application in clinical practice.","Cinar, Pelin; Tempero, Margaret A",Cancer journal,309,19

Tail vein DNA injection is an efficient procedure for gene transfer in murine liver. Hydrodynamic procedures in large animals require organ targeting, and improve with liver vascular exclusion. In the present study, two closed liver hydrofection models employing the human alpha-1-antitrypsin (hAAT) gene are compared to reference standards in order to evaluate their potential clinical interest. MATERIAL AND METHODS A solution of naked DNA bearing the hAAT gene was retrogradely injected in 7 pig livers using two different closed perfusion procedures: an endovascular catheterization-mediated procedure (n = 3) with infrahepatic inferior vena cava and portal vein blockage; and a surgery-mediated procedure (n = 4) with completely sealed liver. Gene transfer was performed through the suprahepatic inferior cava vein in the endovascular procedure and through the infrahepatic inferior vena cava in the surgical procedure. The efficiency of the procedures was evaluated 14 days after hydrofection by quantifying the hAAT protein copies per cell in tissue and in plasma. For comparison, samples from mice (n = 7) successfully hydrofected with hAAT and healthy human liver segments (n = 4) were evaluated. RESULTS Gene decoding occurs efficiently using both procedures, with liver vascular arrest improving its efficiency. The surgically closed procedure (sealed organ) reached higher tissue protein levels (4x10^5- copies/cell) than the endovascular procedure, though the levels were lower than in human liver (5x10^6- copies/cell) and hydrofected mouse liver (10^6- copies/cell). However, protein levels in plasma were lower (p<0.001) than the reference standards in all cases. CONCLUSION Hydrofection of hAAT DNA to ""in vivo"" isolated pig liver mediates highly efficient gene delivery and protein expression in tissue. Both endovascular and surgically closed models mediate high tissue protein expression. Impairment of protein secretion to plasma is observed and might be species-related. This study reinforces the potential application of closed liver hydrofection for therapeutic purposes, provided protein secretion improves.","Sendra, Luis; Miguel, Antonio; Pérez-Enguix, Daniel; Herrero, María José; Montalvá, Eva; García-Gimeno, María Adelaida; Noguera, Inmaculada; Díaz, Ana; Pérez, Judith; Sanz, Pascual; López-Andújar, Rafael; Martí-Bonmatí, Luis; Aliño, Salvador F",PloS one,309,1

The combination of these modalities using dual-labeled antibodies may allow both preoperative and intraoperative tumor localization and may be used in image-guided surgery to ensure complete resection of tumor tissue. Here, we evaluated the potential of dual-modality imaging of prostate cancer with the monoclonal antibody D2B, directed against an extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). For these studies, D2B was labeled both with (111)In and with the NIRF dye IRDye800CW. METHODS D2B was conjugated with N-hydroxysuccinimide-IRDye800CW and p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (ITC-DTPA) and subsequently radiolabeled with (111)In. For biodistribution and NIRF imaging, (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW (2 μg, 0.55 MBq/mouse) was injected intravenously into BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumors (right flank) and PSMA-negative PC3 tumors (left flank). The biodistribution was determined at 1, 2, 3, and 7 d after injection. In addition, micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging with (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW (3 μg, 8.5 MBq/mouse) was performed on mice with intraperitoneally growing LS174T-PSMA tumors. RESULTS (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in subcutaneous PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors (45.8 ± 8.0 percentage injected dose per gram at 168 h after injection), whereas uptake in subcutaneous PSMA-negative PC3 tumors was significantly lower (6.6 ± 1.3 percentage injected dose per gram at 168 h after injection). Intraperitoneal LS174T-PSMA tumors could be visualized specifically with both micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging at 2 d after injection, and the feasibility of image-guided resection of intraperitoneal tumors was demonstrated in this model. CONCLUSION Dual-labeled (111)In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye800CW enables specific and sensitive detection of prostate cancer lesions in vivo with micro-SPECT/CT and NIRF imaging. In addition to preoperative micro-SPECT/CT imaging to detect tumors, NIRF imaging enables image-guided surgical resection.

RESULTS Three hundred and seven patients underwent SILC. Male were 131 patients and female were 176 patients. Mean age was 51.6 ± 13.7 years old and mean body mass index was 24.8 ± 3.6 kg/m(2). Ninety-three patients had histories of previous abdominal operation. Patient's pathologies included: chronic cholecystitis (247 cases), acute cholecystitis (30 cases), gall bladder (GB) polyps (24 cases), and GB empyema (6 cases). Mean operating time was 53.1 ± 25.4 minutes and mean hospital stay was 2.9 ± 3.4 days. There were four cases of 3-4 ports conversion due to cystic artery bleeding. Complications occurred in 5 cases including wound infection (2 cases), bile duct injury (1 case), duodenal perforation (1 case), and umbilical hernia (1 case). CONCLUSION SILC using Konyang Standard Method is safe and feasible. Therefore, our standard procedure can be applied to almost all benign GB disease.","Son, Jong Il; Choi, In Seok; Moon, Ju Ik; Ra, Yu Mi; Lee, Sang Eok; Choi, Won Jun; Yoon, Dae Sung",Annals of surgical treatment and research,309,29

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the association between grazing behavior and weight regain post-bariatric surgery. Literature searches, study selection, design of the method, and quality appraisal were carried out by two independent authors. The search strategy was performed until October 2017 in Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertation & Theses, and Open Grey. Of a total of 3764 articles, five papers met the inclusion criteria (four original articles and one thesis), comprising 994 subjects, mostly women. The prevalence of grazing behavior ranged from 16.6 to 46.6%, and the highest prevalence of significant weight regain was 47%. The association between grazing and weight regain was observed in four of the five evaluated studies. Our findings support an association between grazing behavior and weight regain after bariatric surgery, regardless of surgery type and contextual concept of grazing. Further studies are needed to confirm the clarity of the real prevalence and interfering factors related to grazing behavior and weight outcomes.","Pizato, Nathalia; Botelho, Patrícia B; Gonçalves, Vivian S S; Dutra, Eliane S; de Carvalho, Kênia M B",Nutrients,309,22

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity. RESULTS Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive. Being overweight (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.72) or obese (adjusted OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.98) were also strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. CONCLUSION Even in an integrated healthcare system, Asian or Pacific Islander patients were less likely to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing than White survivors, but more likely to test positive. Additionally, Latinx ethnicity and high body mass index were strongly correlated with a greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity.","Haque, Reina; Chen, LieHong",JCO clinical cancer informatics,309,1

To manage this disease effectively, it is essential to detect PEDV early and accurately. We developed a sensitive and accurate droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to detect PEDV. The optimal primer-to-probe concentration and melting temperature were identified as 300:200 nM and 59.2°C, respectively. The specificity of the ddPCR assay was confirmed by negative test results for common swine pathogens. The detection limit for the ddPCR was 0.26 copies/μL, which is a 5.7-fold increase in sensitivity compared to that of real-time PCR (rtPCR). Both ddPCR and rtPCR assays exhibited good linearity, although ddPCR provided higher sensitivity for clinical detection compared to that of rtPCR. Our ddPCR methodology provides a promising tool for evaluating the PEDV viral load when used for clinical testing, particularly for detecting samples with low-copy viral loads.","Cao, Wei W; He, Dong S; Chen, Zhen J; Zuo, Yu Z; Chen, Xun; Chang, Yan L; Zhang, Zhi G; Ye, Lei; Shi, Lei","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",309,23

Implementing TAVR also in younger intermediate- or low-risk patients increases interest in the possibility of further lowering the risk of perioperative cerebrovascular events. To this aim, some embolic protection devices (EPDs) have been developed, some of which have already been approved for clinical use. Nevertheless, the cause of cerebrovascular events after TAVR is multifactorial, and selection of patients who would benefit from EPD is crucial to further improve outcomes, survival rate and quality of life. We reviewed the available literature in order to assess the incidence of and the mechanisms responsible for neurological events that can occur during TAVR, and we analysed clinical results and imaging findings following EPD use. Clinical trials for Embrella, TriGuard, Sentinel and Embol-X devices were designed to test their safety and their ability to prevent neurological complications in patients having TAVR. So far, published results showed that EPD may help in reducing the volume and size of periprocedural silent ischaemic brain lesions identified on magnetic resonance images but not in reducing the incidence of new lesions and new neurological events. The clinical impact of EPD in lowering the number of transient ischaemic attacks/strokes during TAVR needs to be further investigated in randomized trials.","Gallo, Michele; Putzu, Alessandro; Conti, Michele; Pedrazzini, Giovanni; Demertzis, Stefanos; Ferrari, Enrico",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,309,29

Opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) is a multimodal anaesthesia associating hypnotics, NMDA antagonists, local anaesthetics, anti-inflammatory drugs and α-2 agonists. Proofs of the effect of OFA on reducing opioid-related adverse effects after major or intermediate non-cardiac surgery are still scarce. We hypothesised that the reduced opioid consumption allowed by OFA compared with standard of care will be associated with a reduction of postoperative opioid-related adverse events. METHODS/ANALYSIS The POFA trial is a prospective, randomised, parallel, single-blind, multicentre study of 400 patients undergoing elective intermediate or major non-cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either a standard anaesthesia protocol or an OFA. The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of a severe postoperative opioid-related adverse event within the first 48 hours after extubation defined as: postoperative hypoxaemia or postoperative ileus or postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, each component of the primary outcome measure will be analysed separately. Data will be analysed on the intention-to-treat principle and a per-protocol basis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The POFA trial has been approved by an independent ethics committee for all study centres. Participant recruitment begins in November 2017.

The evolution of their vibrational spectra is understood in the context of the variation of π-electron delocalization as a result of the twisting imparted by the belt structure and in terms of the modulation of the resonance Raman/ROA effects which are photonic properties also tuned by anthracene twisting. The Raman/ROA vibrational spectra are simulated by several theoretical approaches to account for their vibrational and electronic properties including the theoretical evaluation of resonance effects. We furthermore incorporate a vibrational and ROA activity dissection analysis as provided in the Pyvib2 program valid to establish correlations among vibrational modes of different molecules with different electronic structures and equivalent vibrational dynamics. This paper is one of the very first attempts to use ROA spectroscopy in π-conjugated molecules with twisted and helical morphologies that contrast with the well-known cases of ROA studies of chiral helicenes in which the impact of π-electron delocalization in the electronic/photonic/vibrational (Raman/ROA) spectra is negligible.,"Palomo, Luis; Gordillo Gámez, Fernando; Bedi, Anjan; Gidron, Ori; Casado, Juan; Ramírez, Francisco J",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,309,17

However it is often difficult to differentiate septic from aseptic loosening of prosthesis because of the high culture-negative rates in conventional microbiologic culture. This study used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to amplify bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA in vitro and in 11 clinical samples. The in vitro analysis demonstrated that the RT-qPCR method was highly sensitive with the detection limit of bacterial 16S rRNA being 0.148 pg/ μ l. Clinical specimens were analyzed using the same protocol. The RT-qPCR was positive for bacterial detection in 8 culture-positive cases (including aerobic, anaerobic, and mycobacteria) and 2 culture-negative cases. It was negative in one case that the final diagnosis was confirmed without infection. The molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection using RT-qPCR to detect bacterial 16S rRNA around a prosthesis correlated well with the clinical findings. Based on the promising clinical results, we were attempting to differentiate bacterial species or drug-resistant strains by using species-specific primers and to detect the persistence of bacteria during the interim period before the second stage reimplantation in a larger scale of clinical subjects.","Lee, Mel S; Chang, Wen-Hsin; Chen, Su-Chin; Hsieh, Pang-Hsin; Shih, Hsin-Nung; Ueng, Steve W N; Lee, Gwo-Bin",TheScientificWorldJournal,309,11

However, different MA-a-functions might not only influence the magnitude of the estimated muscle forces but also change the shape of the muscle's estimated force-angle relationship (F-a-r). Therefore, we investigated the influence of different literature based Achilles tendon MA-a-functions on the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit F-a-r. The individual in vivo triceps torque-angle relationship was determined in 14 participants performing maximum voluntary fixed-end plantarflexion contractions from 18.3° ± 3.2° plantarflexion to 24.2° ± 5.1° dorsiflexion on a dynamometer. The resulting F-a-r were calculated using 15 literature-based in vivo Achilles tendon MA-a-functions. MA-a-functions affected the F-a-r shape and magnitude of estimated peak active triceps muscle-tendon unit force. Depending on the MA-a-function used, the triceps was solely operating on the ascending limb (n = 2), on the ascending limb and plateau region (n = 12), or on the ascending limb, plateau region and descending limb of the F-a-r (n = 1). According to our findings, the estimated triceps muscle-tendon unit forces and the shape of the F-a-r are highly dependent on the MA-a-function used. As these functions are affected by many variables, we recommend using individual Achilles tendon MA-a-functions, ideally accounting for contraction intensity-related changes in moment arm magnitude.","Holzer, Denis; Paternoster, Florian Kurt; Hahn, Daniel; Siebert, Tobias; Seiberl, Wolfgang",Scientific reports,309,28

The viral spike (S) protein is incorporated into the viral envelope and mediates infectious entry of HCoV-229E into host cells, a process that depends on the activation of the S-protein by host cell proteases. However, the proteases responsible for HCoV-229E activation are incompletely defined. Here we show that the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT cleave the HCoV-229E S-protein (229E-S) and augment 229E-S-driven cell-cell fusion, suggesting that TMPRSS2 and HAT can activate 229E-S. Indeed, engineered expression of TMPRSS2 and HAT rendered 229E-S-driven virus-cell fusion insensitive to an inhibitor of cathepsin L, a protease previously shown to facilitate HCoV-229E infection. Inhibition of endogenous cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 demonstrated that both proteases can activate 229E-S for entry into cells that are naturally susceptible to infection. In addition, evidence was obtained that activation by TMPRSS2 rescues 229E-S-dependent cell entry from inhibition by IFITM proteins. Finally, immunohistochemistry revealed that TMPRSS2 is coexpressed with CD13, the HCoV-229E receptor, in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, and that CD13(+) TMPRSS2(+) cells are preferentially targeted by HCoV-229E, suggesting that TMPRSS2 can activate HCoV-229E in infected humans. In sum, our results indicate that HCoV-229E can employ redundant proteolytic pathways to ensure its activation in host cells. In addition, our observations and previous work suggest that diverse human respiratory viruses are activated by TMPRSS2, which may constitute a target for antiviral intervention.","Bertram, Stephanie; Dijkman, Ronald; Habjan, Matthias; Heurich, Adeline; Gierer, Stefanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Welsch, Kathrin; Winkler, Michael; Schneider, Heike; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Thiel, Volker; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,309,30

However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. OBJECTIVE To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting.

CRF and Ucn1 activate both CRF1 and CRF2, while Ucn2 and Ucn3 activate selectively CRF2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CRF, Ucn1, Ucn2 and Ucn3 on the hippocampal acetylcholine release through which they may modulate cognitive functions, including attention, learning and memory. In this purpose male Wistar rats were used, their hippocampus was isolated, dissected, incubated, superfused and stimulated electrically. The hippocampal slices were first pretreated with selective CRF1 antagonist antalarmin or selective CRF2 antagonist astressin2B, and then treated with non-selective CRF1 agonists, CRF or Ucn1, and selective CRF2 agonists, Ucn2 or Ucn3. The hippocampal acetylcholine release was increased significantly by CRF and Ucn1 and decreased significantly by Ucn2 and Ucn3. The increasing effect of CRF and Ucn1 was reduced significantly by antalarmin, but not astressin2B. In contrast, the decreasing effect of Ucn2 and Ucn3 was reversed significantly by the selective CRF2, but not the selective CRF1 antagonist. Our results demonstrate that CRF and Ucn1 stimulate the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF1, whereas Ucn2 and Ucn3 inhibit the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF2. Therefore, the present study suggests the existence of two apparently opposing CRF systems in the hippocampus, through which CRF and the urocortins might modulate cholinergic activity and thereby cognitive functions.","Pintér, Dávid; Balangó, Beáta; Simon, Balázs; Palotai, Miklós; Csabafi, Krisztina; Dobó, Éva; Ibos, Katalin Eszter; Bagosi, Zsolt",Neuropeptides,309,19

Little is known about what health care providers and patients think about official surgical site marking policy. METHOD Twenty-one patients and health care providers were interviewed, and the authors conducted field observations of surgeons while they marked their patients. The data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. FINDINGS Surgical site marking was perceived to be a safety precaution for operations involving multiple sides and structures but not for cases where there is no uncertainty about the intended operative site. Participants believed that marking could also facilitate error if the wrong side was marked. Site marking was perceived to have the effect of ensuring that the surgeon meets with the patient prior to the operation on the day of surgery. Concerns were raised with respect to who should mark patients and marking surgical sites for genital surgery or other private body sites. CONCLUSIONS For operations that involve multiple possible surgical sites, site marking should be carried out by individuals who are knowledgeable about the patient and the proposed procedure. For operations in which there is no uncertainty about the intended site, interventions other than site marking could be implemented to ensure patient-surgeon interactions on the day of surgery. Surgical site marking procedures should respect patient dignity and privacy.","Goldberg, Amanda E; Harnish, Julie L; Stegienko, Stacey; Urbach, David R",Surgical innovation,309,16

Result Of the 23 patients, 56.5% (13/23) had bilateral disease, 69.6% (16/23) had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundle, 65.2% (15/23) had lesions distributed periphery, 82.6% (19/23) involved in the basal segment of lower lobe, 82.6% (19/23) had ground-glass opacities, 30.4% (7/23) had ground-glass opacities with consolidation, 26.1% (6/23) had reticular changes. In the stage of disease progression, 54.6% (6/11) had an increased number of lesions, and 63.6% (7/11) had the scope of lesions enlarged and density increased. In the remission stage, 25.0% (4/16) had reduced number of lesions, 81.3% (13/16) had scope of lesions reduced, 62.5% (10/16) had density of lesions decreased, and 37.5% (6/16) had fibrosis. Conclusions As an important diagnostic examination method for COVID-19, CT is conducive to the rapid diagnosis of the disease in patients with epidemiological history.","Fang, Xin; Zhao, Ming; Li, Shuang; Yang, Lan-Qing; Wu, Bing",Sichuan da xue xue bao.

We used bronchoscopic jet ventilation (BJV) to delineate the intersegmental plane by selectively sending air into the target segment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with BJV failure. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 48 patients who underwent pulmonary segmentectomy with BJV between March 2014 and May 2019 at a single center. Data were compared between BJV succeeded cases and failed cases. RESULTS In 13 cases (27%), BJV were unsuccessful. The Brinkman index was significantly higher in failed cases (962 ± 965 failed vs. 395 ± 415 successful, P = 0.0067). The success rate was significantly lower when BJV was applied to the posterior basal segmental bronchus (B10) (B10: 1/5 (20%) vs others: 34/43 (79%), P = 0.015). CONCLUSION Long-term smoking and the bronchus corresponding to the posterior basal segment might make successful performance of BJV difficult.","Ikeda, Mizuko; Tanabe, Miwako; Fujimoto, Ayumi; Matsuoka, Tomoka; Sumie, Makoto; Yamaura, Ken",JA clinical reports,309,31

Heparin is best known as an anticoagulant, but it also exhibits direct antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses and has anti-inflammatory activity. The high incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients suggests that coagulopathy plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This already makes heparin a unique, potentially curative agent that can be used immediately to help resolve the ongoing crisis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate here in vitro that heparin does indeed inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three concurrent modes of activity of heparin (antiviral, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory) against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 form a unique therapeutic combination. Thus, repurposing of heparin to fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 appears to be a powerful, readily available measure to address the current pandemic.","Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A; Perkhofer, Lukas; Sparrer, Konstantin Mj; Zelikin, Alexander N; Münch, Jan; Kleger, Alexander",Clinical medicine,309,24

Of the infected patients, 10%-15% may develop severe or critical illness. So far, no definite treatment is available for Covid-19. Cytokine release syndrome may underlie the pathogenesis of severe and critical disease. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 therapies are being tried to improve clinical outcomes. Methods . We did a systematic review to identify the available literature on anti-IL-6 therapies in the treatment of Covid-19 and used the GRADE method to assess the quality of evidence. Results . Four case series and 10 case reports were identified. On critical assessment, we found that these studies reported some beneficial effect of anti-IL-6 therapy, but all the studies had a high risk of bias. The pooled estimate showed that 42% of patients improved but with a very wide confidence interval (CI) (95% CI 1%-91%) and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 95%). The overall quality of evidence was graded as 'very low'. Conclusions . Although promising, anti-IL-6 therapy for Covid-19 needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials to provide robust evidence.","Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar; Seth, Tulika; Shalimar,; Madan, Karan; Nischal, Neeraj; Soneja, Manish; Sharma, Atul; Garg, Pramod; Prasad, Kameshwar",The National medical journal of India,309,27

To identify and treat the severe and critical patients with COVID-19 is the key clinical problem to be solved. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19. Methods We searched independently studies and retrieved the data that involved the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 through database searching. Two authors independently retrieved the data from the individual studies, assessed the study quality with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and analyzed publication bias by Begg's test. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of groups using fixed or random-effect models. Results Five studies with 5,328 patients confirmed with COVID-19 met the inclusion criteria. Severe patents were older and more common in dyspnea, vomiting or diarrhea, creatinine >104 µmol/L, procalcitonin ≥0.05 ng/mL, lymphocyte count <1.5×109/L and bilateral involvement of chest CT. Severe patents had higher risk on complications including acute cardiac injury (OR 13.48; 95% CI, 3.60 to 50.47, P<0.001) or acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 11.55; 95% CI, 3.44 to 38.77, P<0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 26.12; 95% CI, 11.14 to 61.25, P<0.001), shock (OR 53.17; 95% CI, 12.54 to 225.4, P<0.001) and in-hospital death (OR 45.24; 95% CI, 19.43 to 105.35, P<0.001). Severe group required more main interventions such as received antiviral therapy (OR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.32, P=0.001), corticosteroids (OR 5.07; 95% CI, 3.69 to 6.98, P<0.001), CRRT (OR 37.95; 95% CI, 7.26 to 198.41, P<0.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 129.35; 95% CI, 25.83 to 647.68, P<0.001).

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may modify the risk of developing a severe COVID-19 infection, beside identified risk factors such as age and comorbidities. Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with MS and COVID-19 and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants The Covisep registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in MS expert centers and general hospitals and with neurologists collaborating with MS expert centers and members of the Société Francophone de la Sclérose en Plaques. The study included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020. Exposures COVID-19 diagnosed with a polymerase chain reaction test on a nasopharyngeal swab, thoracic computed tomography, or typical symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS ≥6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity). The EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2, 0.2), followed by age (R2, 0.06) and obesity (R2, 0.01). Conclusions and Relevance In this registry-based cohort study of patients with MS, age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; there was no association found between DMTs exposure and COVID-19 severity. The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Louapre, Céline; Collongues, Nicolas; Stankoff, Bruno; Giannesini, Claire; Papeix, Caroline; Bensa, Caroline; Deschamps, Romain; Créange, Alain; Wahab, Abir; Pelletier, Jean; Heinzlef, Olivier; Labauge, Pierre; Guilloton, Laurent; Ahle, Guido; Goudot, Mathilde; Bigaut, Kevin; Laplaud, David-Axel; Vukusic, Sandra; Lubetzki, Catherine; De Sèze, Jérôme",JAMA neurology,309,24

The CAFG has since reconvened to examine more recent scientific literature on airway management. The Focus Group's mandate for this article was to arrive at updated practice recommendations for management of the unconscious/induced patient in whom difficult or failed tracheal intubation is encountered. METHODS Nineteen clinicians with backgrounds in anesthesia, emergency medicine, and intensive care joined this iteration of the CAFG. Each member was assigned topics and conducted reviews of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Results were presented and discussed during multiple teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or consensus-based recommendations were made together with assigned levels of evidence modelled after previously published criteria. CONCLUSIONS The clinician must be aware of the potential for harm to the patient that can occur with multiple attempts at tracheal intubation. This likelihood can be minimized by moving early from an unsuccessful primary intubation technique to an alternative ""Plan B"" technique if oxygenation by face mask or ventilation using a supraglottic device is non-problematic. Irrespective of the technique(s) used, failure to achieve successful tracheal intubation in a maximum of three attempts defines failed tracheal intubation and signals the need to engage an exit strategy. Failure to oxygenate by face mask or supraglottic device ventilation occurring in conjunction with failed tracheal intubation defines a failed oxygenation, ""cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate"" situation. Cricothyrotomy must then be undertaken without delay, although if not already tried, an expedited and concurrent attempt can be made to place a supraglottic device.","Law, J Adam; Broemling, Natasha; Cooper, Richard M; Drolet, Pierre; Duggan, Laura V; Griesdale, Donald E; Hung, Orlando R; Jones, Philip M; Kovacs, George; Massey, Simon; Morris, Ian R; Mullen, Timothy; Murphy, Michael F; Preston, Roanne; Naik, Viren N; Scott, Jeanette; Stacey, Shean; Turkstra, Timothy P; Wong, David T",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,309,1

In contrast to the evolutionary psychological mechanisms linking parasites to human behavior and cultural characteristics proposed by Thornhill and Fincher, we offer an alternative hypothesis that structural racism and differential access to sanitation systems drive both variation in parasite prevalence and differential behaviors and cultural characteristics. METHODS We adopt a Bayesian framework to estimate parasite prevalence rates in 51 districts in eight Latin American countries using the disease status of 170,220 individuals tested for infection with the intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides (Hürlimann et al., []: PLoS Negl Trop Dis 5:e1404). We then use district-level estimates of parasite prevalence and individual-level social data from 5,558 individuals in the same 51 districts (Latinobarómetro, 2008) to assess claims of causal associations between parasite prevalence and sociocultural characteristics. RESULTS We find, contrary to Thornhill and Fincher, that parasite prevalence is positively associated with preferences for democracy, negatively associated with preferences for collectivism, and not associated with violent crime rates or gender inequality. A positive association between parasite prevalence and religiosity, as in Fincher and Thornhill (: Behav Brain Sci 35:61-79), and a negative association between parasite prevalence and achieved education, as predicted by Eppig et al. (: Proc R S B: Biol Sci 277:3801-3808), become negative and unreliable when reasonable controls are included in the model. We find support for all predictions derived from our hypothesis linking structural racism to both parasite prevalence and cultural outcomes. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that best practices in biocultural modeling require examining more than one hypothesis, retaining individual-level data and its associated variance whenever possible, and adopting multilevel techniques suited to the structuring of the data.","Ross, Cody T; Winterhalder, Bruce",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,309,31

Nevertheless, challenges have become apparent, such as the need for high vector doses and the induction of anti-AAV immune responses that cause the loss of vector transduced hepatocytes. This fostered research focusing on development of next-generation AAV vectors capable of dealing with these hurdles. Areas Covered: While both the viral vector genome and the capsid are subjects to engineering, this review focuses on the latter. Specifically, we summarize the principles of capsid engineering strategies, and describe developments and applications of engineered capsid variants for liver-directed gene therapy. Expert Opinion: Capsid engineering is a promising strategy to significantly improve efficacy of the AAV vector system in clinical application. Reduction in vector dose will further improve vector safety, lower the risk of host immune responses and the cost of manufacturing. Capsid engineering is also expected to result in AAV vectors applicable to patients with pre-existing immunity towards natural AAV serotypes.","Rodríguez-Márquez, Esther; Meumann, Nadja; Büning, Hildegard",Expert opinion on biological therapy,309,27

LTAD has been described as the structured and progressive growth of an athlete through different stages of development resulting in some athletes achieving elite sport status. Furthermore, the interest in athletic career development from a holistic perspective has contributed to management approaches underscoring sustainable talent development and participation in sport. The current study investigated youth sports development pathways through both models of development within a South African context. A descriptive quantitative cross-sectional design was used to generate a convenient sample of athletes (N = 267). The Talent Development Environment Questionnaire (TDEQ) was administered, which in previous studies produced acceptable psychometric properties. Principal factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Monte Carlo parallel simulation, MANOVA, and hierarchical regression were performed to analyze the data. The TDEQ was validated for the South African context and was found to measure four components, namely supportive and challenging environment, development fundamentals, support networks, and long-term development. Respondents in the various developmental categories of novice, advanced and elite student-athletes were not statistically significantly influenced by any of the four factors. Controlling for the talent developmental phase, the model proposed did not statistically significantly predict the development pathway of youth athletes. The results provide evidence with some practical significance as supportive and challenging environment and long-term development focus reported a small effect.

Linking specific sets of neuronal responses with perception and behavior is essential for understanding mechanisms of neural circuit computation. We trained mice of both sexes to perform visual detection tasks and used optogenetic perturbations to increase or decrease neuronal spiking primary visual cortex (V1). Perceptual reports were always enhanced by increments in V1 spike counts and impaired by decrements, even when increments and decrements in spiking were generated in the same neuronal populations. Moreover, detecting changes in cortical activity depended on spike count integration rather than instantaneous changes in spiking. Recurrent neural networks trained in the task similarly relied on increments in neuronal activity when activity has costs. This work clarifies neuronal decoding strategies employed by cerebral cortex to translate cortical spiking into percepts that can be used to guide behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVisual responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) are diverse, in that neurons can be either excited or inhibited by the onset of a visual stimulus. We selectively potentiated or suppressed V1 spiking in mice while they performed contrast change detection tasks. In other experiments, excitation or inhibition was delivered to V1 independent of visual stimuli. Mice readily detected increases in V1 spiking while equivalent reductions in V1 spiking suppress the probability of detection, even when increases and decreases in V1 spiking are generated in the same neuronal populations. Our data raise the striking possibility that only increments in spiking are used to render information to structures downstream of V1.","Cone, Jackson J; Bade, Morgan L; Masse, Nicolas Y; Page, Elizabeth A; Freedman, David J; Maunsell, John H R",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,309,20

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Using well-established modeling techniques, evidence-based medicine, and incorporating estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, we show that PICU capacity may suffice during an influenza pandemic. Even during the peak of the pandemic, most children requiring PICU admission may be served, even those who have nonflu-related conditions, provided that robust indications and decision rules are maintained, both for admission, as well as continuation (or discontinuation) of life support. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that a model, with assumptions that can be adapted with new information obtained during early stages of the pandemic that is evolving, be an integral part of a preparedness plan for a pandemic influenza with new human transmissible agent like influenza A virus.","Nap, Raoul E; Andriessen, Maarten P H M; Meessen, Nico E L; Albers, Marcel J I J; van der Werf, Tjip S",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,309,9

SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. While both ACE inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue ACE2, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) to enable binding to cellular ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serine E2 (PN1) that is upregulated by angiotensin II but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema while plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by PN1 could be a further benefit of MRAs beyond their well established organ protection. We review the evidence that spironolactone may be the preferred RASSi to increase PN1 and decrease TMPRSS2, furin and plasmin activities and thereby to reduce viral cell binding, entry, infectivity and bad outcomes. This hypothesis requires direct investigation.","Wilcox, Christopher S; Pitt, Bertram",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,309,31

The impact of the pandemic on dual-physician households remains unknown. In this survey study, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dual-physician families and described gendered differences related to the impact of the pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey distributed via e-mail and social media, with results collected from April 30, 2020 until May 26, 2020. Respondents were members of a dual-physician couple. Respondents provided information on demographic characteristics and the impact of the pandemic on their professional lives, personal lives, and well-being. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Ordinal variables were compared between genders using Cochran-Armitage trend test. Feeling emotionally and physically drained compared to pre-pandemic was analyzed as a binary outcome in a multivariable logistic model. Results: Of the 1799 physicians who completed the survey, 52% were between 30 and 39 years old, 81% self-identified as women, and 62% were white. Women were more likely to report increased worry about their job security, finances, personal health, partner's health, and children's health (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported feeling more drained during the pandemic. Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.3, p < 0.001), and having children younger than 5 years of age (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.95, p = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of feeling more drained. Conclusions: Women were more likely to report increased worry about job security, finances, and health and had an increased risk of feeling more drained during the pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant stress for all physicians, women in dual-physician families were disproportionately affected, demonstrating the need for increased support from hospital administrations.","Soares, Andrea; Thakker, Prashanth; Deych, Elena; Jain, Shikha; Bhayani, Rakhee K",Journal of women's health,309,1

However, the risk for primarily untreated accessory saphenous veins (ASVs) to develop reflux during follow-up has not yet been defined. Here, the prevalence and risk of ASV reflux is explored. METHODS During a prospective multicenter cohort study on radiofrequency segmental thermal ablation of refluxing GSVs, the presence and reflux status of ASVs were monitored in 93 legs in a single center. Control examinations were performed after 1 week and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Life-table and multiple regression analyses were used to describe frequency and risk factors for presence of reflux in untreated ASVs. RESULTS Of 93 legs, 82 (88%) were available for 4-year follow-up. At baseline, 43 legs (46%) had an anterior ASV detectable by duplex ultrasound, with only two legs (2%) presenting with reflux. During 4 years of follow-up, according to life-table analysis, the proportion of legs with a detectable anterior ASV increased to 71% (n = 65); 32% of all legs and 55% of legs with a detectable anterior ASV exhibited refluxing anterior ASVs. Remarkably, in 35% of all legs with an anterior ASV, this reflux presented as a source of axial reflux, suggesting hemodynamic relevance. Posterior ASVs were detected in only 10 legs during 4-year follow-up, exhibiting reflux in only two cases. CONCLUSIONS Whereas posterior ASVs were meaningless, refluxing anterior ASVs occurred in a significant proportion of legs after thermal ablation of GSVs. Whether nonrefluxing anterior ASVs should be treated at the time of GSV ablation needs further examination.","Proebstle, Thomas M; Möhler, Thomas",Journal of vascular surgery.

The modular domain architecture of PARPs gives rise to this functional diversity. PARPs catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to targets-proteins and poly-nucleic acids. This enigmatic post-translational modification comes in two varieties: the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose, known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) or the transfer of multiple units of ADP-ribose, known as poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation). Emerging data shows that PARPs are regulated at multiple levels to control when and where PARP-mediated M/PARylation occurs in cells. In this review, we will discuss the latest knowledge regarding the regulation of PARPs in cells: from transcription and protein stability to subcellular localization and modulation of catalytic activity.","Sanderson, Daniel J; Cohen, Michael S",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,309,31

Along the years, the perfusion strategies for aortic arch reconstruction have evolved from deep hypothermic cardiac arrest to antegrade cerebral perfusion with moderate hypothermia, and recently to a combined cerebral and lower body perfusion with moderate hypothermia. To achieve a lower body perfusion, several cannulation strategies have been described. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of utilizing an arterial sheath introduced in the femoral artery to achieve an effective lower body perfusion. METHODS We included patients who underwent an aortic arch reconstruction surgery with a lower body perfusion, from January 2017 to June 2019. To achieve a lower body perfusion, a three-way stopcock was connected to the arterial line, where one end was connected to the central cannulation for cerebral perfusion and the other to an arterial sheath that was introduced through the femoral artery. A total of 25 patients were included. Peri- and postoperative lactate and creatinine levels and signs of malperfusion were recorded. RESULTS During the reperfusion phase, after selective perfusion ended none of the patients showed a significant increase in lactate, creatinine, and liver enzyme levels. After 24 hours, there were no signs of an acute kidney injury, femoral vessel injury, or limb malperfusion. CONCLUSION These findings show that a sufficient lower body perfusion through an arterial sheath placed in the femoral artery for aortic arch reconstruction can be achieved. This approach caused no complications related to the arterial sheath during the early postoperative period and is an easy way to maintain perfusion of systemic organs.","Boburg, Rodrigo Sandoval; Rosenberger, Peter; Kling, Steffen; Jost, Walter; Schlensak, Christian; Magunia, Harry",Perfusion,309,1

We review the type and frequency of the clinical features in 36 reported individuals with features of VDEGS, 15 (42%) of whom had known pathogenic variants in SCARF2, 6 (16%) with negative SCARF2 testing, and 15 (42%) not tested. We also report three new individuals with pathogenic variants in SCARF2 and clinical features of VDEGS. Of the six persons without known pathogenic variants in SCARF2, three remain unsolved despite extensive genetic testing. Three were found to have pathogenic ABL1 variants using whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS). Their phenotype was consistent with the congenital heart disease and skeletal malformations syndrome (CHDSKM), which has been associated with ABL1 variants. Of the three unsolved cases, two were brothers who underwent WGS and targeted long-range sequencing of both SCARF2 and ABL1, and the third person who underwent WES and RNA sequencing for SCARF2. Because these affected individuals with classical features of VDEGS lacked a detectable pathogenic SCARF2 variant, genetic heterogeneity is likely. Our study shows the importance of performing genetic testing on individuals with the VDEGS ""phenotype,"" either as a targeted gene analysis (SCARF2, ABL1) or WES/WGS.

Some, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), have indicated significant differences between patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Participants (101) were divided into a control group of healthy individuals and, following diagnosis, patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis, and aggressive periodontitis. Compounds reflecting tissue destruction, inflammatory processes or antioxidant responses, such as sirtuins (SIRT-1, SIRT-2), metalloproteinases (MMP), SOD, GPx, GSH, and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in saliva. RESULTS SIRT-2 levels were significantly increased in all patients. In patients with gingivitis, MMP (p<0.05) and GPx (p<0.01) were significantly increased. In patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis, SOD activities were increased (p<0.001) while GPx and GR were decreased (p<0.001). Relative activities of MMP were higher in patients with aggressive periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of SIRT-2 and SOD clearly showed increased levels of oxidative stress in cases of periodontitis with a subsequent inhibition of other antioxidant enzymes. Levels of GSH suggest reversibility of the conditions with appropriate intervention. With the assessment of the trends of these selected antioxidant markers, it is possible to determine the prognosis of the disease.","Kluknavská, J; Krajčíková, K; Bolerázska, B; Mašlanková, J; Ohlasová, J; Timková, S; Drotárová, Z; Vašková, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,309,20

The ovine sural nerve descended to the lower leg along the short saphenous vein. The length of the sural nerve was 14.3 ± 0.5 cm. The distance from the posterior edge of the lateral malleolus to the sural nerve was 7.8 ± 1.8 mm.

In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq in morphologically identified parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), and studied their transcriptomic states in the morphological, physiological, and developmental domains. Overall, we find high transcriptomic similarity among PV-INs, with few genes showing divergent expression between morphologically different types. Furthermore, PV-INs show a uniform synaptic cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profile, suggesting that CAM expression in mature PV cells does not reflect wiring specificity after development. Together, our results suggest that while PV-INs differ in anatomy and in vivo activity, their continuous transcriptomic and homogenous biophysical landscapes are not predictive of these distinct identities.","Que, Lin; Lukacsovich, David; Luo, Wenshu; Földy, Csaba",Nature communications,309,27

This study aims to analyze the relationship between sarcopenia measured by psoas muscle index on computer tomography scans and the presence of postoperative complications in colorectal cancer surgery. Materials and Methods: In a prospective study we recorded data from 51 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery in the Mures County Clinical Hospital, Romania. Total psoas muscle area and psoas density were measured at the level of the third lumbal vertebra (L3) for further index calculation. We also evaluated the general characteristics and laboratory analyses to obtain more information about status of the patients. Short-term postoperative complications were scored according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Results: The majority of the 51 patients were male (61%) and the median age was 65 years. More than half of the cancer was located in the rectum (56.9%), a quarter in the right colon (25.5%), the rest in the sigmoid (11.8%), and the left colon (5.9%). Twenty-one patients (41.2%) developed a complication, five (9.8%) of these were Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 or 5 (high grade) and sixteen (31.3%) grade 1 or 2 (low grade). The low- and high-grade groups showed a significantly lower right psoas muscle area, left psoas muscle area, total psoas muscle area, and psoas muscle index (p < 0.001 in all cases). Among laboratory analyses, a significantly lower perioperative hematocrit, hemoglobin, and albumin level were found in patients who developed complications. Furthermore we observed that an elevated serum C-reactive protein level was associated with a higher grade of complication (p < 0.043). Conclusions: The psoas muscle index (PMI) influence on the postoperative outcome is an important factor in our single center prospective study and it appears to be a good overall predictor in colorectal surgery. A lower PMI is directly associated with a low or high grade complication by Clavien-Dindo classification. Perioperative inflammatory and nutritional status evidenced by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin level influences the presence of postoperative complications.","Benedek, Zalán; Todor-Boér, Szabolcs; Kocsis, Loránd; Bauer, Orsolya; Suciu, Nicolae; Coroș, Marius Florin",Medicina,309,28

RESULTS Between June 2015 and June 2018, a total of 210 cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were treated with vitrectomy. Endodiathermy assisted vitreous base shaving and anterior hyaloid removal was used in those cases with a very low incidence of iatrogenic peripheral retinal breaks during vitreous base shaving (2%), and with no case of lens injury related to the technique. We achieved a final anatomical success of 95.2% in the study period after mean number of operations of 1.3 ± 0.2. Endodiathermy near the peripheral vitreous was not associated with any intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Endodiathermy assisted vitreous base and anterior hyaloid visualization is a safe adjuvant method that could help in achieving complete and rapid vitreous base shaving and anterior hyaloid removal.","Abdullatif, Abdussalam M; Nabih, Mostafa H",European journal of ophthalmology,309,24

METHODS We conducted a qualitative metasynthesis encompassing a systematic literature search in February 2017, for studies published in the past 15 years, in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, SveMed, PsychINFO and Web of Science. To be included, the studies had to report the experience of living with fatigue among adults with RA. The analysis and synthesis followed Malterud's systematic text condensation. RESULTS Eight qualitative articles were included, based on 212 people with RA (69% women) and aged between 20 and 83 years old. The synthesis resulted in the overall theme 'A vicious circle of an unpredictable symptom'. In addition, the synthesis derived four subthemes: 'being alone with fatigue'; 'time as a challenge'; 'language as a tool for increased understanding' and 'strategies to manage fatigue'. Fatigue affects all areas of everyday life for people with RA. They strive to plan and prioritise, pace, relax and rest. Furthermore, they try to make use of a variety of words and metaphors to explain to other people that they experience that RA-related fatigue is different from normal tiredness. Despite this, people with RA-related fatigue experience feeling alone with their symptom and they develop their own strategies to manage fatigue in their everyday life. CONCLUSIONS The unpredictability of RA-related fatigue is dominant, pervasive and is experienced as a vicious circle, which can be described in relation to its physical, cognitive, emotional and social impact. It is important for health professionals to acknowledge and address the impact of fatigue on the patients' everyday lives. Support from health professionals to manage fatigue and develop strategies to increase physical activity and maintain work is important for people with RA-related fatigue.","Primdahl, Jette; Hegelund, Annette; Lorenzen, Annette Gøntha; Loeppenthin, Katrine; Dures, Emma; Appel Esbensen, Bente",BMJ open,309,1

BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic and open techniques for incisional hernia repair are recognized treatment options with pros and cons. METHODS : Patients from 7 centers with a midline incisional hernia of a maximum width of 10 cm were randomized to either laparoscopic (LR) or open sublay (OR) mesh repair. Primary end point was pain at 3 weeks, measured as the bodily pain subscale of Short Form-36 (SF-36). Secondary end points were complications registered by type and severity (the Clavien-Dindo classification), movement restrictions, fatigue, time to full recovery, and QoL up to 8 weeks. RESULTS : Patients were recruited between October 2005 and November 2009. Of 157 randomized patients, 133 received intervention: 64 LR and 69 OR. Measurements of pain did not differ, nor did movement restriction and postoperative fatigue. SF-36 subscales favored the LR group: physical function (P < 0.001), role physical (P < 0.012), mental health (P < 0.022), and physical composite score (P < 0.009). Surgical site infections were 17 in the OR group compared with 1 in the LR group (P < 0.001). The severity of complications did not differ between the groups (P < 0.213). CONCLUSIONS : Postoperative pain or recovery at 3 weeks after repair of midline incisional hernias does not differ between LR and OR, but the LR results in better physical function and less surgical site infections than the OR does.

Neonatal care is emblematic of these acute services as averting deaths requires skilled care over many days from multiple professionals with at least basic equipment. However, hospital care is often of poor quality and large-scale change is needed to improve outcomes. However, achieving large scale change in health systems remains challenging. To set the scene we first characterise the problems of hospital newborn units (NBU) in Kenya. We then combine our understanding of theory and context with reflection on our own position as an embedded research group with no formal authority to help us propose a feasible intervention strategy linked to in initial programme theory. We explain this programme theory and suggest how within a multi-level clinical professional network leaders at the ward or mid-level of hospital hierarchies are key potential change agents. In support of our programme theory we briefly outline and seek to integrate key ideas drawn from a wider set of theories. We propose how an intervention might be developed and employed in a phased approach to create the ownership, relationships and momentum that will be needed to achieve change at scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a strategy for our research design that is based on a prospective, in-depth case study that includes quantitative and qualitative data collection linked to specific sub-studies. We suggest using Realistic Evaluation to integrate our findings and develop an updated programme theory that should inform future large-scale change efforts before briefly discussing some of the challenges of evaluating a network as an intervention.","English, Mike; Nzinga, Jacinta; Irimu, Grace; Gathara, David; Aluvaala, Jalemba; McKnight, Jacob; Wong, Geoffrey; Molyneux, Sassy",Wellcome open research,309,16

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effect of the vNOTES hysterectomy for uterus ≥1 kilogram (kg). METHODS From January 2019 to March 2020, patients with benign indications in cases of uterus weighing ≥1 kg, underwent vNOTES hysterectomy were studied retrospectively. The patients' demographics, indications for surgery, operation outcomes and follow-up details were recorded. RESULTS 39 patients were performed vNOTES hysterectomy for large uterus (mean weight 1141.8 gram, range from 1000 to 1720), indications for surgery included bulky uterine myomas or adenomysosis. The mean age was 48 years (range 42-66) and mean BMI was 24 kg/m2 (range 18.4-38). Mean operating time was 123.3 min (rang 40-400) and the mean estimated blood loss was 206.7 milliliters (range 10-1300). The mean pain assessment was 2.1 (range 0-5). The mean length of stay was 2.4 nights (1-11). 1 patient experienced ureteral injury and was performed ureteral anastomosis. 3 patients were converted to vaginal-assisted trans-umbilicus single-port laparoscopy. The learning curve was analyzed to show that 20 cases were needed to achieve proficiency in vNOTES hysterectomy for large uterus ≥1 kg. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience suggested that vNOTES hysterectomy for large uterus weighing ≥1 kg was feasible and safe, meanwhile this procedure had the advantages of all the minimal invasive approach such as fast recovery and aesthetic advantage.","Wang, Xiaojuan; Li, Junwei; Hua, Keqin; Chen, Yisong",BMC surgery,309,1

The formal name given to 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization is COVID-19, while the International Committee on Taxonomy has named it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to this viral attack, nations around the world have issued lockdown restrictions. Presently, there is no effective way to control the spread of 2019-nCoV, except through social distancing and hygienic activities. World-class scientists and researchers are trying to develop vaccines and medicines that will cure this deadly viral disease and control its spread. Our aim in presenting this article is to provide an easy therapeutic approach that effectively combats deadly viral diseases, such as COVID-19, with minimal intervention and effort. Different Ayurvedic therapeutic agents (Curcuma longa L, green tea, and Piper nigrum) inhibit the entry of viruses in the host cell and the transmission of pathogens, while improving immunity. Curcumin and piperine (1-piperoylpiperidine) interact with each other and form a π-π intermolecular complex that enhances the bioavailability of curcumin by inhibition of glucuronidation of curcumin in the liver. Two molecules, curcumin and catechin, bind directly to the receptor-binding domain of the S-protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host cell, by which these molecules inhibit the entry of viruses in the host cell. As a result, the animal host will survive the infection.","Kumar, Gajendra; Kumar, Dharmendra; Singh, Netra Pal",Drug research,309,7

Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. METHODS Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. RESULTS Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images. These 42 sites also had lesions on macroscopic evaluation. There were 3 false negative and 3 false positive results identified on CECT. The sensitivity of CECT for diagnosing lesions of the DDFT in the equine foot was 93%. CONCLUSION CECT is an effective adjunct to the more commonly used diagnostic techniques in equine foot pain.","van Hamel, S E; Bergman, H J; Puchalski, S M; de Groot, M W; van Weeren, P R",Equine veterinary journal,309,33

However, a substantial number of patients who had successful clot removal develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Residual thrombus and rethrombosis play a part in this phenomenon, but the role of coexisting primary chronic venous disease (PCVD) in these patients has not been studied. METHODS All patients who underwent catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal for symptomatic acute iliofemoral DVT during a 5-year period compose the study group. These patients were assessed for PTS by the Villalta scale, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life (VEINES-QOL) questionnaire. The presence of coexisting PCVD was determined by clinical and duplex ultrasound findings in the contralateral leg at the time of the initial DVT diagnosis. Patients who had coexisting PCVD were compared with those without PCVD. RESULTS Forty patients (40 limbs) were included in the study group. At initial diagnosis, 15 patients (38%) had coexisting symptomatic primary valve reflux in the unaffected limb. After thrombolysis, 9 of 40 limbs (22%) had complete lysis, 29 (73%) had ≥ 50% to 99% lysis, and 2 (5%) had <50% lysis. The mean percentage of lysis in patients with or without PCVD was similar (78% vs 86%; P = .13). Patients without coexisting PCVD had significantly better Villalta score and VCSS compared with those with coexisting PCVD (Villalta score, 2.52 vs 3.27, P = .014; VCSS, 2.96 vs 3.29, P = .005). Forty-five percent of patients (18 of 40) developed PTS. Patients who developed PTS had less clot lysis than those without PTS. This was true for patients with coexisting PCVD (60% vs 85%; P = .025) and in patients without PCVD (75% vs 89%; P = .013). There was no significant difference in the VEINES-QOL score between those with or without PCVD (79.5 vs 80.5; P = .9). Patients who had reflux in the treated limb after lysis had a five times greater chance for development of PTS compared with those who retained normal valve function during follow-up (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-17.045). However, in patients with normal veins in the contralateral leg, the chance of development of PTS was 1.5 times higher if reflux was present in the treated limb (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.043-10.253). CONCLUSIONS Coexisting PCVD is a contributing factor to development of PTS after treatment of iliofemoral DVT with thrombus removal techniques.","Lee, John J; Al-Jubouri, Mustafa; Acino, Robin; Comerota, Anthony J; Lurie, Fedor",Journal of vascular surgery.

Since November 2020, the TaqPath COVID-19 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) has been used to identify viral strains of the new lineage B.1.1.7, since it fails to detect the S-gene with the ∆69/70 deletion. Here, we proposed S-gene mutations screening with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene), another widely used RT-PCR test that targets Sarbecovirus E, SARS-CoV-2 N, and RdRp/S genes. Accordingly, we evaluated the S gene amplification curve pattern compared to those of the other genes. Exploiting an Allplex assay-generated dataset, we screened 663 RT-PCR digital records, including all SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples tested in our laboratory with the Allplex assay between January 1st and February 25th, 2021. This approach enabled us to detect 64 samples with peculiar non-sigmoidal amplification curves. Sequencing a selected group of 4 RNA viral genomes demonstrated that those curves were associated with B.1.1.7 variant strains. Our results strongly suggest that B.1.1.7 variant spread has begun in this area at least since January and imply the potential of these analytical methods to track and characterize the spread of B.1.1.7 strains in those areas where Allplex SARS-CoV-2 datasets have been previously recorded.","Ibba, Gabriele; Sau, Rosangela; Angioj, Flavia; Abbondio, Marcello; Rubino, Salvatore; Uzzau, Sergio",Journal of infection in developing countries,309,19

As a result, adults engaged in a visual search task will often look at items with labels that share phonological features with the target object, demonstrating that language can become activated even in non-linguistic contexts. This highly interactive cognitive system is the culmination of our linguistic and visual experiences-and yet, our understanding of how the relationship between language and vision develops remains limited. The present study explores the developmental trajectory of language-mediated visual search by examining whether children can be distracted by linguistic competitors during a non-linguistic visual search task. Though less robust compared to what has been previously observed with adults, we find evidence of phonological competition in children as young as 8 years old. Furthermore, the extent of language activation is predicted by individual differences in linguistic, visual, and domain-general cognitive abilities, with the greatest phonological competition observed among children with strong language abilities combined with weaker visual memory and inhibitory control. We propose that linguistic expertise is fundamental to the development of language-mediated visual search, but that the rate and degree of automatic language activation depends on interactions among a broader network of cognitive abilities.","Chabal, Sarah; Hayakawa, Sayuri; Marian, Viorica",Cognitive research: principles and implications,309,1

A total of 1523 patients with a current or past diagnosis of solid tumors and diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed with PCR) between 11 March and 20 May, 2020, were included. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Median age was 61 (range:18-94), and 752 (49%) were male. The most common types of cancers were breast (19.8%), prostate (10.9%), and colorectal cancer (10.8%). 65% of the patients had at least one comorbidity.

METHODS In this prospective, non-interventional, single center study, all consecutive patients between 18 and 80 years admitted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a no flow less than 10min, a low flow of less than 50min and a persistent coma after ROSC with Glasgow score equal or less than seven at baseline were included. RESULTS Between February 2012 and January 2013, 43 patients were admitted for OHCA in our ICU. Twenty-two patients (51%) were discharged with no or minimal neurologic complications (CPC 1-2). Mortality rate in the ICU was 46.5%. Cerebral oximetry (rSO2) was correlated with temperature, heart rhythm, PaO2, hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure. Mean rSO2 during the 48 first hours was not different between patients with good and bad neurologic outcomes, respectively, 61.8 (5.9) vs. 58.1 (8.8), P=0.13, as during the period of hypothermia. The minimal value of rSO2 during the first 48h was significantly different between patients with good prognosis and those with bad prognosis, respectively, 45.0 (6.8) vs. 31.7 (15.0), P=0.0009.

The anatomic location of a lumbar hernia makes diagnosis and repair challenging. We successfully repaired a lumbar hernia using a single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this surgical technique in the treatment of a primary Grynfeltt hernia. CASE PRESENTATION A 76-year-old Taiwanese man presented to our hospital with a left lower bulging mass noted for over three months. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a left Grynfeltt hernia. We performed a single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair. Our patient was discharged uneventfully on the fourth day after the operation. There was no evidence of recurrence after six months of follow-up. CONCLUSION A laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair for a lumbar hernia provides an excellent operative view and minimal invasiveness. The single-incision technique also provides better cosmetic outcomes. Our experience suggests that the single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal approach may be a feasible and safe alterative to conventional approaches in lumbar hernia repair.","Wei, Ching-Ting; Chen, Yaw-Sen; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan; Hsieh, Kun-Chou",Journal of medical case reports,309,5

Published randomised studies, non-randomised studies and case series reporting the use of minimal invasive approach to treat gastric cancer were retrieved from the search of standard medical electronic databases and their outcomes were highlighted suggesting their effectiveness. Several randomised, controlled trials and meta-analyses have proven the clinical and oncological safety of the laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Similarly, robot-assisted gastrectomy, EMR (endoscopic mucosal resection) and ESD (endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection) have also been proven feasible and safe to treat gastric cancer of various stages in prospective and retrospective comparative studies. However, UK based studies on minimally invasive surgery to treat gastric cancer is scarce and the paucity of trials led to uncertain outcomes. Laparoscopic gastrectomy, robot-assisted gastrectomy, EMR and ESD are feasible procedures in terms of clinical and oncological safety but mainly being practiced in Asian countries with high prevalence of stomach cancer.

COVID-19 pandemic is used as an example. BACKGROUND Adequate health literacy in the population is known to be important for the prevention of communicable diseases. Foreign domestic workers, a group of marginalized caregivers in private households, are generally presumed to have limited health literacy because of numerous socio-cultural disadvantages. To date, there is limited evidence that these informal health care providers receive support from community-based nurses. DESIGN A discursive paper. CONCLUSION Foreign domestic workers, with varying levels of health literacy, may be viewed either as a resource to break the chain of infection or as a potential reservoir of communicable diseases in the community. Meanwhile, restrictions imposed in response to diseases transmissions (e.g., stay-at-home measures for COVID-19) may directly exacerbate the social support received by these foreign domestic works and their ability to access health-related information. There are also concerns about their ability to appraise and evaluate information related to communicable diseases at a time when fake news and misinformation is being disseminated through social media. Language and cultural barriers are important issues that need to be addressed to ensure that foreign domestic workers are in a position to follow public health recommendations. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses hold an important position in empowering foreign domestic workers with adequate health literacy, by engaging groups of foreign domestic workers in the community and their consulates in planning educational programmes and effectively disseminating information. At a time of global pandemic, an assessment of the health literacy levels of foreign domestic workers in places like Hong Kong is urgently required.","Ho, Ken Hok Man; Smith, Graeme Drummond",Journal of clinical nursing,309,5

Using 6 model active pharmaceutical ingredients, we show that a platform DC tablet formulation suitable for developing low-dose API with excellent CU can be developed. This platform formulation is enabled by particle engineering, where an API of interest is loaded in a suitable porous carrier to form a uniform API-carrier composite. Powder properties of such composite particles are dictated by the properties of the carrier, which are insensitive to chemical structure and loading level of the API. Powder flowability, tabletability, tablet friability, and tablet disintegration time are all excellent and only vary within a narrow range among the 6 model APIs. Nearly 100% drug can be released in water from tablets composed of the 6 model APIs. Thus, the approach described here holds the promise for broad application in developing low-dose tablet products using DC possessing excellent CU and other critical quality attributes.","Sun, Wei-Jhe; Aburub, Aktham; Sun, Changquan Calvin",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,309,1

We aim to summarize recent advances in the understanding and management of graft rejection. RECENT FINDINGS Immune rejection remains the leading cause of graft failure in penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). While ABO blood type and sex match between donor and recipient may reduce rejection, human leucocyte antigens class II matching in a randomized study did not reduce the risk of rejection in high-risk PKP. Compared with PKP, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty, and descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty have lower immune rejection rates of 1.7-13%, 5-11.4%, and 1.7-2.8%, respectively, based on long-term (5 years and more) studies. Whether immune rejection is a major risk factor for graft failure in these lamellar keratoplasties is unclear. While there have not been major advances in the systemic management of graft rejection, topical nonsteroid agents such as tacrolimus and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor have shown promise in high-risk cases. SUMMARY Immune rejection remains the leading cause of graft failure in PKP. Lamellar keratoplasties have significantly lower rejection rates compared with PKP. The significance of rejection in the failure of lamellar grafts warrants further investigation.","Yin, Jia",Current opinion in ophthalmology,309,30

To lower the cost and to avoid implanting biological material, the use of synthetic meshes has been proposed. This is the first study examining TIGR® Mesh in a larger series of immediate breast reconstruction. The aims of the study were to examine complications and predictors for complications. All consecutive patients operated on with breast reconstruction with TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh and tissue expanders (TEs) or permanent implant between March 2015 and September 2016 in our department were prospectively included. Exclusion criteria were ongoing smoking, BMI (kg/m2) > 30, planned postoperative radiation, and inability to leave informed consent. Fifteen breasts (23%) were affected by complications within 30 d: four (6.2%) major complications and eleven (17%) minor complications. The major complications included two implant losses and one pulmonary embolism (PE). Predictors for a complication were age over 51 years, BMI over 24.5 kg/m2, large resection weight, and the need for a wise pattern excision of skin. Four minor surgical complications occurred after 30 d (minimum follow-up 17 months). There were no implant losses. In addition, minor aesthetic corrections, such as dog-ear resection, were performed in 10 breasts. In conclusion, breast reconstruction with a TE in combination with TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh can be performed with a low complication rate.","Hallberg, Håkan; Lewin, Richard; Elander, Anna; Hansson, Emma",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,309,1

Nat Biotechnol 2010;28:600-605). Further screening of these compounds against common respiratory viruses led to the discovery of compound FA-613. This inhibitor exhibited low micromolar antiviral activity against various influenza A and B virus strains, including the highly pathogenic influenza A strains H5N1 and H7N9, enterovirus A71, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus A, SARS- and MERS-coronavirus. No significant cellular toxicity was observed at the effective concentrations. Animal studies showed an improved survival rate in BALB/c mice that received intranasal FA-613 treatments against a lethal dose infection of A/HK/415742Md/2009 (H1N1). Further cell-based assays indicated that FA-613 interfer with the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway by targeting the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Surprisingly, FA-613 lost its antiviral potency in the interferon-deficient Vero cell line, while maintaining its inhibitory activity in an interferon-competent cell line which showed elevated expression of host antiviral genes when infected in the presence of FA-613. Further investigation of the specific connection between pyrimidine synthesis inhibition and the induction of host innate immunity might aid clinical development of this type of drug in antiviral therapies.

Results Reflex response amplitudes significantly increased during JM, HP, and TC in the soleus. HP and JM significantly changed the background activity in the soleus, but TC alone did not. Conclusion These results suggest that dominantly presynaptic disinhibitory mechanisms may be responsible for the increase in the tendon tap reflex during HP, TC, and JM. Significance Because the findings indicate that HP increases the background activity of the soleus, we suggest that researchers should use only TC during the Jendrassik maneuver to avoid any confounding background activity change.","Ertuglu, Lale A; Karacan, Ilhan; Yilmaz, Gizem; Türker, Kemal S",Clinical neurophysiology practice,309,1

Pandemic scenarios, such as the current one (COVID-19), call for a reduction of face-to-face meetings, especially for elderly patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the innovative concept of applying telemedical assessment to geriatric patients in the emergency department (ED) with ED standard treatment. The therapeutic recommendations regarding drug management from the two assessments were compared. A special focus was the use of potentially inadequate drugs (PIMs) for geriatric patients according to the “Fit for the Aged” (FORTA) classification. METHODS 50 patients (40% female) aged ≥70 years and assessed with an Identification of Seniors at Risk Score (ISAR score) of ≥2 admitted to the ED were prospectively enrolled in this study between November 2017 and February 2018. In addition to the standard treatment in the ED, co-evaluation via video transmission was independently carried out by a board-certified geriatrician. Drug recommendations by ED physicians (A) and the geriatrician (B) were compared. RESULTS There was a significantly higher frequency of recommendations regarding changes to preexisting medication (p <0.001, n = 50) via geriatric telemedicine in comparison with standard ED treatment. The geriatrician intervened significantly more often than the ED physicians: discontinuation of a drug, p <0.001; start of a new drug, p = 0.004; dose change of a drug, p = 0.001; n = 50). Based on the additional therapy recommendations of the geriatrician, the amount of medication taken by the patient was significantly reduced compared with standard ED treatment (ED assessment t(49) = 0.622 vs geriatrician’s assessment t(49) = 4.165; p <0.001; n = 50). Additionally, the number of PIMs was significantly reduced compared with standard medical treatment (p <0.001). The geriatrician changed 53.9% of the drugs (35/65) whereas the ED physicians changed only 12.3% (8/65). Recommendations for immediate drug therapy, however, were made more frequently by ED physicians (p <0.039, n = 50). DISCUSSION An early assessment of elderly emergency patients by a geriatrician had a significant impact on the number of drug interventions in the ED. The number of PIMs could be significantly reduced. Whether this also has a positive effect on the further inpatient course needs to be investigated in further prospective studies.

The SILS approach has the potential of reducing the trauma of the surgical access and postoperative pain. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) greatly reduces patient postoperative pain compared with traditional thoracotomy incisions. The current trend is to use fewer working ports to reduce even more postoperative pain, chest wall paresthesia, and hospital stay. No reports have described using a SILS port in VATS. METHODS From September 2009 to March 2010, 13 patients had surgery for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The patients underwent single-lung ventilation. A 2.5-cm-long incision was made at the sixth intercostal space in the median axillary line. The pleural space was entered by blunt dissection for placement of a single flexible port. A 5-mm 0° videothoracoscope, a roticulating grasper, and an endoGIA stapler were introduced through port channels. Apical lung blebs were stapled, and pleurodesis by pleural abrasion with Marlex mesh was performed. RESULTS The study enrolled nine men (69.2%) and four women with a median age of 26.3 years. No complications were recorded. The postoperative pain was mild for 10 patients (76.9%) and moderate for 3 patients. Mild chest wall paresthesia (numbness) was observed in three patients (23.07%). The postoperative hospital stay was 2.15 days. CONCLUSIONS Although the SILS port is for laparoscopic use, it allowed an adequate lineup of the instruments along the intercostal space and adequate instrument maneuverability for stapling and resecting of apical lung bullae or blebs. The procedure was accomplished successfully for 92.3% of the patients. This is the first report on the use of a SILS port in VATS. Further work and development of a proper thoracic single port are needed to define the uses and advantages of this uniportal technique.","Berlanga, Luis A; Gigirey, Orlando",Surgical endoscopy,309,1

There were no differences in cytokines over time between patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection. Using day 1 cytokine levels, latent class analysis categorized patients into two subphenotypes: subphenotype 1 (n = 74 [64%]) and subphenotype 2 (n = 42 [36%]); the latter had significantly higher levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-1ra, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interleukin-12p70, interleukin-15, interleukin-17A, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-α, and interferon-γ. Although baseline characteristics were not different between the two subphenotypes, patients in the subphenotype 2 had higher ICU mortality compared with the subphenotype 1 (18/42 [43%] vs 17/74 [23%]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS One third of critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection demonstrated a subphenotype characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokines, consistent with cytokine storm. Further research is needed to examine whether immunomodulators have differential effects based on inflammatory subphenotypes.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Jawdat, Dunia; Hajeer, Ali H; Sadat, Musharaf; Jose, Jesna; Vishwakarma, Ramesh K; Almashaqbeh, Walid; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz",Critical care medicine,309,5

The interstitial cells can be eliminated through two consecutive treatments with colchicine, a plant-derived toxin that kills dividing cells, thus erasing the potential for renewal of the differentiated cells that are derived from the interstitial stem cells. This allows for the generation of Hydra that lack nerve cells. A nerve-free polyp cannot open its mouth to feed, egest, or regulate osmotic pressure. Such animals, however, can survive and be cultured indefinitely in the laboratory if regularly force-fed and burped. The lack of nerve cells allows for studies of the role of the nervous system in regulating animal behavior and regeneration. Previously published protocols for nerve-free Hydra maintenance involve outdated techniques such as mouth-pipetting with hand-pulled micropipette tips to feed and clean the Hydra. Here, an improved protocol for maintenance of nerve-free Hydra is introduced. Fine-tipped forceps are used to force open the mouth and insert freshly killed Artemia. Following force-feeding, the body cavity of the animal is flushed with fresh medium using a syringe and hypodermic needle to remove undigested material, referred to here as ""burping"". This new method of force-feeding and burping nerve-free Hydra through the use of forceps and syringes eliminates the need for mouth-pipetting using hand-pulled micropipette tips. It thus makes the process safer and significantly more time efficient. To ensure that the nerve cells in the hypostome have been eliminated, immunohistochemistry using anti-tyrosine-tubulin is conducted.","Tran, Cassidy M; Fu, Sharon; Rowe, Trevor; Collins, Eva-Maria S",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,309,5

Accumulation of disability is at least partially due to diminished capacity for neuroplasticity within the central nervous system. Aerobic exercise is a potentially important intervention to enhance neuroplasticity since it causes upregulation of neurotrophins and enhances corticospinal excitability, which can be probed using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Whether people with progressive MS who have accumulated substantial disability could benefit from walking rehabilitative training to enhance neuroplasticity is not known. Objective: We aimed to determine whether 10 weeks of task-specific walking training would affect corticospinal excitability over time (pre, post, and 3-month follow-up) among people with progressive MS who required walking aids. Results: Eight people with progressive MS (seven female; 29-74 years old) with an Expanded Disability Status Scale of 6-6.5 underwent harness-supported treadmill walking training in a temperature controlled room at 16°C (10 weeks; three times/week; 40 min at 40-65% heart rate reserve). After training, there was significantly higher corticospinal excitability in both brain hemispheres, reductions in TMS active motor thresholds, and increases in motor-evoked potential amplitudes and slope of the recruitment curve (REC). Decreased intracortical inhibition (shorter cortical silent period) after training was noted in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand only. These effects were not sustained at follow-up. There was a significant relationship between increases in corticospinal excitability (REC, area under the curve) in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand and lessening of both intensity and impact of fatigue on activities of daily living (Fatigue Severity Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, respectively). Conclusion: Our pilot results support that vigorous treadmill training can potentially improve neuroplastic potential and mitigate symptoms of the disease even among people who have accumulated substantial disability due to MS.","Chaves, Arthur R; Devasahayam, Augustine J; Riemenschneider, Morten; Pretty, Ryan W; Ploughman, Michelle",Frontiers in neurology,309,10

An 8-month-old female and an 8-month-old male underwent living donor liver transplants for biliary atresia. In both cases, a reduction in rSO2 was detected before an emergency liver biopsy was required. As a result of biopsy examinations, both patients were diagnosed with acute graft rejection. NIRS might be useful for graft management during the postoperative period in pediatric patients that undergo liver transplantation. After a liver transplant, a reduction in the rSO2 of the graft might be indicative of the onset of vascular complications.","Shiba, Juntaro; Satoh, Masaaki; Taira, Koki; Niwa, Yasunori; Inoue, Soichiro; Mizuta, Koichi; Takeuchi, Mamoru",Pediatric transplantation,309,19

IDR is categorized into hypervascular transformation of non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules and new intrahepatic recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and IDR after RFA, focusing on new intrahepatic recurrence. METHODS Ninety-one consecutive patients with 115 HCCs undergoing pretreatment Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and RFA for treatment of HCC were enrolled. RESULTS Of the 91 patients who underwent RFA for HCC, 24 had non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules on pretreatment Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Recurrences were observed in 15 and 19 patients with and without non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules, respectively. Of the 15 recurrences in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules, 10 patients had new intrahepatic recurrences. The cumulative incidence of new intrahepatic recurrence was significantly higher in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules than in those without non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules and Child-Pugh score were independent risk factors for new intrahepatic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules during the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were a useful predictive factor for IDR, particularly for new intrahepatic recurrence, after RFA.","Iwamoto, Takayuki; Imai, Yasuharu; Igura, Takumi; Kogita, Sachiyo; Sawai, Yoshiyuki; Fukuda, Kazuto; Yamaguchi, Yoshitaka; Matsumoto, Yasushi; Nakahara, Masanori; Morimoto, Osakuni; Ohashi, Hiroshi; Fujita, Norihiko; Kudo, Masatoshi; Takehara, Tetsuo",Digestive diseases,309,24

In the same vein, adequate reporting of practice guidelines to optimise patient care is equally important. Our study examines the quality of reporting of published WHO guidelines, over time, using the RIGHT (Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in HealThcare) reporting checklist. METHODS We examined English-language guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee from inception of the committee in 2007 until 31 December 2017. Pairs of independent, trained reviewers assessed the reporting quality of these guidelines. Descriptive data were summarised with frequencies and percentages. RESULTS We included 182 eligible guidelines. Overall, 25 out of the 34 RIGHT items were reported in 75% or more of the WHO guidelines. The reporting rates improved over time. Further, 90% of the guidelines reported document type in the title. The identification of evidence, the rationale for recommendations and the review process were reported in more than 80% of guidelines. The certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was assessed in 81% of the guidelines assessed. While 82% of guidelines reported funding sources, only 25% mentioned the role of funders. CONCLUSIONS WHO guidelines provide adequate reporting of many of the RIGHT items and reporting has improved over time. WHO guidelines compare favourably to guidelines produced by other organisations. However, reporting can be further improved in a number of areas.","Wang, Xiaoqin; Zhou, Qi; Chen, Yaolong; Yang, Nan; Pottie, Kevin; Xiao, Yujie; Tong, Yajing; Yao, Liang; Wang, Qi; Yang, Kehu; Norris, Susan L",Health research policy and systems,309,1

Hypothalamic leptin receptor (LepR)- and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons are directly responsive to growth hormone (GH) and deletion of GH receptor (GHR) in these cells impairs neuroendocrine responses during situations of metabolic stress. In the present study, we determined whether GHR ablation in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells modifies acute and chronic metabolic adaptations to exercise. Male mice carrying deletion of GHR in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells were submitted to 8 weeks of treadmill running training. Changes in aerobic performance and exercise-induced metabolic adaptations were determined. Mice carrying GHR deletion in LepR cells showed increased aerobic performance after 8 weeks of treadmill training, whereas GHR ablation in SF1 cells prevented improvement in running capacity. Trained mice carrying GHR ablation in SF1 cells exhibited increased fat mass and reduced cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, deletion of GHR in LepR cells reduced fat mass and increased gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy, energy expenditure and voluntary locomotor activity in trained mice. Although glucose tolerance was not significantly affected by targeted deletions, glycemia before and immediately after maximum running tests was altered by GHR ablation. In conclusion, GHR signaling in hypothalamic neurons regulates the adaptation capacity to aerobic exercise in a cell-specific manner. These findings suggest that GH may represent a hormonal cue that informs specific hypothalamic neurons to produce exercise-induced acute and chronic metabolic adaptations.","Pedroso, João A B; Santos, Lucas B P Dos; Furigo, Isadora C; Spagnol, Alexandre R; Wasinski, Frederick; List, Edward O; Kopchick, John J; Jr, Jose Donato",Peptides,309,1

However, the effect of GL on HMGB1 expression in endotoxemia as well as its underlying molecular mechanism remained unclear. METHODS Twenty-one pigs were divided into four groups: sham group (n=3), control group (n=6), ethyl pyruvate group (n=6) and glycyrrhizin group (n=6). Pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, monitored and given a continuous intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Twelve hours after the start of the LPS infusion, ethyl pyruvate (30 mg/kg/hr) or glycyrrhizin (1 mg/kg/hr) was administered for 12 hours. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, oxygen exchange, and metabolic status were measured. The concentrations of cytokines in serum and the corresponding gene and protein expressions in tissue samples from liver, lungs, kidneys, small intestine and lymph nodes were measured. RESULTS GL maintained the stability of systemic hemodynamics and improved pulmonary oxygen exchange and metabolic status. GL also attenuated organ injury and decreased the serum levels of HMGB1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting their gene and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS GL improved systemic hemodynamics and protected vital organs against porcine endotoxemia through modulation of the systemic inflammatory response. By reducing the serum level and gene expression of HMGB1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, GL may become a potential agent for the treatment of sepsis.","Wang, Wei; Zhao, Feng; Fang, Yong; Li, Xiantao; Shen, Lei; Cao, Tongwa; Zhu, Hechen",Critical care,309,11

Effective control of the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic requires both vaccines and antivirals. Antivirals are particularly crucial to treat infected people during the period of time that an effective vaccine is being developed and deployed. Because the development of specific antiviral drugs can take a considerable length of time, an important approach is to identify existing drugs already approved for use in humans which could be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics. Here we focus on antivirals directed against the SARS-CoV2 Mpro protease, which is required for virus replication. A structural similarity search showed that the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease has a striking three-dimensional structural similarity to the SARS-CoV2 Mpro protease, particularly in the arrangement of key active site residues. We used virtual docking predictions to assess the hypothesis that existing drugs already approved for human use or clinical testing that are directed at the HCV NS3/4A protease might fit well into the active-site cleft of the SARS-CoV2 protease (Mpro). AutoDock docking scores for 12 HCV protease inhibitors and 9 HIV-1 protease inhibitors were determined and compared to the docking scores for an α-ketoamide inhibitor of Mpro, which has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2 virus replication in cell culture. We identified eight HCV protease inhibitors that bound to the Mpro active site with higher docking scores than the α-ketoamide inhibitor, suggesting that these protease inhibitors may effectively bind to the Mpro active site. These results provide the rationale for us to test the identified HCV protease inhibitors as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV2 protease, and as inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 virus replication. Subsequently these repurposed drugs could be evaluated as COVID-19 therapeutics.","Bafna, Khushboo; Krug, Robert M; Montelione, Gaetano T",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,309,20

Twenty patients with CRPS-1 were consecutively enrolled in the study after giving informed consent. The diagnosis of CRPS-1 was defined using the Bruehl and Harden/IASP diagnostic criteria. CRPS-1 was diagnosed between 3 and 18 months after the inciting event (trauma). According to a multiple single-case design (baseline [A1], treatment [B], follow-up [A2]), multiple baseline and follow-up measurements were performed to evaluate changes in CRPS signs and symptoms and to assess functional parameters.

However, few data are available to compare laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) and open techniques for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The aim of this study is to compare the oncologic efficacy and long-term outcomes of LATG vs. open total gastrectomy (OTG) for AGC and to provide our experiences regarding these surgical difficulties as well. METHODS Using data from a clinical database of all operations performed in our department by a special surgical team, we retrospectively analysed data from 117 cases of LATG and matched OTG performed between January 2004 and December 2010. This analysis was a case-control study in which patients in the two groups were matched according to tumour location, age, gender, BMI and TNM stage via a propensity score matching method. Patient clinical characteristics, lymph node retrieval, early postoperative complications, recurrence and long-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS The demographics, preoperative data and characteristics of the tumour were similar in both groups. No significant differences were found in the LATG group compared with the OTG group with regard to the number of retrieved lymph nodes or distance from the proximal margin. Operating time was longer in the LATG group than in the OTG group (292.8 ± 49.5 vs. 242.1 ± 47.4, p < 0.05). Significant differences were found between LATG and OTG with regard to blood loss, postoperative hospitalisation and times of analgesic injection. The early postoperative complication rates in the LATG group were significantly lower than in the OTG group (11.1 vs. 16.3 %, p < 0.05). Operative mortality was zero in both groups. During a median follow-up of 61.2 (range, 6-84) months, the overall 5-year survival rates in the LATG group and OTG group were 49.3 and 46.5 %, respectively; there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.756). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that LATG is technically feasible for advanced gastric cancer patients and can yield good short- and long-term oncologic outcomes as compared with conventional OTG.","Bo, T; Peiwu, Y; Feng, Q; Yongliang, Z; Yan, S; Yingxue, H; Huaxing, L",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,309,1

Our objective was to describe the Spanish experience of this technique and analyze its reliability and short- to mid-term efficacy. METHODS National multicenter observational study, which retrospectively recruited all patients (of any age) with VSD (of any location or type) who underwent percutaneous NitOcclud occlusion, using an intention-to-treat analysis, until January 2019. RESULTS A total of 117 attempts were made to implant at least 1 NitOcclud in 116 patients in 13 institutions. The median [range] age and weight was 8.6 [0.4-69] years and 27 [5.8-97] kg, respectively. In 99 patients (85%), the VSD was an isolated congenital defect. The location was perimembranous in 95 (81%), and 74 (63%) of them were aneurysmatic. The mean fluoroscopy time was 34 [11.4-124] minutes. Of the 117 attempts, 104 were successful (89%) with a follow-up of 31.4 [0.6-59] months. At the last review, final complete occlusion of the defect without residual shunt or with only a minimal shunt was achieved in 92.3% (no shunt, n=73; trivial shunt, n=23). Four patients required a second procedure for residual shunt occlusion. Two devices had to be surgically explanted due to severe hemolysis. There were no deaths or other major complications. CONCLUSIONS The NitOcclud device can be used successfully for a wide anatomical spectrum of VSD. The main issue is residual shunt, but its incidence decreases over time. The incidence of hemolysis was very low and no permanent changes were detected in atrioventricular conduction.","Solana-Gracia, Ruth; Mendoza Soto, Alberto; Carrasco Moreno, José Ignacio; Del Cerro Marín, María Jesús; Gutiérrez-Larraya Aguado, Federico; Coserría Sánchez, José Félix; Blanco Mata, Roberto; Prada Martínez, Fredy Hermógenes; Pan Álvarez-Ossorio, Manuel; Jiménez Montañés, Lorenzo; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Rodríguez Vázquez Del Rey, María Del Mar; Gutiérrez García, Hipólito; Velasco Bayón, José Manuel; Zunzunegui Martínez, José Luis",Revista espanola de cardiologia,309,16

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of RNF2 expression in SCC and adjacent tissues from patients. The protein and gene expression levels of RNF2 in SCC and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot analysis and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT) PCR. Single factor analysis was used to study the association between RNF2 expression level and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with SCC. Multifactor Cox survival analysis was used to examine the association between RNF2 expression and the overall survival rate of postoperative patients with SCC. The results from IHC staining demonstrated that the positive expression rate of RNF2 was 84.68% (210/248) and 56.05% (139/248) in SCC and in adjacent tissues, respectively. Furthermore, results from western blot analysis demonstrated that RNF2 protein expression in SCC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues (P<0.05). The positive rate of RNF2 mRNA in SCC was 81.05% (201/248), which was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues 54.44% (135/248; P<0.05). Furthermore, RNF2 protein and gene expression levels were associated with tumor diameter, tumor stage, tumor metastasis and the degree of tumor differentiation in patients with SCC. Patients exhibiting higher RNF2 protein expression in SCC tissues had a significantly shorter disease-specific survival rate compared with patients with low RNF2 expression. In addition, RNF2 protein expression, tumor diameter, tumors site and tumor stage were independent factors affecting the overall survival rate of postoperative patients. High protein and gene expression levels of RNF2 in SCC tissues may be associated with the occurrence and development of SCC and prognosis of patients. The results form this study may serve the development of novel therapeutic options and diagnostic strategies for patients with SCC.","Ling, Bai; Yao, Ming; Li, Gongqi; Liu, Jun; Liu, Bin; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Bin",Oncology letters,309,2

While most concerns have centred on how learning activities may successfully transit from face-to-face to remote delivery, little attention has been given to how educators can be supported in this new unchartered territory. In this article, we discuss the crucial role of team leaders and how their management and leadership style may have great potential to support educators' motivation. Based on Self-determination Theory, we offer a framework through which team leaders may contribute to create optimal remote working environments for educators. We argue that educators' autonomous motivation depends on how they perceive their remote work environment as supportive of their basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Then, we highlight a series of practical recommendations by which team leaders may be more needs-supportive. Working from home requires space, trust, open communication and flexibility, especially considering that team members may have different clinical or personal circumstances. We therefore hope these suggestions are helpful to cultivate educators' autonomous motivation, which is beneficial not only for themselves but also for others in their institution, including their co-workers and students.","Orsini, Cesar; Rodrigues, Veena",Medical teacher,309,17

The extraordinary pace of clinical research, and particularly the surge in adaptive trials of new and repurposed treatments, have provided rapid answers to questions of whether such treatments work, and has resulted in corticosteroids taking centre stage in the management of hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Some treatment modalities, such as the role of anticoagulation to prevent and treat potential thromboembolic complications, remain controversial, as does the use of high-level oxygen support, outside of an intensive care unit setting.

Moreover, a shortage of available CT dataset hinders deep learning techniques applying to tackling COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based approach known as PPM-Unet to segmenting COVID-19 lesions from CT images. Our method improves an Unet by adopting pyramid pooling modules instead of the conventional skip connection and then enhances the representation of the neural network by aiding the global attention mechanism. We first pre-train PPM-Unet on COVID-19 dataset of pseudo labels containing1600 samples producing a coarse model. Then we fine-tune the coarse PPM-Unet on the standard COVID-19 dataset consisting of 100 pairs of samples to achieve a fine PPM-Unet. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method can accurately segment COVID-19 infection regions from CT images, and achieve higher performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation models in this study. It offers a promising tool to lay a foundation for quantitatively detecting COVID-19 lesions.","Ma, Yinjin; Feng, Peng; He, Peng; Ren, Yong; Guo, Xiaodong; Wei, Biao",Biomedical physics & engineering express,309,7

It results in increased vulnerability to chronic diseases. Despite growing clinical concerns about sarcopenia in an aging society, there are few validated biomarkers for age-related sarcopenia. We tested the potential of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) as a biomarker for sarcopenia in mice and humans across wide age ranges. We used four groups of mice (6, 10, 14, and 18 months old) to explore the association between GDF-15 levels and age, muscle mass, and endurance capacity. Among those four groups, 6- and 18-month-old mice were exposed to 8 weeks of treadmill exercise. The GDF-15 levels were measured in serum and muscle at baseline and after exercise intervention. The body composition was assessed using animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). GDF-15 levels in tissue and serum increased with age in these mice. The serum levels of GDF-15 had a strong negative correlation with both muscle weight and exercise endurance capacity. Expression of GDF-15 in muscle also had a negative trend with muscle weight and endurance capacity. The muscle expression of GDF-15 was significantly attenuated after 8 weeks of exercise compared with the group without exercise, particularly in older mice. GDF-15 levels were also related to functional capacity and showed responses to therapeutic exercise intervention in this model. We also measured serum GDF-15 levels and muscle mass using DXA in healthy human adults (19 men and 18 women). As in mice, serum levels of GDF-15 were correlated positively with age, but negatively with muscle mass in these subjects. These findings support the potential of GDF-15 as a biomarker for age-related sarcopenia.","Kim, Hoyoun; Kim, Kyoung Min; Kang, Min Ji; Lim, Soo",Experimental gerontology,309,27

This study developed a combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Markov chain method for quickly predicting transient particle transport in enclosed environments. The method first calculated a transition probability matrix using CFD simulations. Next, the Markov chain technique was applied to calculate the transient particle concentration distributions. This investigation used three cases, particle transport in an isothermal clean room, an office with an underfloor air distribution system, and the first-class cabin of an MD-82 airliner, to validate the combined CFD and Markov chain method. The general trends of the particle concentrations vs. time predicted by the Markov chain method agreed with the CFD simulations for these cases. The proposed Markov chain method can provide faster-than-real-time information about particle transport in enclosed environments. Furthermore, for a fixed airflow field, when the source location is changed, the Markov chain method can be used to avoid recalculation of the particle transport equation and thus reduce computing costs.","Chen, C; Lin, C-H; Long, Z; Chen, Q",Indoor air,309,26

We compared oxygen transport, lactate metabolism, and mitochondrial function in pigs with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hypoxic hypoxia. METHODS Thirty-two anaesthetized, ventilated pigs were randomized to faecal peritonitis (P), cardiac tamponade (CT), hypoxic hypoxia (HH) or controls. Systemic and regional blood flows, lactate, mitochondrial respiration, and tissue hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) were measured for 24 h. RESULTS Mortality was 50% in each intervention group. While systemic oxygen consumption (VO(2) ) was maintained in all groups, hepatic VO(2) tended to decrease in CT [0.84 (0.5-1.3) vs. 0.42 (0.06-0.8)/ml/min/kg; P = 0.06]. In P, fractional hepatic, celiac trunk, and portal vein blood flows, and especially renal blood flow [by 46 (14-91)%; P = 0.001] decreased. In CT, renal blood flow [by 50.4 (23-81)%; P = 0.004] and in HH, superior mesenteric blood flow decreased [by 38.9 (16-100)%, P = 0.009]. Hepatic lactate influx increased > 100% in P and HH, and > 200% in CT (all P < 0.02). Hepatic lactate uptake remained unchanged in P and HH and converted to release in CT. Mitochondrial respiration remained normal. Muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations decreased in P (5.9 ± 1.4 μmol/g wt vs. 2.8 ± 2.7 μmol/g wt, P = 0.04). HIF-1α expression was not detectable in any group. CONCLUSION We conclude that despite shock and renal hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia is not a major pathophysiological issue in early and established faecal peritonitis. The reasons for reduced skeletal muscle tissue ATP levels in the presence of well-preserved in-vitro muscle mitochondrial respiration should be further investigated.","Regueira, T; Djafarzadeh, S; Brandt, S; Gorrasi, J; Borotto, E; Porta, F; Takala, J; Bracht, H; Shaw, S; Lepper, P M; Jakob, S M",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,309,1

METHODS Compressed movie clip ultrasound images (obstetric sweep protocol) obtained by minimally trained personnel were read and interpreted by physicians with training in obstetric ultrasound. Observed findings were compared among readers and between each reader and the gold standard ultrasound scan report. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS The agreements among readers and between readers and the gold standard, for the anterior and posterior variables of the placental location were excellent, with Cohen κ values of 0.81 to 0.88 and 0.77 to 0.9, respectively. Cohen κ values were slight or slight/fair for other placental locations (left, right, fundal, and low), and the sensitivity and specificity ranged widely. The agreement among readers and between readers and the gold standard for fetal number comparisons was also excellent, with Cohen κ values ranging from 0.82 to 1, sensitivity from 0.83 to 1, and specificity from 0.99 to 1. The agreement among readers for fetal presentation comparisons, according to the Cohen κ, ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 and between readers and the gold standard had values of 0.43 to 0.49. For biometric parameters and estimated gestational age calculations based on these parameters, inter-reader reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for all parameters except femur length. Greater than 94% of obstetric sweep protocol ultrasound ages were within 7 days of the corresponding gold standard age.

This qualitative study sought to understand the manifestations and consequences of stigma experienced by transgender women of color in their dating or romantic relationships. Between January and February 2019, we purposively recruited 33 transgender women of color to participate in five focus group discussions and complete a brief survey. We employed both inductive and deductive approaches to coding and thematic analysis. We identified different forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma experienced by transgender women of color seeking romantic relationships and by those in romantic relationships. For those dating and seeking relationships, anti-transgender interpersonal stigma took the form of dehumanizing stereotypes and sexual objectification. While these manifestations of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma persisted for some within relationships, concealment behaviors from partners was the predominant type of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma. Each of these forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma had significant gender-based violence consequences, specifically encountering physical violence, experiencing psychological trauma, and engaging in survival strategies. In the current climate of COVID-19, which is exacerbating risks of gender-based violence, there is an urgent need to understand and address the nuanced manifestations of stigma in relationships and their consequences on the lives of transgender women of color. Culturally grounded gender-based violence prevention policies and programs with transgender women should address these forms of stigma and build on community strengths.

Investigation about PAEs in terrestrial ecosystem has been extensively conducted while the fate of PAEs in marine environment remains underexplored. In this study, a novel di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) degrading marine bacterial strain, Mycolicibacterium phocaicum RL-HY01, was isolated and characterized from intertidal sediments. Strain RL-HY01 could utilize a range of PAE plasticizers as sole carbon source for growth. The effects of different environmental factors on the degradation of PAEs were evaluated and the results indicated that strain RL-HY01 could efficiently degrade PAEs under a wide range of pH (5.0 to 9.0), temperature (20 °C to 40 °C) and salinity (below 10%). Specifically, when Tween-80 was added as solubilizing agent, strain RL-HY01 could rapidly degrade DEHP and achieve complete degradation of DEHP (50 mg/L) in 48 h. The kinetics of DEHP degradation by RL-HY01 were well fitted with the modified Gompertz model. The metabolic intermediates of DEHP by strain RL-HY01 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis and then the metabolic pathway of DEHP was deduced. DEHP was transformed into di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) via β-oxidation and then DEP was hydrolyzed into phthalic acid (PA) by de-esterification. PA was further transformed into gentisate via salicylic acid and further utilized for cell growth. Bioaugmentation of strain RL-HY01 with marine samples was performed to evaluate its application potential and the results suggested that strain RL-HY01 could accelerate the elimination of DEHP in marine samples. The results have advanced our understanding of the fate of PAEs in marine ecosystem and identified an efficient bioremediation strategy for PAEs-polluted marine sites.","Ren, Lei; Wang, Guan; Huang, Yongxiang; Guo, Jianfu; Li, Chengyong; Jia, Yang; Chen, Sha; Zhou, John L; Hu, Hanqiao",The Science of the total environment,309,30

METHODS Over a 4-month period (May 2018-August 2018), 45 long-term care homes were self-selected from five regions to participate in virtual learning collaborative sessions, which provided an orientation to a quality improvement programme and guidance for implementation. A process evaluation complemented the use of a controlled before-and-after study with a propensity score matched control group (n=127) and a difference-in-difference analysis. Primary outcomes included rates of urine cultures performed and urinary antibiotic prescriptions. Secondary outcomes included rates of emergency department visits, hospital admission and mortality. An 18-month baseline period was compared with a 16-month postimplementation period with the use of administrative data sources. RESULTS Rates of urine culturing and urinary antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 resident days decreased significantly more among long-term care homes that participated in learning collaboratives compared with matched controls (differential reductions of 19% and 13%, respectively, p<0.0001).

RESULTS Four RCTs with a total of 119,110 participants (65,254 from the vaccine group and 53,856 from the placebo group) were considered. The pooled estimate of AEs in the placebo and vaccine groups was 16.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 9.1 - 27.7%) and 25.3% (95% CI, 22.7 - 28.1%), respectively. The pooled SAE rate in the placebo and vaccine groups was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5 - 1.0%) and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4 - 0.9%), respectively. The pooled estimate of participants who withdrew from treatment due to AEs in the placebo and vaccine groups was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1 - 1.0%) and 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1 - 0.5%), respectively. The pooled death rate in the placebo and vaccine groups was 0.02% (95% CI, 0.01 - 0.04%) and 0.01% (95% CI, 0.01 - 0.03%), respectively.

METHOD Six databases were searched (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Science) from April 2010 to August 2020, and a grey literature search was undertaken. Screening was undertaken independently by two authors. The results summarised country, participant and employment characteristics, psychological interventions and work, health and wellbeing outcomes. 10% of the papers were analysed to determine the feasibility of coding intervention descriptions for theory and behaviour change technique (BCT) components. RESULTS Database searches yielded 9341 titles, of which 91 studies were included. Most studies were conducted in Europe (78%) and included males and females (95%) ranging in age from 31-56.6 years although other demographic, and employment information was lacking. Musculoskeletal pain was common (87%). Psychological interventions commonly included cognitive behavioural therapy (30%) and education (28%). Most studies employed a randomised control trial design (64%). Over half contained a control group (54%). Interventions were delivered in mostly healthcare settings (72%) by health professionals. Multiple outcomes were often reported, many of which involved measuring sickness absence and return-to-work (62%) and pain and general health (53%). Within the feasibility analysis, most papers met the minimum criteria of containing one paragraph of intervention description, but none explicitly mentioned theory or BCTs. CONCLUSION Psychological interventions for employees with chronic pain vary in their nature and implementation.

Several studies have linked ZIKV infection in pregnant women with the development of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities, emphasizing the need for a safe and effective vaccine to combat the spread of this disease. Preclinical studies and vaccine development efforts have largely focused on the role of humoral immunity in disease protection. Consequently, relatively little is known in regard to cellular immunity against ZIKV, although an effective vaccine will likely need to engage both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. To that end, we utilized two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify 90 ZIKV peptides that were naturally processed and presented on HLA class I and II molecules (HLA-A*02:01/HLA-DRB1*04:01) of an immortalized B cell line infected with ZIKV (strain PRVABC59). Sequence identity clustering was used to filter the number of candidate peptides prior to evaluating memory T cell recall responses in ZIKV convalescent subjects. Peptides that individually elicited broad (4 of 7 subjects) and narrow (1 of 7 subjects) T cell responses were further analyzed using a suite of predictive algorithms and in silico modeling to evaluate HLA binding and peptide structural properties. A subset of nine broadly reactive peptides was predicted to provide robust global population coverage (97.47% class I; 70.74% class II) and to possess stable structural properties amenable for vaccine formulation, highlighting the potential clinical benefit for including ZIKV T cell epitopes in experimental vaccine formulations.","Crooke, Stephen N; Ovsyannikova, Inna G; Kennedy, Richard B; Poland, Gregory A",PloS one,309,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of PSH after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and the efficacy of closure of the port site as a means of preventing PSH. A retrospective analysis was performed on 386 patients who underwent LSG between December 2009 and January 2015. 352 (91.2%) of the patient were followed up for at least 24 months. In the first 206 patients, the fascial layers of the trocar incisions were not closed, while in the next 146 cases, routine closure of the trocar sites was performed. The patients were reviewed in relation to demographics, comorbidities, complications, percentage of excess weight loss, and rates of PSH. The total cohort consisted of 220 female and 132 male patients with a mean age of 36.2 ± 12.3 years. Demographic data, initial BMI, and comorbidities were similar for the patients in both groups. The closure of the fascia was caused by the prolonged duration of the operation with no significant difference. The unclosed fascial defects were associated with a significantly increased incidence of PSH (1.3 vs. 3.9%, p < 0.05). All of the patients who experienced PSH had at least one comorbidity, and no complication was noted in the fascial closure cases. It was found that the rate of PSH after LSG is not as low as previously thought, and that routine closure of fascial defects at port sites may result in a decreased PSH rate.","Ece, Ilhan; Yilmaz, Huseyin; Alptekin, Husnu; Yormaz, Serdar; Colak, Bayram; Sahin, Mustafa",Updates in surgery,309,1

In spite of United States Food and Drug Administration's recent assent of remdesivir as the only approved agent for COVID-19, there is limited information available about the physicochemical, metabolism, transport, pharmacokinetic (PK), and drug-drug interaction (DDI) properties of this drug. The objective of this in silico simulation work was to simulate the biopharmaceutical and DDI behavior of remdesivir and characterize remdesivir PK properties in special populations which are highly affected by COVID-19. METHODS The Spatial Data File format structures of remdesivir prodrug (GS-5734) and nucleoside core (GS-441524) were obtained from the PubChem database to upload into the GastroPlus software 9.8 version (Simulations Plus Inc., USA). The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) Predictor and PKPlus modules of GastroPlus were used to simulate physicochemical and PK properties, respectively, in healthy and predisposed patients. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of GastroPlus was used to simulate different patient populations based on age, weight, liver function, and renal function status. Subsequently, these data were used in the Drug-Drug Interaction module to simulate drug interaction potential of remdesivir with other COVID-19 drug regimens and with agents used for comorbidities. RESULTS Remdesivir nucleoside core (GS-441524) is more hydrophilic than the inactive prodrug (GS-5734) with nucleoside core demonstrating better water solubility. GS-5734, but not GS-441524, is predicted to be metabolized by CYP3A4. Remdesivir is bioavailable and its clearance is achieved through hepatic and renal routes. Differential effects of renal function, liver function, weight, or age were observed on the PK profile of remdesivir. DDI simulation study of remdesivir with perpetrator drugs for comorbidities indicate that carbamazepine, phenytoin, amiodarone, voriconazole, diltiazem, and verapamil have the potential for strong interactions with victim remdesivir, whereas agents used for COVID-19 treatment such as chloroquine and ritonavir can cause weak and strong interactions, respectively, with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS GS-5734 (inactive prodrug) appears to be a superior remdesivir derivative due to its hepatic stability, optimum hydrophilic/lipophilic balance, and disposition properties. Remdesivir disposition can potentially be affected by different physiological and pathological conditions, and by drug interactions from COVID-19 drug regimens and agents used for comorbidities.

However, most of the surgical masks on the market are disposable that cannot be self-sterilized for reuse. Thus, when confronting the global public health crisis, a severe shortage of mask resource is inevitable. In this paper, a novel low-cost electrothermal mask with excellent self-sterilization performance and portability is reported to overcome this shortage. First, a flexible, ventilated, and conductive cloth tape is patterned and adhered to the surface of a filter layer made of melt-blown nonwoven fabrics (MNF), which functions as interdigital electrodes. Then, a graphene layer with premier electric and thermal conductivity is coated onto the MNF. Operating under a low voltage of 3 V, the graphene-modified MNF (mod-MNF) can quickly generate large amounts of heat to achieve a high temperature above 80 °C, which can kill the majority of known viruses attached to the filter layer and the mask surface. Finally, the optimized graphene-modified masks based on the mod-MNF filter retain a relatively high particulate matter (PM) removal efficiency and a low-pressure drop. Moreover, the electrothermal masks can maintain almost the same PM removal efficiency over 10 times of electrifying, suggesting its outstanding reusability.","Shan, Xiaoli; Zhang, Han; Liu, Cihui; Yu, Liyan; Di, Yunsong; Zhang, Xiaowei; Dong, Lifeng; Gan, Zhixing",ACS applied materials & interfaces,309,1

Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) and cardiac imaging with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) are two sophisticated techniques for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) deformation and sympathetic innervation, respectively, which offer important prognostic information in patients with heart failure (HF). The purpose of this investigation was to explore, in patients with systolic HF, the relationship between LV deformation assessed by 3D-STE and cardiac sympathetic derangement evaluated by (123)I-MIBG imaging. METHODS We prospectively studied 75 patients with systolic HF. All patients underwent a 3D-STE study (longitudinal, circumferential, area and radial) and (123)I-MIBG planar and SPECT cardiac imaging. RESULTS 3D-STE longitudinal, circumferential and area strain values were correlated with (123)I-MIBG late heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio and late SPECT total defect score. After stratification of the patients according to ischaemic or nonischaemic HF aetiology, we observed a good correlation of all 3D-STE measurements with late H/M ratio and SPECT data in the ischaemic group, but in patients with HF of nonischaemic aetiology, no correlation was found between LV deformation and cardiac sympathetic activity. At the regional level, the strongest correlation between LV deformation and adrenergic innervation was found for the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution territory for all four 3D-STE values. In multivariate linear regression analyses, including age, gender, LV ejection fraction, NYHA class, body mass index, heart rate and HF aetiology, only 3D-STE area and radial strain values significantly predicted cardiac sympathetic derangement on (123)I-MIBG late SPECT. CONCLUSION This study indicated that 3D-STE measurements are correlated with (123)I-MIBG planar and SPECT data. Furthermore, 3D-STE area and radial strain values, but not LVEF, predict cardiac sympathetic derangement in human postischaemic HF.","Leosco, Dario; Parisi, Valentina; Pellegrino, Teresa; Pagano, Gennaro; Femminella, Grazia Daniela; Bevilacqua, Agnese; Paolillo, Stefania; Formisano, Roberto; Ferro, Gaetana; de Lucia, Claudio; Prastaro, Maria; Filardi, Pasquale Perrone; Cuocolo, Alberto; Rengo, Giuseppe; Ferrara, Nicola",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,309,27

The goal of this present study was to develop operational prototypes of 3-dimensional (3-D) printed vitrification devices with innovative components that can provide comprehensive functionalities for practical repository development for aquatic species. The design featured an elongated loop to suspend a thin film of sperm sample in cryoprotectant, a retractable sleeve to protect the vitrified samples and allow permanent labeling, a handle to facilitate processing and storage, and a shaft with annular grooves to guide positioning of the protective retractable sleeve. To span a wide range of sample capacities and configurations, a total of 39 different configurations (3 loop lengths ×13 loop heights) were fabricated by 3-D printing with the thermoplastics polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). A total of 86 devices were fabricated with ABS filament with a print failure rate of 9%, and 97 devices were fabricated with PLA filament with a failure rate of 20%. Major types of printing failures included disconnected loops, insufficient build surface adhesion, stringing, and inconsistent extrusion. The sample volume capacity ranged from 1-47 μL and had linear relationships to the loop lengths and layer numbers. Vitrified samples were observed in 10-mm and 15-mm loops fabricated with PLA and ABS but not in 20-mm loops. This study demonstrated the feasibility of development of standardized low-cost ($0.05 material cost) devices fabricated by 3-D printing with practical functions including vitrification, volume control, labeling, protection, and storage within conventional systems.

Most challenges are attributable to the general resources of public health agencies, although workforce limitations, technology issues such as a lack of data standards, and policy uncertainty around reporting requirements also remain prominent issues. Ongoing funding to support the adoption of technology and strengthen the development of the health informatics workforce, combined with revising the promotion of the interoperability scoring approach, will likely help improve the exchange of electronic data between hospitals and public health agencies. CONTEXT The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted significant barriers in the exchange of essential information between hospitals and local public health agencies. Thus it remains important to clarify the specific issues that hospitals may face in reporting to public health agencies to inform focused approaches to improve the information exchange for the current pandemic as well as ongoing public health activities and population health management. METHODS This study uses cross-sectional data of acute-care, nonfederal hospitals from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey and Information Technology supplement. Guided by the technology-organization-environment framework, we coded the responses to a question regarding the challenges that hospitals face in submitting data to public health agencies by using content analysis according to the type of challenge (i.e., technology, organization, or environment), responsible entity (i.e., hospital, public health agency, vendor, multiple), and the specific issue described. We used multivariable logistic and multinomial regression to identify characteristics of hospitals associated with experiencing the types of challenges. FINDINGS Our findings show that of the 2,794 hospitals in our analysis, 1,696 (61%) reported experiencing at least one challenge in reporting health data to a public health agency. Organizational issues were the most frequently reported type of challenge, noted by 1,455 hospitals. The most common specific issue, reported by 1,117 hospitals, was the general resources of public health agencies. An advanced EHR system and participation in a health information exchange both decreased the likelihood of not reporting experiencing a challenge and increased the likelihood of reporting an organizational challenge. CONCLUSIONS Our findings inform policy recommendations such as improving data standards, increasing funding for public health agencies to improve their technological capabilities, offering workforce training programs, and increasing clarity of policy specifications and reporting. These approaches can improve the exchange of information between hospitals and public health agencies.","Walker, Daniel M; Yeager, Valerie A; Lawrence, John; McAlearney, Ann Scheck",The Milbank quarterly,309,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS In bovine liver tissue, 42 ex vivo microwave ablations (60 W; 180 s) were performed. During ablation, the temperature was measured continuously at 4 points of interest (POI), in a distance of 7.5 and 15 mm on each side of the microwave antenna, with a titanium surgical placed at one 7.5-mm POI. Ablation volumes containing large vessels (n = 10) were excluded. For every POI, the mean temperature of 32 ablations was calculated. The mean temperatures were compared between the 4 POI and statistically analyzed using the Student's t test. RESULTS The mean maximum temperatures at the side of the clip were 88.76 °C/ 195 s and 52.97 °C/ 195 s and at the side without clip 78.75 °C/ 195 s and 43.16 °C/ 195 s, respectively, at POI 7.5 mm and POI 15 mm. The maximum difference of mean temperatures for POI 7.5 mm was 12.91 °C at 84 s (p = 0.022) and for POI 15 mm 9.77 °C at 195 s (p = 0.009). No significant changes in size and shape of the ablation zone could be determined. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated significantly higher temperatures adjacent to surgical clips. Also, the temperatures distal to the titanium clip were higher compared to the control location without clip. These findings suggest an increased risk of thermal damage to surrounding tissues during MWA, especially in case of immediate contact to surgical clips.","Liebl, Martin; Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Zimmermann, Markus; Pedersoli, Federico; Kuhl, Christiane; Bruners, Philipp; Isfort, Peter",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,309,1

Methods: In total, 30 patients who underwent hysteroscopy between March and September 2016 at the University of Health Sciences Fatih Sultan Mehmet Health Research and Application Center, Ankara, Turkey were included in this prospective study. Standard hemodynamic monitoring, ANI, and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring were applied to the patients. At 10 min prior to induction, 1 μg/kg of remifentanil was applied in Group R (n=15) and 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was applied in Group D (n=15). After induction, sevoflurane was used for maintenance with dexmedetomidine at 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/hour in Group D and remifentanil at 0.05-0.5 μg/kg/minute in Group R. Perioperative and postoperative analgesia levels (ANI and VAS, respectively), hemodynamics, and complications were recorded. Results: Even though the ANI levels in Group D were lower at the perioperative 5th and 10th minutes, the ANI values were between the targeted limits, except for the measurement after I-gel insertion, in both groups. Hemodynamic parameters were within normal limits, but the mean arterial pressures in Group R after induction, following I-gel placement, and at the perioperative 5th, 10th, and 20th minutes were lower and at postoperative 30th minute were significantly higher. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil are both efficacious agents for perioperative analgesia in hysteroscopy cases.","Gazi, Mustafa; Abitağaoğlu, Süheyla; Turan, Güldem; Köksal, Ceren; Akgün, Fatma Nur; Ari, Dilek E",Saudi medical journal,309,1

Recently, researchers are using deep learning networks for medical diseases' diagnosis. Some of these researches focuses on optimizing deep learning neural networks for enhancing the network accuracy. Optimizing the Convolutional Neural Network includes testing various networks which are obtained through manually configuring their hyperparameters, then the configuration with the highest accuracy is implemented. Each time a different database is used, a different combination of the hyperparameters is required. This paper introduces two COVID-19 diagnosing systems using both Residual Network and Xception Network optimized by random search in the purpose of finding optimal models that give better diagnosis rates for COVID-19. The proposed systems showed that hyperparameters tuning for the ResNet and the Xception Net using random search optimization give more accurate results than other techniques with accuracies 99.27536% and 100 % respectively. We can conclude that hyperparameters tuning using random search optimization for either the tuned Residual Network or the tuned Xception Network gives better accuracies than other techniques diagnosing COVID-19.","Farag, H.

Variability in specimens and methods prevent standardization of RT-qPCR assays and reliable quantitative reporting to assess viral load. We developed an extraction-free RT-qPCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and monitored viral load until convalescence in COVID-19 patients. Comparison of 231 matched anterior nares swab and saliva specimens demonstrated that extraction-free testing of saliva has equivalent analytical and clinical assay performance compared to testing of RNA extracts from either anterior nares or saliva specimens. Analysis of specimen pairs revealed higher viral loads in the nasal cavity compared to the oral cavity, although this difference did not impact clinical sensitivity for COVID-19. Extraction-free testing of a combination specimen consisting of both nasal swab and saliva is also demonstrated. Assessment of viral load by RT-qPCR and parallel digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) revealed that cycle threshold (Ct) values less than approximately 30 correlated well with viral load, whereas Ct values greater than 30 correspond to low viral loads <10 copies/uL. Therefore, extraction-free saliva testing maximizes testing efficiency without compromising assay performance and approximates viral loads >10 copies/uL. This technology can facilitate high-throughput laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2, monitor viral load in individual patients, and assess efficacy of therapies for COVID-19.","Qiu, Y.; Lu, L.; Gao, D.; McGrath, P.; Han, C.; Kogut, I.; Blomquist, B.; Yao, X.; Zevallos, J.

Some items on the cooperation agenda have been delayed and people-to-people exchanges have come to a halt. The pandemic, notwithstanding, is a testament to the value and resilience of the ""17 + 1"" framework and has presented an opportunity for both sides to identify new areas for future collaboration. In a post-pandemic world, China and Central and Eastern European countries will not only have to address the shortfalls and drawbacks in the current cooperation mechanism, but also firmly work together to deal with new challenges arising from the pandemic.","Jing, L.",China Quarterly of International Strategic Studies,309,1

The study sample consisted of 1.256 Brazilian health professionals. Data were collected during one month (May-2020 to June-2020) through an online self-administered questionnaire, including the CBI and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptoms. All consistency measures showed values > 0.90. The split-half correlation values with Spearman-Brown reliability were higher than 0.8. The parallel analysis suggested two factors: the items of CBI's personal burnout (PB) and work-related burnout (WB) sub-dimensions that were associated with factor 1 (personal and work-related fatigue and exhaustion) and the items of CBI's client-related burnout (CB) sub-dimension were associated with factor 2 (exhaustion that emerges while working with people). The correlation between the PHQ-9 score and factor 1 was 0.76 (0.73; 0.79) and with factor 2, 0.49 (0.43; 0.55). Our study provides a valid and reliable Brazilian Portuguese version of CBI, encouraging the expansion of the burnout research field in our country.","Moser, C. M.; Tietbohl-Santos, B.; Arenas, D.

However, sparse data exists regarding the ideal cytokines to use during viral specific T-cell (VST) expansion in general, and coronavirus specific T-cells (CST) in particular, to maximize specificity and cell count. Here, we demonstrate that polyfunctional coronavirus-specific T cells (CSTs) can be generated rapidly from convalescent donors, and that CSTs can be optimized by varying cytokine expansion cocktails. Methods, Results & Conclusion: PBMCs from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors were stimulated with overlapping peptide pools encompassing membrane, spike, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins, and expanded in 96-well plates for 10 days. Cells were expanded either with IL4 (400IU/mL) +IL7 (10ng/mL), IL15 (5ng/mL), IL15+4, IL15+6 (100ng/mL), or IL15+7. After expansion, T-cell phenotype and functionality were assessed using ELISpot and intracellular flow cytometry. Cytokine combinations with the best performance on micro-expansion were retested using GMP-applicable methods.

CD4+ specificity was maximized using IL4+7, IL15+6, and IL15+7 (Fig. 1), while CD8+ specificity was maximized using IL15+7, IL15+6, and IL15 (Fig.e 2). T-cell phenotype was similar across cytokine conditions (median 6.9±0.2% naïve, 8.3±0.8% central memory, 79±0.9% effector memory, 4.5±0.2% terminal effector). NK cell expansion was increased in the setting of IL15 and its combinations (median 10.4±12% CD3-/CD56+ versus 1.0±1% without IL-15 p<0.05). Comparison of CSTs grown with IL4+7 and IL15+7 in G-Rex-10 bioreactors showed increased expansion and specificity for spike and membrane peptides with IL15+7 as compared with IL4+7 (Fig. 3). Our study demonstrates that the generation of polyfunctional CSTs targeting SARS-CoV-2 can be optimized using IL15+7 as compared with other cytokine cocktails. We are now translating these techniques to the clinic to examine the safety of adoptive transfer of IL15+7 expanded CSTs for the prevention or early treatment of SARSCoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients.","Durkee-Shock, J.

Both the disease itself and the preventive measures introduced by governments lead to a restriction of economic activity. The beginning of the third quarter of 2020 is the time when some of European economies have already experienced the first wave of cases, and many restrictions have already been lifted. On the other hand with the end of this quarter, the number of cases is still growing meaning second wave and further limiting of economic activities. The study analyses the similarities of European countries in terms of the following indicators: Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and Employment Expectations Indicator (EEI) from the beginning of 2020. The obtained results are compared with the course of the pandemic in the studied countries. Ward’s method was used in the analysis. Results show that after the collapse in March/April, the values of variables reflecting condition of economies started to increase in most of identified groups of countries. There are very little similarities between the countries with respect to changes in indicators and the course of the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nojszewska, E.; Sielska, A.","29th Conference of the Section on Classification and Data Analysis of the Polish Statistical Association, SKAD 2020",309,22

Specifically, it reports on how students helped the university’s cafeteria to assess meals by conducting an LCA for 25 meals and identifying environmental hotspots. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive case study of a graduate course at Ulm University is presented. The course included lectures and problem-based exercises, both theoretical and software assisted. A course evaluation was conducted during the course and one year after completion to poll improvement potentials, as well as its impacts on students’ everyday life. Findings: It was found that although it was the first LCA for all students, the resulting LCA information of 25 different meals were homogeneous, comparable to the scientific literature and beneficial to the cafeteria’s sustainable development strategy. The concept of service-learning had a higher impact on students’ motivation than a good grade and active-learning is explicitly requested by students. The course design sensitized students to the real-life problems of LCA and made their consumption patterns more elaborate and ecological. Furthermore, this digitization of higher education could be carried out with only minor changes in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation. Originality/value: As the subject of service-learning in natural sciences is still expandable, this study presents an easy to adapt case study on how to integrate such an approach into university curricula dominated by traditional learning. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this case study presents the first published LCA university course explicitly describing and evaluating a service-learning approach. The topic touches the everyday lives of students, allows comparisons between different student groups, is easily scalable to different group sizes and credits, and supports learning both how to study in small groups and cooperation between groups to ensure comparability of LCA results. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Johannisson, J.; Hiete, M.",International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,309,20

The aim of this study is to verify the relationship between the attitudes towards online teaching and environmental factors, equipment, noise and distraction from other people, in the students of the State University of Tetova in North Macedonia. Attitudes towards online learning are addressed in three specific dimensions, namely cognitive, affective and behavioral, while the environmental factors are focused on the conditions the learning process takes place, the noise, the technological equipment and distractions from other people during online learning. The methodology used in this study is non-experimental correlational with quantitative data gathered through relevant instruments, with a sample of 801 University of Tetova students, in North Macedonia, whereas the most frequented age was 18–22 years. The findings of the study, through relevant statistical tests, report slightly more emphasized negative student attitudes towards online learning, while the correlational analysis result as statistically moderate, with a negative direction between student attitudes towards online learning and environmental factors. The multiple regression analysis shows a statistically significant model for predicting the level of students’ attitudes towards online learning by environmental factors such as: teaching conditions, noise and distractions from other people. Negative attitudes towards online learning are more associated with increasing difficulties of the environmental factors where online learning takes place. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Neziri, I.; Ahmeti, K.; Memeti, A.","23rd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2021",309,1

The aim of the study is to bring these sources and bases to light in the dimension of religious thought. The data obtained in accordance with the qualitative research paradigm using the interview technique were analysed. Even though they had to face negative mental effects, it was concluded that the pandemic process was encountered with a kind of prosperity and maturity by Muslim elders, they approached this process with moderation, they got support from their beliefs and used them wisely. As a result, it is understood that Muslim elders have an existential and encompassing understanding based on their beliefs against the effects of the pandemic process, all of which are related to their ego integrity and maturity.","Ferah, N.",Ilahiyat Tetkikleri Dergisi-Journal of Ilahiyat Researches,309,20

This article focuses on issues that are problematic, based on the analysis of guidance issued by the European Data Protection Board, as well as national data protection authorities and practitioners from 20 countries in response to these concerns. The first section of the article analyses concepts of personal data and health data in the context of Covid-19. Then the article proceeds with exploring what possible legal bases employers can use to process employees' personal data in general, and health data in particular, under the General Data Protection Regulation when applying different measures to combat Covid-19. In the latter part of the article two practical questions raised by employers - concerning the checking of employees' body temperatures and informing them of possible infection - are discussed. The analysis indicates that national data protection authorities seem to look for a reasonable and pragmatic approach regarding compliance with the GDPR in light of the Covid-19 emergency. However, their guidance differs in several areas and the views in between nation states are not always aligned. A more specific, clear and uniform pan-European vision concerning the processing of employees' data in times of emergency is needed to better protect employees and limit the spread of the virus.","Suder, S.",European Labour Law Journal,309,28

Realizing negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will require technologies like anaerobic digestion to recover biomethane from organic biomass. As the world's main grain-producing country, China has abundant crop residues, &gt;85% of which were utilized as fertilizer, fodder, industrial material, biofuel, and base material in 2019. However, the potential contribution of crop residues to energy and reduced GHG emissions following anaerobic digestion have been scarcely evaluated. Based on crop yield and the field residue index, the annual quantity of crop residues in China from 2000 to 2019 was estimated. The annual crop residue yield increased between 2003 and 2014, and then remained constant at ~970 × 106 t/a, with an estimated 495 × 106 t/a being available for biomethane production. This corresponded to a potential biomethane yield of 82.25 × 109 m3/a, which could have met 29.2% of the annual natural gas consumption and 2.25% of the annual energy consumption in China in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated potential GHG emission reduction was 197 × 106 t/a (CO 2 equivalent), representing ~2% of China's GHG emissions in 2019. Nevertheless, to reach the expected goal, some crucial technical and equipment-oriented research and development should be promoted to adapt to the characteristics of China's crop residues and regional environment. Moreover, governmental support policies on subsidies would be required for the development of the biomethane industry, which should prioritize northern regions with relatively high quantities of crop residues. • Energy and GHG emission reduction potential of straw biogas in China was assessed. • Biomethane yield of 82.25 × 109 m3/a could be produced from available residues. • GHG emission reduction potential from residues could be 197 × 106 t CO 2 eq/a. • The utilization mode of straw may need to be restructured for carbon neutrality. • Recommendations were proposed to help overcome barriers in straw biogas industry.

Being latent and path-dependent, the manifestation of organizational resilience is hard to be directly measured. This article assesses organizational resilience of firms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with pre-shock corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance as a predictor that positively influences the level of organizational resilience to the external shock caused by the pandemic. We develop three theoretical mechanisms based on stakeholder theory, resource-based theory, reputation perspective and means-end chain theory to explain how CSR fulfillment in the past could help firms maintain stability to adapt to and react flexibly to recover from the crisis. We examine the relationship in the context of the systemic shock caused by COVID-19, using a sample of 1597 listed firms in China during the time window from 20 January 2020 to 10 June 2020. We find that companies with higher CSR performance before the shock will experience fewer losses and will take a shorter time to recover from the attack.","Huang, Wenchuan Chen Shouming",Sustainability,309,1

Goldstein and co-workers pioneered the field of enzymatic conversion of blood group A and B red blood cells (RBCs) to O (ECO). Using alpha-galactosidase from coffee beans to produce B-ECO RBCs, proof of principle for this revolutionary concept was achieved in clinical trials. However, because this enzyme has poor kinetic properties and low pH optimum the process was not economically viable. Conversion of group A RBCs was only achieved with the weak A2 subgroup with related enzymes having acidic pH optima. More recently, the identification of entirely new families of bacterial exoglycosidases with remarkably improved kinetic properties for cleaving A and B antigens has reinvigorated the field. Enzymatic conversion of groups A, B and AB RBCs with these novel enzymes resulting in ECO RBCs typing as O can now be achieved with low enzyme protein consumption, short incubation times and at neutral pH. Presently, clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy of ECO RBCs are ongoing. Here, we review the status of the ECO technology, its impact and potential for introduction into clinical component preparation laboratories.","Olsson, Martin L; Clausen, Henrik",British journal of haematology,309,9

However, systemic delivery of r-hIFN-alpha is associated with severe side effects, but more importantly, it is effective in only a small percentage of patients. In an effort to maximize IFN-alpha antiviral efficacy, we have explored the therapeutic potential of murine IFN-alpha2 (mIFNalpha2) selectively expressed in the liver. To this end, we have developed a helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HD) containing the mIFN-alpha2 gene under the control of the liver-specific transthyretin promoter (HD-IFN). Comparison with a first-generation adenovirus carrying the same mIFN-alpha2 expression cassette indicates that at certain HD-IFN doses, induction of antiviral genes can be achieved in the absence of detectable circulating mIFN-alpha2. Challenge of injected mice with mouse hepatitis virus type 3 showed that HD-IFN provides high liver protection. Moreover, liver protection was also observed in acute nonviral liver inflammation hepatitis induced by concanavalin A at 1 month postinfection. These results hold promise for the development of a gene therapy treatment for chronic viral hepatitis based on liver-restricted expression of IFN-alpha2.","Aurisicchio, L; Delmastro, P; Salucci, V; Paz, O G; Rovere, P; Ciliberto, G; La Monica, N; Palombo, F",Journal of virology,309,19

However, the variability of the testing environment and conditions as well as the competency of staff performing the tests may have a significant impact on the quality and accuracy of POCT results. A majority of the staff who perform POCT are not trained laboratory staff and may not be as knowledgeable about the processes involved in testing, such as patient preparation, sample collection, management of equipment and supplies, instrument calibration and maintenance, the performance of the test, quality control, interpretation of the results, and reporting/documentation of results in each patient's context.

Sequence analysis of the recovered viruses showed a reversion at this position to the original virus sequence. The effect of point mutations at nucleotide 637 was analyzed by reverse genetics using a TGEV full-length cDNA clone and cDNAs from TGEV-derived minigenomes. The replacement of nucleotide 637 of TGEV genome by a T, as in the DI-C sequence, or an A severely affected virus recovery from the cDNA, yielding mutant viruses with low titers and small plaques compared to those of the wild type. In contrast, T or A at position 637 was required for minigenome rescue in trans by the helper virus. No relationship between these observations and RNA secondary-structure predictions was found, indicating that mutations at nucleotide 637 most likely had an effect at the protein level. Nucleotide 637 occupies the second codon position at amino acid 108 of the pp1a polyprotein. This position is predicted to map in the N-terminal polyprotein papain-like proteinase (PLP-1) cleavage site at the p9/p87 junction. Replacement of G-637 by A, which causes a drastic amino acid change (Gly to Asp) at position 108, affected PLP-1-mediated cleavage in vitro. A correlation was found between predicted cleaving and noncleaving mutations and efficient virus rescue from cDNA and minigenome amplification, respectively.","Galán, Carmen; Enjuanes, Luis; Almazán, Fernando",Journal of virology,309,28

Nineteen patients with thirty-one tumours (mean diameter 2.4 cm) underwent percutaneous MWA in 28 sessions. Microwave ablation was carried out using a 2450-MHz generator (Emprint/Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA). Procedures were performed under cone-beam CT (CBCT) and under fluoro-CT (one session) guidance. Safety, technical success, effectiveness, LPFS and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Safety was defined as the frequency of major and minor complications. The efficacy was evaluated on the basis of imaging characteristics, using RECIST criteria. CT follow-up was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months and yearly. LPFS was defined as the interval between MWA treatment and evidence of local recurrence, if there was any. OS was defined as the percentage of patients who were still alive. We registered one major complication (purulent hydro-pneumothorax). Minor complications were spontaneously resolved (pneumothorax and perilesional haemorrhagic effusion). Technical success was 100%. Residual disease was registered in two cases, one of whom was retreated. Complete ablation was obtained in the remaining cases (90.3%).

Refinements of surgery have improved warm ischemia times and facilitated renal reconstruction. We present a technique that makes renorrhaphy easier using Self-Retaining Barbed Suture (SRBS) weaving two threads. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients with carcinoma of the kidney, 3.4 and 1.5 cm respectively, were subjected to the LPN. The SRBS is an absorbable polygluconate with small projections along its axis which are anchored in the tissue, distributing the tension of the suture line and eliminating the need for knots. Renorrhaphy was performed using the SRBS by two continuous suture lines without knots, setting the sutures with clips of Hem-o-lok(®) and adjusting it with the technique of «sliding clip», without placing «bolsters» inside the renal parenchymal defect. RESULTS Operative time was 156 minutes and 163 minutes, intraoperative bleeding was 50 ml and 850 ml, the warm ischemia time was 14.3 minutes and 23 minutes and follow-up time was 7 months and 3 months in the first and second cases respectively. The hospital stay was 5 days and there were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Simplified renorrhaphy using SRBS is effective, hemostatic, facilitates the renal reconstruction, and can help reduce the warn ischemia time.","García-Segui, A; Bercowsky, E; Gascón-Mir, M",Actas urologicas espanolas,309,20

However, we understand very little about the effects of this pandemic on families of young children. We used a risk and resilience model to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on mental health in diverse caregivers (N = 286) with children ages birth to 5. We evaluated the hypotheses that (a) pandemic stress and caregiver-reported child psychosocial concerns correlate with caregivers' mental health symptoms and (b) caregivers' pandemic-related self-efficacy and coping mediate these relationships. Caregivers completed surveys in April-May 2020 assessing pandemic stress (e.g., health, finances, and housing), child psychosocial problems, coping strategies, and self-efficacy to manage family needs. Our primary outcome was caregivers' self-reported changes in mental health symptoms since the outbreak. Path analysis revealed that higher pandemic stress was associated with caregivers' reduced confidence in meeting their family's needs related to COVID-19, which correlated with worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Greater child psychosocial problems also predicted worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Findings suggest that pandemic stress, child psychosocial problems, and caregiver self-efficacy are interrelated in their influence on caregivers' mental health. While further research is needed to examine strategies to foster resilience and buffer the pandemic's effects on caregiver mental health, this is a first step in evaluating the psychosocial effects of this pandemic in families of young children. Clinical implications are discussed for a tiered response to mitigate the pandemic's impacts on family functioning.","Davidson, Bridget; Schmidt, Ellyn; Mallar, Carolina; Mahmoud, Farah; Rothenberg, William; Hernandez, Julieta; Berkovits, Michelle; Jent, Jason; Delamater, Alan; Natale, Ruby",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),309,16

In our study, we report our findings based on molecular docking analysis which could be the new effective way for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus and additionally, another manipulative possibilities involving the mimicking of immune system as occurred during the bacterial cell recognition system. For this purpose, we performed molecular docking using computational biology techniques on several SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are responsible for its pathogenicity against N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. A similar molecular dynamics analysis has been carried out on both SARS-CoV-2 and anti-Staphylococcus aureus neutralizing antibodies to establish the potential of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine which likely induces the immune response against the virus. The results of molecular dynamic analysis have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 6M0J), RNA-binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB: 6WKP), refusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer (PDB: 6X79), and main protease 3clpro at room temperature (PDB: 7JVZ) could bind with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine that these proteins play an important role in SARS-CoV-2's infection and evade the immune system. Moreover, our molecular docking analysis has supported a strong protein-ligand interaction of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with these selected proteins. Furthermore, computational analysis against the D614G mutant of the virus has shown that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine affinity and its binding potential were not affected by the mutations occurring in the virus' receptor binding domain. The analysis on the affinity of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine towards human antibodies has shown that it could potentially bind to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins and antibodies based on our predictive modelling work. Our results confirmed that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine holds the potential to inhibit several SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as induce an immune response against the virus in the host.","Baysal, Ömür; Abdul Ghafoor, Naeem; Silme, Ragip Soner; Ignatov, Alexander N; Kniazeva, Volha",PLoS One,309,2

Monte Carlo calculations were performed to gauge the ability to deliver low-dose radiation to the thoracic mid-plane using an orthovoltage machine. In addition, the potential harm of a single dose of 0.75 Gy (whole-lung irradiation) was assessed based on the recommendations of the BEIR-VII committee of the U.S. National Research Council. Based on the results of this work, it was determined that an orthovoltage machine (minimum 300 kVp) can be used to deliver 0.75 Gy dose to the lungs while respecting cutaneous tolerance. Using data from the BEIR-VII Committee, it is evident that the apparent benefits of such radiation treatment for patients suffering from severe manifestations of the COVID-19 infectious syndrome outweigh the potential loss of life due to radiation-induced malignancy. Although the vaccination against COVID-19 has become a reality, the spread and mortality in severely ill patients remain unacceptably high. The risk of outbreaks in the future is unknown.

These findings were validated in a second cohort of patients (n = 231).

COVID-19, the disease caused by this highly contagious virus, can have serious health consequences, though risks of complications are highly age-dependent. Rates of hospitalization and death are less than 0.1% in children, but increase to 10% or more in older people. Moreover, at all ages, men are more likely than women to suffer serious consequences from COVID-19. These patterns are familiar to the geroscience community. The effects of age and sex on mortality rates from COVID-19 mirror the effects of aging on almost all major causes of mortality.

Titania (TiO2) nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings is one of the ideal remedies to disinfect pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi) from common surfaces under light illumination. The photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of recent TiO2 nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings for surfaces, dental and orthopaedic implants are emphasized in this review. Mostly, inorganic metals (e.g. copper (Cu), silver (Ag), manganese (Mn), etc), non-metals (e.g. fluorine (F), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P)) and two-dimensional materials (e.g. MXenes, MOF, graphdiyne) were incorporated with TiO2 to regulate the charge transfer mechanism, surface porosity, crystallinity, and the microbial disinfection efficiency. The antimicrobial activity of TiO2 coatings was evaluated against the most crucial pathogenic microbes such as Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, T2 bacteriophage, H1N1, HCoV-NL63, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine coronavirus. Silane functionalizing agents and polymers were used to coat the titanium (Ti) metal implants to introduce superhydrophobic features to avoid the microbial adhesion. TiO2 nanocomposite coatings in dental and orthopaedic metal implants disclosed an exceptional bio-corrosion resistance, durability, biocompatibility, bone-formation capability, and long-term antimicrobial efficiency.

To assess whether self-reported perceptions of COVID-19 and personal characteristics are associated with protective behaviors among general adults and to compare patterns in six different countries. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses the secondary data collected through an online survey between 15 and 23 April 2020 across six countries (China, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the USA). A total of 5945 adults aged 18 years or older were eligible for our analysis. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of three recommended behaviors (wearing a mask, handwashing, and avoiding social gatherings). RESULTS: In most countries except for China, the participants who perceived wearing a mask as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to wear a mask (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 4.14, 2.08-8.02; Japan: 3.59, 1.75-7.30; Korea: 7.89, 1.91-31.63: UK: 9.23, 5.14-17.31; USA: 4.81, 2.61-8.92). Those who perceived that handwashing was extremely effective had higher ORs of this preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 16.39, 3.56-70.18; Japan: 12.24, 4.03-37.35; Korea: 12.41, 2.02-76.39; UK: 18.04, 2.60-152.78; USA: 10.56, 2.21-44.32). The participants who perceived avoiding social gathering as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to take this type of preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: China: 3.79, 1.28-10.23; Korea: 6.18, 1.77-20.60; UK: 4.45, 1.63-11.63; USA: 4.34, 1.84-9.95). The associations between personal characteristics, living environment, psychological status, and preventive behaviors varied across different countries. Individuals who changed their behavior because of recommendations from doctors/public health officials were more likely to take preventive behaviors in many countries. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher perceived effectiveness may be a common factor to encourage preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results may provide a better understanding of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of factors related to preventive behaviors and improve public health policies in various countries and groups.","Fujii, Ryosuke; Suzuki, Kensuke; Niimi, Junichiro",Environ Health Prev Med,309,24

Herein, we sought to explore the anti-cancer mechanisms of ISL loaded nanoliposomes (ISL-NLs) on AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathways mediated glycolysis. Also, the key targets such as caveolin 1 (CAV1), glucose transporters and Akt/mTOR that promote glycolysis, and are activated via the induction of &#945;-enolase (ENO1), fructose bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expressions were also investigated. It was shown that ISL-NLs significantly suppressed the proliferation and glucose uptake of CRC cell by potentially regulating the glycolysis and lactate targets as well as pathways that formed the basis of the anti-CRC effects of ISL-NLs. The mechanism underlying this effect was further validated via the regulation of some key targets such as ENO1, ALDOA, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and MCT4 in glycolysis coupled with cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1&#945;) in protein kinase B/mTOR (Akt/mTOR) pathways. Moreover, the AMPK proteins were identified to be up-regulated while the lactic acid production was suppressed by ISL-NLs in the CRC cells, indicating that ISL-NLs had an inhibitory effect on AMPK mediated glycolysis and lactate production. Altogether, these results have provided insights into the mechanism underlying the key role that liposomal ISL played in the multiple inhibition of AMPK and Akt/mTOR mediated glycolysis and lactate generation, which may be regulated as the alternative metabolic pathways of CRC as well as serve as adjuvant therapy for the disease.","Wang, Gang; Yu, Yang; Wang, Yu-Zhu; Yin, Pei-Hao; Xu, Ke; Zhang, Heng",Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,309,20

However, the drawbacks of online teaching (e.g., students' inadequate autonomous learning, the lack of effective online instruction) forced us to modify teaching strategies during this special period, especially developing courses that are suitable for student learning at home and improving their key competencies. In order to solve these problems, this study introduces some theoretical exploration and practical work of curriculum design under the guidance of thinking-based instruction theory (TBIT) during the pandemic. We firstly introduce TBIT, and elaborate on the curriculum design under the TBIT theoretical frame. Then we describe a series of TBIT-based micro-courses with the pandemic as background. A descriptive study is reported to illustrate the effects of three micro-courses. Results showed that, compared to national curricula, the TBIT-based micro-courses not only improved the course quality but also enhanced students' motivation and facilitated their online learning behavior (such as interactive communication) for the online courses. The current study has important implications for how to design effective and interesting online courses suitable under pandemic and capable of improving students' thinking abilities and key competencies.","Li, Y.; Zhang, X.; Dai, D.

In our previous study, we found elevated plasma levels of IL-38 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the clear relationship of IL-38 expression in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and clinical and laboratory features needs elucidation. Additionally, we evaluated the possible role of IL-38 in regulating production of inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs in vitro. A pristane-induced murine lupus model was used to further demonstrate the effects of IL-38 on cytokines in vivo and discuss the significance of IL-38 in lupus development. The results showed that mRNA expression of IL-38 in PBMCs of patients with SLE was elevated compared with volunteers, and expression of IL-38 in both plasma and PBMCs was strongly related to clinical features, such as haematuria and proteinuria, and correlated with a SLEDAI score. Plasma levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6 and IL-23 were elevated in patients with SLE and were related to plasma levels of IL-38. In vitro, PBMCs of patients with SLE stimulated with IL-38 showed a decreased expression of the four inflammatory cytokines compared with PBMCs of patients without treatment. Interestingly, IL-38 administration in lupus mice significantly reduced the development of lupus, such as reduced proteinuria, improved histological examinations of the kidneys and down-regulated inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, IL-38 may suppress synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore regulate lupus pathogenesis.","Xu, Wang-Dong; Su, Lin-Chong; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Wang, Jia-Min; Yuan, Zhi-Chao; Qin, Zhen; Zhou, Xi-Ping; Huang, An-Fang",J. cell. mol. med,309,16

Senescent T cells are highly inflammatory and secrete cytotoxic mediators and express natural killer cells receptors (NKR) that bypass their antigen specificity. Instead they recognize stress ligands that are induced by inflammation or infection of different cell types in tissues. In this article we discuss data on T cell senescence, how it is regulated and evidence for novel functional attributes of senescent T cells. We discuss an interactive loop between senescent T cells and senescent non-lymphoid cells and conclude that in situations of intense inflammation, senescent cells may damage healthy tissue. While the example for immunopathology induced by senescent cells that we highlight is cutaneous leishmaniasis, this situation of organ damage may apply to other infections, including COVID-19 and also rheumatoid arthritis, where ageing, inflammation and senescent cells are all part of the same equation.","Covre, Luciana P; De Maeyer, Roel P H; Gomes, Daniel C O; Akbar, Arne N",Aging Cell,309,20

Any communication method can be used to target an individual and trick them into leaking confidential data in a fake environment, which can be later used to harm the sole victim or even an entire business depending on the attacker’s intend and the type of leaked data. Researchers have developed enormous anti-phishing tools and techniques like whitelist, blacklist, and antivirus software to detect web phishing. Classification is one of the techniques used to detect website phishing. This paper has proposed a model for detecting phishing attacks using various machine learning (ML) classifiers.

IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o..

They replaced them with online teaching and distance learning activities to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to this sudden change, students experienced some anthropometric, environmental, and psychosocial difficulties at home during the distance learning process. This study focuses on determining the importance of anthropometric, environmental, and psychosocial factors in the distance learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents main factors and their subfactors affecting ergonomic conditions of university students during distance learning. A novel distance learning ergonomics checklist is proposed based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration checklists. The data are collected via a questionnaire filled by 100 university students who attend the Ergonomics course online. Then, the integrated methodology includes Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process integrated Pythagorean Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to An Ideal Solution method is adopted to prioritize the factors determined. Thirty-nine different subfactors are evaluated under five titles, and the most important factors are determined using the proposed methodology. With the results achieved, it is seen that the suggested checklist and proposed methodology can be used by public and private education organizations as a guide for improving their distance learning strategies.","Ayyildiz, Ertugrul Taskin Gumus Alev",Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing &amp; Service Industries,309,1

Collective interhospital transport of critically ill COVID-19 patients as a way to mitigate the localised pressure from overloaded intensive care units at a national or international level has not been reported yet. The aim of this study was to provide descriptive data about the first six collective aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC) of COVID-19 patients performed within Europe. METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult patients transported by the first six collective MEDEVAC missions for COVID-19 patients performed within Europe on the 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, 31st of March and the 3rd of April 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were transported aboard six MEDEVAC missions. The median duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU before transportation was 4 days (3-5.25). The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio obtained before, during the flight and at day 1 after the transport was 180 mmHg (156-202,5), 143 mmHg (118,75-184,75) and 174 mmHg (129,5-205,5), respectively, with no significant difference. The median norepinephrine infusion rate observed before, during the flight and at day 1 after the transport was 0,08 µg/kg-1. min-1 (0,00-0,20), 0,08 (0,00-0,25), and 0,07 (0,03-0,18), respectively, with no significant difference.

The social groups thus formed, in variable proportions depending on the context, are not randomly organised but exhibit distinct features, such as the well-known tendency of 3-member groups to be arranged in a V-shape. The existence of group structures is thus likely to impact the collective dynamics of the crowd, possibly in a critical way when emergency situations are considered. After turning a blind eye to these group aspects for years, endeavours to model groups in crowd simulation software have thrived in the past decades. This fairly short review opens on a description of their empirical characteristics and their impact on the global flow. Then, it aims to offer a pedagogical discussion of the main strategies to model such groups, within different types of models, in order to provide guidance for prospective modellers.","Nicolas, Alexandre; Hafinaz, Fadratul",,309,33

Mobile web-based educational materials provide a novel and potentially valuable means to communicate clinical information that can aid in both medical management and rehabilitation. AIMS: We, therefore, evaluated an educational tablet-based intervention in three patient cohorts regarding the following topics: Parkinson's disease (PD) medications, dystonia and botulinum toxin treatment. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects with PD, 32 with dystonia and 61 receiving botulinum toxin treatment for movement disorders or sialorrhoea were enrolled. Participants in each cohort completed a specific educational module at the time of their regularly scheduled clinic visit, comprising slides, in addition to pre- and post-module quizzes and a satisfaction survey. Additionally, participants in the dystonia and botulinum toxin modules were given a follow-up test at their 3- or 6-month clinical treatment visit. RESULTS: There were 143 participants with 50 completing the PD module, 32 completing the dystonia module and 61 completing the botulinum toxin module. All three groups demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of module content between their pre- and post-module test scores (PD: p=.0001, dystonia: p<.0001 and botulinum toxin: p=.008), and those who took the dystonia module maintained significant improvement at either a 3- or 6-month follow up compared to pre-module (p <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Tablet-based teaching modules are an effective means of communicating key concepts to patients. This study supports their use for improving patient understanding that can support lifelong approaches to managing disabling, neurological conditions.Implication for RehabilitationTablet-based modules are relatively easy to use for enhancing education during clinic visits and can possibly help reduce and maintain disability with chronic conditions like Parkinson's disease and dystonia.Improvements in post-test scores suggested that patient participants were able to retain information from the tablets about their complex and challenging conditions and treatments.Adding patients who are fluent in another language would have made this study more generalizable and future studies exploring educational interventions are warranted to help better tailor interventions to patients with chronic neurologic illnesses to help understand the complex aspects of their medical and rehabilitation therapy.The effect of cognitive changes in neurological conditions and understanding of educational information needs to be further tested.This positive result is especially meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person access to both medical and rehabilitative care has been curtailed.","Hellmers, Natalie; Barkan, Samantha; Auerbach, Gabrielle; Hanineva, Aneliya; Popa, Paul; Sarva, Harini; Henchcliffe, Claire",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,309,33

The manifestations of this disease are still being described in a variety of different contexts and patient populations. RESULTS: We report the case of a neonate who demonstrated COVID-19 after surgical correction of transposition of the great arteries. In addition, the patient demonstrated an evolving and persistent tachyarrhythmia consistent with neither the most likely postoperative complications nor typical COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The patient had negative preoperative testing for the virus and presented with profound oxygen desaturation and respiratory failure several days postoperatively. This raised concern for a complication of his arterial switch operation. It was found that one of the patient's caregivers was an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19, and imaging ruled out intracardiac shunting. After initiating treatment for COVID-19, the patient's oxygen requirements and need for anti-arrhythmic agents improved. CONCLUSION: We propose that, despite negative preoperative testing, coronavirus infection may present as refractory tachyarrhythmia, and may be considered along with surgical complications as a cause for unexplained hypoxemia postoperatively.","Lopez, Raymond A; Padilla, Luz A; Sorabella, Robert A; Cleveland, David C; Rhodes, Leslie A; Dabal, Robert J",J. card. surg,309,33

Similar to recently reported self-assemblage in curcumin induced by sugar, trigonelline, a natural antidiabetic derived from fenugreek, can also induce auto-catalyzed self-assemblage in curcumin to form nanoparticles. It has been shown that these nanoparticles may be utilized for the delivery of drugs with severe side effects especially for diabetic patients with triple benefit of being antidiabetic, biocompatible and safe. As an example, carriage of antidiabetic drug pioglitazone and anticancer drug taxol have been depicted utilizing nanoparticles of curcumin and trigonelline.

METHODS: A nationwide questionnaire survey on line was administered to medical staffs involved in COVID-19 treatment on February 28th, 2020. The questionnaire included drug treatment, respiratory support therapy, sedation and analgesia, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), etc. RESULTS: There were 1 103 respondents, of whom 699 (504 doctors and 195 nurses) participated in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, 432 doctors and 170 nurses from 9 provinces submitted valid questionnaires. The results of the questionnaire surveys of doctors and nurses were basically the same. Considering that doctors dominated in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the results of the questionnaires of doctors were mainly analyzed. The doctors participating in the survey were mainly from Hubei (29.2%), followed by Henan (24.5%), Guizhou (22.7%), and Guangxi (14.6%), etc. 55.4% of the doctors came from tertiary three hospitals, and most of them have senior titles (56.4%). 232 doctors (53.7%) participated in the treatment of mild COVID-19, and 200 doctors (46.3%) participated in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients. More than 95% of the doctors expressed that they would carry out antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19 regardless of disease severity. The main antiviral drugs included &#945;-interferon (69.5%), lopinavir/ritonavir (65.0%), abidol (60.0%), and ribavirin (55.7%). The choice of antiviral drugs was highly consistent with the national treatment programs of COVID-19. At the same time, 95.5% of doctors would routinely prescribe antibiotics to severe and critically ill patients. 94.0% of doctors agreed to prescribe low-dose glucocorticoid therapy to severe and critically ill patients. About 2/3 of doctors would perform lung recruitment or prone position treatment for critical patients with invasive ventilation. 79.0% of doctors preferred to use deep sedation for patients with invasive ventilation. About 1/3 of doctors believed that CRRT should be initiated early, and nearly 1/3 of doctors suggested that ECMO should be used more aggressively in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Medical staffs are familiar with the national treatment plan of COVID-19 and willing to follow it. However, as a new disease, we have limited knowledge about COVID-19 and there are still many controversies. Further practical training is needed to make clinicians more aware of the disease, and more evidence-based evidence is needed to guide clinical treatment.","Liu, Shaohua; Ding, Xianfei; Cao, Junzi; Zhang, Shuguang; Sun, Tongwen",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,309,24

However, the relationship between microbiota and COVID-19 severity progression is still being assessed. This study aimed to analyse the diversity and taxonomic composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, to determine its association with COVID-19 clinical outcome. Methods and FindingsSamples came from a retrospective cohort of adult patients with COVID-19, hospitalised in a tertiary centre. To study the nasopharyngeal microbiota, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing. Raw sequences were processed by QIIME2. The associations between the microbiota, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality were analysed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI), adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. 177 patients were included: median age 68.0 years, 57.6% males, 59.3% had a Charlson comorbidity index [≥]3, and 89.2% with pneumonia. The microbiota diversity indexes were lower in patients with a fatal outcome, and this association persisted after adjustment for the main confounders; whereas the {beta} diversity analysis showed a significant clustering, grouping the patients with a fatal outcome. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of Selenomonas spp., Filifactor spp., Actinobacillus spp., or Chroococcidiopsis spp., was associated with a reduced risk of IMV (adjusted OR 0.06[95%CI 0.01-0.0.47], p = 0.007).

Independent head-to-head studies are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT nasal sampling to demonstrate comparability of performance with nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling. We conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT (distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the sampling methods as well as sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0-94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5-99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2-92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5-95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1-99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling.

To study a very complex cellular response, it is necessary to diminish background environmental influences and highlight the particular event. However, surface-driven nonspecific interactions of the abundant biomolecules from the environment influence the targeted cell response significantly. Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation may serve as a marker of human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cell responses to the extracellular matrix and surface-mediated stresses. Here, we propose a platform of tunable functionable antifouling poly(carboxybetain) (pCB)-based brushes to achieve a molecularly clean background for studying arginine, glycine, and aspartic acid (RGD)-induced YAP-connected mechanotransduction. Using two different sets of RGD-functionalized zwitterionic antifouling coatings with varying compositions of the antifouling layer, a clear correlation of YAP distribution with RGD functionalization concentrations was observed. On the other hand, commonly used surface passivation by the oligo(ethylene glycol)-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) shows no potential to induce dependency of the YAP distribution on RGD concentrations. The results indicate that the antifouling background is a crucial component of surface-based cellular response studies, and pCB-based zwitterionic antifouling brush architectures may serve as a potential next-generation easily functionable surface platform for the monitoring and quantification of cellular processes.","Vísová, Ivana; Smolková, Barbora; Uzhytchak, Mariia; Vrabcová, Markéta; Chafai, Djamel Eddine; Houska, Milan; Pastucha, Matej; Skládal, Petr; Farka, Zdenek; Dejneka, Alexandr; Vaisocherová-Lísalová, Hana",Biomolecules,309,12

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","Lim, Julian; Leow, Zaven; Ong, Jason; Pang, Ly-Shan; Lim, Eric",JMIR Ment Health,309,14

The status of the host immune system is a critical factor that affects the severity and outcomes of COVID-19. In particular, antibody responses are an indicator of the anti-viral defense; so, a delayed or inappropriate induction of these responses would correlate with a defect in the viral clearance. METHODS: This is a rapid synthesis of literature investigating antibody responses in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. RESULTS: Lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), along with the direct evidence of antibody responses in COVID-19, pose the potentials of dynamic antibody responses for screening and prognostic purposes in COVID-19. Also, neutralizing antibodies extracted from recovered patients and monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines offer therapeutic support for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the dynamics of antibody responses help to determine the effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19. Of note, it might be helpful for the evaluation of the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccination - the dreams for the future of COVID-19. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility and efficacy of antibody extraction from animal subjects. Finally, numerous factors affect antibody response such as race, nutrition status, and virus mutations in viral infections, which need to be considered in the context of COVID-19.","Mohammadi, Tooba; Nasab, Mahsa G; Mohebalizadeh, Mehdi; Kheirandish, Ali; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Clin. lab,309,16

The present study design determines the diagnostic value of LUSS in the semi-quantitative assessment of pneumonia in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neonates. METHODS: Eleven COVID-19 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 infection and 11 age- and gender-matched controls were retrospectively studied. LUSS was acquired by assessing the lesions and aeration loss in 12 lung regions per subject. RESULTS: Most of the COVID-19 newborns presented with mild and atypical symptoms, mainly involving respiratory and digestive systems. In the COVID-19 group, a total of 132 regions of the lung were examined, 83 regions (62.8%) of which were detected abnormalities by LUS. Compared with controls, COVID-19 neonates showed sparse or confluent B-lines (83 regions), disappearing A-lines (83 regions), abnormal pleural lines (29 regions), and subpleural consolidations (2 regions). The LUSS was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. In total, 49 regions (37%) were normal, 73 regions (55%) scored 1, and 10 regions (8%) scored 2 by LUSS. All the lesions were bilateral, with multiple regions involved. The majority of the lesions were located in the bilateral inferior and posterior regions. LUS detected abnormalities in three COVID-19 neonates with normal radiological performance. The intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility of LUSS was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a noninvasive, convenient, and sensitive method to assess neonatal COVID-19 pneumonia, and can be used as an alternative to the use of diagnostic radiography. LUSS provides valuable semi-quantitative information on the lesion distribution and severity.","Li, Wei; Fu, Manli; Qian, Chao; Liu, Xin; Zeng, Lingkong; Peng, Xuehua; Hong, Yue; Zhou, Huan; Yuan, Li",Pediatr Pulmonol,309,22

Despite the presence of different COVID-19 vaccines, the discovery of proper antiviral therapeutics is an urgent necessity. Nature is considered as a historical trove for drug discovery, especially in global crises. During our efforts to discover potential anti-SARS CoV-2 natural therapeutics, screening our in-house natural products and plant crude extracts library led to the identification of C. benedictus extract as a promising candidate. To find out the main chemical constituents responsible for the extract’s antiviral activity, we utilized recently reported SARS CoV-2 structural information in comprehensive in silico investigations (e.g., ensemble docking and physics-based molecular modeling). As a result, we constructed protein–protein and protein–compound interaction networks that suggest cnicin as the most promising anti-SARS CoV-2 hit that might inhibit viral multi-targets. The subsequent in vitro validation confirmed that cnicin could impede the viral replication of SARS CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 1.18 µg/mL. Furthermore, drug-like property calculations strongly recommended cnicin for further in vivo and clinical experiments. The present investigation highlighted natural products as crucial and readily available sources for developing antiviral therapeutics. Additionally, it revealed the key contributions of bioinformatics and computer-aided modeling tools in accelerating the discovery rate of potential therapeutics, particularly in emergency times like the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Alhadrami, Hani A.; Sayed, Ahmed M.; Hassan, Hossam M.; Youssif, Khayrya A.; Gaber, Yasser Moatasim Yassmin Kutkat Omnia Mostafa Ahmed Ali Mohamed Ahmed Rateb Mostafa E.; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan Gamaleldin Noha M.",Antibiotics,309,12

Utilization of drug repurposing approaches has generated substantial interest in order to overcome these drawbacks. A drastic reduction in the failure rate, which otherwise is ~92%, is achieved with the drug repurposing approach. The recent exploration of the drug repurposing approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has further validated the fact that it is more beneficial to reinvestigate the in-practice drugs for a new application instead of designing novel drugs. The first successful example of drug repurposing is zidovudine (AZT), which was developed as an anti-cancer agent in the 1960s and was later approved by the US FDA as an anti-HIV therapeutic drug in the late 1980s after fast track clinical trials. Since that time, the drug repurposing approach has been successfully utilized to develop effective therapeutic strategies against a plethora of diseases. Hence, an extensive application of the drug repurposing approach will not only help to fight the current pandemics more efficiently but also predict and prepare for newly emerging viral infections. In this review, we discuss in detail the drug repurposing approach and its advancements related to viral infections such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Trivedi, Jay; Mohan, Mahesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",,309,9

This unprecedented situation highlights ongoing societal ageism and its manifestations in public discourse. This analysis asks how national news sources performed explicit and implicit ageism during the first month of the pandemic. METHODS: Using content and critical discourse analysis methods, we analyzed 287 articles concerning older adults and COVID-19 published between March 11 and April 10, 2020, in four major U.S.-based newspapers. RESULTS: Findings indicate that while ageism was rarely discussed explicitly, ageist bias was evident in implicit reporting patterns (e.g., frequent use of the term ""elderly,"" portrayals of older adults as ""vulnerable""). Infection and death rates and institutionalized care were among the most commonly reported topics, providing a limited portrait of aging during the pandemic. The older ""survivor"" narrative offers a positive alternative by suggesting exceptional examples of resilience and grit. However, the survivor narrative may also implicitly place blame on those unable to survive or thrive in later life.

In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment. METHODS: Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99 ± 3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the ""being away"" dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the ""being away"" and ""fascination"" dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables. RESULTS: Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.","Dzhambov, Angel M; Lercher, Peter; Browning, Matthew H E M; Stoyanov, Drozdstoy; Petrova, Nadezhda; Novakov, Stoyan; Dimitrova, Donka D",Environ Res,309,14

Regulations such as ""physical distancing,"" mentioned as ""social distancing,"" and the closure of public facilities during the lockdown could be perceived as burdensome especially by individuals who feel a strong need for social exchange and belonging. These components such as need to belong and the fear of missing out also play a major role in the development and maintenance of a problematic use of social networks. Researchers have argued recently that an increase of addictive (online) behaviors may be a likely consequence of subjectively experienced restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study investigates the interplay of perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions and the fear of missing out (FoMO) as well as of symptoms of problematic social-networks use. We hypothesized that perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions mediates the effect of specific predisposing variables related to social needs on the symptom severity of a problematic use. To assess the perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions, we developed a specific questionnaire asking for perceived COVID-19-related strain in several domains of everyday-life. An exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: perceived strain related to restrictions of (1) social contacts, (2) travel, (3) childcare, (4) work, and (5) own health. In a sample of 719 German participants and data collection during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 30th until April 3rd 2020), a structural equation model was calculated showing that higher levels of need to belong and FoMO increase perceived COVID-19-related strain, which is related to symptoms of a problematic social-networks use. The effect of need to belong on problematic social-networks use is mediated by experienced COVID-19-related strain and FoMO-online. Even if the use of social networks is not pathological per se, it may be associated with suffering for a vulnerable part of users. We conclude that specific needs and fear-associated predisposing variables contribute to experiencing physical distance and other pandemic-related restrictions as more stressful, which may increase problematic social-networks use and potentially other addictive behaviors as well in the context of the COVID-19-related lockdown.","Wegmann, E.; Brandtner, A.; Brand, M.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,309,27

Up to now, there is scarce information regarding the clinical features and short-term outcomes of infected patients with cancer. Methods: We performed a retrospective study in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 14, 2020, to Mar 15, 2020, China. Data were retrieved including demographic and clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome data. Patients were classified into the discharged group and undischarged group by the 4-week outcomes from admission. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed between the two groups. Results: A total of 37 patients were enrolled in the study, including 27 cancer survivors in routine follow-up. Breast cancer (18.9%) was the most frequent cancer type, and common symptoms included cough (54.1%), fever (48.6%), and fatigue (27%). Lymphocytopenia and hypoproteinemia were much frequent in patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within the past month. However, the concentration of D-dimer (median: 3.75 vs 0.43, P =0.010) and fibrin degradation products (median: 23.60 vs 1.80, P =0.002) were evidently increased in this population compared with cancer survivors. At the end of follow-up, 83.8% of the enrolled patients were discharged. Among the discharged, women (48.6%) and cancer survivors (67.6%) showed better short-term outcomes. The elevated level of FDP was significantly higher in the undischarged group (median: 21.85 vs 2.00, P =0.049). The proportion of CD3-positive lymphocyte cells and CD4-positive lymphocytes was correlated with short-term outcomes. Conclusion: Peripheral lymphocyte subset (CD3-positive and CD4-positive) on admission as a novel biomarker had a potential association with early efficacy. Cancer survivors in routine follow-up would achieve better short-term outcomes. COVID-19 patients with cancer should gain more attention and close monitoring.","Wang, Yong; Shan, Ben-Jie; Shen, Xia-Bo; Zheng, Chang-Cheng; Wang, Jin-Quan; Li, Gui-Ling; Pan, Yue-Yin",Cancer Manag Res,309,20

In this study, emissions from anthracite and bitumite were examined. Red mud (RM) acts as an additive and is mixed in coal briquettes with a content of 0-10% as a single variable to demonstrate the reduction in the PM2.5 emissions. Burnt in a regulated combustion chamber, the 10% RM-containing bitumite and anthracite briquettes showed 52.3 and 18.6% reduction in PM2.5, respectively, compared with their chunk coals. Lower cytotoxicity (in terms of oxidative stresses and inflammation factors) was observed for PM2.5 emitted from the RM-containing briquettes than those from non-RM briquettes, especially for the bitumite groups. Besides, the results of western blotting illustrated that the inhibition of NF-&#954;B and MAPK was the potential pathway for the reduction of cytokine levels by the RM addition. The regression analyses further demonstrated that the reduction was attributed to the lower emissions of transition metals (i.e., Mn) and PAHs (i.e., acenaphthene). This pilot study provides solid evidence for the cytotoxicity to vascular smooth muscle cells induced by PM2.5 from coal combustion and potential solutions for reducing the emission of toxic pollutants from human health perspectives.","Sun, Jian; Shen, Zhenxing; Niu, Xinyi; Zhang, Yue; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Tian; He, Kun; Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Suixin; Ho, Steven Sai Hang; Li, Xuxiang; Cao, Junji",Environ Sci Technol,309,16

The basic aim of this study was to study the maternal and fetal outcome in the pregnant females affected by COVID-19 infection at any gestational age and the frequency of vertical transmission, and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The audit of hospital based data to devise and implement local management guidelines for the pregnant patients. This descriptive case series was conducted at the department of gynecology and obstetrics, at KRL Hospital Islamabad from 1st of April to 31st of July, 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 16 patients were included who were found positive for the infection via RT-PCR. Demographic profile, gestational age at the time of presentation, premorbid disease, maternal symptoms and severity of disease and perinatal outcome noted. The data was analyzed using SPSS 21.0. All the females were aged between 25 to 35 years. Amongst these, 6 patients were primigravida, 1 was diagnosed during the first trimester, 3 in the second trimester and remaining in third trimester. Only one patient had severe disease with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath and remained on oxygen support. But majority of patients were either asymptomatic or had symptoms like flu, fever, generalized body weakness. No maternal mortality, venous thromboembolism, or need of ventilatory support noted. Only one of the patients had an intrauterine death while the rest had neonates who were monitored in the postnatal period and only 1 needed admission due to RDS. None of the baby developed COVID infection. Majority of patients had asymptomatic infection that does not appear to affect the obstetrical outcomes. But the adverse outcomes were seen in those patients who did not attend the antenatal clinics due to the lockdown situation.

COVID-19 has also affected the social and economic sustainability structure which has led from one crisis to another and the developing countries have been the worst hit. Economic crisis resulted in unemployment leading to labour migrations, inevitable casualties and rising poverty etc. However, at a certain level, a few industries and organizations have shown resilience with better anticipation and survivability which may lead them to a quicker recovery.

The study considers three aspects of organizational resilience as crisis anticipation, organizational robustness and recoverability. It assesses the impact of the aspects of resilience on social sustainability and economic sustainability. The study uses empirical analysis of primary data which is analysed to verify the hypothesized relationships by using a structural equation modelling approach.

Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA) is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by 18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China, Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends of spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon.","Shen, Xinyi; Cai, Chenkai; Civil, Hui Li Department of; Engineering, Environmental; Connecticut, University of; Hydrology, College of; Resources, Water; University, Hohai; Finance, Department of",,309,26

We examine 10 independent reviews of the Australian government's response to the GFC with a particular focus on their nature and the context in which they occurred. As a result, we identify five themes: when and how often reviews are conducted; recognition of context; the need for clear program objectives; explicit design principles; and governance. We develop a typology of independent reviews that has three key and interrelated dimensions: purpose, timing, and reviewer. We observe that there was patchwork coverage of the GFC measures, with no single report providing a holistic assessment of what was achieved or lessons learnt. We contend that, notwithstanding differences between crises, the typology will aid understanding of the role, key issues, and contributions of reviews that have already been, or will be, commissioned into COVID-19 and future emergency economic stimulus measures.","Wilkins, Peter; Gilchrist, David; Phillimore, John",Aust.

Thus, the relationship among animal-origin food supply as independent factor and total cases of COVID-19 as a dependent variable was assessed. In this regard, the relevance between the consumption quantity of foods (n = 20) and TC of COVID-19 in worldwide countries (n = 215) was evaluated. For more details, we studied the number of total case (TC) as a dependent variable and food supply as an independent variable. Food supply (kg/capita/yr.) was estimated in each country based on the latest available data of FAO. The results showed an association between a group of animal-origin foods and TC. Regression, Bayes, and Lasso's findings demonstrated that eggs and freshwater fish have a high positive correlation with TC. We suppose an important role for animal-origin foods concerning COVID-19 as a cross-contamination pathway. In conclusion, a noticeable vehicle for SARS-Cov-2 may be some of the animal-origin foods. The perspective is the development of surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 in the food production chain. Also, chicken's eggs and freshwater fish may be leading vehicles for SARS-Cov-2 by cross-contamination.","Saeedi, N.; Rafat, S. A.",Journal of Zoonotic Diseases,309,30

The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of &#8805;8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale.

DESIGN: A prospective follow-up study. SETTING: In 2019, the baseline Urban Health and Nutrition Study 2019 (UHNS-2019) was conducted in 603 households, which were selected randomly from 30 clusters to represent underserved urban settlements in Colombo. In the present study, 35 % of households from the UHNS-2019 cohort were randomly selected for repeat interviews, 1 year after the baseline study and 6 months after COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Height/length and weight of children and women were re-measured, household food insecurity was reassessed, and associated factors were gathered through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Differences in measurements at baseline and follow-up studies were compared. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 207 households, comprising 127 women and 109 children were included. RESULTS: The current prevalence of children with wasting and overweight was higher in the follow-up study than at baseline UHNS-2019 (18·3 % v. 13·7 %; P = 0·26 and 8·3 % v. 3·7 %; P = 0·12, respectively). There was a decrease in prevalence of child stunting (14·7 % v. 11·9 %; P = 0·37). A change was not observed in overall obesity in women, which was about 30·7 %. Repeated lockdown was associated with a significant reduction in food security from 57 % in UHNS-2019 to 30 % in the current study (P < 0·001).

These peptides showed robust viral antigenicity, immunogenicity, and a marked interaction with HLA alleles. Interestingly, several peptides showed affinity by HLA class I (HLA-I) alleles that commonly activates to natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, HLA biding peptides are conserved among SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Here we show that many of the studies on which these estimates are based are scientifically flawed for reasons which include: nonsensical equations, unjustified assumptions, small sample sizes, non-representative sampling (systematic biases), incorrect definitions of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (identified and unidentified cases), typically assuming that cases which are asymptomatic at the time of testing are the same as completely asymptomatic (never symptomatic) cases. Moreover, a widely cited meta-analysis misrepresents some of the IFR values in the original studies, and makes inappropriate duplicate use of studies, or the information from studies, so that the results that are averaged are not independent from each other.

We conducted this study to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients who were enrolled in the nation-wide inception cohort. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to the SLE patients enrolled in the inception cohort. Questions related to the effect on disease activity, preventive measures adopted against COVID-19, the incidence of COVID-19, hardships faced in getting access to health care professionals and availability of medicines, adherence, fear of COVID-19 and the potential benefits of being part of the registry. RESULTS: A total of 1040 (90% females) patients completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 27.5 ± 19.1 years and the mean disease duration was 1.25 years. Twenty-Four (2.3%) patients had developed fever (>1 day) during this period, including one patient with additional symptoms of diarrhoea and anosmia, however, none of the patients developed COVID-19 infection. 262 patients (25.2%) reported financial difficulty during this period and patients reported an average excess expenditure of at least 2255.45 INR ($30) per month. 378 patients (36%) reported problems in getting their prescribed medicines due to lockdown. Of these, 167 (40%) patients needed to change their medication schedule due to this non-availability. Almost 54% of patients missed their scheduled follow up visits during the lockdown period and 37% of patients were unable to get their investigations done due to closure of laboratories and hospitals. 266 patients (25.5%) reported worsening of various symptoms of SLE during this period. Almost 61% patients felt confident that being associated with the inception cohort had helped them in managing their disease better during this period of lockdown as they received help in the form of timely and frequent telephonic consults, assistance in making the medicines available, and regular counselling resulting in abetment of their fears and anxieties. CONCLUSION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on our SLE patients. Patients faced difficulty in the availability of medicines, missed the doses of medicines, had financial constraints, and spent more money on health during the pandemic.","Rathi, Manish; Singh, Parmeshar; Bi, Hayath Peta; Shivanna, Archana; Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Tripathy, Saumya Ranjan; Parthasarathy, Janani; Tota, Sneha; Maurya, Supriya; Vijayalekshmi, Vishnupriya; Bhavani, D; Jain, Avinash; Gupta, Ranjan; Danda, Debashish; Rajasekhar, Liza; Negi, Vir Singh; Shobha, Vineeta; Das, Bidyut; Aggarwal, Amita",Lupus,309,1

We hypothesized, following prohibition: there would be a significant change in the relative search volumes (RSV) of alcohol-related queries; that temporal analysis of the trends would reflect a public response to policy changes; and that geospatial analysis of RSV would correlate with the prevalence of alcohol use. METHODS: Three different search periods were used to test the hypotheses. The search inputs were based on potential public response to alcohol prohibition, as evidenced by the literature, newspaper articles, and consensus. We used RSV as the unit of analysis. Mean RSV of search queries, pre-post implementation of prohibition, were compared. Smoothing of scatter plots examined the temporal association of trends with policy measures. Multiple linear regression tested the relationship of state-wise RSV and alcohol use prevalence. RESULTS: Post-implementation of prohibition, a significant increase in the RSV was observed for searches related to alcohol withdrawal (p<0.001), how to extract alcohol from sanitizer (p = 0.002), alcohol home delivery online (p<0.001), alcohol home delivery (p<0.001), and sleeping pills (p = 0.006). The trends suggested a decrease in general interest in alcohol but increased demand, and a possible connection with changes in policy measures. State-level RSV and alcohol use prevalence did not reveal a significant relationship. CONCLUSION: Google trend is a potential source of rapid feedback to policymakers about population responses to an abrupt change in alcohol policies.","Ghosh, Abhishek; E-Roub, Fazl; Krishnan, Narayanan C; Choudhury, Shinjini; Basu, Aniruddha",Int J Drug Policy,309,17

In this article, direct evidence from studies of COVID-19, and indirect evidence from studies of infections caused by other coronaviruses (eg SARS, MERS) and of the ICU experience are explored to identify the potential course of recovery and areas where nurses can help. Most people will have an uncomplicated recovery. However, it appears that a more complicated recovery is likely to be associated with severe disease.

A great deal of effort has been made to find effective drugs against this disease. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were widely adopted in treating COVID-19, but the results were contradictive. CQ/HCQ have been used to prevent and treat malaria and are efficacious anti-inflammatory agents in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. These drugs have potential broad-spectrum antiviral properties, but the underlying mechanisms are speculative. In this review, we re-evaluated the treatment outcomes and current hypothesis for the working mechanisms of CQ/HCQ as COVID-19 therapy with a special focus on disruption of Ca 2+signaling. In so doing, we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for CQ/HCQ action on coronavirus may interact and reinforce each other. The potential toxicity is also noted due to its action on Ca 2+and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells. We propose that intracellular calcium homeostasis is an alternative mechanism for CQ/HCQ pharmacology, which should be considered when evaluating the risks and benefits of therapy in these patients and other perspective applications.Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Calcium, HCN, SARS-CoV-2; Cardiology; Pathology; Infectious disease; Neurology; Pharmacology; Immunology; Clinical toxicology; Toxicology; Eye-ear-nose-throat; Internal medicine","Zhan, Xiping; Dowell, Sharon; Shen, Ying; Lee, Dexter L.",Heliyon,309,21

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs. METHODS: Studies reporting safety and efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were included. Only descriptive statistics were conducted to obtain a pooled rate of immune-related adverse events in vaccinated patients. RESULTS: Ten studies assessing the safety and eight assessing the efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were identified, for a total of 1124 and 986 vaccinated patients, respectively. Most patients had melanoma or lung cancer and received a single agent anti-PD-1, but also other tumour types and immunotherapy combinations were represented. No severe vaccination-related toxicities were reported. The pooled incidence of any grade immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events was 28.9%. In the 6 studies specifying the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities, the pooled incidence was 7.5%. No grade 5 toxicities were reported. No pooled descriptive analysis was conducted in studies reporting efficacy outcomes due to the heterogeneity of endpoints and data reporting. Nevertheless, among the eight studies included, seven reported positive efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review support the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs.

The most important factor in the synthesis of SACs is the selection of appropriate support and formation of metal-support interaction. Among a large number of nanomaterials, MXenes can be utilized as benign supports for fixing SACs because of their expansive specific surface area, regulable bandgap, superior electronic conductivity, and strong mechanical stability. The structure and property of MXenes can be manipulated by changing transition metal elements and surface termination. Here, the uniqueness and superiority of MXenes as superexcellent supports for confining SACs are analyzed from structure and property. The synthetic strategy of MXene-supported SACs is also summarized, especially emphasizing the immobilization of isolated atom against aggregation by utilizing the formidable metal-support covalent coordination interaction. In addition, the applications of MXene-supported SACs in electrocatalytic field are highlighted, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Finally, the challenges and prospects are pointed out for the further understanding and practical application of MXene-supported SACs in electrocatalysis.","Zhang, Mingming; Lai, Cui; Li, Bisheng; Liu, Shiyu; Huang, Danlian; Xu, Fuhang; Liu, Xigui; Qin, Lei; Fu, Yukui; Li, Ling; Yi, Huan; Chen, Liang",Small,309,27

Although evidence suggests that masks help to curb the spread of the disease, there is little empirical research at the population level. We investigate the association between self-reported mask-wearing, physical distancing, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA, along with the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered via a web platform to randomly surveyed US individuals aged 13 years and older, to query self-reports of face mask-wearing. Survey responses were combined with instantaneous reproductive number (Rt) estimates from two publicly available sources, the outcome of interest. Measures of physical distancing, community demographics, and other potential sources of confounding (from publicly available sources) were also assessed. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask-wearing and community transmission control (Rt<1). Additionally, mask-wearing in 12 states was evaluated 2 weeks before and after statewide mandates. FINDINGS: 378â207 individuals responded to the survey between June 3 and July 27, 2020, of which 4186 were excluded for missing data. We observed an increasing trend in reported mask usage across the USA, although uptake varied by geography. A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 3·53, 95% CI 2·03-6·43). We found that communities with high reported mask-wearing and physical distancing had the highest predicted probability of transmission control. Segmented regression analysis of reported mask-wearing showed no statistically significant change in the slope after mandates were introduced; however, the upward trend in reported mask-wearing was preserved. INTERPRETATION: The widespread reported use of face masks combined with physical distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Self-reported mask-wearing increased separately from government mask mandates, suggesting that supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximise adoption and help to curb the ongoing epidemic.

We found â¼11,000 cysteines proximal to a ligand across 8,386 complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In a prospective evaluation, five out of nine predicted covalent kinase inhibitors showed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 155 nM and 4.5 µM. Application against an existing SARS-CoV Mpro reversible inhibitor led to an acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking was validated by 12 co-crystal structures. Together these examples hint at the vast number of covalent inhibitors accessible through our protocol.","Zaidman, Daniel; Gehrtz, Paul; Filep, Mihajlo; Fearon, Daren; Gabizon, Ronen; Douangamath, Alice; Prilusky, Jaime; Duberstein, Shirly; Cohen, Galit; Owen, C David; Resnick, Efrat; Strain-Damerell, Claire; Lukacik, Petra; Barr, Haim; Walsh, Martin A; von Delft, Frank; London, Nir",Cell Chem.

Over the last three decades, various studies have shown that HCQ also plays a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Although the mechanisms of action underlying the glucose-lowering properties of HCQ are still not entirely clear, evidence suggests that this drug may exert multifaceted effects on glucose regulation, including improvement of insulin sensitivity, increase of insulin secretion, reduction of hepatic insulin clearance, and reduction of systemic inflammation. Preliminary studies have shown the safety and efficacy of HCQ (at a dose ranging from 400 to 600 mg/day) in patients with type 2 diabetes over a short-term period. In 2014, HCQ has been approved in India as an add-on hypoglycemic agent for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of HCQ in patients with type 2 diabetes over a long-term period. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, several medications (including HCQ) have been used as off-label drugs because of the lack of proven effective therapies. However, emerging evidence shows limited benefit from HCQ use in COVID-19 in general. The aim of this manuscript is to comprehensively summarize the current knowledge on the antihyperglycemic properties of HCQ and to critically evaluate the potential risks and benefits related to HCQ use in patients with diabetes, even in light of the current pandemic scenario.","Infante, Marco; Ricordi, Camillo; Fabbri, Andrea",J Diabetes,309,1

In hospitalized-patients, prompt interruption of the virus-driven inflammatory process by using combination treatments seems theoretically of outmost importance. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis of multifaceted management of these patients. Methods A treatment algorithm based on ferritin was applied in 311 patients (67.2% males; median age 63-years; moderate disease, n=101; severe, n=210). Patients with ferritin <500ng/ml received anakinra 2-4mg/kg/day ± corticosteroids (Arm A, n=142) while those with &#8805;500ng/ml received anakinra 5-8mg/kg/day with corticosteroids and Î³-globulins (Arm B, n=169). In case of no improvement a single dose of tocilizumab (8mg/kg; maximum 800mg) was administered with the potential of additional second and/or third pulses. Treatment endpoints were the rate of the development of respiratory failure necessitating intubation and the SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. The proposed algorithm was also validated in matched hospitalized-patients treated with standard-of-care during the same period. Results In overall, intubation and mortality rates were 5.8% and 5.1% (0% in moderate; 8.6% and 7.6% in severe). Low baseline pO2/FiO2 and older age were independent risk factors. Comparators had significantly higher intubation (HR=7.4; 95%CI: 4.1-13.4; p<0.001) and death rates (HR=4.5, 95%CI: 2.1-9.4, p<0.001). Significant adverse events were rare, including severe secondary infections in only 7/311 (2.3%). Conclusions Early administration of personalized combinations of immunomodulatory agents may be life-saving in hospitalized-patients with COVID-19. An immediate intervention (the sooner the better) could be helpful to avoid development of full-blown acute respiratory distress syndrome and improve survival.","Dalekos, George N; Stefos, Aggelos; Georgiadou, Sarah; Lygoura, Vasiliki; Michail, Anastasia; Ntaios, George; Samakidou, Anna; Giannoulis, George; Gabeta, Stella; Vlychou, Marianna; Petinaki, Efthymia; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Gatselis, Nikolaos K",Eur J Intern Med,309,23

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. The survey consisted of an ad hoc questionnaire comprising clinical and sociodemographic information and the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: The final sample included 21,207 individuals [mean age (SD) = 39.7 (14.0); females: 14,768 (69.6%)]. Up to 2867 (13.5%) of participants reported using alcohol, 2545 (12%) tobacco and 1384 (6.5%) both substances as a strategy to cope with the pandemic. Sex-related factors were associated with alcohol consumption as a coping strategy [female, OR = 0.600, p < 0.001].

In all probability, the advent of COVID-19 has substantially raised these levels. The present study measured the emotional state of university students during lockdown and identified the relevant situational and psychological factors. To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown. We explored the extent to which these factors were associated with levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that students' belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects was positively related to hassles (r = .34, p < .001), while concerns about their own health and that of relatives were positively associated with anxiety (r = .37 and .34; p < .001). In addition, use of the positive reframing coping strategy mediated the effect of students' implicit theory of emotion on their depressive symptoms.

Clinical and laboratory data are of importance to increase the success in the management of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively from medical records of 191 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from a tertiary single-center hospital between March and April 2020. Prognostic effects of variables on admission among patients who received intensive care unit (ICU) support and those who didn't require ICU care were compared. RESULTS: Patients required ICU care (n = 46) were older (median, 71 vs. 43 years), with more underlying comorbidities (76.1% vs. 33.1%). ICU patients had lower lymphocytes, percentage of large unstained cell (%LUC), hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin, but higher leucocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), urea, creatinine, aspartate amino transferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer when compared with non-critically ill patients (p < 0.001). A logistic regression model was created to include ferritin, %LUC, NLR, and D-dimer. %LUC decrease and D-dimer increase had the highest odds ratios (0.093 vs 5.597, respectively) to predict severe prognosis. D-dimer, CRP, and NLR had the highest AUC in the ROC analysis (0.896, 0.874, 0.861, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive analysis of clinical and admission laboratory parameters to identify patients with severe prognosis is important not only for the follow-up of the patients but also to identify the pathophysiology of the disease. %LUC decrease and D-dimer, NLR, and CRP increases seem to be the most powerful laboratory predictors of severe prognosis.","Bastug, Aliye; Bodur, Hurrem; Erdogan, Serpil; Gokcinar, Derya; Kazancioglu, Sumeyye; Kosovali, Behiye Deniz; Ozbay, Bahadir Orkun; Gok, Gamze; Turan, Isil Ozkocak; Yilmaz, Gulsen; Gonen, Canan Cam; Yilmaz, Fatma Meric",Int Immunopharmacol,309,9

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by &#8805;95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.","Barone, Sierra M; Paul, Alberta G A; Muehling, Lyndsey M; Lannigan, Joanne A; Kwok, William W; Turner, Ronald B; Woodfolk, Judith A; Irish, Jonathan M",,309,16

Le nombre total de décès déclarés reste faible. En septembre 2020, on dénombrait 1532 cas et 81 décès sur la ville de Bamako, dont 466 cas et 27 décès dans la commune VI. Cette étude évalue la proportion de la population ayant été infectée par le SARS-CoV-2 à Bamako et la compare aux données rapportées afin d’éclairer l’épidémie de COVID-19 au Mali. Matériels et méthodes L’étude a eu lieu dans 3 quartiers de la commune VI de Bamako. Un échantillonnage stratifié par quartiers et secteurs a permis de tirer au sort des concessions, dans lesquelles tous les ménages acceptant de participer ont été inclus. Les participants ont été inclus à leur domicile, répondu à un questionnaire et fourni un échantillon sanguin. Les anticorps IgM et IgG contre la protéine Spike du SARS-CoV-2 ont été détectés par ELISA. La séroprévalence et l’intervalle de confiance à 95 % (IC95 %) ont été calculés pour la commune VI, par quartier, par classe d’âge. Le nombre total d’infections survenues à Bamako a été estimé en appliquant les taux de séroprévalence mesurés par âge et par sexe à la population de Bamako (données de recensement de 2009 actualisées en 2017). Le nombre de décès attendus a été calculé en appliquant aux infections estimées les taux de mortalité par classe d’âge observés en Chine durant la phase précoce de l’épidémie (alors que la prise en charge n’avait pas été optimisée). Résultats Du 16 au 29 septembre 2020, 1526 participants ont été inclus et 1367 résultats valides de sérologie obtenus. La séroprévalence brute s’élevait à 16,5 % (225/1367, IC95 %=14,5–18,5 %). La prévalence était similaire entre les 3 quartiers (Chi2, p=0,91). Une tendance non significative à l’augmentation avec l’âge a été observée. En tenant compte de la distribution par âge et par sexe de l’échantillon par rapport à celle de la population, la prévalence en population générale était estimée à 15,8 %, soit plus de 380 000 infections pour 2,4 millions d’habitants. Le nombre attendu de décès liés à la COVID-19 serait inférieur à 1500 entre mars et septembre 2020 à Bamako. Conclusion Cette étude transversale suggère une propagation lente mais généralisée du SARS-CoV-2 durant les 6 premiers mois de la pandémie à Bamako.

Based on an extended version of the protection motivation theory, this study examined the role of perceived risks to oneself and to others, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and perceived social norms for intentions to and the endorsement of several protective behaviours and alternative behaviours known to be ineffective. Further, it was hypothesised that effects of risk perceptions depended on high levels of self-efficacy. DESIGN: Data were collected by telephone at the beginning of the lockdown in Switzerland with a large sample (N = 1,009) representative of the adult Swiss population. METHODS: All predictors (self-efficacy, response efficacy, perceived social norms, intentions) but risk perceptions were assessed for hygiene behaviours, social distancing, adherence to recommended behaviours in case of symptoms, and alternative measures known to be ineffective. RESULTS: Across all analyses of intentions for and endorsement of protective and alternative behaviours, response efficacy and self-efficacy emerged as the most important predictors. Social norms were mainly related to intentions, but not to behaviours. The different risk perceptions were rarely and inconsistently related to intentions and behaviours. No consistent pattern of interactions between self-efficacy and risk perceptions emerged. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that even in the face of a pandemic of an unknown virus, the resources (self-efficacy, response efficacy) rather than the risk perceptions have the potential to promote protective behaviours.","Scholz, Urte; Freund, Alexandra M",Br. j. health psychol,309,10

To determine the differences in states of mind between people in the central area and people in other areas, we investigated the changes in their “daily lives” including matters related to school;playing outside;associating with other children;“communication” including communication with family and friends;and the “use of information technologies” that secure communication. Moreover, we explored households that are satisfied even when they are unable to go out and clarified how children and their parents who live in the central area perceive the current situation. The study results indicate that the risks of COVID-19 in large cities have spatial characteristics and increase the burden on households raising children. Particularly in the central area, which has a high population density, the changes children experience are striking. Furthermore, due to the inadequate amount of open space, a strong awareness of the “new normal (avoiding the ‘Three Cs’ (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings)” is required.","Tomikawa, Shun Niwa Yukari Lim Hwajin Kida Maiko",Journal of Urban Management,309,6

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34+4 weeks pregnant (G4P1A2) lady was admitted to one of our satellite hospitals with one-week history of severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided facial numbness. At presentation, she had sudden decreased level of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) equal to 4, and bilateral fixed pupils. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles with 2.5cm sized round hemorrhagic lesion at the right posterior thalamic region. After medical stabilization and placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD), the patient was referred for neurosurgical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cavernous hemangioma adjacent to the right posterior wall of the third ventricle. After cesarean section and anterior interhemispheric trans-callosal approach, the mass was removed totally. However, on third postoperative day, she experienced mild hypoxia and dyspnea with fever. Chest CT-scan of the patient showed bilateral consolidation. Thereafter, COVID-19 was confirmed subsequently with positive nasopharyngeal swab testing for RT-PCR. The patient was treated as COVID-19 infection and symptoms improved on day 10 of the treatment and completely recovered.

RECENT FINDINGS: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women as measured by rates of admission to intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and morbidities including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolic and other thrombotic events, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and preterm birth. The risk of transmission from mother-to-infant is relatively low (1.5-5%) as quantitated by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infants appear to be at higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the mother has tested positive within 1 week of delivery or is herself symptomatic at the time of maternity admission. The rate of positivity is not higher in infants who room in with the mother compared to infants who are initially separated and cared for in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment. Infants who test positive in the hospital have no or mild signs of disease, most of which may be attributable to prematurity, and rarely require readmission for clinical signs consistent with COVID-19. SUMMARY: Pregnant women should take precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 can receive normal neonatal care in-hospital with their mothers if mother and staff adhere to recommended infection control practices.","Hudak, Mark L",Curr Opin Pediatr,309,14

In the Netherlands, the national screening programs, including for breast cancer, were halted temporarily. This posed a challenge to breast cancer care, because â¼40% of cases are detected through national screening. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with breast cancer in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of COVID-19 on patients with breast cancer who had undergone surgery from March 9 to May 17, 2020. The primary endpoints were the number of surgical procedures performed during the study period, tumor characteristics, surgery type, and route of referral. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 217 consecutive patients with breast cancer requiring surgery were included. We found an overall decrease in the number of patients with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. The most significant decline was seen in surgery for T1-T2 and N0 tumors. A decline in the number of referrals from both the national screening program and general practitioners was observed. The incidence of postoperative complications remained stable during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The temporary halt of the national screening program for breast cancer resulted in fewer surgical procedures during the study period and a pronounced decrease in surgery of the lower tumor stages.","Filipe, Mando D; van Deukeren, Désirée; Kip, Marijn; Doeksen, Annemiek; Pronk, Apollo; Verheijen, Paul M; Heikens, Joost T; Witkamp, Arjen J; Richir, Milan C",,309,15

This engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety levels, and knowledge, as well as by historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses, and cultural factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures. RESULTS: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed. Perceived severity of symptoms differed by setting, with weighted percentages of 96.8% for Hong Kong (1621/1663) and 19.9% for the United Kingdom (366/1768). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channels-and trust should be maintained-while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","Bowman, Leigh; Kwok, Kin On; Redd, Rozlyn; Yi, Yuanyuan; Ward, Helen; Wei, Wan In; Atchison, Christina; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",J Med Internet Res,309,16

The most recent addition to techniques for epilepsy surgery is minimally invasive thermal therapy. Significant advances in imaging technology and thermal ablation have opened a novel avenue for epilepsy treatment, permitting surgical intervention with seizure-freedom rates approaching the success of traditional methods but with reduced invasiveness, blood loss and duration of postoperative hospital stay. Here, we review recent advances on stereotactic ablation techniques focused on epilepsy surgery. Finally, we present emerging navigation techniques, which allow a higher degree of freedom. The described technologies render precise navigation of the ablation probe to avoid critical structures along the trajectory path and open novel pathways to further minimize invasiveness and improve safety and efficacy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data regarding acute stroke patients presenting at 5 Campania stroke hubs, before and after the issue of lockdown in Italy on March 9th, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown, we observed a significant reduction in the number of acute reperfusion treatments in stroke (P for interact 0.001); however the global number of patients presenting with acute stroke did not significantly differ. The time to reach medical attention was significantly longer in the lockdown phase (230 versus 154 min, P 0.016).

We surveyed 536 anaesthetic junior doctors who applied for ST3 posts during this application round with the aim of investigating their experience of the recruitment process this year (response rate 536/1,056 = 51%). Approximately 61% were not offered ST3 posts (n = 326), a similar proportion to that previously reported. We asked all respondents what their potential career plans were for the next 12 to 24 months. The majority expressed intentions to take up either CT3 top-up posts or non-training fellow posts from August 2021 (79%). Other options considered by respondents included: pursuing work abroad (17%), embarking on a career break (16%), taking up an ST3 post in intensive care medicine instead of anaesthetics (15%) and permanently leaving the medical profession (9%). A number of respondents expressed a desire to pursue training in a different medical specialty (9%). Some respondents expressed an intention to pursue further education or research (10%). A large proportion of respondents (42%) expressed a lack of confidence in being able to achieve the necessary training requirements to later apply for ST4 in August 2023. The majority of respondents reported not feeling confident in achieving GMC Specialty Registration in Anaesthesia in the future without a training number (75%), and that their wider life plans have been disrupted due to the impending time out of training (78%). We received a total of 384 free-text responses to a question asking about general concerns regarding the ST3 applications process. Sentiment analysis of these free-text responses indicated that respondents felt generally negatively about the ST3 recruitment process. Some themes that were elicited from the responses included: respondents feeling the recruitment process lacked fairness, respondents suffering burnout and negative impacts on their wellbeing, difficulties in making plans for their personal lives, and feeling undervalued and abandoned despite having made personal sacrifices to support the health service during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that junior anaesthetic doctors in the UK currently have a negative perception towards postgraduate training structures, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to the postgraduate training curriculum and difficulties in securing higher training posts.","Durrant, Fionnuala; Edwardson, Stuart; El-Ghazali, Sally; Holt, Christopher; McCrossan, Roopa; Pramanik, Ileena; Subramaniam, Jeevakan; Wong, Danny Jon Nian",,309,24

An interesting debate concerning the potential relationship between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently been opened in the case of prostate cancer (PC), and the aim of this multi-centre cohort study was to investigate the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostrate cancer (mCRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with mCRPC who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and recorded their baseline clinical characteristics, their history of PC and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their oncological status and treatment at the time of infection. The primary study end point was the death rate and the possible impact of the patients' PC-related history and treatments on mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-four of the 1433 patients with mCRPC attending the participating centres (2.3%) developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 22 (64.7%) of whom were hospitalised. Most of the patients were symptomatic, the most frequent symptoms being fever (70.6%), dyspnoea (61.8%), cough (52.9%) and fatigue (38.2%). After a median follow-up of 21 days (interquartile range: 13-41), 13 patients had died (38.2%), 17 recovered (50.0%) and four (11.7%) were still infected. The number of treatments previously administered for mCRPC had a significant impact on mortality (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute additional data to the current debate concerning the postulated protective role of ADT, which seems to be less in patients with metastatic PC.","Caffo, Orazio; Gasparro, Donatello; Di Lorenzo, Giuseppe; Volta, Alberto Dalla; Guglielmini, Pamela; Zucali, Paolo; Bortolus, Roberto; Cavo, Alessia; Ceresoli, Giovanni; Chiari, Rita; Fornarini, Giuseppe; Fratino, Lucia; Iaculli, Alessandro; Maruzzo, Marco; Masini, Cristina; Morelli, Franco; Mucciarini, Claudia; Procopio, Giuseppe; Sabbatini, Roberto; Verri, Elena; Kinspergher, Stefania; Maines, Francesca; Messina, Carlo; Veccia, Antonello; Donini, Maddalena",Eur J Cancer,309,24

METHODS: A total of 60,199 residents in China were surveyed via an internet-based survey containing a general questionnaire, such as the self-rating depression scale, the state anxiety inventory, and the negative cognitive processing bias questionnaire. An ordered multiple logistic regression analysis model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey revealed mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms in 62.65, 11.33, and 6.14% participants, respectively, and mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms in 33.21, 41.27, and 22.99% participants, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that factors, such as female gender, being older than 55 years, high school education level, medical staff, marital conflicts, negative attention bias, rumination, and death growth rate, positively affected depression and anxiety symptoms. The good family functionality, democratic working atmosphere, and a myriad of social activities negatively affected the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chinese residents exhibited a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the epidemic. Thus, psychological interventions should focus on the vulnerable groups, and cognitive training should focus on reducing the negative cognitive processing bias. This might be an effective way to alleviate the mental stress of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jiang, Wen; Liu, Xuerong; Zhang, Jingxuan; Feng, Zhengzhi",BMC Psychiatry,309,16

However, it is time-consuming and costly given that cells or animals are employed for activity confirmation, which leads to a large amount of waste being produced if the result is negative. Stepwise frontal analysis is employed to saturate the affinity stationary phase, by using a series of low- to high-concentration solutions which resultantly form a staircase pattern. In doing so, the waste of samples, caused by the balancing process, can be avoided. In this study, stepwise frontal analysis coupled with a CMC system was performed for screening and characterizing the affinity of an active compound from wuweizi. Schizandrin A was screened and identified by &#945;1A AR /CMC coupled with UHPLC-MS/MS. By comparing the values obtained with those related to the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) calculated by zonal elution, the accuracy of the stepwise frontal analysis was verified. Subsequently, the type of affinity force between Schizandrin A and &#945;1A AR was studied by thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, schizandrin A showed an antagonistic effect on phenylephrine-induced contractions, which relax prostate muscle strips in a non-competitive antagonism manner. It has already suggested that the active compound, schizandrin A, could be used as a lead compound for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and should be further studied.

MethodsA cross-sectional Internet monitoring survey was performed between December 22 and 26, 2020. Data from 9,510 (5,392 males and 4,118 females) participants needing regular treatment or hospital visits were analyzed. We determined the age-sex- and multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of treatment interruption associated with various indices of infection level by nesting multilevel logistic models in prefecture of residence. In the multivariate model, sex, age, marital status, job type, equivalent household income, education, self-rated health, and anxiety were adjusted. ResultsThe ORs of treatment interruption for the lowest versus highest levels of infection were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.09-1.59) for the overall incidence rate (per 1,000 population), 1.34 (95% CI: 1.10-1.63) for the overall number of people infected, 1.28 (95% CI: 1.06-1.54) for the monthly incidence rate (per 1,000 population), and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.14-1.67) for the number of people infected per month. For each index of infection level, higher infection was linked to more workers experiencing treatment interruption. ConclusionHigher local infection levels were linked to more workers experiencing treatment interruption. Our results suggest that apart from individual characteristics such as socioeconomic and health status, treatment interruptions during the pandemic were also subject to contextual effects related to regional infection levels. Preventing community spread of COVID-19 may thus protect individuals from indirect effects of the pandemic, such as treatment interruption.","Akashi, Jun; HIno, Ayako; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Nagata, Tomohisa; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Kataoka, Masaharu; Fujino, Yoshihisa",,309,16

We aim to further evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (AIDs). METHODS: We included all confirmed inpatients with COVID-19 and systemic AIDs in Wuhan Tongji Hospital from 29 January to 8 March 2020. We retrospectively collected and analysed information on epidemiology of 1255 inpatients and additional clinical characteristics of patients with systemic AIDs. Outcomes were followed up until 16 April 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1255 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 64.0 years and 53.1% were male. More than half (63.0%) had chronic comorbidities. The proportions of elderly, male and patients with comorbidities were significantly higher in intensive care unit (ICU) than in the general ward (p<0.001). 17 (0.61%) patients with systemic AIDs were further screened and analysed from 2804 inpatients. The median age was 64.0 years and 82.4% were female. All patients were living in Wuhan and two family clusters were found. 1 (5.9%) patient was admitted to ICU and one died. 10 (62.5%) of 16 patients changed or stopped their anti-AIDs treatments during hospitalisation, and 5 of them felt that the disease had worsened after the quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Older males with chronic comorbidities are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. The lower proportion of COVID-19 in patients with systemic AIDs needs more high-quality human clinical trials and in-depth mechanism researches.

Therefore, understanding their clinical evolution beyond hospital discharge is essential not only from an individual standpoint, but from a populational level. OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 3 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, we screened for anxiety and depression and assessed important clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study performed in Sao Paulo (Brazil), in which participants were contacted by telephone to answer a short survey. EQ-5D-3L was used to assess HRQoL and clinical data from patients' index admission were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: We contacted 251 participants (59.8% males, mean age 53 years old), 69.7% of which had presented with severe COVID-19. At 3 months of follow-up, 6 patients had died, 51 (20.3%) had visited the emergency department again and 17 (6.8%) had been readmitted to hospital. Seventy patients (27.9%) persisted with increased dyspnoea and 81 had a positive screening for anxiety/depression. Similarly, patients reported an overall worsening of EQ-5D-3L single summary index at 3 months compared to before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (0.8012 (0.7368 - 1.0) vs. 1.0(0.7368 - 1.0), p < 0.001). This affected all 5 domains, but especially pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Only female sex and intensive care requirement were independently associated with worsening of HRQoL.

The use of the pulmonary surfactant seems to be promising as an additional therapy for the treatment of ARDS. COVID-19 causes lung damage and ARDS, so beneficial effects of surfactant therapy in COVID-19-associated ARDS patients are conceivable, especially when applied early in the treatment strategy against pulmonary failure. Because of the robust anti-inflammatory and lung protective efficacy and the current urgent need for lung-supportive therapy, the exogenous pulmonary surfactant could be a valid supportive treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia patients in intensive care units in addition to the current standard of ARDS treatment.","Cattel, Francesco; Giordano, Susanna; Bertiond, Cecilia; Lupia, Tommaso; Corcione, Silvia; Scaldaferri, Matilde; Angelone, Lorenzo; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,309,1

The most common disorders among the participants were found to be skin dryness (76.3%), obsession (42.2%), skin itching (41.2%), coughing (41.1%), and eyes irritation (39.5%). The mean frequency of hand washing and hand disinfecting were 15.28 and 10.74 times per a day, respectively, and the clean-up in case of surfaces was 2.99 times a day. The frequency of hand washing and disinfecting in women group (16.4 and 11.2 times a day) were higher than in men (14.0 and 10.3 times a day) group. In addition, these self-care actions in married people (15.6 and 11.0 times a day) were higher compared to those in single people (14.0 and 10.6 times a day). Conclusion: Being unaware of participants with instruction for preparation and use disinfectants may harm their health. Therefore, it is suggested that the authorities provide the necessary training program for public through official media.","Dindarloo, Kavoos; Aghamolaei, Teamur; Ghanbarnejad, Amin; Turki, Habibollah; Hoseinvandtabar, Sommayeh; Pasalari, Hasan; Ghaffari, Hamid Reza",J Environ Health Sci Eng,309,16

The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers. METHODS: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70 % of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level &#8805; 6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis. One in three subjects had anxiety symptoms and one in five subjects had depressive symptoms.","Guerraoui, Abdallah; Idier, Laetitia; Hallonet, Patrick; Dolley-Hitze, Thibault; Gosselin, Morgane; Duneau, Gabrielle; Vendrely, Benoît; Hirigoyen, Marie-Dorothée; Azzouz, Lynda; Bouillier, Marc; Pelletier, Solenne; Fouque, Denis; Fessi, Hafedh; De-Precigout, Valérie; Vigneau, Cécile; Kolko, Anne; Pinçon, Émilie; Duquennoy, Simon; Delezire, Arnaud; Chantrel, François; Combe, Christian; Chauveau, Philippe; Caillette-Beaudoin, Agnès; Lasseur, Catherine; Prézelin-Reydit, Mathilde",Nephrol. ther,309,28

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 1612 unselected patients attending a Danish ED, with 100% follow-up for 90 days after presentation. RESULTS: The 765 (47%) ED patients with an elevated D-dimer level (ie, &#8805; 0.5 mg/L) were more likely to be admitted to hospital (p <.0001), re-present to health services (pâ¯=â¯.02), and die within 90 days (8.1% of patients, p <.0001). Only 10 patients with a normal D-dimer level (1.2%) died within 90 days. Five had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infection, and 5 had cancer (4 of whom also had infection). Venous thromboembolism, infection, neoplasia, anemia, heart failure, and unspecified soft tissue disorders were significantly associated with an elevated D-dimer level. Of the 72 patients with venous thromboembolism, 20 also had infection, 8 had cancer, and 4 had anemia. None of the patients with heart failure, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction with a normal D-dimer level died within 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, nearly half of all patients attending the ED had an elevated D-dimer level, and these patients were more likely to be admitted to hospital and to re-present to health services or die within 90 days. In this unselected ED patient population, elevated D-dimer levels were found to not only be significantly associated with venous thromboembolism, but to also be associated with infection, cancer, heart failure, and anemia.","Nickel, Christian H; Kellett, John; Cooksley, Tim; Lyngholm, Le E; Chang, Simon; Imfeld, Stephan; Bingisser, Roland; Brabrand, Mikkel",Am. j. med,309,22

All patients underwent initial and follow-up CT after admission during the treatment, and were divided into 2 groups. Group A and B were composed of 15 patients with a history of exposure to the original district (Wuhan, China) in short-term (i.e., imported infection), and 7 with a close contact with the patients with confirmed COVID-19 or with the healthy individuals from the original district (i.e., second-generation infection), respectively. Initial CT features including extent score and density score between groups were statistically compared. We found that all patients in group A and 3 of 7 patients in group B had abnormal CT findings while 4 of 7 patients in group B had not. Patients with abnormal CT findings were more frequent in group A than in group B (Pâ<â.05). On initial CT, pure ground glass opacity (GGO), and GGO with consolidation and/or other abnormalities were found in 20% (3/15) and 80% (12/15) patients in group A, respectively, while 1 (14.3%), 2 (28.6%), and 4 (57.1%) had pure GGOs, GGO with focal consolidation, and normal CT appearances in Group B, respectively. Patients with extent and density scores of &#8805;5 were more frequent in group A than in group B (all P-valuesâ<â.01). Additionally, 3 of 4 (75%) patients with normal initial CT findings had focal pure GGO lesions on follow-up. In conclusion, COVID-19 in patients with a history of exposure to the original district can be severer than with the second-generation infection on CT.","Wu, Yu-Ping; Cao, Jin-Ming; Chen, Tian-Wu; Li, Rui; Liu, Feng-Jun; Zeng, Yue; Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Mu, Qi-Wen; Li, Hong-Jun",Medicine (Baltimore),309,10

It enables the public health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases from the population, thereby limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people. However, despite the significance of testing in epidemic control, the recent literature on the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this paper, an epidemic model is proposed that incorporates the testing rate as a control input and differentiates the undetected infected from the detected infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading process in the population. After estimating the model on the data corresponding to the beginning phase of COVID-19 in France, two testing policies are proposed: the so-called best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a minimum testing rate that stops the growth of the epidemic when implemented. The COST policy, on the other hand, is a mitigation strategy that provides an optimal value of testing rate minimizing the peak value of the infected population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths for the COVID-19 case of France.","Niazi, Muhammad Umar B.; Kibangou, Alain; Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos; Nikitin, Denis; Tumash, Liudmila; Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre",,309,1

In the absence of specific vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, medicines that may assist in tackling the emergency and limiting the high number of fatalities are urgently needed. The repositioning of available drugs to treat COVID-19 is the only and rapid option in the face of the lack of direct antiviral agents and vaccines available. In this light it is important to focus on available drugs, which, based on their pharmacodynamics, could plausibly attenuate viral growth as well as COVID-19’s worst complications. This is the case of chloroquine and tocilizumab which seem to limit virus replication and the severity of interstitial pneumonia, respectively. However, these treatments, particularly those aimed at containing inflammation, are still reserved for the most severe cases. This commentary elaborates on the pharmacological rationale of repositioning the mast cell stabilizer chromones as an adjunctive treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and proposes their practical clinical testing as an early, safe, and cost-effective anti-inflammatory intervention in COVID-19 to limit the eventual secondary progression toward life-threatening respiratory complications.","Sestili, Piero; Stocchi, Vilberto",Front.

COVID-19 often affects patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, and may trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and acute heart failure (AHF). However, as COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infectious disease, there remain substantial uncertainty and controversy whether and how cardiovascular biomarkers should be used in patients with suspected COVID-19. To help clinicians understand the possible value as well as the most appropriate interpretation of cardiovascular biomarkers in COVID-19, it is important to highlight that recent findings regarding the prognostic role of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are similar to those obtained in studies for pneumonia and ARDS in general. Cardiovascular biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes involved in COVID-19/pneumonia and its complications have a role evaluating disease severity, cardiac involvement, and risk of death in COVID-19 as well as in pneumonias caused by other pathogens. First, cardiomyocyte injury, as quantified by cardiac troponin concentrations, and haemodynamic cardiac stress, as quantified by natriuretic peptide concentrations, may occur in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. The level of those biomarkers correlates with disease severity and mortality. Interpretation of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptide concentrations as quantitative variables may aid in risk stratification in COVID-19/pneumonia and also will ensure that these biomarkers maintain high diagnostic accuracy for AMI and AHF. Second, activated coagulation as quantified by D-dimers seems more prominent in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. Due to the central role of endothelitis and VTE in COVID-19, serial measurements of D-dimers may help physicians in the selection of patients for VTE imaging and the intensification of the level of anticoagulation from prophylactic to slightly higher or even therapeutic doses.","Mueller, Christian; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Jaffe, Allan S; Huber, Kurt; Mair, Johannes; Cullen, Louise; Hammarsten, Ola; Mills, Nicholas L; Möckel, Martin; Krychtiuk, Konstantin; Thygesen, Kristian; Lindahl, Bertil",European heart journal.

The outbreak of this virus (SARS-CoV-2) is strongly compromising worldwide healthcare systems, social behavior, and everyone's lives. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 and isolation of positive cases has proven to be fundamental in containing the spread of the infection. Even though the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the urgent demand for rapid and wide-scale diagnosis precipitated the development of alternative diagnostic approaches. The millions of tests performed every day worldwide are still insufficient to achieve the desired goal, that of screening the population during daily life. Probably the most appealing approach to consistently monitor COVID-19 spread is the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from exhaled breath. For instance, the challenging incorporation of reliable, highly sensitive, and cost-efficient detection methods in masks could represent a breakthrough in the development of portable and noninvasive point-of-care diagnosis for COVID-19.

We examined the ability of existing information to help families feel better prepared for surgery at the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) and evaluated the best way to enhance its content and accessibility. We developed an online survey for families who have had surgery at ACH. Participants were recruited through pre-existing patient networks and from the ACH Short Stay Unit (SSU) between October 2018 and October 2019. The survey asked participants to evaluate the information available to prepare them for surgery and requested suggestions for improvement. Our survey results show that those who completed the in-person Surgery 101 program felt significantly more prepared for surgery. Of those who did not attend; 40% would have been interested in participating but were unaware that the program existed; and 17% planned to attend but were unable to; due to work or travel distance. Participants felt additional resources via online content or paper handouts would be most valuable. We used this information to prepare an online accessible summary of the Surgery 101 program and tour in the form of a video to reach more Albertan families preparing for surgery for their children.,"Newell, Christopher; Leduc-Pessah, Heather; Bell-Graham, Lisa; Rasic, Nivez; Carter, Kerryn",,309,15

Exposure to various environmental factors increases the risk of exacerbations. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed and assessed literature published within the last 10 years to include epidemiological evidence on the relationships between air pollution, temperature and COPD exacerbation risk as well as the implications of extreme weather events on exacerbations. EXPERT OPINION: Ongoing climate change is expected to increase air pollution levels, global temperature and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, all of which are associated with COPD exacerbations. Further research is needed using patient-focused methodological approaches to better understand and quantify these relationships, so that effective mitigation strategies that decrease the risk of exacerbations can be developed.","Gayle, Alicia V; Quint, Jennifer K; Fuertes, Elaine I",Expert Rev Respir Med,309,15

Social distancing, cancellation of elective cases, and staff re-deployment have compromised clinical and academic teaching. We describe the neurosurgical experience at Emory University during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of COVID-19-related policies on resident experience. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all neurosurgical cases performed at Emory University Hospital between March 16, the day cancellation of elective cases was effective, and April 15, 2020, and the same period in the preceding 3 years. For the study period, we collected the number of cases and their distribution by subspecialty along with total hospital charges. RESULTS: Compared with an average of 606 cases performed during the study period over the past 3 years, only 145 neurosurgical cases were performed between March 16 and April 15, 2020, which corresponds to an 80% reduction in case volume and 66% decrease in hospital revenue in 2020. When divided by subspecialty, the most significant reduction was observed in functional (84%; P < 0.01) followed by spine (78%; P < 0.01) surgery, although all subspecialties were significantly impacted. Assessing junior resident experience, we observed a significant reduction in number of neurosurgical admissions (47%; P < 0.01) and bedside procedures (59%; P < 0.01) in the study period in 2020 compared with the past 3 years, with no significant reduction in number of consultations (17%; P > 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Even at academic centers that were not hugely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, prophylactic and preparedness measures still exhibited an unprecedented toll on neurosurgical resident and fellow experience.","Saad, Hassan; Alawieh, Ali; Oyesiku, Nelson; Barrow, Daniel L; Olson, Jeffrey",World Neurosurg,309,16

It was first identified in Wuhan City in China in December 2019. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the top 15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next 2 months. METHODS: The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. The spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents. The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The advanced ARIMA model was used for predicting future data based on time series data. The ARIMA model provides a weight to past values and error values to correct the model prediction, so it is better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. RESULTS: The top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model. The identified top 15 countries with cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 were compared. The United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, and a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy. There was a high death rate ratio in Italy and the United Kingdom and a lower death rate ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value is represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence interval values. The validation of the ARIMA model was done using the Akaike information criterion value; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were rose faster when compared to confirmed cases over the next 2 months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in the United States, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

In this study, web-based traffic information covering the Greater Taipei Area was obtained using a vision-based traffic analysis system. Web-based traffic data were normalized and applied to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to study the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in the Greater Taipei Area. According to an analysis of the obtained traffic data, sedans were the most common vehicles in the Greater Taipei Area, followed by motorcycles. Moderate traffic conditions with an average speed of 30-50 km/h were most prominent during weekdays, whereas traffic flow with an average speed of 50-70 km/h was most common during weekends. The proportion of traffic flows in free-flow conditions (>70 km/h) was higher on weekends than on weekdays. Two peaks of traffic flow were observed during the morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays. On the weekends, this morning peak was not observed, and the variation in vehicle numbers was lower than on weekdays. The simulation results suggested that the addition of real-time traffic data improved the CMAQ model's performance, especially for the carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. According to sensitivity tests for total and vehicle emissions in the Greater Taipei Area, vehicle emissions contributed to >90% of CO, 80% of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and approximately 50% of PM2.5 in the downtown areas of Taipei. The vehicle emissions contribution was affected by both vehicle emissions and meteorological conditions. The connection between the surveillance camera data, vehicle emissions, and regional air quality models in this study can also be used to explore the impact of special events (e.g., long weekends and COVID-19 lockdowns) on air quality.","Tsai, I-Chun; Lee, Chen-Ying; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice; Su, Chih-Wen",Sci Total Environ,309,1

Hospitalization rate of the patients was 56.6% and intensive care unit admission rate was 11.4%. 77 (5.1%) patients died within 30 days of diagnosis. The first multivariate model which included only the demographic and clinical characteristics showed older age, male gender, and presence of diabetes and receipt of cytotoxic therapy to be associated with increased 30-day mortality, while breast and prostate cancer diagnoses were associated with lower 30-day mortality. In the second set, we further included laboratory parameters. The presence of leukocytosis (OR 6.7, 95 % CI 3.3-13.7, p<0,001), lymphocytopenia (OR 3,1, 95 % CI 1,6-6,1, p=0,001) and thrombocytopenia (OR 3,4 95% CI 1,5-8,1, p=0,005) were found to be associated with increased 30-day mortality. Relatively lower mortality compared with Western countries and China mainly results from differences in baseline risk factors but may also implicate the importance of intensive supportive care.

METHODS: Prospective multicenter cohort study (N = 578, 1 February 2018-20 April 2019) and recontacted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. Health-care professionals participated in May 2020. Association of personality traits and clinical factors with acceptance was assessed with multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, videoconference was more accepted than telephone-based visits (28% vs. 16% pretest, 30% vs. 19% post-test). Predictors for telephone visits were age (pretest, odds ratio [OR] 10-year increment = 0.79; post-test OR 10Y = 0.78); disclosure of panel testing (OR = 0.60), positive results (OR = 0.52), low conscientiousness group (OR = 2.87), and post-test level of uncertainty (OR = 0.93). Predictors for videoconference were age (pretest, OR 10Y = 0.73; post-test, OR 10Y = 0.75), educational level (pretest: OR = 1.61), low neuroticism (pretest, OR = 1.72), and post-test level of uncertainty (OR = 0.96). Patients' reported acceptance for non-in-person visits after COVID-19 increased to 92% for the pretest and 85% for the post-test. Health-care professionals only preferred non-in-person visits for disclosure of negative results (83%).

Looking for safe vaccines that evoke protective maternal and fetal antibody response is important. MethodsWe searched from registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Clinical Trial Registry, and the EU Clinical Trial Registry) and databases (MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Proquest, and Springer) up until June 20, 2021. Articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after duplicates were removed. Infection rate, maternal antibody response, placental antibody transfer, and adverse events were described. This systematic review was performed with quality assessment and semi-quantitative synthesis according to PRISMA guidelines. ResultsTwelve observational studies with a total of 40.509 pregnant women included. The mRNA based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infections (p=0.0004). Both vaccines did not affect pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. The most commonly encountered adverse reactions are injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache but only transient. Antibody responses were rapid after the prime dose of vaccines. After booster, antibody responses were higher and associated with better placental antibody transfer. Longer intervals between first vaccination dose and delivery were also associated with higher antibody fetal IgG and better antibody transfer ratio. ConclusionsThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are efficacious for preventing future SARS-CoV-2 infections. These vaccines can be considered as a safe option for pregnancy and their fetus. Two doses of vaccines were recommended for more robust maternal and fetal antibody responses. Longer latency was associated with higher fetal antibody responses.

In the emergency department (ED), patients who need supplemental oxygen or respiratory support are admitted to the hospital, but the course of normoxic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In our health system, the policy during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was to admit all patients with abnormal chest imaging (CXR) regardless of their oxygen level. We also admitted febrile patients with respiratory complaints who resided in congregate living. We describe the rate of decompensation among patients admitted with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection but who were not hypoxemic in the ED. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to our health system between March 1-May 5, 2020 with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We queried our registry to find patients who were admitted to the hospital but had no recorded oxygen saturation of <92% in the ED and received no supplemental oxygen prior to admission. Our primary outcome was decompensation at 72 hours, defined by the need for respiratory support (oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or intubation). RESULTS: A total of 840 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those patients, 376 (45%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty patients (7.1%) with suspected COVID-19 required respiratory support at 72 hours including 27 (3%) of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Among the 376 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 54 patients (14%) had normal CXR in the ED. One-third of patients with normal CXRs decompensated at 72 hours. Seven SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in our cohort died during their hospitalization, of whom five had normal CXRs on admission. CONCLUSION: Sixty (7.1%) of suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 72 hours required respiratory support despite being normoxic in the ED. Further research should look to identify the normoxic SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk for decompensation.","Schreyer, Kraftin E; Isenberg, Derek L; Satz, Wayne A; Lucas, Nicole V; Rosenbaum, Jennifer; Zandrow, Gregory; Gentile, Nina T",West J Emerg Med,309,1

The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) is a theoretically driven instrument developed for this purpose. The SCHFI measures self-care with three scales: self-care maintenance, measuring behaviors to maintain HF stability; symptom perception, measuring monitoring behaviors; and self-care management, assessing the response to symptoms. After the theory underpinning the SCHFI was updated, the instrument was updated to version 7.2 but it was only tested in the United States. In this study we tested the psychometric characteristics (structural and construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability) of the SCHFI v.7.2 in an Italian population of HF patients. We used a cross-sectional design to study 280 HF patients with additional data collected after 2 weeks for test-retest reliability. Adults with HF (mean age 75.6 (±10.8); 70.8% in New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) were enrolled from six centers across Italy. Confirmatory factor analysis showed supportive structural validity in the three SCHFI v.7.2 scales (CFI from 0.94 to 0.95; RMSEA from 0.05 to 0.07). Internal consistency reliability estimated with Cronbach's &#945; and composite reliability ranged between .73 and .88; test-retest reliability ranged between 0.73 and 0.92. Construct validity was supported with significant correlations between the SCHFI v.7.2 scale scores and quality of life, brain natriuretic peptide levels and NYHA class. This study further supports the psychometric characteristics of the SCHFI v.7.2, illustrating that it can be used in clinical practice and research also in an Italian population.","Vellone, Ercole; De Maria, Maddalena; Iovino, Paolo; Barbaranelli, Claudio; Zeffiro, Valentina; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Durante, Angela; Alvaro, Rosaria; Riegel, Barbara",Res Nurs Health,309,16

However, this group was not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, and limited postauthorization vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are available for this critical population (3). It is not known how well COVID-19 vaccines protect SNF residents, who typically are more medically frail, are older, and have more underlying medical conditions than the general population (1). In addition, immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be lower in adults aged 65-85 years than in younger adults (4). Through the CDC Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, SNF residents and staff members in Connecticut began receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (5). Administration of the vaccine was conducted during several on-site pharmacy clinics. In late January 2021, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) identified two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents and staff members that occurred after each facility's first vaccination clinic. CT DPH, in partnership with CDC, performed electronic chart review in these facilities to obtain information on resident vaccination status and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Partial vaccination, defined as the period from >14 days after the first dose through 7 days after the second dose, had an estimated effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33%-79%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) among residents within these SNFs. This is similar to estimated effectiveness for a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adults across a range of age groups in noncongregate settings (6) and suggests that to optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series should be recommended for SNF residents and staff members.","Britton, Amadea; Jacobs Slifka, Kara M; Edens, Chris; Nanduri, Srinivas Acharya; Bart, Stephen M; Shang, Nong; Harizaj, Adora; Armstrong, Jillian; Xu, Kerui; Ehrlich, Hanna Y; Soda, Elizabeth; Derado, Gordana; Verani, Jennifer R; Schrag, Stephanie J; Jernigan, John A; Leung, Vivian H; Parikh, Sunil",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,309,7

We developed and tested a highly sensitive and robust assay based on reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) that uses readily available reagents and a simple heat block using contrived spike-in and actual clinical samples. RT-LAMP testing on RNA-spiked samples showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/µl of viral transport media. RT-LAMP testing directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media had an 85% positive percentage agreement (PPA) (17/20), and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPV) and delivered results in 30 min. Our optimized RT-LAMP based testing method is a scalable system that is sufficiently sensitive and robust to test for SARS-CoV-2 directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media in 30 min at the point of care without the need for specialized or proprietary equipment or reagents. This cost-effective and efficient one-step testing method can be readily available for COVID-19 testing world-wide, especially in resource poor settings.","Wei, Shan; Kohl, Esther; Djandji, Alexandre; Morgan, Stephanie; Whittier, Susan; Mansukhani, Mahesh; Hod, Eldad; D039,; Alton, Mary; Suh, Yousin; Williams, Zev",Sci Rep,309,16

This process is orchestrated by valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ ATPase that extracts polyubiquinated chromatin proteins and facilitates their turnover. However, because of the essential and pleiotropic effects of VCP in global proteostasis, it remains challenging practically to understand and target its DDR-specific functions. We describe a DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation event (Ser784), which selectively enhances chromatin-associated protein degradation mediated by VCP and is required for DNA repair, signaling, and cell survival. These functional effects of Ser784 phosphorylation on DDR correlate with a decrease in VCP association with chromatin, cofactors NPL4/UFD1, and polyubiquitinated substrates. Clinically, high phospho-Ser784-VCP levels are significantly associated with poor outcome among chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. Thus, Ser784 phosphorylation is a DDR-specific enhancer of VCP function and a potential predictive biomarker for chemotherapy treatments.","Zhu, Cuige; Rogers, Anna; Asleh, Karama; Won, Jennifer; Gao, Dongxia; Leung, Samuel; Li, Shan; Vij, Kiran R; Zhu, Jian; Held, Jason M; You, Zhongsheng; Nielsen, Torsten O; Shao, Jieya",Cell Rep,309,29

Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.","Park, Dae Hoon; Joe, Yun Haeng; Piri, Amin; An, Sanggwon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,309,27

Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.","Smith, Julia; Davies, Sara E; Feng, Huiyun; Gan, Connie C R; Grépin, Karen A; Harman, Sophie; Herten-Crabb, Asha; Morgan, Rosemary; Vandan, Nimisha; Wenham, Clare",Glob Public Health,309,1

METHODS: Online-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 1190 questionnaires were (partly) answered. With respect to outpatient care and consultations from 15 March to 15 April 2020, a total of 69 (5.8%) participants indicated unlimited, 756 (63.5%) reduced and 330 (27.7%) emergency care only, independent of the type of institution. Outpatient surgery was restricted to emergency surgery in 68% of clinics, 42.0% of inpatient wards, 45.0% of surgical medical care centers and group practices and 33.0% of private practices. Inpatient procedures were limited to emergency care in 75.0% of inpatient wards and in 71.0% of clinics. With the exception of endophthalmitis (+8.2%), the number of urgent indications and emergencies declined: retinal detachment (-34.8%), perforating eyeball injuries (-7.3%), acute glaucoma (-17.8%), central retinal artery occlusion and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (-31.0%), others (-30.9%), penetrating keratoplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation (-59.1%). Institutional or professional policy requirements (76.0%) and appointment cancellation by patients (84.0%) were the most common reasons for limitations in ophthalmic patient care. CONCLUSION: The initial phase of the pandemic was characterized by a massive reduction in non-urgent conservative and surgical treatment that affected all areas of ophthalmology. Due to intensive care capacities required for COVID-19 patients, inpatient treatment was largely restricted to emergencies. Treatment of ophthalmological patients, including ocular emergencies and urgent treatment, was maintained across all sectors with a (considerable) decrease in the number of cases even in these groups.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Heinz, Peter; Feltgen, Nicolas; Hoerauf, Hans; Kohnen, Thomas; Priglinger, Siegfried; Bachmann, Werner; Rieks, Johannes; Eter, Nicole; Reinhard, Thomas",Ophthalmologe,309,26

This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011). DESIGN: Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study were used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants. Participants self-reported motivation, capability, and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Using regression models, we found that all three COM-B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour. Breaking this down further, the subscales psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour. Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.","Gibson Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; McKay, Ryan; Murphy, Jamie; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate M; Bentall, Richard P",Br. j. health psychol,309,7

Positive creativity can be a bit of a slippery concept in that, what is positive to one person or one group may be neutral or even negative to another group. Much of teaching young people for positive creativity, therefore, involves providing the tools to decide what positive creativity means to them, and teaching them how to defend their decision. This essay focuses especially on alternative conceptions of what positive creativity means. It considers a variety of approaches, such as definitional models--objective and subjective betterment;ratings, including from layperson and experts;philosophical models--utilitarian and categorical-imperative models;decision-theory models--minimax, maximin, and maximax models;psychologically based models--a Four-C model and a model based on wise creativity.

A Quality Improvement Project was designed to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles.MethodDaily weekend safety huddles were introduced to improve communication regarding workload, acuity, new admissions, seclusion reviews, deteriorating patients;and to improve team cohesiveness and trainee support out-of-hours.The QIP team involved the deputy medical director, the associate director for speciality units, consultants, the college tutor, specialty registrars and core psychiatry trainees. Prior to initiating the huddles, the QIP team met to decide which specialties to involve, to agree on an agenda and liaise with other sites regarding existing huddles. Once the huddles began in April 2020, the team met periodically to agree next courses of action and to troubleshoot. The huddles initially involved acute services and eventually included CAMHS, Forensic, Older Adults, Specialist Units, all on-call consultants, the on-call registrar, two core trainees, the psychiatric liaison manager and the duty senior nurse.ResultData were gathered throughout the QIP using Likert scale surveys which were sent to all junior doctors on the out-of-hours rota. Paper surveys were used initially but were later replaced with Microsoft Forms to ensure anonymity.The percentage of respondents who answered “most of the time” or “all of the time” increased across all parameters when comparing data from before and after implementation of the safety huddles.These results included improvement in: understanding of workload and acuity (9% before vs 69% after), discussion of new admissions on site (4% before vs 90% after), discussion of patients with deteriorating mental health (35% before vs 90% after) and physical health (22% before vs 83% after), understanding of number of patients in seclusion (61% before vs 93% after) and feeling part of a cohesive “on-call” team (17% before vs 86% after). In addition, the results suggested a reduction in frequency of safety concerns on site (83% answered at least “sometimes” before vs 62% after).ConclusionThe results of the final survey demonstrated a measurable and positive impact on communications between the out-of-hours team, improved team cohesiveness and a reduction in safety concerns. The lessons learnt also influenced decisions made in formatting safety huddles at other trust sites.","Allis, Helen Zahedi Mariam Stephenson Thomas Newson Michael Kumar Anil",BJPsych Open,309,1

Considering policy domains together provides insight into how different policy decisions interact. The model incorporates important characteristics of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as heterogeneous risk factors and asymptomatic transmission, and enables a reliable qualitative comparison of policy choices despite the current uncertainty in key virus and disease parameters. Results suggest possible refinements to current policies, including emphasizing the need to reduce random encounters more than personal contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. The strength of social distancing of symptomatic individuals affects the degree to which asymptomatic cases drive the epidemic as well as the level of population-wide contact reduction needed to keep hospitals below capacity. The relative importance of testing and triaging also depends on the overall level of social distancing.","McCombs, Audrey; Kadelka, Claus",PLoS Comput Biol,309,6

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary care ICU in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS: Consecutive critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured cytokines on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of ICU stay. We included 116 patients (40 with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and 76 with non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection). On ICU day 1, both patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had higher levels of interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-17A, eotaxin, and epidermal growth factor compared with healthy controls. There were no differences in cytokines over time between patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection. Using day 1 cytokine levels, latent class analysis categorized patients into two subphenotypes: subphenotype 1 (n = 74 [64%]) and subphenotype 2 (n = 42 [36%]); the latter had significantly higher levels of interleukin-1ß, interleukin-1ra, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interleukin-12p70, interleukin-15, interleukin-17A, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#945;, macrophage inflammatory protein-1ß, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-&#945;, and interferon-Î³.

This paper models this skill as a Scavenger Hunt (SH) game, which we formulate as a variation of the NP-hard stochastic traveling purchaser problem. In this problem, the goal is to find a set of objects as quickly as possible, given probability distributions of where they may be found. We investigate the performance of several solution algorithms for the SH problem, both in simulation and on a real mobile robot. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent to plan a minimal cost path, and show that the RL agent can outperform a range of heuristic algorithms, achieving near optimal performance. In order to stimulate research on this problem, we introduce a publicly available software stack and associated website that enable users to upload scavenger hunts which robots can download, perform, and learn from to continually improve their performance on future hunts.","Yedidsion, Harel; Suriadinata, Jennifer; Xu, Zifan; Debruyn, Stefan; Stone, Peter",,309,5

Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31,211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3,156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.","Chen, Bilin; Zhong, Huanhuan; Ni, Yueyan; Liu, Lulu; Zhong, Jinjin; Su, Xin",Front. Med.,309,16

However, few methodologies are described in detail on how to rapidly and efficiently generate effective NAbs to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we integrated and optimized a strategically screening method for NAbs, which has enabled us to obtain SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific NAbs within 6 days, followed by additional 9 days for antibody production and function analysis. Using this method, we obtained 198 specific Abs against SARS-CoV-2 RBD from the blood samples of COVID-19 convalescent patients, and 96 of them showed neutralizing activity. At least 20% of these NAbs exhibited advanced neutralizing potency and high affinity, with the top two NAbs showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 at 9.88 and 11.13 ng/ml, respectively. Altogether, our study provides an effective methodology with high applicable value for discovering potential preventative and therapeutic NAbs for the emerging infectious diseases.","Han, Xiaojian; Wang, Yingming; Li, Shenglong; Hu, Chao; Li, Tingting; Gu, Chenjian; Wang, Kai; Shen, Meiying; Wang, Jianwei; Hu, Jie; Wu, Ruixin; Mu, Song; Gong, Fang; Chen, Qian; Gao, Fengxia; Huang, Jingjing; Long, Yingyi; Luo, Feiyang; Song, Shuyi; Long, Shunhua; Hao, Yanan; Li, Luo; Wu, Yang; Xu, Wei; Cai, Xia; Gao, Qingzhu; Zhang, Guiji; He, Changlong; Deng, Kun; Du, Li; Nai, Yaru; Wang, Wang; Xie, Youhua; Qu, Di; Huang, Ailong; Tang, Ni; Jin, Aishun",Front Immunol,309,19

Preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate if itraconazole is effective for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: Due to the initial absence of preclinical models, the effect of itraconazole was explored in a clinical, proof-of-concept, open-label, single-center study, in which hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care with or without itraconazole. Primary outcome was the cumulative score of the clinical status until day 15 based on the 7-point ordinal scale of the World Health Organization. In parallel, itraconazole was evaluated in a newly established hamster model of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as soon as the model was validated. FINDINGS: In the hamster acute infection model, itraconazole did not reduce viral load in lungs, stools or ileum, despite adequate plasma and lung drug concentrations. In the transmission model, itraconazole failed to prevent viral transmission. The clinical trial was prematurely discontinued after evaluation of the preclinical studies and because an interim analysis showed no signal for a more favorable outcome with itraconazole: mean cumulative score of the clinical status 49 vs 47, ratio of geometric means 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.19) for itraconazole vs standard of care. INTERPRETATION: Despite in vitro activity, itraconazole was not effective in a preclinical COVID-19 hamster model. This prompted the premature termination of the proof-of-concept clinical study.

Extracellular stimuli are sensed, amplified, and transduced through a dynamic cellular network of messengers converting the first signal into a proper response: production of specific mediators, cell activation, survival, or death. Several overlapping pathways are coordinated to ensure specific and timely induction of inflammation to neutralize potential harms to the tissue. Ideally, the inflammatory response must be controlled and self-limited. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that culminates with termination of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Comparably to the onset of inflammation, resolution responses are triggered by coordinated intracellular signaling pathways that transduce the message to the nucleus. However, the key messengers and pathways involved in signaling transduction for resolution are still poorly understood in comparison to the inflammatory network. cAMP has long been recognized as an inducer of anti-inflammatory responses and cAMP-dependent pathways have been extensively exploited pharmacologically to treat inflammatory diseases. Recently, cAMP has been pointed out as coordinator of key steps of resolution of inflammation. Here, we summarize the evidence for the role of cAMP at inducing important features of resolution of inflammation.","Tavares, Luciana P; Negreiros-Lima, Graziele L; Lima, Kátia M; E Silva, Patrícia M R; Pinho, Vanessa; Teixeira, Mauro M; Sousa, Lirlândia P",Pharmacol Res,309,13

Particularly in viral infections, the understanding of the host-pathogen mechanisms, and the immune response to these, is considered a major goal for the rational design of appropriate therapies. For this reason, the use of gene networks may well encourage therapy-associated research in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, orchestrating experimental scrutiny and reducing costs. In this work, gene co-expression networks were reconstructed from RNA-Seq expression data with the aim of analyzing the time-resolved effects of gene Ly6E in the immune response against the coronavirus responsible for murine hepatitis (MHV). Through the integration of differential expression analyses and reconstructed networks exploration, significant differences in the immune response to virus were observed in Ly6E &#916; H S C compared to wild type animals. Results show that Ly6E ablation at hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to a progressive impaired immune response in both liver and spleen. Specifically, depletion of the normal leukocyte mediated immunity and chemokine signaling is observed in the liver of Ly6E &#916; H S C mice. On the other hand, the immune response in the spleen, which seemed to be mediated by an intense chromatin activity in the normal situation, is replaced by ECM remodeling in Ly6E &#916; H S C mice. These findings, which require further experimental characterization, could be extrapolated to other coronaviruses and motivate the efforts towards novel antiviral approaches.","Delgado-Chaves, Fernando M; Gómez-Vela, Francisco; Divina, Federico; García-Torres, Miguel; Rodriguez-Baena, Domingo S",,309,1

This study explores (1) the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for older Chinese migrants in Belgium and the Netherlands in terms of increased loneliness and its risk factors (reduced in-person contact, decreased social participation, feelings of existential threat) and protective factors (increased non-in-person contact, more individual activities), and (2) which risk and protective factors have contributed to the incidence and prevention of higher loneliness levels. Using quantitative data of a survey among 98 Chinese migrants aged 50 years and older in Belgium (n = 84) and the Netherlands (n = 14), the findings first indicate that the coronavirus pandemic has a significant impact on older Chinese migrants' lives. One in five experienced more loneliness. Second, reduced social participation (measured as less frequent participation in outdoor group activities) and financial insecurity (measured as experiencing financial difficulties) lead to higher than pre-pandemic loneliness levels. Problem-focused coping strategies (measured as increased non-in-person contact, via telephone or social media) and emotion-focused coping (measured as finding distraction through increased participation in individual activities) were not found to protect against increased loneliness in the pandemic. Two practical implications for loneliness interventions for older Chinese migrants are put forward. Organizing COVID-19-safe social participation activities and paying more attention to older Chinese migrants' financial situation can be beneficial when addressing higher levels of loneliness due to the coronavirus pandemic.","Pan, Honghui; Fokkema, Tineke; Switsers, Lise; Dury, Sarah; Hoens, Sylvia; De Donder, Liesbeth",Eur J Ageing,309,16

Although all patients with HLH typically need intensive anti-inflammatory therapy, patients with FHL also need HSCT to be cured. In the international HLH-2004 study, 187 children aged <18 years fulfilling the study inclusion criteria (5 of 8 diagnostic criteria, affected sibling, or molecular diagnosis in FHL-causative genes) underwent 209 transplants (2004-2012), defined as indicated in patients with familial/genetic, relapsing, or severe/persistent disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-72); event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (95% CI, 52-67). Five-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 65-90) for children with a complete response and 59% (95% CI, 48-69) for those with a partial response (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.27; P = .035). For children with verified FHL (family history/genetically verified, n = 134), 5-year OS was 71% (95% CI, 62-78) and EFS was 62% (95% CI, 54-70); 5-year OS for children without verified FHL (n = 53) was significantly lower (52%; 95% CI, 38-65) (P = .040; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03-2.77); they were also significantly older. Notably, 20 (38%) of 53 patients without verified FHL had natural killer cell activity reported as normal at diagnosis, after 2 months, or at HSCT, suggestive of secondary HLH; and in addition 14 (26%) of these 53 children had no evidence of biallelic mutations despite having 3 or 4 FHL genes analyzed (natural killer cell activity not analyzed after 2 months or at HSCT). We conclude that post-HSCT survival in FHL remains suboptimal, and that the FHL diagnosis should be carefully investigated before HSCT. Pretransplant complete remission is beneficial but not mandatory to achieve post-HSCT survival.

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Grelli, Sandro; Ciotti, Marco; Miano, Roberto; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Cell Death Discov,309,24

The pandemic requires adaptation of the health care standards, including epidemiologic surveillance, logistics of home supply, and monitoring. Potential lack of medical professionals may worsen the standard of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the medical staff resources in HPN units. RESULTS: The study was conducted by major Polish scientific societies in clinical nutrition. A questionnaire was distributed among all Polish adult HPN centers concerning statistics from the first 3 mo of the pandemic (March through May 2020). Data on medical staff resources and organizational issues of the units were collected. Modifications of the home procedures, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of HPN patients and health care workers (HCW) were analyzed. Influence of the pandemic on the rates of new qualifications for home artificial nutrition (HAN) was estimated. Fourteen of 17 adult Polish HPN units took part in the study. The point prevalence of HPN in Poland was 30.75/1 million citizens. Of HCWs, 344 were involved in patient care in Polish HPN units; 18.9% were physicians (49% surgeons, 18.46% internal medicine specialists, 15.38% anesthesiologists, 7.69% pediatricians, 1.54% palliative care specialists), 32.27% nurses, 5.23% dietitians, 9.01% pharmacists, 4.94% pharmacy technicians, 3.2% pharmacy assistants, 5.81% administrative workers, 3.49% physiotherapists. HAN patient-to-HCW ratios for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians were 49.5, 29.15, 111.6, and 181.6, respectively. Medium ages of physicians and nurses were 45.6 and 44.15 y, respectively. Slightly less than half (53.8%) of physicians and 31.53% of nurses worked parallelly in hospital wards. Thirty-one pharmacists overall were working in all HPN units (2.21 per unit) as were 18 dietitians (1.3 per unit). Nine patients had a confirmed COVID-19 infection (four HPN, five home enteral nutrition). All the units introduced telemedicine solutions in the first months of the pandemic. The number of new qualifications for HPN and home enteral nutrition in the units did not significantly decline from March through May in comparison with a similar period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of HPN medical professionals requires attention when planning health care organization, especially during a pandemic. Severe restrictions in public health systems may not reduce the number of new qualifications for the HPN procedure. There is a need for the continuation of data collection during the evolution of the pandemic as it may have a detrimental effect on HPN including serious issues with access to professional HCWs.","Folwarski, Marcin; Klek, Stanislaw; Matras, Przemyslaw; Bartoszewska, Lidia; Bednarz, Slawomir; Jakubczyk, Marlena; Kamocki, Zbigniew; Krasowski, Grzegorz; Kunecki, Marek; Kwella, Bogna; Matysiak-Lusnia, Katarzyna; Matysiak, Konrad; Pierzynowska, Gabriela; Szafranski, Waldemar; Szopinski, Jacek; Urbanowicz, Krystyna; Sobocki, Jacek",Nutrition,309,25

Although lipids have been shown to possess antiviral efficacy, little is currently known about lipid compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry properties. To address this issue, we screened, overall, 17 polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids, as wells as lipid-soluble vitamins. In performing target-based ligand screening utilizing the RBD-SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we observed that polyunsaturated fatty acids most effectively interfere with binding to hACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using a spike protein pseudo-virus, we also found that linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, eicosapentaenoic acid showed higher efficacy than linolenic acid in reducing activity of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases, but neither of the fatty acids affected their expression at the protein level. Also, neither reduction of hACE2 activity nor binding to the hACE2 receptor upon treatment with these two fatty acids was observed. Although further in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings, our study provides a new insight into the role of lipids as antiviral compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 strain.","Goc, Anna; Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra; Rath, Matthias",Sci Rep,309,24

The aerosol data have been obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) for the lockdown phase-1 (March 25 - April 15, 2020) and its corresponding average of the reference period (2001-2019). The total PM2.5 has been modelled over the GB based on the inputs from MERRA-2. The in-situ AQI values from cities across the GB have been obtained during pre-lockdown (February, 29 - March, 20, 2020) and lockdown phase-1 period to evaluate changes. Non-parametric pairwise comparison is performed to evaluate the significant change in the pollutants including AOD, and quantile regression is used to explore the effect of meteorology on AOD and other pollutants. The results show a significant reduction (p ≤ 0.05) in AOD, BC, OC, SO4, dust, dust particulate matter (PM2.5), sea salt, sea salt PM2.5, and estimated total PM2.5 during the lockdown phase-1 with respect to the reference period. The analysis also reveals that meteorological factors do not play a vital role in the reduction of AOD during the lockdown phase-1 period. The estimated reductions for AOD, BC, OC, SO4, dust, dust PM2.5, sea salt, and sea salt PM2.5 are 33%, 21%, 24%, 20%, 18%, 17%, 64%, and 61%, respectively due to imposition of lockdown measures. As many as 28 cities in the GB have shown substantial improvement in the air quality during the lockdown phase-1 period. The reduction in the emission quantity and subsequent improvement in AQI has opened up a new discourse for combatting the persistent air quality issues for million-plus cities in particular and for the north Indian plain in general. The findings of this study thus provide insightful views to the environmentalists and policymakers for framing better emission policy to deal with the air quality issue.","Rani, Seema Kumar Rajesh Acharya Prasenjit Maharana Pyarimohan Singh Rajkumar",Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment,309,6

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","Capriotti, Annalaura; Piovesana, Susy; Zenezini Chiozzi, Riccardo; Montone, Carmela Maria; Bossi, Alessandra Maria; Laganà, Aldo",J Proteomics,309,24

However, the use of these concepts is often unclear and ambivalent: On one hand, older people are described as a vulnerable group whose protection requires sacrifices on the part of younger generations, e.g., regarding individual freedom and economic welfare. On the other, they appear as dispensable individuals that should relinquish their claims for the sake of the young and their future prospects. Our contribution offers an analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in public discourses on COVID-19. The leading question is how both concepts are used and how the corresponding claims can be justified or criticized. We first give an overview of notions of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in current debates. In the next step, we provide a moral philosophical clarification of both concepts and their normative presuppositions. We then conduct a descriptive ethical discourse analysis of pertinent cases from three areas of European discourse: politics, civil society, and mass media. The analysis focuses on politico-moral claims and their normative premises, ambiguities, and biases. We argue that the discourse involves assumptions about old age and generational relations that need further clarification and justification. An analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in times of COVID-19 can help understand the dynamics of social cohesion in late-modern societies.","Ellerich-Groppe, Niklas; Pfaller, Larissa; Schweda, Mark",Eur J Ageing,309,24

Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","Hernández-Galdamez, Diego Rolando; González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Romo-Dueñas, Daniela Karola; Lima-Morales, René; Hernández-Vicente, Irma Alejandra; Lumbreras-Guzmán, Marivel; Méndez-Hernández, Pablo",Arch Med Res,309,16

The virus has now spread to a large number of countries/territories and has caused over three million deaths. Evidently, the virus has been mutating and adapting during this period. Significant effort has been spent on identifying these variations and their impact on transmission, virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes cellular entry. Therefore, human ACE2 variations could also influence susceptibility or resistance to the virus. A deeper understanding of the evolution and genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 as well as ACE2 could contribute to the development of effective treatment and preventive measures.

Furthermore, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for 2 subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, whereas the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the men who have sex with men and non-Japanese subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS. Continuously monitoring the situation and securing sufficient test resources by use of self-testing is essential to understand the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Yamamoto, Nao; Rosenberg, Molly; Ludema, Christina; Bento, Ana I; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Ichikawa, Seiichi; Mizushima, Daisuke; Iwami, Shingo",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,309,24

Leptin produced in visceral fat might play a role in the deterioration to mechanical ventilation. A cross sectional study was performed. The mean BMI was 31 kg/m2 (range 24.8-48.4) for the 31 SARS-CoV-2 ventilated patients and 26 kg/m2 (range 22.4-33.5) for 8 critically ill non-infected control patients. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a similar BMI as control patients appear to have significantly higher levels of serum leptin.

With these findings we describe a clinical and biological framework that may explain these clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This might be enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role.

US daily deaths have numbered over one-thousand people per day for nearly 3 days (from November 18, 2020 to November 20, 2020), and total deaths have exceeded 250 000 as of November 21, 2020, which drives the medical community to search for trends to provide an early warning of rising numbers of cases and to prevent future increases. Objective: The study intended to evaluate available US COVID-19 data to determine the possibility of predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. Design: The research team collected US COVID-19 data from a time-series view and established a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict trends. Results: According to the spatial and temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases, US COVID-19 cases are mainly concentrated in areas with high population density, with that variable having a positive correlation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The correlation coefficients are 0.95 and 0.817, respectively, indicating that the transmission of COVID-19 in the USA is characterized by agglomeration. After exploring the impact of population density, the research team established a SARIMA model to predict the trends, finding that US COVID-19 cases will continue to go up. Conclusions: By combining knowledge of the statistical features of the virus with modeling findings, the study determined a method that can improve understanding of the serious pandemic, paving the way toward the development of predictive and preventative solutions.","Ding, Yongmei; Huang, Rui; Shao, Ningyi",Altern. ther. health med,309,11

In our opinion, one of the main reasons for this is the raise hand function of the respective web conference systems, which (independent of the system used) results in an unobtrusive signal that can easily be missed by the lecturer. Given the necessary focus on one's own presentation, questions can therefore only be perceived with a considerable time delay and can only be integrated into the lessons to a limited extent. Thus, the idea arose to display question requests of the auditorium by a clear visual signal in PowerPoint® itself. Methodology: With Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft PowerPoint® holds an integrated programming language that extends its functionality. Accordingly, VBA was used to program a routine running in the background of the presentation, which periodically retrieves the contents of a web-based ""signal file"" in a cycle of a few seconds. The content of this signal file, in turn, can be modified by the students by calling up an URL (i.e. from any Internet-capable device) - this results in a (customizable) visual signal in PowerPoint® that is temporarily visible and does not further interfere with the presentation. Conclusion: With the concept presented here, a raise hand function was realized in PowerPoint®, which manifests itself as a clear visual signal independent of the web conferencing system used. This enables the lecturers to respond instantly to questions from the audience during live transmission of lectures.","Volf, Ivo",GMS J Med Educ,309,16

Patients with cancer are at significantly increased risk compared with the general population. Telemedicine represents a common strategy to prevent viral spread. We sought to evaluate patient with cancer and physician perceptions of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 16-question survey was e-mailed to 1,843 active e-mails of patients presenting to one of the six cancer clinics at a comprehensive cancer care center from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. A six-question survey was e-mailed to attending physicians of those clinics. Specialties included Medical Oncology, Hematology-Oncology, Surgical Oncology, Urological Oncology, and Gynecologic Oncology. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four patients (20.3%) and 14 physicians (66.7%) responded. Most (68.2%) currently prefer in-person visits, and 80.4% prefer in-person visits following pandemic resolution. More than half (52.2%) of patients preferring virtual visits do so because of convenience. Most (63.1%) patients with cancer are comfortable with a complete physical examination. Surgical patients are more likely to prefer a complete examination (P = .0476). Physicians prefer in-person visits (64.2%) and believe that virtual visits maybe or probably do not provide comparable care (64.2%). 71.4% believe that virtual visits help prevent the spread of infectious disease. CONCLUSION: Given preferences for in-person visits, cancer care teams should be prepared to continue providing in-person visits for many of their patients. The discrepancy between patient and provider concern for spread of infectious disease represents an area where patients may benefit from increased education. Providers should feel comfortable performing physical examinations at their own discretion.","Wehrle, Chase J; Lee, Sang W; Devarakonda, Aditya K; Arora, Tania K",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,309,24

In both waves, women showed a higher prevalence of symptoms of poor mental health compared to men, and middle-aged (40-59 years old) and elderly (&#8805;60 years old) showed a higher risk of symptoms of poor mental health compared to the younger. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 revealed no significant relationship to symptoms of poor mental health, whereas, the interaction analysis revealed that those with other underlying diseases showed more symptoms of poor mental health during the centralized quarantine and a greater decrease during the follow-up home isolation. Conclusion: The discharged COVID-19 patients suffered from mental health problems such as, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and this was especially so for women, the middle-aged and elderly, and those with underlying diseases, but along with the rehabilitation and the environmental change from centralized quarantine to home isolation, all the mental symptoms were significantly alleviated. Based on a follow-up investigation, the current results provide critical evidence for mental health and early rehabilitation upon the discharged COVID-19 patients.","Li, Li; Wu, Michael Shengtao; Tao, Junxiu; Wang, Weijun; He, Jing; Liu, Ru; Guo, Juan; Chen, Yun; Li, Kejian; Li, Shilong; Qi, Bo; Han, Buxin",Front Public Health,309,26

METHODS: We included 424 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission from January 17, 2020, to February 17, 2020, in the primary cohort of this retrospective multicenter study. The extent of lung involvement was quantified on chest CT images by a deep learning-based framework. The composite endpoint was the occurrence of severe or critical COVID-19 or death during hospitalization. The optimal machine learning classifier and feature subset were selected for model construction. The performance was further tested in an external validation cohort consisting of 98 patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of adverse outcomes (8.7% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.858) between the primary and validation cohorts. The machine learning method extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and optimal feature subset including lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), presence of comorbidity, CT lesion ratio (lesion%), and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were selected for model construction. The XGBoost classifier based on the optimal feature subset performed well for the prediction of developing adverse outcomes in the primary and validation cohorts, with AUCs of 0.959 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.936-0.976) and 0.953 (95% CI: 0.891-0.986), respectively. Furthermore, the XGBoost classifier also showed clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a machine learning model that could be effectively used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, opening up the possibility for patient stratification and treatment allocation. KEY POINTS: â¢ Developing an individually prognostic model for COVID-19 has the potential to allow efficient allocation of medical resources. â¢ We proposed a deep learning-based framework for accurate lung involvement quantification on chest CT images. â¢ Machine learning based on clinical and CT variables can facilitate the prediction of adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","Feng, Zhichao; Shen, Hui; Gao, Kai; Su, Jianpo; Yao, Shanhu; Liu, Qin; Yan, Zhimin; Duan, Junhong; Yi, Dali; Zhao, Huafei; Li, Huiling; Yu, Qizhi; Zhou, Wenming; Mao, Xiaowen; Ouyang, Xin; Mei, Ji; Zeng, Qiuhua; Williams, Lindy; Ma, Xiaoqian; Rong, Pengfei; Hu, Dewen; Wang, Wei",Eur. radiol,309,16

The largest protests in US history occurred in late May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM movement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they occurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest conditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and with COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was hypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a balancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread. However, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion of the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither supporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as a factor. Framings of the movement by BLM supporters largely replicated those of earlier studies, with new frames emerging surrounding the opposition the movement has received from racism, police militarisation and President Donald Trump. Discourse evidenced worrying levels of polarisation, hate, incivility and conspiracy content and bore many similarities to previously studied COVID discourse. This suggests that George Floyd's death, as yet another example of an African American man killed by US police, was largely seen through established, polarised identity positions that made reactions to the incident and resulting protest largely a foregone conclusion, established and articulated without reference to the ongoing pandemic.","Bolsover, Gillian",,309,22

Some patients in the US have developed delayed localized cutaneous vaccine reactions that have been dubbed ""COVID arm."" Objective: To describe the course of localized cutaneous injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, subsequent reactions to the second vaccine dose, and to characterize the findings of histopathologic examination of the reaction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case series study was performed at Yale New Haven Hospital, a tertiary medical center in New Haven, Connecticut, with 16 patients referred with localized cutaneous injection-site reactions from January 20 through February 12, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: We collected each patient's demographic information, a brief relevant medical history, clinical course, and treatment (if any); and considered the findings of a histopathologic examination of 1 skin biopsy specimen. Results: Of 16 patients (median [range] age, 38 [25-89] years; 13 [81%] women), 14 patients self-identified as White and 2 as Asian. The delayed localized cutaneous reactions developed in a median (range) of 7 (2-12) days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. These reactions occurred at or near the injection site and were described as pruritic, painful, and edematous pink plaques. None of the participants had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Results of a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a mild predominantly perivascular mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils, consistent with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. Of participants who had a reaction to first vaccine dose (15 of 16 patients), most (11 patients) developed a similar localized injection-site reaction to the second vaccine dose; most (10 patients) also developed the second reaction sooner as compared with the first-dose reaction. Conclusions and Relevance: Clinical and histopathologic findings of this case series study indicate that the localized injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. These reactions may occur sooner after the second dose, but they are self-limited and not associated with serious vaccine adverse effects. In contrast to immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria), these delayed reactions (dubbed ""COVID arm"") are not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination.","Johnston, Margaret S; Galan, Anjela; Watsky, Kalman L; Little, Alicia J",JAMA Dermatol,309,21

We show that node representations of temporal graphs can be cast into two distinct frameworks: (a) The de-facto standard approach, which we denote {\em time-and-graph}, where equivariant graph (e.g., GNN) and sequence (e.g., RNN) representations are intertwined to represent the temporal evolution of the graph; and (b) an approach that we denote {\em time-then-graph}, where the sequences describing the node and edge dynamics are represented first (e.g., RNN), then fed as node and edge attributes into a (static) equivariant graph representation that comes after (e.g., GNN). In real-world datasets, we show that our {\em time-then-graph} framework achieves the same prediction performance as state-of-the-art {\em time-and-graph} methods. Interestingly, {\em time-then-graph} representations have an expressiveness advantage over {\em time-and-graph} representations when both use component GNNs that are not most-expressive (e.g., 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman GNNs). We introduce a task where this expressiveness advantage allows {\em time-then-graph} methods to succeed while state-of-the-art {\em time-and-graph} methods fail.","Gao, Jianfei; Ribeiro, Bruno",,309,24

However, evidence was still limited about the effect of HV with face mask on cortical excitability of patients with epilepsy. The motivation of this work is to make use of the graph theory of EEG to characterize the cortical excitability of patients with epilepsy when they did HV under the condition wearing a surgical face mask. METHODS We recruited 19 patients with epilepsy and 17 normal controls. All of participants completed two HV experiments, including HV with face mask (HV+) and HV without a mask (HV). The interval was 30 min and the sequence was random. Each experiment consisted of three segments: resting EEG, EEG of HV, and EEG of post-HV. EEG were recorded successively during each experiment. Participants were asked to evaluate the discomfort degree using a questionnaire when every HV is completed. RESULTS All of the participants felt more uncomfortable after HV + . Moreover, not only HV decreased small-worldness index in patients with epilepsy, but also HV + significantly increased the clustering coefficient in patients with epilepsy. Importantly, the three-way of Mask*HV*Epilepsy showed interaction in the clustering coefficient in the delta band, as well as in the path length and the small-worldness index in the theta band. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicated that patients with epilepsy showed the increased excitability of brain network during HV + . We should pay more attention to the adverse effect on brain network excitability caused by HV + in patients with epilepsy. In the clinical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that the wearing face mask remain cautious for the individuals with epilepsy when they carried out HV behavior such as exercise (e.g., running, etc.).","Song, Penghui; Cao, Dan; Li, Siran; Wang, Rong; Wang, Yuping; Lin, Hua",Epilepsy research,309,15

The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the cumulative prevalence and incidence rates of COVID-19 among dentists and to assess their level of engagement in specific infection control practices. METHODS: US dentists were invited to participate in a monthly web-based survey from June through November 2020. Approximately one-third of initial respondents (n = 785) participated in all 6 surveys, and they were asked about COVID-19 testing received, symptoms experienced, and infection prevention procedures followed in their primary practice. RESULTS: Over a 6-month period, the cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence rate was 2.6%, representing 57 dentists who ever received a diagnosis of COVID-19. The incidence rates ranged from 0.2% through 1.1% each month. The proportion of dentists tested for COVID-19 increased over time, as did the rate of dentists performing aerosol-generating procedures. Enhanced infection prevention and control strategies in the dental practice were reported by nearly every participant monthly, and rates of personal protection equipment optimization, such as changing masks after each patient, dropped over time. CONCLUSIONS: US dentists continue to show a high level of adherence to enhanced infection control procedures in response to the ongoing pandemic, resulting in low rates of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19. Dentists are showing adherence to a strict protocol for enhanced infection control, which should help protect their patients, their dental team members, and themselves. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 infections among practicing dentists will likely remain low if dentists continue to adhere to guidance.","Araujo, Marcelo W.B.; Estrich, Cameron G.; Mikkelsen, Matthew; Morrissey, Rachel; Harrison, Brittany; Geisinger, Maria L.; Ioannidou, Effie; Vujicic, Marko",J Am Dent Assoc,309,22

Six types of prosocial tendencies (altruism, dire, compliant, emotional, public, and anonymous) and selfishness as the antisocial tendency were included as personality factors, while fear related to the pandemic and empathy toward vulnerable groups (i.e., those in forced isolation) were context-related factors. Furthermore, mediation effect of empathy and moderation effect of fear were explored in relations between personality factors and protective behaviors. The sample included 581 participants (78.3% females). The data were collected from March 28 to April 6, 2020, during the emergency state and curfew in Serbia. The results showed that tendency to help anonymously had a positive effect and selfishness had a negative effect on protective behaviors, over and above demographic characteristics and context-related factors. Among context-related factors, only fear related to the pandemic had a significant unique positive effect on protective behaviors, but it had no moderator effect in the relationship between personality traits and protective behaviors. However, empathy acted as a mediator and partly accounted for the negative effect of selfishness and positive effect of tendency to help anonymously on protective behaviors. The results revealed that compliance with protective measures could be seen as prosocial and unselfish form of behavior.

Here, we present an integrated system of genomic surveillance in the German city of Dusseldorf, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) analysis of hospital outbreaks, d) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and e) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. The generated surveillance sequencing data (n = 320 SARS-CoV-2 genomes) showed that the development of the local viral population structure from August to December 2020 was consistent with European trends, with the notable absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants 20I/501Y.V1/B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 until the end of the local sampling period. Against a background of local surveillance and other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 data, four putative SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at Dusseldorf University Hospital between October and December 2020 (n = 44 viral genomes) were investigated and confirmed as clonal, contributing to the development of improved infection control and prevention measures. An analysis of the generated surveillance sequencing data with respect to infection clusters in the population based on a greedy clustering algorithm identified five candidate clusters, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the integration of public health authority contact tracing data and shown to be represent transmission settings of particular relevance (schools, care homes). A joint analysis of outbreak and surveillance data identified a potential transmission of an outbreak strain from the local population into the hospital and back; and an in-depth analysis of one population infection cluster combining genetic with contact tracing data enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized population transmission chain involving a martial arts gym. Based on these results and a real-time sequencing experiment in which we demonstrated the feasibility of achieving sample-to-turnaround times of <30 hours with the Oxford Nanopore technology, we discuss the potential benefits of routine ultra-fast sequencing of all detected infections for contact tracing, infection cluster detection, and, ultimately, improved management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Walker, A.; Houwaart, T.; Finzer, P.; Ehlkes, L.; Tyshaieva, A.; Damagnez, M.; Strelow, D.; Duplessis, A.; Nicolai, J.; Wienemann, T.; Tamayo, T.; Kohns Vasconcelos, M.; HuÌlse, L.; Hoffmann, K.; LuÌbke, N.; Hauka, S.; Andree, M.; DaÌumer, M.

For this perspective paper, we posit that they do not. Concepts and measures related to the adaptive functions and well-being areas of emotion research cannot simply be transferred for use in advertising research. When a commercial elicits emotions, the emotions staged in the commercial must not be directly associated with the emotions felt by consumers when exposed to those commercials. This is why “aesthetic” emotions seem more appropriate than “utilitarian” emotions in advertising research, with the former generally felt more significantly than they are acted upon. Aesthetic emotions elicit limited physiological change, and they rely on the intrinsic pleasantness appraisal of commercials. Accordingly, pleasure and displeasure—as observed through expressive and subjective components of aesthetic emotion—often form the first and only step of commercial appraisal, and they are directed toward attitude formation rather than overt behaviors. Our preliminary psychophysiological study shows this by investigating the contributions of psychophysiological and self-reported measures of aesthetic emotions induced by commercials to explain attitudes toward advertisements. The results show that only two components of aesthetic emotion positively influenced attitudes toward the advertisements: expressive (measured by facial electromyography) and subjective (measured by the self-assessment manikin scale). Also, the subjective component of aesthetic emotion partially mediates the effects of the expressive components on attitudes toward the ads. Our exploratory study illustrates the relevance of focusing on aesthetic emotions in advertising research. It also shed new light on the contributions of the physiological, expressive, and subjective feelings components of aesthetic emotions in advertising effectiveness.","Lajante, Mathieu; Droulers, Olivier; Derbaix, Christian; Poncin, Ingrid",Front Psychol,309,16

The JAK/STAT molecular pathway is activated under the interaction of a broad number of profibrotic/pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and IL-13, among others, which are increased in different ILDs. Similarly, several growth factors over-expressed in ILDs, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activate JAK/STAT by canonical or non-canonical pathways, which indicates a predominant role of JAK/STAT in ILDs. Between the different JAK/STAT isoforms, it appears that JAK2/STAT3 are predominant, initiating cellular changes observed in ILDs. This review analyzes the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT isoforms in ILDs lung tissue and different cell types related to ILDs, such as lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells and analyzes JAK/STAT activation. The effect of JAK/STAT phosphorylation on cellular fibrotic processes, such as proliferation, senescence, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or epithelial/fibroblast to mesenchymal transition will be described. The small molecules directed to inhibit JAK/STAT activation were assayed in vitro and in in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis, and different JAK inhibitors are currently approved for myeloproliferative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that JAK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed to block IL-6 are used as compassionate use to attenuate the excessive inflammation and lung fibrosis related to SARS-CoV-2 virus. These altogether indicate that JAK/STAT pathway is an attractive target to be proven in future clinical trials of lung fibrotic disorders.","Montero, Paula; Milara, Javier; Roger, Inés; Cortijo, Julio",Int J Mol Sci,309,16

Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","Tan, J.; Xiong, Y.-q.; Zhao, S.; Liu, C.; Huang, S.; Lu, X.; Thabane, L.; Xie, F.; Sun, X.; Li, W.",,309,16

However, recent research has serious limitations, such as non-guideline definition of myocardial injury, heterogenicity of troponin sampling or very short-term follow-up. Using data from a large European cohort, we aimed to overcome these pitfalls and adequately characterize myocardial damage in COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and available high-sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. RESULTS: A total of 918 patients (mean age 63.2 ± 15.5 years, 60.1% male) with a median follow-up of 57 (49-63) days were included. Of these, 190 (20.7%) fulfilled strict criteria for myocardial injury (21.1% chronic, 76.8% acute non-ischemic, 2.1% acute ischemic). Time from onset of symptoms to maximum hs-TnI was 11 (7-18) days. Thrombotic and bleeding events, arrhythmias, heart failure, need for mechanical ventilation and death were significantly more prevalent in patients with higher hs-TnI concentrations, even without fulfilling criteria for myocardial injury. hs-TnI was identified as an independent predictor of mortality [HR 2.52 (1.57-4.04) per 5-logarithmic units increment] after adjusting for multiple relevant covariates. CONCLUSION: Elevated hs-TnI is highly prevalent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even mild elevations well below the 99th URL were significantly associated with higher rates of cardiac and non-cardiac complications, and higher mortality. Future research should address the role of serial hs-TnI assessment to improve COVID-19 prognostic stratification and clinical outcomes.","Caro-Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R.; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M.; Rosillo, Sandra O.; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Merino, Carlos; Marco, Irene; Martinez, Luis A.; Garcia-Veas, Jose M.; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-de-Sá, Esteban; Merino, Jose L",Med Clin (Barc),309,16

Such alerts are rare; however, on Feb 19, 2003, a pandemic alert was issued in response to human infections caused by an avian H5N1 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/213/03. H5N1 had been noted once before in human beings in 1997 and killed a third (6/18) of infected people.1, 2 The 2003 variant seemed to have been transmitted directly from birds to human beings and caused fatal pneumonia in one of two infected individuals. Candidate vaccines were sought, but no avirulent viruses antigenically similar to the pathogen were available, and the isolate killed embryonated chicken eggs. Since traditional strategies of vaccine production were not viable, we sought to produce a candidate reference virus using reverse genetics. METHODS: We removed the polybasic aminoacids that are associated with high virulence from the haemagglutinin cleavage site of A/Hong Kong/213/03 using influenza reverse genetics techniques. A reference vaccine virus was then produced on an A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) backbone on WHO-approved Vero cells. We assessed this reference virus for pathogenicity in in-vivo and in-vitro assays. FINDINGS: A reference vaccine virus was produced in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade facilities in less than 4 weeks from the time of virus isolation. This virus proved to be non-pathogenic in chickens and ferrets and was shown to be stable after multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs. INTERPRETATION: The ability to produce a candidate reference virus in such a short period of time sets a new standard for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and clearly shows the usefulness of reverse genetics for influenza vaccine development. The same technologies and procedures are currently being used to create reference vaccine viruses against the 2004 H5N1 viruses circulating in Asia.","Webby, RJ; Perez, DR; Coleman, JS; Guan, Y; Knight, JH; Govorkova, EA; McClain-Moss, LR; Peiris, JS; Rehg, JE; Tuomanen, EI; Webster, RG",Lancet,309,1

We show here that the E19 protein is retained in the ER even in the absence of class I antigens. To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface. Thus, we concluded that a small stretch of amino acids exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane is responsible for the retention of the E19 protein in the ER.","Pääbo, Svante; Bhat, Bheem M.; Wold, William S.M.; Peterson, Per A.",Cell,309,28

So far, there has been no information on the use of high-fidelity simulation in undergraduate clinical nephrology teaching. Aim of this study was to analyze students' opinions and reactions to the simulation module in nephrology. METHODS: The survey consisting of the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES) and open-ended question concerning the overall impression of classes was conducted among 103 5(th) year medical students, who took part in the simulation training in nephrology. SSES consisted of three parts (debriefing, reasoning, education). Statements from the open-ended question were interpreted by means of the Atlas.ti software for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: The overall score for simulation classes was 4.39 ± 0.69 points. Students rated debriefing, reasoning and education at 4.43 ± 0.78, 4.32 ± 0.7 and 4.39 ± 0.73 points, respectively. 87.4% and 84.5% of participants agreed that simulation developed their 'clinical reasoning' and 'decision-making' skills in nephrology, respectively. Thematic analysis revealed that students evaluated the module as 'interesting', 'useful' and 'informative', but they found number of classes significantly insufficient. Students pointed out that due to the small emphasis placed on practical aspects in the existing curriculum e.g. routes of drug administration and conversion of doses, they could not fully benefit from simulation. CONCLUSION: Medical simulation is a valuable constituent of the nephrology course. Putting greater emphasis on practical aspects from the beginning of training may enable students to benefit more from simulation modules.","Pawłowicz, Ewa; Kulesza, Michelle; Szymańska, Aleksandra; Masajtis-Zagajewska, Anna; Bartczak, Maria; Nowicki, Michał",Renal failure,309,1

In order to track the genetic evolutionary of IBV isolates circulating in yellow chickens, we continued to conduct the genetic analyses of the structural genes S1, E, M, and N from 64 IBV isolates in southern China during 2009–2017. The results showed that the dominant genotypes based on the four genes had changed when compared with those during 1985–2008. Based on the S1 gene phylogenetic tree, LX4-type (GI-19) was the most dominant genotype, which was different from that during 1985–2008. The second most dominant genotype was LDT3-A-type, but this genotype disappeared after 2012. New-type 1 (GVI-1) isolates showed increasing tendency and there were four aa (QKEP) located in the hypervariable region (HVR) III and one aa (S) insertion in all the New-type 1 isolates. Both the analyses of amino acid entropy and molecular evolutionary rate revealed that the variations from large to small were S1, E, M, and N. Purifying selection was detected in the S1, E, M, and N gene proteins, which was different from the positive selection during 1985–2008. Six isolates were confirmed to be recombinants, possibly generated from a vaccine virus of the 4/91-type or LDT3-A-type and a circulating virus. The estimated times for the most recent common ancestors based on the S1, E, M, and N genes were the years of 1744, 1893, 1940, and 1945, respectively. Bayesian skyline analysis revealed a sharp decrease in genetic diversity of all the four structural genes after 2010 and since late 2015, the viral population rapidly rose. In conclusion, the IBVs circulating in southern China over the past decade have experienced a remarkable change in genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure, indicating the importance of permanent monitoring of circulating strains and the urgency for developing new vaccines to counteract the emerging LX4-type and New-type IBVs.","Fan, Wensheng; Tang, Ning; Dong, Zhihua; Chen, Jiming; Zhang, Wen; Zhao, Changrun; He, Yining; Li, Meng; Wu, Cuilan; Wei, Tianchao; Huang, Teng; Mo, Meilan; Wei, Ping",Viruses,309,16

METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study of all consecutive patients aged 18 years or more admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at a high-volume reference hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina comparing hospitalization rates, primary causes of admission, inpatient utilisation indicators, pharmacy supplies expenditures, and in-hospital mortality between March 5 and July 31, 2020 with two corresponding control periods in 2019 and 2018. RESULTS: We included 722 patients [mean age of 61.6 (SD 15.5) years; 237 (32.8%)] were females. Overall hospitalisations dropped 53.2% (95%CI: 45.3, 61.0%) from 295.5 patients/year over the periods 2018/2019 to 137 patients in 2020. Cardiovascular disease-related admissions dropped 59.9%, while admission for noncardiac causes doubled its prevalence from 9.6% over the periods 2018/2019 to 22.6% in the study period (P<0.001). In the period 2020, the bed occupancy rate fell from 82.2% to 77.4%, and the bed turnover rate dropped 50% from 7.88 to 3.91 monthly discharges/bed. The average length of stay doubled from 3.26 to 6.75 days, and the turnover interval increased from 3.8 to 8.39 days in 2020.

METHODS AND RESULTS In total, 512 patients who survived their hospitalization for acute HF in two South London referral centers between 7 January and 14 June 2020 were included in the study and compared with 725 patients from the corresponding period in 2019. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The demographic characteristics of patients admitted in 2020 were similar to the 2019 cohort. Median (IQR) follow-up was 622 (348-691) days. All-cause mortality after discharge remained significantly higher for patients admitted in 2020 compared with the equivalent period in 2019 (P < 0.01), which may relate to observed differences in place of care with fewer patients being managed on specialist cardiology wards during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg. RESULTS: Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.

The identification of many novel proteases from genome‐sequencing programs has suggested them as potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several well‐characterized metallopeptidases were recently shown to possess new biological roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. As a result of these studies, metabolism of the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid peptide (Aβ) is considered as a physiologically relevant process with several metallopeptidases being suggested for the role of amyloid‐degrading enzymes. These include the neprilysin (NEP) family of metalloproteinases (including its homologue endothelin‐converting enzyme), insulin‐degrading enzyme, angiotensin‐converting enzyme, plasmin, and, possibly, some other enzymes. NEP also has a role in metabolism of sensory and inflammatory neuropeptides such as tachykinins and neurokinins. The existence of natural enzymatic mechanisms for removal of amyloid peptides has extended the therapeutic avenues in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. The proteolytic events underlying AD are highly compartmentalized in the cell and formation of amyloid peptide from its precursor molecule APP (amyloid precursor protein) takes place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane, especially in lipid raft domains. Degradation of amyloid peptide by metallopeptidases can also be both intra‐ and extracellular depending on the activity of membrane‐bound enzymes and their soluble partners. Soluble forms of proteases can be secreted or released from the cell surface through the activity of “sheddases”—another group of proteolytic enzymes involved in key cellular regulatory functions. The activity of proteases involved in amyloid metabolism depends on numerous factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, age), and some conditions (e.g., hypoxia and ischemia) shift the balance of amyloid metabolism toward accumulation of higher concentrations of Aβ. In this regard, regulation of the activity of amyloid‐degrading enzymes should be considered as a viable strategy in neuroprotection.","Turner, A.J.; Nalivaeva, N.N.",Int Rev Neurobiol,309,10

From the few case series that are available in the literature, women with high risk pregnancies have been associated with higher morbidity. It has been suggested that pregnancy induced immune responses and cardio-vascular changes can exaggerate the course of the COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year old Somalian woman (G2P1) presented with a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever. A nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Her condition rapidly worsened leading to severe liver and coagulation impairment. An emergency Caesarean section was performed at gestational week 32 + 6 after which the patient made a rapid recovery. Severe COVID-19 promptly improved by the termination of the pregnancy or atypical HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes and Low Platelet Count) exacerbated by concomitant COVID-19 infection could not be ruled out. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This case adds to the growing body of evidence which raises concerns about the possible negative maternal outcomes of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and advocates for pregnant women to be recognized as a vulnerable group during the current pandemic.","Ronnje, Louise; Länsberg, John-Kalle; Vikhareva, Olga; Hansson, Stefan R.; Herbst, Andreas; Zaigham, Mehreen",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,309,6

HOX proteins execute their activity by exploiting a cooperative binding to PBX proteins and DNA. Therefore, an increase or decrease in HOX activity has been associated with both solid and haematological cancer diseases. Thus, inhibiting HOX-PBX interaction represents a potential strategy to prevent these malignancies, as demonstrated by the patented peptide HTL001 that is being studied in clinical trials. In this work, a computational study is described to identify novel potential peptides designed by employing a database of non-natural amino acids. For this purpose, residue scanning of the HOX minimal active sequence was performed to select the mutations to be further processed. According to these results, the peptides were point-mutated and used for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in complex with PBX1 protein and DNA to evaluate complex binding stability. MM-GBSA calculations of the resulting MD trajectories were exploited to guide the selection of the most promising mutations that were exploited to generate twelve combinatorial peptides. Finally, the latter peptides in complex with PBX1 protein and DNA were exploited to run MD simulations and the ΔG(binding) average values of the complexes were calculated. Thus, the analysis of the results highlighted eleven combinatorial peptides that will be considered for further assays.","Gulotta, Maria Rita; De Simone, Giada; John, Justin; Perricone, Ugo; Brancale, Andrea",Int J Mol Sci,309,20

Several prophylactic interventions are being performed to discover the effective anti-COVID-19 agent. Thus, the present study aims to identify the cryptogamic secondary metabolites (CSMs) as potent inhibitors of two major targets of SARS-Cov2, namely 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein (SGP), by implementing a computational approach. Molecular docking was carried out on Autodock 4.2 software with the 3CL(pro) (PDB ID:6LU7) and RBD of SGP (PDB ID:6W41) of the virus. Lopinavir and Arbidol were taken as positive controls to compare the efficacy of randomly selected 53 CSMs. The drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties of all metabolites were accessed to discern the anti-COVID 19 activity acting well at the physiological conditions. The docking results predicted that Marchantin E and Zeorin would potentially block the catalytic site of 3CL(pro) with the interaction energy values of -8.42 kcal/mol and -9.04 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, Usnic acid revealed its ability to combat the interaction of RBD of SGP to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in docking analysis. To certify the potent metabolites for both targets of SARS-CoV-2, MD analysis was performed for 100 ns. The results confirmed that Marchantin E could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) and RBD of SGP as well as reveals excellent pharmacokinetic properties. The present study suggests that the identified CSMs could be quickly positioned for further experimental validation to propose promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Prateeksha, G.; Rana, Tikam S.; Ashthana, Ashish K.; Barik, Saroj K.; Singh, Brahma N.",J Mol Struct,309,30

The N-protein interacts with viral genomic RNA and helps in packaging. As SARS-CoV-2 spread to almost all countries worldwide within 2–3 months, it also acquired mutations in its RNA genome. Therefore, this study was conducted with an aim to identify the variations present in N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we analysed 4,163 reported sequence of N-protein from United States of America (USA) and compared them with the first reported sequence from Wuhan, China. Our study identified 107 mutations that reside all over the N-protein. Further, we show the high rate of mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of N-protein. Our study show 45% residues of IDR2 harbour mutations. The RNA-binding domain (RBD) and dimerization domain of N-protein also have mutations at key residues. We further measured the effect of these mutations on N-protein stability and dynamicity and our data reveals that multiple mutations can cause considerable alterations. Altogether, our data strongly suggests that N-protein is one of the mutational hotspot proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that is changing rapidly and these mutations can potentially interferes with various aspects of N-protein functions including its interaction with RNA, oligomerization and signalling events.","Azad, Gajendra Kumar",PeerJ,309,12

In response to the pandemic threat of the coronavirus epidemic, several countries, including China, adopted lockdown and quarantine policies, which may cause psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China as well as the corresponding risk factors and protective factors. METHODS: We examined the immediate (2-week) and delayed (2-month) impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine on psychological distress in a national sample of 1390 Chinese residents. RESULTS: No immediate impact of province-wide lockdown on psychological distress was observed, whereas personal quarantine increased individuals’ anxiety, fear, and anger. Despite the lack of initial association, psychological distress increased among those in province-wide lockdown. Self-stigma and personal control both significantly moderated the association between lockdown and psychological distress, but in different directions. Those with higher self-stigma and lower personal control were more impacted by the lockdown. Government support moderated the impact of quarantine on psychological distress, but not that of lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed effects of lockdown and quarantine on psychological distress were observed, and self-stigma, social support, and perceived control moderate the relationships. This study is the first to demonstrate the psychological costs of province-wide lockdowns on individuals’ mental health, providing evidence of the need for mitigation strategies and timely public mental health preparedness in countries with recent outbreaks of COVID-19.","Gan, Yiqun; Ma, Jinjin; Wu, Jianhui; Chen, Yidi; Zhu, Huanya; Hall, Brian J.",Psychological medicine,309,16

However, the underlying mechanism of the disease development is largely unknown. There is no report on CFHR1 gene knockout in any animal infection model and its function in vivo is still unclear. Here, a Cfhr1 knockout mouse was generated for investigating AP in sepsis and sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). We found that murine FHR-1 homolog (FHR-E) deficiency enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AP activation both in vitro and in vivo and that Cfhr1 knockout mice exhibited more severe sepsis and AKI in response to LPS challenge. These results indicated that FHR-E deficiency promoted LPS-induced sepsis and AKI through AP over-activation, providing a mouse model for studying AP regulation and sepsis. This study revealed the function of FHR-E in vivo, which may further provide hints to the pathogenesis of FHR-1 deficiency-related diseases by enhancing LPS-induced AP activation.","Li, Xiangru; Hao, Zhenhua; Liu, Xiaorong; Li, Wei",Front Immunol,309,20

The aim of this research is to examine requirements on informed consent in biomedical research in Germany, Poland, and Russia to determine how each national regulatory framework relates to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. METHODS: For this analysis, we conducted a search of the legal databases “Gesetze im Internet” for Germany, “Internetowy System Aktow Prawnych” for Poland, and “ГAPAHT – Garant” for Russia. The search was complemented by a review of secondary literature contained in the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Polish National Library, and eLibrary.ru. We have identified 21 normative regulations containing provisions on informed consent in clinical research in all three countries. The content of these documents was systematically categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: The normative framework in all three countries shows a strong commitment towards the core ethical principles of research envisaged in the Declaration of Helsinki. Nevertheless, provisions on informed consent vary between these three countries. The differences range from the method and language in which information should be provided, through the amount of information required to be disclosed, to the form of documenting consent or withdrawal. In the case of research on vulnerable groups, these differences are particularly visible. CONCLUSIONS: The identified differences can negatively impact the ethical conduct of international clinical studies. Attention needs to be paid that flexibilities within national regulations are not misused to undermine the protection of research subjects.

For children with acute abdomen, we investigate main radiologic patterns, surgical treatment and intraoperative findings, outcomes. FINDINGS: One-thousand ten children were enrolled. Forty-two children (4.2%) had a clinical diagnosis of acute abdomen. Four (9.5%) were diagnosed with MIS-C and did not undergo surgery. The remaining 38 children (3.8%) underwent abdominal surgery due to suspected appendicitis, 34 of them (89.7%) had an intraoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis (AA), while 4 of them had nonsurgical findings. Eight children died (0.8%), none of them being diagnosed with appendicitis. Children with AA were significantly older than those without (P < 0.0001).

In COVID‐19 patients, baPWV (19.9 [18.4–21.0] vs. 16.0 [14.2–20.4], P = 0.02) and cfPWV (14.3 [13.4–16.0] vs. 11.0 [9.5–14.6], P = 0.01) were higher than in the controls. In multiple regression analysis, COVID‐19 was independently associated with higher cfPWV (β = 3.164, P = 0.004) and baPWV (β = 3.532, P = 0.003). PWV values were higher in nonsurvivors. In survivors, PWV correlated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 appears to be related to an enhanced PWV reflecting an increase in arterial stiffness. Higher PWV might be related to an increased length of hospital stay and mortality.","Schnaubelt, S.; Oppenauer, J.; Tihanyi, D.; Mueller, M.; Maldonado‐Gonzalez, E.; Zejnilovic, S.; Haslacher, H.; Perkmann, T.; Strassl, R.; Anders, S.; Stefenelli, T.; Zehetmayer, S.; Koppensteiner, R.; Domanovits, H.; Schlager, O.",J Intern Med,309,17

In this paper, a hybrid learning framework is developed to forecast multi-step-ahead (one, two and three-month-ahead) meningitis cases in four states of Brazil. First, the proposed approach applies an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the data into intrinsic mode functions and residual components. Then, each component is used as the input of five different forecasting models, and, from there, forecasted results are obtained. Finally, all combinations of models and components are developed, and for each case, the forecasted results are weighted integrated (WI) to formulate a heterogeneous ensemble forecaster for the monthly meningitis cases. In the final stage, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm – version II is employed to find a set of candidates’ weights, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to choose the adequate set of weights. Next, the most adequate model is the one with the best generalization capacity out-of-sample in terms of performance criteria including mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE). By using MOO, the intention is to enhance the performance of the forecasting models by improving simultaneously their accuracy and stability measures. To access the model’s performance, comparisons based on metrics are conducted with: (i) EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble integrated by direct strategy, or simple sum; (ii) EEMD, homogeneous ensemble of components WI; (iii) models without signal decomposition. At this stage, MAE, RRMSE, sMAPE criteria and Diebold–Mariano statistical test are adopted. In all twelve scenarios, the proposed framework was able to perform more accurate and stable forecasts, which showed, on 89.17% of the cases, that the errors of the proposed approach are statistically lower than other approaches. These results showed that combining EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble and WI with weights obtained by optimization can develop precise and stable forecasts. The modelling developed in this paper is promising and can be used by managers to support decision making.","Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin; Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos",J Biomed Inform,309,16

The prescribing of these medications is complicated by sub-optimal efficacy and high rates of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These both contribute to poor levels of adherence. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) considers how genetic variation can influence an individual’s response to a drug. Pharmacogenetic testing is a tool that could aid clinicians when selecting psychotropic medications, as part of a more personalized approach to prescribing. This may improve the use of and adherence to these medications. Yet to date, the implementation of PGx in mental health environments in the United Kingdom has been slow. This review aims to identify the current barriers and enablers to the implementation of PGx in psychiatry and determine how this can be applied to the uptake of PGx by NHS mental health providers. A systematic searching strategy was developed, and searches were carried out on the PsychInfo, EmBase, and PubMed databases, yielding 11 appropriate papers. Common barriers to the implementation of PGx included cost, concerns over incorporation into current workflow and a lack of knowledge about PGx; whilst frequent enablers included optimism that PGx could lead to precision medicine, reduce ADRs and become a more routine part of psychiatric clinical care. The uptake of PGx in psychiatric care settings in the NHS should consider and overcome these barriers, while looking to capitalize on the enablers identified in this review.","Jameson, Adam; Fylan, Beth; Bristow, Greg C.; Sagoo, Gurdeep S.; Dalton, Caroline; Cardno, Alastair; Sohal, Jaspreet; McLean, Samantha L.",Front Genet,309,1

However, clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated AKI are poorly described. We present two cases of severe COVID-19 patients with AKI. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old woman was suspected of having vancomycin-associated AKI, and a 45-year-old man was suspected of having heme pigment-induced AKI caused by rhabdomyolysis. The granular cast, which is known to be a valuable diagnostic tool for confirming the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis, was detected in both patients at the onset of AKI. Interestingly, both patients also developed microscopic hematuria at the occurrence of AKI, and one patient had elevated d-dimer and low platelet levels simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Some reports suggested that COVID-19-associated microangiopathy contributed to the kidney damage. Therefore, it is possible that our patients might have accompanied renal microangiopathy, and that this pathological background may have caused exaggerated tubular damage by vancomycin or heme pigment. The etiology of AKI in patients with COVID-19 is multifactorial. Superimposition of nephrotoxin(s) and virus-associate intra-renal microangiopathy may be a crucial trigger of kidney injury leading to severe AKI in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in COVID-19 patients, risk factors for AKI should be taken into consideration to prevent its progression into severe AKI.","Fujimaru, Takuya; Shimada, Keiki; Hamada, Takayuki; Watanabe, Kimio; Ito, Yugo; Nagahama, Masahiko; Taki, Fumika; Isokawa, Shutaro; Hifumi, Toru; Otani, Norio; Nakayama, Masaaki",Ren Replace Ther,309,20

Pharmacotherapy for respiratory viruses has largely been unsuccessful with the exception of early treatment of influenza viruses, which shortens symptom duration and prevents infection in close contacts. Under the rapidly evolving circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, most clinical trials of experimental treatments in the United States have focused on later stages of the disease process. Worldwide, the clinical studies of the most impactful drugs, remdesivir and dexamethasone in ACTT-1, RECOVERY, and Solidarity, have studied hospitalized patients. Less than half of clinical trials in the U.S. have investigated oral agents, and the majority have taken place in hospitals at a disease stage where the viral load is already decreasing. The limited success of treatments for respiratory viruses and the viral dynamics of COVID-19 suggest that an antiviral therapy with the greatest impact against pandemic coronaviruses would be orally administered, well-tolerated, target a highly conserved viral protein or host-coronavirus interaction and could be used effectively throughout the world, including resource-poor settings. We examine the treatment of respiratory viral infections and current clinical trials for COVID-19 to provide a framework for effective antiviral therapy and prevention of future emergent coronaviruses and call attention to the need for continued preclinical drug discovery.","Villamagna, Angela Holly; Gore, Sara J.; Lewis, James S.; Doggett, J.

Concerted action to mitigate shocking levels of inequality could be a powerful antidote to nationalist populism. A basic yet critical start to addressing health inequalities is to recognize them, which demands improving data collection and analysis.

Complete sequencing of many genomes provides the opportunity to study and compare global information properties of those genomes. RESULTS: We have analyzed aspects of the information content of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli (K-12) genomes. Virtually all possible (> 98%) 12 bp oligomers appear in vertebrate genomes while < 2% of 19 bp oligomers are present. Other species showed different ranges of > 98% to < 2% of possible oligomers in D. melanogaster (12–17 bp), C. elegans (11–17 bp), A. thaliana (11–17 bp), S. cerevisiae (10–16 bp) and E. coli (9–15 bp). Frequencies of unique oligomers in the genomes follow similar patterns. We identified a set of 2.6 M 15-mers that are more than 1 nucleotide different from all 15-mers in the human genome and so could be used as probes to detect microbes in human samples. In a human sample, these probes would detect 100% of the 433 currently fully sequenced prokaryotes and 75% of the 3065 fully sequenced viruses. The human genome is significantly more compact in sequence space than a random genome. We identified the most frequent 5- to 20-mers in the human genome, which may prove useful as PCR primers. We also identified a bacterium, Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, which has an exceptionally low diversity of oligomers given the size of its genome and its GC content. The entropy of coding regions in the human genome is significantly higher than non-coding regions and chromosomes. However chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 12 and 14 have a relatively high proportion of coding DNA without high entropy, and chromosome 20 is the opposite with a low frequency of coding regions but relatively high entropy. CONCLUSION: Measures of the frequency of oligomers are useful for designing PCR assays and for identifying chromosomes and organisms with hidden structure that had not been previously recognized. This information may be used to detect novel microbes in human tissues.","Liu, Zhandong; Venkatesh, Santosh S; Maley, Carlo C",BMC Genomics,309,17

Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general adult population as well as samples from COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that these assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as two days post COVID19 symptoms onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Such serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers may, in the future, also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.","Amanat, Fatima; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Strohmeier, Shirin; Nguyen, Thi H.O.; Chromikova, Veronika; McMahon, Meagan; Jiang, Kaijun; Asthagiri Arunkumar, Guha; Jurczyszak, Denise; Polanco, Jose; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Kleiner, Giulio; Aydillo, Teresa; Miorin, Lisa; Fierer, Daniel; Amarilis Lugo, Luz; Milunka Kojic, Erna; Stoever, Jonathan; Liu, Sean T.

Engaged curiosity toward each patient is a source of meaning and connection for health care providers, and it protects against sympathetic distress and burnout. In a prolonged crisis like Covid‐19, clinicians provide care out of a sense of duty, especially the duty of nonabandonment. We argue that when duty alone is relied on too heavily, with fear and frustration continually suppressed, the risk of burnout is dramatically increased. Even before Covid‐19, clinicians often worked under dehumanizing and unjust conditions, and rates of burnout were 50 percent for physicians and 33 percent for nurses.

However, with the development of new tools to detect non-culturable environmental microorganisms, the study of bioaerosols has advanced significantly. Most importantly, these techniques have revealed a more complex bioaerosol burden that also includes non-culturable microorganisms, such as archaea and viruses.

METHODS: Pediatric patients with symptoms of URI had nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples obtained prospectively between January and April and September and December 2010 for small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) multiplex nucleic acid testing. NP swabs or nasal washes were obtained for viral culture and rapid antigen testing (RAT). RESULTS: Of 499 evaluable SVPCR array RP samples, 344 (69%) tested positive for at least 1 of the 21 tested organisms. The most commonly identified pathogen was rhinovirus/enterovirus (181/344 [53%]) for which no RAT exists at CHM. Of 344 positive specimens, 57 (17%) had at least 2 identified pathogens; 8 (2%) of these had 3. In 11% of patients, molecular testing detected pathogens or pathogen combinations requiring both contact and droplet precautions. CONCLUSION: SVPCR array RP testing detected respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients with URI at rates higher than that of RAT and viral culture. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected, the study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions may be warranted to prevent health care-associated infection in pediatric inpatients with URI.

In this Commentary, we briefly describe how people with OUD are at increased risk for COVID-19, discuss existing policy barriers to evidence-based prevention and treatment for individuals with OUD, explain the temporary rollbacks of those barriers, and argue that these changes should be made permanent. We also suggest several additional steps that federal and state governments can urgently take to reduce barriers to care for individuals with OUD, both during the current crisis and beyond.","Davis, Corey S.; Samuels, Elizabeth A.",J Addict Med,309,2

However, these drugs may have side effects such as hearing loss. This study aimed to describe the hearing function in SLE patients using antimalarials. Secondarily, this study aimed to investigate whether SLE causes hearing loss and if there are any serological or clinical aspects of this diseases associated with inner ear damage. STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: This study included 84 individuals (43 SLE patients and 41 controls) with audiometry and tympanometry tests. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and treatment profiles of SLE patients were extracted from the charts. RESULTS: SLE patients had more sensorineural hearing loss than controls (23.2% vs. 0; P = .001). Pure‐tone averages in SLE patients using antimalarials and not using antimalarials were similar (8.75 vs. 8.75; P = .63). At 8,000 Hz, antimalarial dug nonusers performed worse than users (10.00 vs. 22.50; P = .03). Tympanometry was normal in all participants. SLE serological and clinical profiles in patients with and without hearing loss were the same (all P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of hearing loss in SLE that is not affected by antimalarial drug use.

Although an efficacious vaccine for HEV has been developed, we lack key epidemiologic data needed to understand how best to use the vaccine for hepatitis E control in endemic countries. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published on hepatitis E in low-income and lower-middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify articles with data on anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig)G seroprevalence, outbreaks of HEV, or risk factors for HEV infection, disease, or death, and all relevant data were extracted. Using these data we describe the evidence around temporal and geographical distribution of HEV transmission and burden. We estimated pooled age-specific seroprevalence and assessed the consistency in risk factor estimates. RESULTS: We extracted data from 148 studies. Studies assessing anti-HEV IgG antibodies used 18 different commercial assays. Most cases of hepatitis E during outbreaks were not confirmed. Risk factor data suggested an increased likelihood of current or recent HEV infection and disease associated with fecal-oral transmission of HEV, as well as exposures to blood and animals. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in diagnostic assays used and exposure and outcome assessment methods hinder public health efforts to quantify burden of disease and evaluate interventions over time and space. Prevention tools such as vaccines are available, but they require a unified global strategy for hepatitis E control to justify widespread use.","Koyuncu, Aybüke; Mapemba, Daniel; Ciglenecki, Iza; Gurley, Emily S; Azman, Andrew S",Open Forum Infect Dis,309,20

At the peak of the pandemic, trauma and orthopaedic services at our institutions undertook internal restructuring, diverting resources to frontline medical care. Consequently, we sought to assess the impact on the elderly and comorbid patients presenting with femoral neck fractures, with a particular focus on 30-day mortality, length of stay, multidisciplinary team involvement and departmental structuring. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of patients presenting with femoral neck fractures at three separate West London NHS Trusts was undertaken between March 11, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Length of stay, 30-day mortality and adherence to parameters constituting the best care evidence-based practice tariffs were compared between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and negative patients. A similar comparison was also conducted between our cohort and the equivalent period in 2018 using data from the National Hip Fracture Database. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients presenting with femoral neck fractures were identified, mean age 81 (range 38–98), 73% female. There were 10 confirmed/suspected cases of COVID-19 on admission and a further seven confirmed as inpatients. The 30-day mortality within our cohort was 11.76% compared to 6% nationally in 2018 (p = 0.045). Orthogeriatric reviews occurred within 72 h in 71% of cases compared to 88% in the equivalent 2018 period. Within the cohort, mean length of stay was 17.13 days (SD 5.6, range 8-27 days) for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared to 10 days (SD 8.7, range 1–53 days) for negative patients (p < 0.05). Thirty-two patients (47%) required increased packages of care on discharge or rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in 30-day mortality for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting with femoral neck fractures is multifactorial, resulting from a combination of the direct effects of COVID-19 pneumonia as well as changes to the delivery of orthopaedic services. The provision of multidisciplinary care was directly affected by staff redeployment, particularly reorganisation of orthogeriatric services and lack of continuity of ward based clinical care. Our experiences have re-directed efforts towards the management of theatre teams, patient services and staffing, should we be faced with either a resurgence of COVID-19 or a future pandemic.","Wright, Esther Victoria; Musbahi, Omar; Singh, Abhinav; Somashekar, Naresh; Huber, Christopher P.; Wiik, Anatole Vilhelm",Patient Saf Surg,309,3

A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves. A case–control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms. A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms. Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99(+), Clostridium perfringens with β toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. More than a half of the fecal samples from the diarrheic calves had multiple pathogens. Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99(+), and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p < 0.05). Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9). Unexpectedly BNoV (OR = 2.0) and Nebovirus (OR = 16.7) were identified with high frequency in diarrheic calves, suggesting these viruses may have a significant contribution to calf diarrhea.","Cho, Yong-Il; Han, Jae-Ik; Wang, Chong; Cooper, Vickie; Schwartz, Kent; Engelken, Terry; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin",Vet Microbiol,309,30

It can be implemented with widely used two-step methods or one-step methods, such as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Existing simulation studies have shown that GLMMs outperform the two-step methods in some settings. It is, however, unclear whether these simulation settings are common in the real world. We aim to compare the real-world performance of various meta-analysis methods for synthesizing proportions. METHODS: We extracted datasets of proportions from the Cochrane Library and applied 12 two-step and one-step methods to each dataset. We used Spearman’s ρ and the Bland–Altman plot to assess their results’ correlation and agreement. The GLMM with the logit link was chosen as the reference method. We calculated the absolute difference and fold change (ratio of estimates) of the overall proportion estimates produced by each method vs. the reference method. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 43,644 datasets. The various methods generally had high correlations (ρ > 0.9) and agreements. GLMMs had computational issues more frequently than the two-step methods. However, the two-step methods generally produced large absolute differences from the GLMM with the logit link for small total sample sizes (< 50) and crude event rates within 10–20% and 90–95%, and large fold changes for small total event counts (< 10) and low crude event rates (< 20%). CONCLUSIONS: Although different methods produced similar overall proportion estimates in most datasets, one-step methods should be considered in the presence of small total event counts or sample sizes and very low or high event rates.

This study also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a negative-pressure environment around the face in preventing the escape of small aerosolized particles. STUDY DESIGN: This study is an evaluation study with specific methodology described below. SETTING: This study was performed in our institution’s fresh tissue laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A fixed cadaver head was placed in a controlled environment with a black background, and small-particle aerosols were created using joss incense sticks (mass-median aerosol diameter of 0.28 µ). Smoke was passed through the cadaver head, and images were taken with a high-resolution camera in a standardized manner. Digital image processing was used to calculate relative amounts of small-particle escape from a variety of masks, including a standard surgical mask, a modified Ambu mask, and our negative airway pressure respirator (NAPR). RESULTS: Significant amounts of aerosolized particles escaped during the trials with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and the NAPR without suction. When suction was applied to the NAPR, creating a negative-pressure system, no particle escape was noted. CONCLUSION: We present a new and effective method for the study of small-particle aerosols as a step toward better understanding the spread of these particles and the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019. We also present the concept of an NAPR to better protect health care workers from aerosols generated from the upper and lower airways.","Khoury, Tawfiq; Lavergne, Pascal; Chitguppi, Chandala; Rabinowitz, Mindy; Nyquist, Gurston; Rosen, Marc; Evans, James",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,309,21

Analyses of model transporters and receptors from different organisms, and with widely different biological functions, indicate common structure-sequence motifs at internal proton-binding sites. Proton-binding dynamic hydrogen-bond networks that are exposed to the bulk might provide alternative proton-binding sites and proton-binding pathways. In this perspective article I discuss protonation coupling and proton binding at internal and external carboxylate sites of proteins that use proton transfer for function. An inter-helical carboxylate-hydroxyl hydrogen-bond motif is present at functionally important sites of membrane proteins from archaea to the brain.

In vv-infected cells cytoplasmically synthesized vv core proteins became disulfide bonded in the newly assembled intracellular mature viruses (IMVs). vv membrane proteins also assembled disulfide bonds, but independent of IMV formation and to a large extent on their cytoplasmic domains. If disulfide bonding was prevented, virus assembly was only partially impaired as shown by electron microscopy as well as a biochemical assay of IMV formation. Under these conditions, however, the membranes around the isolated particles appeared less stable and detached from the underlying core. During the viral infection process the membrane proteins remained disulfide bonded, whereas the core proteins were reduced, concomitant with delivery of the cores into the cytoplasm. Our data show that vv has evolved an unique system for the assembly of cytoplasmic disulfide bonds that are localized both on the exterior and interior parts of the IMV.","Locker, Jacomine Krijnse; Griffiths, Gareth",J Cell Biol,309,2

Every year the number of publications and patents based on this polymer increase. Chitosan exhibits poor solubility in neutral and basic media, limiting its use in such conditions. Another serious obstacle is directly related to its natural origin. Chitosan is not a single polymer with a defined structure but a family of molecules with differences in their composition, size, and monomer distribution. These properties have a fundamental effect on the biological and technological performance of the polymer. Moreover, some of the biological properties claimed are discrete. In this review, we discuss how chitosan chemistry can solve the problems related to its poor solubility and can boost the polymer properties. We focus on some of the main biological properties of chitosan and the relationship with the physicochemical properties of the polymer. Then, we review two polymer applications related to green processes: the use of chitosan in the green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles and its use as support for biocatalysts. Finally, we briefly describe how making use of the technological properties of chitosan makes it possible to develop a variety of systems for drug delivery.","Aranaz, Inmaculada; Alcántara, Andrés R.; Civera, Maria Concepción; Arias, Concepción; Elorza, Begoña; Heras Caballero, Angeles; Acosta, Niuris",Polymers (Basel),309,4

We calculated associations of ADMA and SDMA with mortality and organ failure, and we developed a predictive algorithm based upon these biomarkers to predict mortality risk. Nine patients (29%) experienced in-hospital death. SDMA and ADMA serum concentrations were significantly higher at admission in COVID-19 patients who died than in survivors. Cut-offs of 0.90 µmol/L for SDMA (AUC, 0.904, p = 0.0005) and 0.66 µmol/L for ADMA (AUC, 0.874, p = 0.0013) were found in ROC analyses to best discriminate both subgroups of patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to survey empirical scholarly literature on the application of algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives to identify the legal and ethical issues that have been raised. METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies on the application of algorithmic technologies in mental health care in the Scopus, Embase, and Association for Computing Machinery databases. A total of 1078 relevant peer-reviewed applied studies were identified, which were narrowed to 132 empirical research papers for review based on selection criteria. Conventional content analysis was undertaken to address our aims, and this was supplemented by a keyword-in-context analysis. RESULTS: We grouped the findings into the following five categories of technology: social media (53/132, 40.1%), smartphones (37/132, 28%), sensing technology (20/132, 15.1%), chatbots (5/132, 3.8%), and miscellaneous (17/132, 12.9%). Most initiatives were directed toward detection and diagnosis. Most papers discussed privacy, mainly in terms of respecting the privacy of research participants. There was relatively little discussion of privacy in this context. A small number of studies discussed ethics directly (10/132, 7.6%) and indirectly (10/132, 7.6%). Legal issues were not substantively discussed in any studies, although some legal issues were discussed in passing (7/132, 5.3%), such as the rights of user subjects and privacy law compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and legal issues tend to not be explicitly addressed in empirical studies on algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives. Scholars may have considered ethical or legal matters at the ethics committee or institutional review board stage. If so, this consideration seldom appears in published materials in applied research in any detail. The form itself of peer-reviewed papers that detail applied research in this field may well preclude a substantial focus on ethics and law. Regardless, we identified several concerns, including the near-complete lack of involvement of mental health service users, the scant consideration of algorithmic accountability, and the potential for overmedicalization and techno-solutionism. Most papers were published in the computer science field at the pilot or exploratory stages. Thus, these technologies could be appropriated into practice in rarely acknowledged ways, with serious legal and ethical implications.","Gooding, Piers; Kariotis, Timothy",JMIR Ment Health,309,12
