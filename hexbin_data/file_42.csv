It remains unclear if sylvatic cycles exist or could establish themselves elsewhere and contribute to the epidemiology of these diseases. The Caribbean island of St. Kitts has a large African green monkey (AGM) (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) population and is therefore ideally suited to investigate sylvatic cycles. METHODS: We tested 858 AGM sera by ELISA and PRNT for virus-specific antibodies and collected and identified 9704 potential arbovirus vector mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were homogenized in 513 pools for testing by viral isolation in cell culture and by multiplex RT-qPCR after RNA extraction to detect the presence of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKVs. DNA was extracted from 122 visibly blood-fed individual mosquitoes and a polymorphic region of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS) was amplified by PCR to determine if mosquitoes had fed on AGMs or humans. RESULTS: All of the AGMs were negative for DENV, CHIKV or ZIKV antibodies. However, one AGM did have evidence of an undifferentiated Flavivirus infection. Similarly, DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV were not detected in any of the mosquito pools by PCR or culture. AGMs were not the source of any of the mosquito blood meals. CONCLUSION: Sylvatic cycles involving AGMs and DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV do not currently exist on St. Kitts.

Our quality improvement initiative developed and implemented a novel symptom management and family support checklist and post-debriefing template to improve team communication and staff support. STUDY DESIGN: An interprofessional team performed a needs assessment, determined key drivers and intervention steps, and implemented changes using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. Outcomes included nursing perception of good communication with the medical team, nursing assessment of patient comfort after CE, and frequency of post-event debrief. Outcomes were analyzed using time series design with 12 months baseline data and 6 months post-implementation monitoring. RESULT: Eighteen events were studied. Respondents endorsing “good” communication with the medical team increased by 60%, and debrief participation rate improved by 96%. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a CE checklist and post-event debriefing sheet was associated with increased rate of debriefs and improved team communication.","Donoho, Kelsey; Fossa, Mallory; Dabagh, Sarah; Caliboso, Menchie; Lotstein, Debra; Nair, Srikumar",J Perinatol,42,22

These reflect physical and radiological disease activity and are the most relevant endpoints in clinical trials. Over the past few years, the number of studies evaluating so-called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been increasing. PROs are reports from patients concerning their own health perception. They are typically obtained by means of questionnaires and aim to quantify symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction. The emergence of PROs has made a tremendous contribution to understanding the individual impact of disease in people with MS and their health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of PROs consumes resources, including time and personnel. Thus, useful ways to conveniently introduce PROs into clinical practice are needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a rationale and pilot study protocol for a mobile health (mHealth) solution named “haMSter” that allows for remote monitoring of PROs in people with MS. METHODS: The core function of haMSter is to provide three scientifically validated PRO questionnaires relevant to MS for patients to fill out at home once a month. Thereby, longitudinal and remote documentation of PROs is enabled. A scoring algorithm graphically plots PRO scores over time and makes them available at the next visit. RESULTS: The pilot study is currently ongoing and will evaluate adherence to this mHealth solution in 50 patients over a period of 6 months. Results from the haMSter pilot study are expected in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: haMSter is a novel mHealth-based solution for modern PRO research, which may constitute the first step in achieving the ability to integrate PROs in clinical practice. This allows for a more problem-oriented approach in monitoring visits, which addresses patient needs and ultimately saves time.

In this paper, we clustered brain MRI images to detect tumor location. To obtain perfect results, we presented an unsupervised robust PCA algorithm to clustered images. The proposed method clusters brain MR image pixels to four leverages. The algorithm is implemented for five brain diseases such as glioma, Huntington, meningioma, Pick, and Alzheimer's. We used ten images of each disease to validate the optimal identification rate. According to the results obtained, 2% of the data in the bad leverage part of the image were determined, which acceptably discerned the tumor. Results show that this method has the potential to detect tumor location for brain disease with high sensitivity. Moreover, results show that the method for the Glioma images has approximately better results than others. However, according to the ROC curve for all selected diseases, the present method can find lesion location.","Hamzenejad, Ali; Ghoushchi, Saeid Jafarzadeh; Baradaran, Vahid",Biomed Res Int,42,22

This was a mixed-method feasibility assessment of an 8-week WhatsApp-based maternal support group for mothers of toddlers (12–18 months of age) enrolled in a birth cohort study in Southern Brazil. Daily messages and weekly activities were sent by moderators to promote maternal–child outcomes: child nutrition, child sleep, nurturing care, and maternal psychosocial well-being (assessed pre- and post-intervention via self-reported questionnaire). The implementation and engagement of the mothers in the program were assessed by message extraction. Acceptability was evaluated through in-depth interviews (n = 5) and open-ended surveys (n = 10). 1481 messages were exchanged in 3 WhatsApp groups (n = 30 mothers). Mothers were most active on weekdays (68.6% of messages sent on Tuesdays and 72.6% on Thursdays), afternoons (2:00–4:00pm), and evenings (9:00–11:00 pm). Engagement was higher at weeks 1–4. Mothers enjoyed and considered topics relevant. Group interaction was perceived as low, which influenced their participation. The prevalence of depression symptoms decreased from pre- to post-intervention (9% to 5%; P = .04). A moderated mobile-based support group for mothers of toddlers was feasible. mHealth services to promote maternal support are a promising strategy to improve maternal–child outcomes, but engagement and use of the service remains a challenge. Program managers should work with community members to identify ways to support engagement and participation throughout the intervention.","Trude, Angela C.

The aim of this study was to assess current evidence to determine whether antiviral therapy is associated with better outcomes in these patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Database and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 25 May 2020. All clinical studies investigating the effects of antiviral therapy on the outcome of mechanically ventilated ICU patients in whom HSV was detected in the respiratory tract were eligible for inclusion, regardless of study design, publication status or language. Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently by two authors. If the articles seemed eligible, full-text articles were reviewed and data extracted. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary endpoint was hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (one randomized controlled trial, eight cohort studies). Antiviral treatment was associated with lower hospital mortality (with antiviral treatment, 40.6% (189 out of 465 patients); without, 52.7% (193 out of 366 patients); RR 0.74 [0.64, 0.85]; eight studies, low quality of evidence). Furthermore, antiviral treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality (RR 0.75 [0.59, 0.94]; three studies, very low quality of evidence). We did not observe evidence for differences in ICU mortality (RR 0.73 [0.51, 1.05]; three studies, very low quality of evidence). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of the available data shows that antiviral therapy might result in lower hospital and 30-day all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated ICU patients who are positive for HSV in the respiratory tract. However, this result must be interpreted with great caution due to the high risk of bias and limited number of patients. Large, well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials are urgently needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in advance on International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020180053).","Hagel, Stefan; Scherag, André; Schuierer, Lukas; Hoffmann, Reinhard; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Pletz, Mathias W.; Kesselmeier, Miriam; Weis, Sebastian",Crit Care,42,22

In addition, cross-reactive CD8 T cells induced by dengue virus (DENV) have been shown to play a protective role against Zika virus (ZIKV). However, how JEV exposure or vaccination affects ZIKV infection in humans remains unclear. In this report, epitope prediction algorithms were used to predict the cross-reactive CD8 T cell epitope restricted to human HLA between JEV and ZIKV. We found that these predicted CD8 T cell epitopes are immunogenic and cross-reactive in humanized HLA transgenic mice. Moreover, JEV vaccine immunization provided cross-protection against ZIKV infection. Furthermore, CD8 T cells were involved in the protection against ZKIV infection in vivo. Our results have an important clinical implication that vaccination with JEV SA14-14-2 may provide protection against ZIKV infection in humans.","Tarbe, Marion; Dong, Wei; Hu, Guang; Xu, Yongfen; Sun, Jing; Grayo, Solene; Chen, Xianyang; Qin, Chengfeng; Zhao, Jincun; Liu, Li; Li, Xiuzhen; Leng, Qibin",Front Immunol,42,12

Medium-term follow-up will generate knowledge and help in devising a structured follow-up plan and to facilitate enrolment in clinical trials assessing the role of antifibrotic drugs in modifying the course of disease in order to avert long-term pulmonary sequelae of disease. The study was aimed to evaluate the lung findings on a medium-term follow-up (3 months or more) chest computed tomography (CT) in COVID-19 pneumonia survivors, assess the rate of resolution or persistence of lung abnormalities and to identify the initial demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics that could potentially predict the persistence of lung abnormalities on follow-up. RESULTS: Out of the total study cohort of 81 patients, 46 (56.8%) demonstrated complete resolution of lung findings and the remaining 35 (43.2%) had residual lung opacities on follow-up CT. The most common type of residual abnormality was ground glass opacity (GGO) (16/35; 45.7%), followed by parenchymal bands (9/35; 25.7%), mixed pattern of GGO and parenchymal bands (6/35; 17.2%), bronchiectasis (6/35; 17.2%), and interlobular septal thickening (4/35; 11.4%). Patients with residual abnormalities were older, had higher BMI, more comorbidities, lower SpO2, longer hospital stay, higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, higher WBC count, a higher CT severity score, and lower rate of steroid administration with all p values < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of post-COVID-19 survivors had residual lung abnormalities after ≥ 3 months of follow-up. Certain clinico-radiological characteristics have the potential to identify the individuals at risk of having residual lung abnormalities on medium-term follow-up.","Parry, Arshed Hussain; Wani, Abdul Haseeb; Shah, Naveed Nazir; Jehangir, Majid",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,42,1

These formats gained popularity in the consumer markets due to their compactness, portability and facile interpretation without external instrumentation. However, lack of quantitation in measurements has challenged the demand of existing assay formats in consumer markets. Recently, paper-based microfluidics has emerged as a multiplexable point-of-care platform which might transcend the capabilities of existing assays in resource-limited settings. However, paper-based microfluidics can enable fluid handling and quantitative analysis for potential applications in healthcare, veterinary medicine, environmental monitoring and food safety. Currently, in its early development stages, paper-based microfluidics is considered a low-cost, lightweight, and disposable technology. The aim of this review is to discuss: (1) fabrication of paper-based microfluidic devices, (2) functionalisation of microfluidic components to increase the capabilities and the performance, (3) introduction of existing detection techniques to the paper platform and (4) exploration of extracting quantitative readouts via handheld devices and camera phones. Additionally, this review includes challenges to scaling up, commercialisation and regulatory issues. The factors which limit paper-based microfluidic devices to become real world products and future directions are also identified.","Yetisen, Ali Kemal; Akram, Muhammad Safwan; Lowe, Christopher R",Lab on a chip,42,1

This review addresses oxygen transport mechanisms at the microcirculatory scale, and how hypoxia may occur in spite of adequate convective oxygen supply. The structure of the microcirculation is intrinsically heterogeneous, with wide variations in vessel diameters and flow pathway lengths, and consequently also in blood flow rates and oxygen levels. The dynamic processes of structural adaptation and flow regulation continually adjust microvessel diameters to compensate for heterogeneity, redistributing flow according to metabolic needs to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation. A key role in flow regulation is played by conducted responses, which are generated and propagated by endothelial cells and signal upstream arterioles to dilate in response to local hypoxia. Several pathophysiological conditions can impair local flow regulation, causing hypoxia and tissue damage leading to organ failure. Therapeutic measures targeted to systemic parameters may not address or may even worsen tissue oxygenation at the microvascular level. Restoration of tissue oxygenation in critically ill patients may depend on restoration of endothelial cell function, including conducted responses.","Roy, Tuhin K; Secomb, Timothy W",Microcirculation,42,1

A mediation model was proposed whereby the association between symptoms of depression and patient safety perceptions was mediated by burnout. BACKGROUND There is growing interest in the relationships between depressive symptoms and burnout in healthcare staff and the safety of patient care. Depressive symptoms are higher in healthcare staff than the general population and overlap conceptually with burnout. However, minimal research has investigated these variables in nurses. Given the conceptual overlap between depressive symptoms and burnout, there is also a need for an explanatory model outlining the relative contributions of these factors to patient safety. DESIGN A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed at three acute NHS Trusts. METHOD Three-hundred and twenty-three hospital nursing staff completed measures of depressive symptoms, burnout and patient safety perceptions (including measures at the level of the individual and the work area/unit) between December 2015 - February 2016. RESULTS When tested in separate analyses, depressive symptoms and burnout facets were each associated with both patient safety measures. Furthermore, the proposed mediation model was supported, with associations between depressive symptoms and patient safety perceptions fully mediated by burnout. CONCLUSION These results suggest that symptoms of depression and burnout in hospital nurses may have implications for patient safety. However, interventions to improve patient safety may be best targeted at improving burnout in particular, with burnout interventions known to be most effective when focused at both the individual and the organisational level.","Johnson, Judith; Louch, Gemma; Dunning, Alice; Johnson, Olivia; Grange, Angela; Reynolds, Caroline; Hall, Louise; O'Hara, Jane",Journal of advanced nursing,42,6

This study aims to evaluate variation in complication and failure to rescue rates among hospitals that perform pulmonary resection for lung cancer. METHODS By using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database, a retrospective, multicenter cohort study was performed of adult patients with lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection. Hospitals participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database were ranked by their risk-adjusted, standardized mortality ratio (using random effects logistic regression) and grouped into quintiles. Complication and failure to rescue rates were evaluated across 5 groups (very low, low, medium, high, and very high mortality hospitals). RESULTS Between 2009 and 2012, there were 30,000 patients cared for at 208 institutions participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database (median age, 68 years; 53% were women, 87% were white, 71% underwent lobectomy, 65% had stage I). Mortality rates varied over 4-fold across hospitals (3.2% vs 0.7%). Complication rates occurred more frequently at hospitals with higher mortality (42% vs 34%, P < .001). However, the magnitude of variation (22%) in complication rates dwarfed the 4-fold magnitude of variation in failure to rescue rates (6.8% vs 1.7%, P < .001) across hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Variation in hospital mortality seems to be more strongly related to rescuing patients from complications than to the occurrence of complications. This observation is significant because it redirects quality improvement and health policy initiatives to more closely examine and support system-level changes in care delivery that facilitate early detection and treatment of complications.","Farjah, Farhood; Backhus, Leah; Cheng, Aaron; Englum, Brian; Kim, Sunghee; Saha-Chaudhuri, Paramita; Wood, Douglas E; Mulligan, Michael S; Varghese, Thomas K",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,42,16

Using data from our calculations we construct phase diagrams for the two metals in the region of very high compressions and obtain their melting curves. For tin at pressures <100 GPa and zero temperature, we did not find the region of stability of the body-centered orthorhombic (bco) phase, as it was earlier observed in experiments by Salamat et al. [Phys Rev. B 88, 104104 (2013)]. Our calculations suggest that one structural transition from the tetragonal to cubic phase, bct→bcc, occurs in perfect Sn crystal at T=0 K in the pressure range of about 27-32 GPa. But any deviation from perfection may cause an orthorhombic distortion of its tetragonal phase. At pressures above 100 GPa, the bcc→hcp transition exists in both metals, and the phase boundary has a domed shape and does not rise in temperature above 2 kK. This behavior of the phase boundary with the increasing temperature is caused by the softer phonon modes of the bcc structure and the smaller contribution of lattice vibrations to the free energy of the crystal compared to the hcp phase. At pressures above 2.5 TPa and T≤1 kK, lead can also undergo another structural transition, hcp→fcc, but at Т>1.5 kK there must exist the more energetically preferable bcc→fcc transition.","Smirnov, Nikolai A",Journal of physics.

We conducted influenza A virus surveillance among four bat species in Egypt. Out of 1,202 swab specimens, 105 were positive by real-time PCR. A virus was successfully isolated in eggs and propagated in MDCK cells in the presence of N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Genomic analysis revealed that the virus was phylogenetically distinct from all other influenza A viruses. Analysis of the hemagglutinin gene suggested a common ancestry with other H9 viruses, and the virus showed a low level of cross-reactivity with serum raised against H9N2 viruses. Bats were seropositive for the isolated viruses. The virus replicated in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. While it is genetically distinct, this virus shares several avian influenza virus characteristics suggesting a more recent avian host origin.IMPORTANCE Through surveillance, we isolated and characterized an influenza A virus from Egyptian fruit bats. This virus had an affinity to avian-like receptors but was also able to infect mice. Our findings indicate that bats may harbor a diversity of influenza A viruses. Such viruses may have the potential to cross the species barrier to infect other species, including domestic birds, mammals, and, possibly, humans.","Kandeil, Ahmed; Gomaa, Mokhtar R; Shehata, Mahmoud M; El Taweel, Ahmed N; Mahmoud, Sara H; Bagato, Ola; Moatasim, Yassmin; Kutkat, Omnia; Kayed, Ahmed S; Dawson, Patrick; Qiu, Xueting; Bahl, Justin; Webby, Richard J; Karesh, William B; Kayali, Ghazi; Ali, Mohamed A",Journal of virology,42,1

It is one of the most common symptoms of upper respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and is a leading cause of physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions. However, few over-the-counter medications are proven to heal sore throat inflammation. METHODS Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and three dimensional organotypic human respiratory tissues were used to study inflammation and various treatment effects on respiratory epithelia. The cells and tissues were studied both in the presence and absence of bradykinin, one of the first inflammatory mediators of pharyngitis. Inflammation was measured by analyzing the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Tissue morphology was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS In studying pharyngitis using organotypic human respiratory tissue stimulated with bradykinin, we saw an increase in PGE2 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in response to bradykinin. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), a nonspecific COX inhibitor, was able to mitigate a bradykinin-induced increase in PGE2 in our studies. However, ASA was inflammatory above its therapeutic window, increasing the levels of PGE2 and IL-8 above those seen with bradykinin stimulation alone. We describe a novel, scientifically validated treatment for sore throat, that contains a low dose of ASA and other anti-inflammatory ingredients. CONCLUSION This study elucidates the complex mechanisms involved in healing pharyngitis, an inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory epithelia. An ASA-based formula (Biovanta) mitigated bradykinin-induced inflammation more strongly than ASA alone in organotypic human respiratory tissues. Surprisingly, we found that many of the most common over the counter sore throat therapies exacerbate inflammation and IL-8 in organotypic human respiratory tissues, suggesting these common treatments may increase the likelihood of further respiratory complications.","Leyva-Grado, Victor; Pugach, Pavel; Sadeghi-Latefi, Nazlie","Immunity, inflammation and disease",42,1

The goals of this pilot study were to assess environmental contamination in different areas and at two time periods in the influenza season and to determine the feasibility of using surgical mask contamination to evaluate potential exposure to influenza virus. Bioaerosol samples were collected over 12 days (two 6-day sessions) at 12 locations within a student health center using portable two-stage bioaerosol samplers operating 8 hr each day. Surface samples were collected each morning and afternoon from common high-contact non-porous hard surfaces from rooms and locations where bioaerosol samplers were located. Surgical masks worn by participants while in contact with patients with influenza-like illness were collected. A questionnaire administered to each of the 12 participants at the end of each workday and another at the end of each workweek assessed influenza-like illness symptoms, estimated the number of influenza-like illness patient contacts, hand hygiene, and surgical mask usage. All samples were analyzed using qPCR. Over the 12 days of the study, three of the 127 (2.4%) bioaerosol samples, 2 of 483 (0.41%) surface samples, and 0 of 54 surgical masks were positive for influenza virus. For the duration of contact that occurred with an influenza patient on any of the 12 days, nurse practitioners and physicians reported contacts with influenza-like illness patients >60 min, medical assistants reported 15-44 min, and administrative staff reported <30 min. Given the limited number of bioaerosol and surface samples positive for influenza virus in the bioaerosol and surface samples, the absence of influenza virus on the surgical masks provides inconclusive evidence for the potential to use surgical masks to assess exposure to influenza viruses. Further studies are needed to determine feasibility of this approach in assessing healthcare personnel exposures. Information learned in this study can inform future field studies on influenza transmission.","Ahrenholz, Steven H; Brueck, Scott E; Rule, Ana M; Noti, John D; Noorbakhsh, Bahar; Blachere, Francoise M; de Perio, Marie A; Lindsley, William G; Shaffer, Ronald E; Fisher, Edward M",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,42,26

Infection occurs after a traumatic inoculation of Sporothrix propagules in mammals' skin and can follow either a classic route through traumatic inoculation by plant debris (e.g., S. schenckii and S. globosa) or an alternative route through zoonotic transmission from animals (e.g., S. brasiliensis). Epizootics followed by a zoonotic route occur in Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as the epicenter of a recent cat-transmitted epidemic. DNA-based markers are needed to explore the epidemiology of these Sporothrix expansions using molecular methods. This paper reports the use of amplified-fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLP) to assess the degree of intraspecific variability among Sporothrix species. We used whole-genome sequences from Sporothrix species to generate 2,304 virtual AFLP fingerprints. In silico screening highlighted 6 primer pair combinations to be tested in vitro. The protocol was used to genotype 27 medically relevant Sporothrix. Based on the overall scored AFLP markers (97-137 fragments), the values of polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.2552-0.3113), marker index (MI = 0.002-0.0039), effective multiplex ratio (E = 17.8519-35.2222), resolving power (Rp = 33.6296-63.1852), discriminating power (D = 0.9291-0.9662), expected heterozygosity (H = 0.3003-0.3857), and mean heterozygosity (Havp = 0.0001) demonstrated the utility of these primer combinations for discriminating Sporothrix. AFLP markers revealed cryptic diversity in species previously thought to be the most prevalent clonal type, such as S. brasiliensis, responsible for cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, and S. globosa responsible for large sapronosis outbreaks in Asia. Three combinations (#3 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-TT, #5 EcoRI-FAM-GA/MseI-AG, and #6 EcoRI-FAM-TA/MseI-AA) provide the best diversity indices and lowest error rates. These methods make it easier to track routes of disease transmission during epizooties and zoonosis, and our DNA fingerprint assay can be further transferred between laboratories to give insights into the ecology and evolution of pathogenic Sporothrix species and to inform management and mitigation strategies to tackle the advance of sporotrichosis.","de Carvalho, Jamile Ambrósio; Hagen, Ferry; Fisher, Matthew C; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires; Rodrigues, Anderson Messias",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,42,19

Abdominal quilting with progressive tension sutures has been effective in reducing abdominal drainage in abdominoplasty patients prompting a change of practice in our unit. We studied consecutive unilateral mastectomy patients undergoing breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap. The initial 27 patients underwent breast reconstruction without any form of abdominal flap plication. The subsequent 26 patients underwent an identical DIEP flap raise procedure after which the abdominal flap was progressively tensioned using a running barbed suture quilting technique. All patients had closed suction drains inserted bilaterally until daily drain output was <40 ml in 2 consecutive days. Primary outcome measures were total volume of abdominal drainage and length of hospital stay. Independent statistical analyses were performed using Welch's t-test. There were no demographic differences between the two groups. A statistically significant decrease in the mean total abdominal drainage was found after quilting (238 ml vs. 528 ml; p = 0.0005). Patients in the quilting group also showed a reduction in mean duration of hospital stay. Quilting of the abdominal flap helps to reduce abdominal drainage not only in abdominoplasty patients but also in patients undergoing breast reconstruction with DIEP flap.","Liang, D G; Dusseldorp, J R; van Schalkwyk, C; Hariswamy, S; Wood, S; Rose, V; Moradi, P","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",42,1

DESIGN We performed an update of a Cochrane systematic review, and performed network meta-analysis comparing randomised trials evaluating colorectal cancer screening with guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) (annual, biennial), faecal immunochemical test (FIT) (annual, biennial), sigmoidoscopy (once-only) or colonoscopy (once-only) in a healthy population, aged 50-79 years. We conducted subgroup analysis on sex. Follow-up >5 years was required for analysis of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS 12 randomised trials proved eligible. Compared with no-screening, we found high certainty evidence for sigmoidoscopy screening slightly reducing colorectal cancer incidence (relative risk (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI 0.70 to 0.83) and mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80), while gFOBT screening had little or no difference on colorectal cancer incidence, but slightly reduced colorectal cancer mortality (annual: RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.86, biennial: RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.93). No screening test reduced mortality nor incidence by more than six per 1000 screened over 15 years. Sigmoidoscopy had a greater effect in men, for both colorectal cancer incidence (women: RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.92, men: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.79), and mortality (women: RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96, men: RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75) (moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS In a 15-year perspective, sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer incidence, while sigmoidoscopy, annual and biennial gFOBT all reduce colorectal cancer mortality.

Deciphering which neonates are at increased risk for mortality can have an important global impact. As such, integrating high computational technology (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI]) may help identify the early and potentially modifiable predictors of neonatal mortality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate, critically appraise, and analyze neonatal prediction studies that included AI. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, OVID, and Google Scholar. We included studies that used AI (e.g., machine learning (ML) and deep learning) to formulate prediction models for neonatal death. We excluded small studies (n < 500 individuals) and studies using only antenatal factors to predict mortality. Two independent investigators screened all articles for inclusion. The data collection consisted of study design, number of models, features used per model, feature importance, internal and/or external validation, and calibration analysis. Our primary outcome was the average area under the receiving characteristic curve (AUC) or sensitivity and specificity for all models included in each study. RESULTS Of 434 articles, 11 studies were included. The total number of participants was 1.26 M with gestational ages ranging from 22 weeks to term. Number of features ranged from 3 to 66 with timing of prediction as early as 5 min of life to a maximum of 7 days of age. The average number of models per study was 4, with neural network, random forest, and logistic regression comprising the most used models (58.3%). Five studies (45.5%) reported calibration plots and 2 (18.2%) conducted external validation. Eight studies reported results by AUC and 5 studies reported the sensitivity and specificity. The AUC varied from 58.3% to 97.0%. The mean sensitivities ranged from 63% to 80% and specificities from 78% to 99%. The best overall model was linear discriminant analysis, but it also had a high number of features (n = 17). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION ML models can accurately predict death in neonates. This analysis demonstrates the most commonly used predictors and metrics for AI prediction models for neonatal mortality. Future studies should focus on external validation, calibration, as well as deployment of applications that can be readily accessible to health-care providers.","Mangold, Cheyenne; Zoretic, Sarah; Thallapureddy, Keerthi; Moreira, Axel; Chorath, Kevin; Moreira, Alvaro",Neonatology,42,23

Over the course of this journey, the author grapples with her inner biases and struggles with the emotional trauma associated with bearing witness to extraordinary suffering and social isolation imposed by COVID-19. Not only does the ethics of care approach embodied here lead to the creation of enduring vibrant works of art for this patient and others, but it also affirms a guiding principle of palliative care in which interdisciplinary collaboration is marshalled in the service of cultivating relationships, upholding responsibilities, and intensifying empathy among persons tied together by a common narrative.","Berlin, Assistant Professor Of Surgery And Medicine Ana",Journal of pain and symptom management,42,1

Higher blood glucose levels (BGL) have been associated with worse clinical outcome, but the pathophysiological causes are not yet understood. We hypothesized that higher levels of BGL are associated with more pronounced ischemic brain edema and worse clinical outcome mediated by cerebral collateral circulation. METHODS 178 acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were included. Early ischemic brain edema was determined using quantitative lesion water uptake on initial computed tomography (CT) and collateral status was assessed with an established 5-point scoring system in CT-angiography. Good clinical outcome was defined as functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict functional independence and linear regression analyses to investigate the impact of BGL and collateral status on water uptake. RESULTS The mean BGL at admission was significantly lower in patients with good outcome at 90 days (116.5 versus 138.5 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and early water uptake was lower (6.3% versus 9.6%; p < 0.001). The likelihood for good outcome declined with increasing BGL (odds ratio [OR] per 100 mg/dl BGL increase: 0.15; 95% CI 0.02-0.86; p = 0.039). Worse collaterals (1% water uptake per point, 95% CI 0.4-1.7%) and higher BGL (0.6% per 10 mg/dl BGL, 95% CI 0.3-0.8%) were significantly associated with increased water uptake. CONCLUSION Elevated admission BGL were associated with increased early brain edema and poor clinical outcome mediated by collateral status. Patients with higher BGL might be targeted by adjuvant anti-edematous treatment.","Broocks, Gabriel; Kemmling, Andre; Aberle, Jens; Kniep, Helge; Bechstein, Matthias; Flottmann, Fabian; Leischner, Hannes; Faizy, Tobias D; Nawabi, Jawed; Schön, Gerhard; Sporns, Peter; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta",Journal of neurology,42,16

However, there is a paucity of data on factors that impact the association between critical infarct thresholds volume and outcome. We sought to determine whether lesion thresholds best predicting outcome depend on the degree of preexisting white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesion burden. METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging infarct volumes were quantified in 414 consecutive patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes evaluated between January 2014 and December 2014. The WMH lesion volume was graded according to the Fazekas scale and dichotomized to absent to mild versus moderate to severe. Receiver operator characteristics curves were calculated to determine the infarct volume threshold best predicting the 90-day outcome. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether the critical lesion thresholds independently predicted a favorable 90-day outcome after adjusting for pertinent confounders. RESULTS The infarct volumes thresholds predicting the 90-day outcome for the entire cohort (standard thresholds) were ≤29.5 mL (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1), ≤29.9 mL (mRS 0-2), and ≤34.1 mL (mRS 0-3). For patients with absent-to-mild WMH lesion burden, WMH-adjusted critical infarct thresholds were significantly greater than the standard infarct thresholds. In the fully adjusted multivariable regression models, the WMH-adjusted infarct thresholds correctly predicted the outcome to a similar degree as the standard thresholds. CONCLUSIONS In this proof-of-concept study, the WMH lesion burden impacted the critical outcome-predicting infarct thresholds. If confirmed, using a WMH-adjusted infarct threshold could allow defining patients that have a favorable outcome despite having relatively large infarct volumes.","Patti, Jatinder; Helenius, Johanna; Puri, Ajit S; Henninger, Nils",Stroke,42,1

This evidence has not been comprehensively summarized. A scoping review was conducted to explore the available evidence on BI among AYAs and identify the definitions, theories, models, frameworks, measures, and methods used to assess BI. METHODS Databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO (via Ovid) and CINAHL and Gender Studies (via EBSCO) were searched to identify published studies from 1 January 2000 to 25 November 2019. Inclusion criteria were: qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology; at least one BI-related measure or theme; published in English; and majority of the sample between 13 and 39 years at diagnosis and a mean age at diagnosis between 13 and 39 years. Two authors screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles and data were extracted and summarized. RESULTS The search yielded 11,347 articles and 82 met inclusion criteria. Articles included 45 quantitative, 33 qualitative, and four mixed-methods studies. The majority of studies used cross-sectional designs, while BI definitions, theories, models, frameworks, and measures were varied. Studies explored descriptive, psychological, physical, coping, and social factors, with BI being described most often as an outcome rather than a predictor. CONCLUSIONS Theory-based research that employs a holistic BI definition and uses longitudinal or intervention study designs or a qualitative methodology is needed to better understand the BI experience of AYAs and inform the development of strategies and programs to reduce BI concerns and increase positive body experiences.","Vani, Madison F; Lucibello, Kristen M; Trinh, Linda; Santa Mina, Daniel; Sabiston, Catherine M",Psycho-oncology,42,19

Conversely, an antisense (complementary) peptide is coded by the corresponding nucleotide sequence (read 5' → 3') of the antisense (negative) strand of DNA. Research has been accumulating steadily to suggest that sense peptides are capable of specific interactions with their corresponding antisense peptides. Unfortunately, although more and more examples of specific sense-antisense peptide interactions are emerging, the very idea of such interactions does not conform to standard biology dogma and so there remains a sizeable challenge to lift this concept from being perceived as a peripheral phenomenon if not worse, into becoming part of the scientific mainstream. AREAS COVERED Specific interactions have now been exploited for the inhibition of number of widely different protein-protein and protein-receptor interactions in vitro and in vivo. Further, antisense peptides have also been used to induce the production of antibodies targeted to specific receptors or else the production of anti-idiotypic antibodies targeted against auto-antibodies. Such illustrations of utility would seem to suggest that observed sense-antisense peptide interactions are not just the consequence of a sequence of coincidental 'lucky-hits'. Indeed, at the very least, one might conclude that sense-antisense peptide interactions represent a potentially new and different source of leads for drug discovery. But could there be more to come from studies in this area? EXPERT OPINION Studies on the potential mechanism of sense-antisense peptide interactions suggest that interactions may be driven by amino acid residue interactions specified from the genetic code. If so, such specified amino acid residue interactions could form the basis for an even wider amino acid residue interaction code (proteomic code) that links gene sequences to actual protein structure and function, even entire genomes to entire proteomes. The possibility that such a proteomic code should exist is discussed. So too the potential implications for biology and pharmaceutical science are also discussed were such a code to exist.","Miller, Andrew D",Expert opinion on biological therapy,42,1

We aimed to examine the attitudes of the Jordanians and how these attitudes can predict their adherence using the health belief model (HBM). A cross-sectional study of 5057 participants using an internet-based questionnaire was conducted during lockdown. Multivariable ordinal regression analyses were used to estimate predictors of adherence to home quarantine. Overall, 646 (12.8%), 2078 (41.2%), and 2317 (46%) of participants showed poor, intermediate, and strict adherence, respectively. Of the HBM constructs, seriousness (β= 0.116, 95% CI 0.027 to 0.205), benefits (β= 0.056, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.110) and barriers (β= -0.025, 95% CI -0.035 to -0.015) were significant predictors.

However, the incidence of VTE after discharge and whether postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is beneficial and safe are unclear. In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported. CONCLUSION In patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, systematic screening for VTE 6 weeks after discharge revealed a low incidence of VTE. A strategy of selectively providing postdischarge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients seems safe and potentially effective.","Engelen, Matthias M; Vandenbriele, Christophe; Balthazar, Tim; Claeys, Eveline; Gunst, Jan; Guler, Ipek; Jacquemin, Marc; Janssens, Stefan; Lorent, Natalie; Liesenborghs, Laurens; Peerlinck, Kathelijne; Pieters, Griet; Rex, Steffen; Sinonquel, Pieter; Van der Linden, Lorenz; Van Laer, Christine; Vos, Robin; Wauters, Joost; Wilmer, Alexander; Verhamme, Peter; Vanassche, Thomas",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,42,1

Meibomian glands at the eyelid secrete lipids that prevent evaporation of the aqueous tear film. The pathogenesis of obstructive MGD is incompletely understood to date. Herein, we aim to investigate the pathogenesis of obstructive MGD using murine and human samples with various forms of ocular surface inflammation. METHOD The presence of Neutrophil extracellular Traps (NETs) was detected with immunofluorescence analysis of ocular surface discharge and biopsy samples from patients with blepharitis. Tear fluid from patients with MGD and blepharitis were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory mediators using bead based immunoassay. Murine model of allergic eye disease (AED) was performed to investigate the role of NETs in MG occlusion. RESULTS we show that the ocular discharge from patients with blepharitis contains aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs). Furthermore, the ducts of human Meibomian glands affected by blepharitis were largely congested by aggNETs. Tear fluid from patients with MGD showed elevated neutrophil chemoattractants (C5a, IL6, IL8 and IL18). C5a and IL8 correlated with the degree of deficiency of tear fluid. In the murine model of allergic eye disease (AED), aggNETs accumulated in the MG leading to occlusion of their ducts and the retrograde pent-up of the fluid followed by acinar atrophy. Constraining aggNET formation by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) effectively reduced MG damage. CONCLUSION We conclude that aggNETs occlude MG causing MGD after ocular surface inflammation.","Mahajan, Aparna; Hasíková, Lenka; Hampel, Ulrike; Grüneboom, Anika; Shan, Xiaomei; Herrmann, Irmgard; Garreis, Fabian; Bock, Felix; Knopf, Jasmin; Singh, Jeeshan; Schauer, Christine; Mahajan, Siddharth; Leppkes, Moritz; Paulsen, Friedrich; Schlötzer-Schrehardt, Ursula; Krenn, Veit; Jünemann, Anselm; Hohberger, Bettina; Schett, Georg; Herrmann, Martin; Muñoz, Luis E",The ocular surface,42,1

We have developed a pulsed jet device that can be incorporated into a gastrointestinal endoscope. Here, we investigated the mechanical profile of the pulsed jet device and demonstrated the usefulness of this instrument in esophageal ESD in swine. METHODS The device comprises a 5-Fr catheter, a 14-mm long stainless steel tube for generating the pulsed water jet, a nozzle and an optical quartz fiber. The pulsed water jet was generated at pulse rates of 3 Hz by irradiating the physiological saline (4°C) within the stainless steel tube with an holmium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser at 1.1 J/pulse. Mechanical characteristics were evaluated using a force meter. The device was used only for the part of submucosal dissection in the swine ESD model. Tissues removed using the pulsed jet device and a conventional electrocautery device, and the esophagus, were histologically examined to assess thermal damage. RESULTS The peak impact force was observed at a stand-off distance of 40 mm (1.1 J/pulse). ESD using the pulsed jet device was successful, as the tissue specimens showed precise dissection of the submucosal layer. The extent of thermal injury was significantly lower in the dissected bed using the pulsed jet device. CONCLUSION The results showed that the present endoscopic pulsed jet system is a useful alternative for a safe ESD with minimum tissue injury.","Sato, Chiaki; Nakano, Toru; Nakagawa, Atsuhiro; Yamada, Masato; Yamamoto, Hiroaki; Kamei, Takashi; Miyata, Go; Sato, Akira; Fujishima, Fumiyoshi; Nakai, Masaaki; Niinomi, Mitsuo; Takayama, Kazuyoshi; Tominaga, Teiji; Satomi, Susumu",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,42,27

The transmissibility of the disease is of great interest to healthcare workers and scientists alike. The primary route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, but viral RNA has also been found in feces and body fluids such as urine, serum, and semen. So far, there has been no report on whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the exudates of cutaneous lesions. This study was designed to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the pressure injury exudates in patients with severe COVID-19 infections. METHODS 46 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU of the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan between February 4 and April 12 developed pressure injuries. 22 patients with pressure injuries had wound exudates. Wound and pharyngeal swabs of the 22 patients were collected and RT-PCRs were conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. RESULTS At the time of pressure injury, 5 patients still tested positive by pharyngeal swabs, the rest of the 17 patients tested negative. However, none of the wound exudate swabs from the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that it is rather unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted via pressure injury exudates, but we still recommend standardized personal protective equipment, face shield and an additional pair of gloves when treating pressure injuries.","Yu, Nanze; Zhang, Yuwei; Xiao, Meng; Cao, Wei; Zhang, Yan; Yang, Yang; Liu, Zhengyin; Li, Yunzhu; Long, Xiao; Liu, Zhifei; Zhang, Shuyang; Wang, Xiaojun",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,42,1

We sought to determine if this relationship varies by transplant center. Using SRTR, we included patients<18 years transplanted 2008-2013 (N=2804). We matched patient ZIP codes to a deprivation index (range [0,1]; higher values indicate increased socioeconomic deprivation). A center-level patient-mix deprivation index was defined by the distribution of patient-level deprivation. Centers (n=66) were classified as high or low deprivation if their patient-mix deprivation index was above or below the median across centers. Center quality was classified as low or high graft failure if graft survival rates were better or worse than the overall 10-year graft survival rate. Primary outcome was patient-level graft survival. We used random-effect Cox models to evaluate center-level covariates on graft failure. We modeled center quality using stratified Cox models. In multivariate analysis, each 0.1 increase in the patient-mix deprivation index was associated with increased hazard of graft failure (HR 1.32; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.66).

Older people with dementia may face even greater barriers to appropriate care in acute care settings. Yet, studies about the care quality for older patients with dementia in acute care settings are still few. The objective of this study is to assess whether dementia status is associated with poorer treatment by examining the association of a patient's dementia status with the probability of receiving surgery and the waiting time until surgery for a hip fracture in acute care hospitals in Japan. METHODS All patients with closed hip fracture were extracted from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database between April 2014 and March 2018. After excluding complicated cases, we conducted regressions with multilevel models. We used two outcome measures: (i) whether the patient received a surgery or was treated by watchful waiting; and (ii) number of waiting days until surgery after admission. RESULTS Two hundred fourteen thousand six hundred one patients discharged from 1328 hospitals were identified. Among them, 159,173 patients received surgery. Both 80-89 year-olds (OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.90) and those 90 years old and above (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.70) had significantly lower odds ratios for receiving surgery compared to 65-79 year-olds. Those with severe dementia had a significantly greater likelihood of receiving surgery compared to those without dementia (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16, 1.25). Patients aged 90 years old and above had shorter waiting time for surgery (Coef. -0.06; 95% CI, - 0.11, - 0.01). Mild dementia did not have a statistically significant impact on the number of waiting days until surgery (P = 0.34), whereas severe dementia was associated with shorter waiting days (Coef. -0.08; 95% CI, - 0.12, - 0.03). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest physicians may be taking proactive measures to preserve physical function for those with severe dementia and to avoid prolonged hospitalization although there are no formal guidelines on prioritization for the aged and dementia patients.","Tomioka, Shinichi; Rosenberg, Megumi; Fushimi, Kiyohide; Matsuda, Shinya",BMC health services research,42,29

However, poor sensitivity of the NC membrane based LFA limits its further application in many cases. Herein, we developed a facile method for LFA sensitivity enhancement, by incorporating two-sugar barrier into LFAs: one between the conjugation pad and the test line, and the other between the test line and the control line. ORF1ab nucleic acid of COVID-19 was used as the model target to demonstrate the concept on the HF120 membrane. Results show that at optimum conditions, the two sugar barrier LFAs have a detection limit of 0.5 nM, which is compared to that of 2.5 nM for the control LFA, achieving a 5-fold sensitivity increase. This low cost, easy-to-fabricate and easy-to-integrate LFA method may have potential applications in other cellulose paper-based platforms.","Tang, Ruihua; Alam, Nur; Li, Min; Xie, Mingyue; Ni, Yonghao",Carbohydrate polymers,42,33

This study was conducted to establish an objective and reliable method for analyzing the transfer of colored cosmetics onto face masks. METHODS A total of 24 women participated in this test. The participants were requested to wear Korean Filter 94 masks after having applied colored cosmetics on their faces and lips. VISIA-CR was used to photograph the face, and a camera was used to photograph the mask, which had smeared the cosmetics. Each image was analyzed using the Image-pro® 10 image analysis software. RESULTS Immediately after applying the cosmetics, the intensity of the face decreased and the redness of the lips increased when compared with the results 30 minutes after washing the face. After wearing a mask, the intensity increased and the redness decreased when compared with immediately after applying the cosmetics. The area before and after the colored cosmetics smeared onto the mask was increased. CONCLUSION It is expected that this study could be used as a reference for further experiments on analysis of methods for preventing mask stains.","Kim, Suyeon; Lee, Juseon; Park, Minhye; Kim, Hongbi; Kim, Sungeun; Byun, Ji Won; Hwang-Bo, Jeon; Park, Keun Hyung",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,42,1

The magnitudes of these effects have not been compared at equivalent anesthetic doses. We hypothesized that upper airway closing pressure is less negative and genioglossus activity is lower during deep compared with shallow anesthesia. METHODS In a randomized controlled crossover study of 12 volunteers, anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using a pain stimulus to identify the threshold for suppression of motor response to electrical stimulation. Measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyography, ventilation, hypopharyngeal pressure, upper airway closing pressure, and change in end-expiratory lung volume during mask pressure drops. RESULTS A total of 393 attempted breaths during occlusion maneuvers were analyzed. Upper airway closing pressure was significantly less negative at deep versus shallow anesthesia (-10.8 ± 4.5 vs. -11.3 ± 4.4 cm H2O, respectively [mean ± SD]) and correlated with the bispectral index (P < 0.001), indicating a more collapsible airway at deep anesthesia. Respiratory genioglossus activity during airway occlusion was significantly lower at deep compared with light anesthesia (26 ± 21 vs. 35 ± 24% of maximal genioglossus activation, respectively; P < 0.001) and correlated with bispectral index (P < 0.001). Upper airway closing pressure and genioglossus activity during airway occlusion did not differ between sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia increased upper airway collapsibility in a dose-dependent fashion with no difference at equivalent anesthetic concentrations. These effects can in part be explained by a dose-dependent inhibiting effect of anesthetics on respiratory genioglossus activity.","Simons, Jeroen C P; Pierce, Eric; Diaz-Gil, Daniel; Malviya, Sanjana A; Meyer, Matthew J; Timm, Fanny P; Stokholm, Janne B; Rosow, Carl E; Kacmarek, Robert M; Eikermann, Matthias",Anesthesiology,42,10

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of clinically realistic stomach inflation on cardiopulmonary function during hemorrhagic shock in a porcine model. METHODS Pigs were randomized to a sham control group (n = 9), hemorrhagic shock (35 mL kg over 15 min [n = 9]), and hemorrhagic shock combined with stomach inflation (35 mL kg over 15 min and 5 L stomach inflation [n = 10]). RESULTS When compared with the control group, hemorrhagic shock (n = 9) increased heart rate (103 ± 11 vs. 146 ± 37 beats min; P = 0.002) and lactate (1.4 ± 0.5 vs. 4.0 ± 1.9 mmol L; P < 0.001), and decreased mean arterial blood pressure (81.3 ± 12.8 vs. 35.4 ± 8.1 mmHg; P < 0.001) and stroke-volume index (38.1 ± 6.4 vs. 13.6 ± 4.8 mL min m; P < 0.001). Hemorrhagic shock combined with stomach inflation (n = 10) versus hemorrhagic shock only (n = 9) increased intra-abdominal pressure (27.0 ± 9.3 vs. 1.1 ± 1.0 mmHg; P < 0.001), and decreased stroke-volume index (9.9 ± 6.0 vs. 20.8 ± 8.5 mL min m; P = 0.007), and dynamic respiratory system compliance (10.8 ± 4.5 vs. 38.1 ± 6.1 mL cmH2O; P < 0.001). Before versus after stomach evacuation during hemorrhagic shock, intra-abdominal pressure decreased (27.0 ± 9.3 vs. 9.8 ± 5.4 mmHg; P = 0.042). Survival in the sham control and hemorrhagic shock group was 9 of 9, respectively, and 3 of 10 after hemorrhagic shock and stomach inflation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS During hemorrhagic shock stomach inflation caused an abdominal compartment syndrome and thereby impaired cardiopulmonary function and aerobic metabolism, and increased mortality. Subsequent stomach evacuation partly reversed adverse stomach-inflation triggered effects.","Braun, Patrick; Putzer, Gabriel; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Wimmer, Angela; Schnell, Hermann; Arnold, Henrik; Neururer, Sabrina; Brugger, Hermann; Wenzel, Volker; Paal, Peter",Shock,42,1

To match this increasing demand, there has been focus on hastening patients' recovery of function. This effort has culminated in the formulation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategies. However, with evolving ERAS programs and new recommendations, a review of current evidence is required to provide clinicians with up-to-date information about its effect on outcomes for TJA. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to assess the utility of ERAS programs on patient, health service, and economic outcomes for primary, elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS A systematic search will be conducted in Medline (Ovid), EMCARE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science, CINAHL, National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database, and the Cochrane Library. Analytical, observational, and experimental designs will be included in this systematic review. Only studies including patients undergoing primary TKA and THA comparing ERAS programs with conventional surgery and postoperative care will be included. Data related to patient outcomes, health service outcomes, safety, and economic evaluation will be extracted. RESULTS The search terms and primary database searches have been finalized. Findings will be reported in narrative and tabular form. Where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses will be conducted for each outcome, and heterogeneity quantified with Cochran Q test and I2 statistic. Measures of effect or mean differences will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

However, decellularizing porcine esophagus to obtain decellularized esophageal matrix (DEM) for potential biomedical applications has not been widely investigated. In this study a modified decellularization protocol was employed to prepare a porcine esophageal DEM for the study of cancer cell growth. The cellular removal and retention of matrix components in the porcine DEM were fully characterized. The microstructure of the DEM was observed using scanning electronic microscopy. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and human primary esophageal fibroblast cells (FBCs) were seeded in the DEM to observe their growth. Results show that the decellularization process did not cause significant loss of mechanical properties and that blood ducts and lymphatic vessels in the submucosa layer were also preserved. ESCC and FBCs grew on the DEM well and the matrix did not show any toxicity to cells. When FBS and ESCC were cocultured on the matrix, they secreted more periostin, a protein that supports cell adhesion on matrix. This study shows that the modified decellularization protocol can effectively remove the cell materials and maintain the microstructure of the porcine esophageal matrix, which has the potential application of studying cell growth and migration for esophageal cancer models.","Chaitin, Hersh; Lu, Michael L; Wallace, Michael B; Kang, Yunqing",Cells,42,1

The aims of this study were (i) a proof of concept regarding wavelet-based analysis of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data and (ii) to demonstrate advantages of wavelet-based measures compared to standard cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps in patients with the initial diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS Consecutive 3-T DSC MRI datasets of 46 subjects with GBM (mean age 63.0 ± 13.1 years, 28 m) were retrospectively included in this feasibility study. Vessel-specific wavelet magnetic resonance perfusion (wavelet-MRP) maps were calculated using the wavelet transform (Paul wavelet, order 1) of each voxel time course. Five different aspects of image quality and tumor delineation were each qualitatively rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Quantitative analysis included image contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio. RESULTS Vessel-specific wavelet-MRP maps could be calculated within a mean time of 2:27 min. Wavelet-MRP achieved higher scores compared to CBV in all qualitative ratings: tumor depiction (4.02 vs. 2.33), contrast enhancement (3.93 vs. 2.23), central necrosis (3.86 vs. 2.40), morphologic correlation (3.87 vs. 2.24), and overall impression (4.00 vs. 2.41); all p < .001. Quantitative image analysis showed a better image contrast and higher contrast-to-noise ratios for wavelet-MRP compared to conventional perfusion maps (all p < .001). CONCLUSIONS wavelet-MRP is a fast and fully automated post-processing technique that yields reproducible perfusion maps with a clearer vascular depiction of GBM compared to standard CBV maps. KEY POINTS • Wavelet-MRP offers high-contrast perfusion maps with a clear delineation of focal perfusion alterations. • Both image contrast and visual image quality were beneficial for wavelet-MRP compared to standard perfusion maps like CBV. • Wavelet-MRP can be automatically calculated from existing dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion data.","Huber, Thomas; Rotkopf, Lukas; Wiestler, Benedikt; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Bette, Stefanie; Gempt, Jens; Preibisch, Christine; Ricke, Jens; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S; Sommer, Wieland H; Thierfelder, Kolja M",European radiology,42,5

139070,139070,139070,In this August issue.,21.1302,8.2542095,2020-08-01,"The term ""health systems science"" (HSS) has recently emerged as a unifying label for competencies in health care delivery and in population and community health. Despite strong evidence that HSS competencies are needed in the current and future health care workforce, heretofore the integration of HSS into medical education has been slow or fragmented-due, in part, to a lack of evidence that these curricula improve education or population outcomes. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the national reckoning with racial inequities in the United States further highlight the time-sensitive imperative to integrate HSS content across the medical education continuum. While acknowledging challenges, the authors highlight the unique opportunities inherent in an HSS curriculum and present an elaborated curricular framework for incorporating health care delivery and population health into undergraduate medical education. This framework includes competencies previously left out of medical education, increases the scope of faculty development, and allows for evidence of effectiveness beyond traditional learner-centric metrics. The authors apply a widely adopted six-step approach to curriculum development to address the unique challenges of incorporating HSS. Two examples-of a module on quality improvement (health care delivery) and of an introductory course on health equity (population and community health)-illustrate how the six-step approach can be used to build HSS curricula. The Supplemental Digital Appendix (at http://links.lww.com/ACADMED/B106) outlines this approach and provides specific examples and resources. Adapting these resources within local environments to build HSS curricula will allow medical educators to ensure future graduates have the expertise and commitment necessary to effect health systems change and to advocate for their communities, while also building the much-needed evidence for such curricula.","Singh, Mamta K; Gullett, Heidi L; Thomas, Patricia A",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,42,29

This case was treated with lumpectomy requiring wide margins due to the high rate of local recurrence. A planned breast reduction surgery was deemed adequate postlumpectomy therapy to prevent cancer recurrence, negating the need for chemotherapy or radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which cosmetic breast reduction surgery will be used as postlumpectomy cancer recurrence risk mitigation for primary leiomyosarcoma of the breast. Patients with this malignancy have a relatively poor prognosis compared with other breast cancer types, with a 5-year disease-free survival of 33%-52%.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our staged reopening protocol and the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among elective arthroplasty patients. METHODS We identified all elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients who underwent our universal COVID-19 testing protocol during our phased reopening between May 1, 2020, and July 21, 2020, at our institution. We recorded the SARS-CoV-2 test results of each patient along with their demographics, medical comorbidities, and symptoms at the time of testing. We followed each of these positive patients through their rescheduled cases and recorded any complications or potential SARS-CoV-2 healthcare exposures. RESULTS Of the 2,329 patients, we identified five patients (0.21%) with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test, none with symptoms. All patients were successfully rescheduled and underwent their elective arthroplasty procedure within 6 weeks of their original surgery date. None of these patients experienced a perioperative complication at the time of their rescheduled arthroplasty procedure. No orthopaedic surgeon or staff member caring for these patients reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION Our phased reopening protocol with universal preoperative virus testing was safe and identified a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic, elective arthroplasty patients at our institution. With uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this research can guide future policy decisions regarding elective surgery.","Zangrilli, Julian; Hameed, Daniel; Chisari, Emanuele; Vannello, Chris; Courtney, P Maxwell; Krueger, Chad A",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,42,1

Nationwide surveillance could benefit from using data on meat inspection findings, but several limitations need to be overcome. At the producer level, interpretation of meat inspection findings is a notable opportunity for surveillance with relevance to animal health and welfare. In this study, we propose that discovery and monitoring of relational patterns between condemnation conditions co-present in broiler batches at meat inspection can provide valuable information for surveillance of farmed animal health and welfare. RESULTS Great Britain (GB)-based integrator meat inspection records for 14,045 broiler batches slaughtered in nine, four monthly intervals were assessed for the presence of surveillance indicators relevant to broiler health and welfare. K-means and correlation-based hierarchical clustering, and association rules analyses were performed to identify relational patterns in the data. Incidence of condemnation showed seasonal and temporal variation, which was detected by association rules analysis. Syndrome-related and non-specific relational patterns were detected in some months of meat inspection records. A potentially syndromic cluster was identified in May 2016 consisting of infection-related conditions: pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, and abnormal colour. Non-specific trends were identified in some months as an unusual combination of condemnation reasons in broiler batches. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the detection of relational patterns in meat inspection records could provide producer-level surveillance indicators with relevance to broiler chicken health and welfare.","Buzdugan, S N; Alarcon, P; Huntington, B; Rushton, J; Blake, D P; Guitian, J",BMC veterinary research,42,1

In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is deregulation that has yielded sudden changes in how we police and treat people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Arbitrary laws and counterproductive policies previously subject to only incremental reform have given way to sweeping changes: people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have been released from jails and prisons, the enforcement of drug laws has been cast aside as a priority, and the regulations surrounding addiction treatment medications and treating patients with OUD have been greatly loosened. These are changes many practitioners and advocates have sought for years if not decades, but they come with the reality that the old systems are culturally entrenched and likely to be resilient. It is critical that researchers evaluate these changes and synthesize the results with existing evidence in ways that empower efforts to make the most effective responses permanent.

Physical examination revealed no nasal discharge or airflow through the left nostril. A CT of the head revealed a left frontal sinus obstruction with expansile remodelling and osteolucency. Drainage of the frontal sinus obstruction was alleviated via placement of a temporary polyvinylchloride (PVC) stent that was left in place for 6 weeks. Purulent material removed from the frontal sinus returned a positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to marbofloxacin that was continued for 4 weeks, and for an additional 2 weeks after stent removal. A left-sided mucoid nasal discharge returned 3 months after removal of the stent. Repeat CT performed 20 months after surgery found the presence of a gas-filled frontal sinus and partial resolution in the amount of fluid within the mid and rostral nasal cavity.

HIFU is a highly precise medical procedure that uses focused ultrasound to heat and destroy pathogenic tissue rapidly and locally in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner. The released dosage could be remotely controlled by manipulating the power of HIFU and/or the duration of exposure. We demonstrated localized release within the focal volume of HIFU by using gelatin phantom samples containing dye-loaded Au nanocages. By placing chicken breast tissues on top of the phantoms, we further demonstrated the feasibility of this system for controlled release at depths up to 30 mm. Because it can penetrate more deeply into soft tissues than near-infrared light, HIFU is a potentially more effective external stimulus for rapid, on-demand drug release.","Li, Weiyang; Cai, Xin; Kim, Chulhong; Sun, Guorong; Zhang, Yu; Deng, Rui; Yang, Miaoxin; Chen, Jingyi; Achilefu, Samuel; Wang, Lihong V; Xia, Younan",Nanoscale,42,1

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse, from a holistic perspective, the well-being of children with special needs during the total lockdown period in Spain. The ‘Well-being of Children in Lockdown’ (WCL) scale was completed by 1225 parents of which 3.1% (n = 38) had children with special needs. The results reveal the emergence of negative emotions among children with special needs, who were found to be crying more, feeling more nervous than usual, getting more angry and feeling sadder. These children also have more unhealthy habits, eat more than usual, overuse new technology and watch too many TV. Children with special needs scored lower for general well-being than those without these needs, and scored lower also for emotional aspects, playful and creative activities and physical activity.

There is an unprecedented demand of several forms of personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs leading to possible acute shortage of these equipment. This has paved way for development of local innovative PPEs. Objective: To test feasibility of a low cost, indigenous three-in-one face protective gear (FPG) in HCWs of a neonatal unit of a tertiary care institute in northern India. Methodology: A three-in-one FPG was developed using the commonly available items in a ward or intensive care and few trash items. Items used were sterile surgical sheet, cling wrap piece/transparency sheet, cover of umbilical catheter/any sterile hollow plastic pipe, or straw and adhesive tape. The FPG was tested in 17 HCWs regarding its ease to use, comfort, and feasibility with the help of questionnaire. Results: A total of 17 HCWs participated in this study. Majority (10, 58.8%) were doctors. Eight (47%) participants have never used any form of PPE previously. Thirteen (76.4%) participants found the FPG comfortable to wear;12 (70.5%) found it comfortable to wear up to 8 h. Three HCWs found it difficult to work when wear the FPG;1 out of 3 found it suffocating. Conclusion: Three-in-one FPG is an indigenous, low cost, and may be a feasible alternative in low-risk situations when there is scarcity of conventional protective equipment.","Panghal, A.; Gupta, A.

Our study indicates that bats harbor a much wider diversity of coronaviruses than any other animal species. Dating of different coronavirus lineages suggests that bat coronaviruses are older than those recognized in other animals and that the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was directly derived from viruses from wild animals in wet markets of southern China. Furthermore, the most closely related bat and SARS coronaviruses diverged in 1986, an estimated divergence time of 17 years prior to the outbreak, suggesting that there may have been transmission via an unknown intermediate host. Analysis of lineage-specific selection pressure also indicated that only SARS coronaviruses in civets and humans were under significant positive selection, also demonstrating a recent interspecies transmission. Analysis of population dynamics revealed that coronavirus populations in bats have constant population growth, while viruses from all other hosts show epidemic-like increases in population. These results indicate that diverse coronaviruses are endemic in different bat species, with repeated introductions to other animals and occasional establishment in other species. Our findings suggest that bats are likely the natural hosts for all presently known coronavirus lineages and that all coronaviruses recognized in other species were derived from viruses residing in bats. Further surveillance of bat and other animal populations is needed to fully describe the ecology and evolution of this virus family.","Vijaykrishna, D; Smith, G J D; Zhang, J X; Peiris, J S M; Chen, H; Guan, Y",Journal of virology,42,32

METHODS The study sample included 40 depressed patients 29.65 +/- 9.38 years old and 120 normal comparison subjects 27.23 +/- 10.62 years old. In 20 of them (12 patients and 8 comparison subjects) the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. Clinical Diagnosis was reached by consensus of two examiners with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. Statistical Analysis included ANOVA, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha (alpha) RESULTS Both Sensitivity and specificity exceed 90.00 at 44/45, Chronbach's alpha for the total scale was equal to 0.09, suggesting that the scale covers a broad spectrum of symptoms. Factor analysis revealed five factors (anxiety-depression, thought content, gastrenterological symptoms, irritability and social-interpersonal functioning). The test-retest reliability was satisfactory (Pearson's R between 0.92). CONCLUSION The ZDRS-Greek translation is both reliable and valid and is suitable for clinical and research use with satisfactory properties. Its properties are similar to those reported in the international literature, although the literature is limited. However one should always have in mind the limitations inherent in the use of self-report scales.","Fountoulakis, K N; lacovides, A; Samolis, S; Kleanthous, S; Kaprinis, S G; St Kaprinis, G; Bech, P",BMC psychiatry,42,9

The published sequences of the genomes of various coronaviruses were compared. On the level of the amino acid sequence, conserved regions, common to all coronaviruses, were found in the gene encoding the nonstructural protein 1b as well as in the genes coding for the major structural proteins (S, M, and N). Due to the degeneration of the genetic code, some amino acids may be encoded by different nucleotide triplets. In order to compensate for this degeneration, mixtures of primers were synthesized, containing a variety of nucleotide sequences which together represented all possible codons for the conserved amino acid sequences. This method allowed to amplify and clone approximately 4000 base pairs of the genome of PEDV. An analysis of the genomic sequences revealed that PEDV holds an interesting intermediate position between human coronavirus 229E and Transmissible Gastroenteritis virus. We postulate that the method presented in this contribution may be useful to study and characterize other unknown viruses, especially viruses for which no cell cultures for propagation are available.","Tobler, K; Ackermann, M",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,42,31

METHODS We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CochraneLibrary, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and medRxiv pre-print databases using available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine. Data from all studies that focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with or without the addition of azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients, which were published up to 12 September 2020, were collated for analysis using CMA v.2.2.064. RESULTS Our systematic review retrieved 41 studies. Among these, 37 studies including 45,913 participants fulfilled the criteria for subsequent meta-analysis. The data showed no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the HCQ and control groups (RR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.81-1.27). Combination of HCQ with AZM also did not lead to improved treatment outcomes (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74). Furthermore, the mortality difference was not significant, neither in HCQ treatment group (RR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.71-1.03) nor in HCQ plus AZM treatment group (RR: 1.28, 95% CI, 0.76-2.14) in comparison to controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that age was the factor that significantly affected mortality (P<0.00001). CONCLUSION The meta-analysis found that there was no clinical benefit of using either HCQ by itself or in combination with AZM for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Hence, it may be prudent for clinicians and researchers to focus on other therapeutic options that may show greater promise in this disease.","Shamshirian, Amir; Hessami, Amirhossein; Heydari, Keyvan; Navaei, Reza Alizadeh; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Yip, George W; Ghasemian, Roya; Sedaghat, Meghdad; Baradaran, Hananeh; Yazdi, Soheil Mohammadi; Aboufazeli, Elham; Jafarpour, Hamed; Dadgostar, Ehsan; Tirandazi, Behnaz; Sadeghnezhad, Reza; Karimifar, Keyvan; Eftekhari, Aida; Shamshirian, Danial","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",42,17

As its pathogen was identified as a new kind of coronavirus (SARS_CoV), its genome was quickly sequenced on several isolates. Studies on its functional genomics were performed by combinatorial application of all the available bioinformatics tools and the development of new programs. In this way, it was found that the four proteins were absolutely responsible for nosogenesis of SARS, i.e. spike (S) protein; small envelop (E) protein; membrane (M) protein; and nucleocaspid (N) protein. Molecular evolution studies have revealed that SARS must be originated from wild animals, and it was demonstrated that the major genetic variations in some critical genes, particularly the Spike gene, was essential for the transition from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission. Theoretical models, either Logistic model or SIR model, were developed to describe the transmission of SARS. The recorded difference of SARS spreading in Beijing and Hong Kong was also reasonably analyzed according to these models.

METHODS The EMG signals for the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and vastus medialis (VM) as well as times to exhaustion (Tlim) were recorded in ten runners during two exhaustive treadmill runs (SIZ1 and SIZ2). The composite and individual responses were compared among muscles and between intensities. RESULTS The composite patterns of responses in EMG AMP (linear, quadratic, and cubic increases; r2/R2=0.684-0.848) and EMG MPF (linear, quadratic, and cubic decreases; r2/R2=0.648 - 0.852) for the VL and RF were consistent with neuromuscular fatigue in both zones, but those for the VM were not (quadratic, cubic, and non-significant relationships with responses near baseline). The RF tended to demonstrate greater fatigue (EMG MPF decreased from 80-100% Tlim). There was large inter-individual variability (only 10-60% of responses consistent with composite) in response to fatiguing treadmill running.

Despite the ease of use of stapling devices for end-to-end anastomosis, esophagogastric anastomosis is complicated by the narrow laparoscopic space, making the placement of an esophageal purse-string suture and anvil insertion into the fragile and contracted esophagus difficult. The aim of this study was to employ a novel esophagogastric anastomosis technique for laparoscopic surgery which may avoid esophageal breakdown. Eleven patients with early gastric cancer within the upper gastric body underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. The anvil of the stapler was introduced into the esophagus through a small gastrostomy, before transection of the esophagus. The esophageal-to-anterior gastric wall anastomosis was performed using a double-stapling technique, without the need to apply a purse-string suture. The mean operation time was 237 +/- 15 min and estimated blood loss was 39 +/- 21 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful in all 11 patients, with no anastomotic leakage observed. Two patients needed endoscopic balloon dilation of an anastomotic stricture 24 to 28 days postoperatively. This modified procedure of laparoscopic esophagogastric anastomosis after proximal gastrectomy for the resection of cancer is a simple, rapid, and atraumatic technique which reduces the risk of anastomotic insufficiency.","Hiki, Naoki; Fukunaga, Tetsu; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu; Nunobe, Souya; Tokunaga, Masanori; Ohyama, Shigekazu; Seto, Yasuyuki; Muto, Tetsuichiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,42,28

Expression of IP-10 is seen in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. To determine the in vivo function of IP-10, we constructed an IP-10-deficient mouse (IP-10(-/-)) by targeted gene disruption. Immunological analysis revealed that IP-10(-/-) mice had impaired T cell responses. T cell proliferation to allogeneic and antigenic stimulation and IFN-gamma secretion in response to antigenic challenge were impaired in IP-10(-/-) mice. In addition, IP-10(-/-) mice exhibited an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, characterized by decreased ear swelling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates. T cells recovered from draining lymph nodes also had a decreased proliferative response to Ag restimulation. Furthermore, IP-10(-/-) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had an impaired ability to control viral replication in the brain. This was associated with decreased recruitment of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes into the brain, reduced levels of IFN-gamma and the IFN-gamma-induced chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9) and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11) in the brain, decreased numbers of virus-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) cells in the spleen, and reduced levels of demyelination in the CNS. Taken together, our data suggest a role for IP-10 in both effector T cell generation and trafficking in vivo.","Dufour, Jennifer H; Dziejman, Michelle; Liu, Michael T; Leung, Josephine H; Lane, Thomas E; Luster, Andrew D",Journal of immunology,42,1

RESULTS There was a significant correlation between the SARS cases and the environmental temperature seven days before the onset and the seven day time lag corresponds well with the known incubation period for SARS. The optimum environmental temperature associated with the SARS cases was between 16 degrees C to 28 degrees C, which may encourage virus growth. A sharp rise or decrease in the environmental temperature related to the cold spell led to an increase of the SARS cases because of the possible influence of the weather on the human immune system. This study provided some evidence that there is a higher possibility for SARS to reoccur in spring than that in autumn and winter. CONCLUSION Current knowledge based on case studies of the SARS outbreak in the four cities suggested that the SARS outbreaks were significantly associated with the temperature and its variations. However, because the fallacy and the uncontrolled confounding effects might have biased the results, the possibility of other meteorological factors having an affect on the SARS outbreaks deserves further investigation.","Tan, Jianguo; Mu, Lina; Huang, Jiaxin; Yu, Shunzhang; Chen, Bingheng; Yin, Jun",Journal of epidemiology and community health,42,1

Therefore, these patients may be at high risk for a more severe course of COVID-19, including hospitalisation and death. Concerns about efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccines, as well as doubts, not yet fully clarified in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, represent other important factors for a low vaccination rate in people with (CV). Indeed, providing an expert position on the issues related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients suffering from CV is of critical relevance in order to help both patients and clinicians who are treating them in making the best choice in each case. A multidisciplinary task force of the Italian Group for the Study of Cryoglobulinaemia (GISC) was convened, and through a Delphi technique produced provisional recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cryoglobulinaemic patients.","Scarpato, Salvatore; Sebastiani, Marco; Quartuccio, Luca; Marson, Piero; Fraticelli, Paolo; Castelnovo, Laura; Visentini, Marcella; Candela, Marco; Mazzaro, Cesare; Saccardo, Francesco; Pioltelli, Piero; Casato, Milvia; Filippini, Davide; Monti, Giuseppe; Galli, Massimo",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,42,7

METHODS A retrospective, descriptive study conducted on Canterbury District Health Board trauma registry data. The study population consisted of all major trauma patients of all age groups admitted to Christchurch Hospital over three 33-day periods: before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand. Broadly speaking, major trauma is defined as having an injury severity score 13 or death following injury. RESULTS There was a 42% reduction in the volume of major trauma admissions during lockdown. Falls were the most common injury during lockdown, and transport-related injuries after lockdown. Alcohol intoxication was associated with 19 to 33% of all injuries across the study periods. CONCLUSION Major trauma inevitably occurred during lockdown, although at considerably lower volumes. After lockdown, once restrictions were eased, major trauma admissions reverted to pre-lockdown patterns. Injury prevention strategies can reduce avoidable pressures on hospitals at a time of pandemic. In New Zealand, focus should be placed on reducing alcohol- and transport-related injuries and increasing community awareness on falls prevention.","Fan, Dali; Scowcroft, Hannah; McCombie, Andrew; Duncan, Ruth; Wakeman, Christopher",The New Zealand medical journal,42,1

Aotearoa has recently made some notable changes in health policy by formally recognising the physical health needs of people with mental health and addiction issues. The COVID-19 vaccination sequencing framework provides an important opportunity to protect and promote the health of people with addiction and mental health issues. An expert advisory group, convened as part of the Aotearoa Equally Well collaborative, considered findings of a literature review on the vulnerability of people with mental health and addiction issues of contracting and dying from COVID-19. Evidence indicates an association between mental health and addiction issues and infection risk and worse outcomes. The group concluded mental health and addiction issues should be recognised as underlying health conditions that increase COVID-19 vulnerability, and that people with these issues should be prioritised for vaccination. For too long the health system has failed to address the life expectancy gap of people with addiction and mental health issues. Now is an opportunity to change the kōrero.

Herein, we show that supramolecular formulation of CQ by a macrocyclic host, curcurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), reduced its non-specific toxicity and improved its antiviral activity against coronavirus, working in synergy with CB[7]. CB[7] was found to form 1:1 host-guest complexes with CQ, with a binding constant of â¼104 L/mol. The CQ-CB[7] formulation decreased the cytotoxicity of CQ against Vero E6 and L-02 cell lines. In particular, the cytotoxicity of CQ (60 µmol/L) against both Vero E6 cell line and L-02 cell lines was completely inhibited in the presence of 300 µmol/L and 600 µmol/L CB[7], respectively. Furthermore, the CB[7] alone showed astonishing antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells and Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) infected N2A cells, and synergistically improved the antiviral activity of CQ-CB[7], suggesting that CB[7]-based CQ formulation has a great potential as a safe and effective antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus.","Kwong, Cheryl H T; Mu, Jingfang; Li, Shengke; Fang, Yaohui; Liu, Qianyun; Zhang, Xiangjun; Kam, Hiotong; Lee, Simon M Y; Chen, Yu; Deng, Fei; Zhou, Xi; Wang, Ruibing",,42,20

Our aim is to describe the first non-ICU Spanish deceased series with COVID-19, comparing specifically between unexpected and expected deaths. Methods: In this single-centre study, all deceased inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had died from March 4 to April 16, 2020 were consecutively included. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, were analyzed and compared between groups. Factors associated with unexpected death were identified by multivariable logistic regression methods. Results: In total, 324 deceased patients were included. Median age was 82 years (IQR 76-87); 55.9% males. The most common cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension (78.4%), hyperlipidemia (57.7%), and diabetes (34.3%). Other common comorbidities were chronic kidney disease (40.1%), chronic pulmonary disease (30.3%), active cancer (13%), and immunosuppression (13%). The Confusion, BUN, Respiratory Rate, Systolic BP and age &#8805;65 (CURB-65) score at admission was >2 in 40.7% of patients. During hospitalization, 77.8% of patients received antivirals, 43.3% systemic corticosteroids, and 22.2% full anticoagulation. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 5.5%, and 105 (32.4%) patients had an increased level of troponin I. The median time from initiation of therapy to death was 5 days (IQR 3.0-8.0). In 45 patients (13.9%), the death was exclusively attributed to COVID-19, and in 254 patients (78.4%), both COVID-19 and the clinical status before admission contributed to death. Progressive respiratory failure was the most frequent cause of death (92.0%). Twenty-five patients (7.7%) had an unexpected death. Factors independently associated with unexpected death were male sex, chronic kidney disease, insulin-treated diabetes, and functional independence. Conclusions: This case series provides in-depth characterization of hospitalized non-ICU COVID-19 patients who died in Madrid. Male sex, insulin-treated diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and independency for activities of daily living are predictors of unexpected death.","Pérez-García, Carlos Nicolás; Enríquez-Vázquez, Daniel; Méndez-Bailón, Manuel; Olmos, Carmen; Gómez-Polo, Juan Carlos; Iguarán, Rosario; Ramos-López, Noemí; García-Klepzig, José Luis; Ferrández-Escarabajal, Marcos; Jerónimo, Adrián; Martínez-Gómez, Eduardo; Font-Urgelles, Judit; Fragiel-Saavedra, Marcos; Paz-Arias, Pilar; Romero-Delgado, Teresa; Gómez-Álvarez, Zaira; Playán-Escribano, Julia; Jaén, Esther; Vargas, Gianna; González, Elizabeth; Orviz, Eva; Burruezo, Irene; Calvo, Alberto; Nieto, Ángel; Molino, Ángel; Lorenzo-Villalba, Noël; Andrès, Emmanuel; Macaya, Carlos; Vilacosta, Isidre",,42,30

Here, we review recently published studies on the clinical diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of MIS-C, highlighting key gaps in research progress that are a microcosm for challenges in translational pediatric research. We then discuss potential solutions in the realm of translational bioinformatics. RECENT FINDINGS: Current case definitions are inconsistent and do not capture the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C, which remains poorly understood. Although overall mortality is low, some patients rapidly decompensate, and a test to identify those at risk for severe outcomes remains an unmet need. Treatment consists of various combinations of immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and biologics, based on extrapolated data and expert opinion, while the benefits remain unclear as we await the completion of clinical trials. SUMMARY: The small size and heterogeneity of the pediatric population contribute to unmet needs because of financial and logistical constraints of the current research infrastructure focused on eliminating most sources of heterogeneity, leading to ungeneralizable results. Data sharing and meta-analysis of gene expression shows promise to accelerate progress in the field of MIS-C as well as other childhood diseases beyond the current pandemic.","Murphy Jones, Lara; Khatri, Purvesh",Curr Opin Pediatr,42,16

The initial reported patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and children had low incidence and were not susceptible. As the number of children infected gradually increased, the infection spread to premature babies, infants and young children, and severe cases in children have now occurred. Susceptibility characteristics of the entire population have been identified in the latest diagnosis and treatment plan. At present, the proportion of children affected by the disease is relatively low, but it still deserves enough attention. The epidemiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia in children and adults is unclear, and there is no specific drug for treatment, which brings great difficulties to epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment. Early identification of epidemiological characteristics and effective treatment with drugs are the key to preventing and controlling this new epidemic.

While many factors contribute to reduced demand and supply, we attribute the low amount of coverage to the high levels of capital that would be required to credibly insure pandemic economic losses with cross-sectional pooling mechanisms. Pooling over time significantly reduces the required capital and therefore the cost of insurance, but as a practical matter likely requires a government with the ability to borrow and tax. We also argue that insurance for economic losses due to pandemics likely generates positive externalities for the macroeconomy. We therefore analyze the general tradeoffs associated with different ways that a government can promote such insurance.","Hartwig, Robert; Niehaus, Greg; Qiu, Joseph",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,42,16

Despite several medical treatment protocols having been established, a comprehensive rehabilitation program that can promote functional recovery is still frequently ignored. An online consensus meeting of an expert panel comprising members of the Taiwan Academy of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation was held to provide recommendations for rehabilitation protocols in each of the five COVID-19 stages, namely (1) outpatients with mild disease and no risk factors, (2) outpatients with mild disease and epidemiological risk factors, (3) hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease, (4) ventilator-supported patients with clear cognitive function, and (5) ventilator-supported patients with impaired cognitive function. Apart from medications and life support care, a proper rehabilitation protocol that facilitates recovery from COVID-19 needs to be established and emphasized in clinical practice.","Cheng, Yuan-Yang; Chen, Chin-Ming; Huang, Wei-Chun; Chiang, Shang-Lin; Hsieh, Pei-Chun; Lin, Ko-Long; Chen, Yi-Jen; Fu, Tieh-Cheng; Huang, Shu-Chun; Chen, Ssu-Yuan; Chen, Chia-Hsin; Chen, Shyh-Ming; Chen, Hsin-Shui; Chou, Li-Wei; Chou, Chen-Liang; Li, Min-Hui; Tsai, Sen-Wei; Wang, Lin-Yi; Wang, Yu-Lin; Chou, Willy",J.

Yet, few studies have directly compared social cognition in ASD, SCZ, and typical development (TD). The current study examined individual differences in face recognition and its relation to affective theory of mind (ToM) in each diagnostic group. Adults with ASD (n = 31), SCZ (n = 43), and TD (n = 47) between the ages of 18 and 48 years-old with full scale IQ above 80 participated in this study. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) measured affective ToM, and the Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT) measured face perception. Adults with ASD and SCZ did not differ in their affective ToM abilities, and both groups showed affective ToM difficulties compared with TD. However, better face recognition ability uniquely predicted better affective ToM ability in ASD. Results suggest that affective ToM difficulties may relate to face processing in ASD but not SCZ. By clarifying the complex nature of individual differences in affective ToM and face recognition difficulties in these disorders, the present study suggests there may be divergent mechanisms underlying pathways to social dysfunction in ASD compared with SCZ.

We sought to provide direct proof of the global population's altered use of Wikipedia medical knowledge resulting from the new COVID-19 pandemic and related global restrictions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify temporal search trends and quantify changes in access to Wikipedia Medicine Project articles that were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical articles across nine language versions of Wikipedia and country-specific statistics for registered COVID-19 deaths. The observed patterns were compared to a forecast model of Wikipedia use, which was trained on data from 2015 to 2019. The model comprehensively analyzed specific articles and similarities between access count data from before (ie, several years prior) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wikipedia articles that were linked to those directly associated with the pandemic were evaluated in terms of degrees of separation and analyzed to identify similarities in access counts. We assessed the correlation between article access counts and the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths to identify factors that drove interest in these articles and shifts in public interest during the subsequent phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: We observed a significant (P<.001) increase in the number of entries on Wikipedia medical articles during the pandemic period. The increased interest in COVID-19-related articles temporally correlated with the number of global COVID-19 deaths and consistently correlated with the number of region-specific COVID-19 deaths. Articles with low degrees of separation were significantly similar (P<.001) in terms of access patterns that were indicative of information-seeking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Wikipedia medical article popularity could be a viable method for epidemiologic surveillance, as it provides important information about the reasons behind public attention and factors that sustain public interest in the long term. Moreover, Wikipedia users can potentially be directed to credible and valuable information sources that are linked with the most prominent articles.","Chrzanowski, Jedrzej; Solek, Julia; Fendler, Wojciech; Jemielniak, Dariusz",J Med Internet Res,42,10

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote olfactory assessment;in particular, smell training at home is a promising method for olfactory rehabilitation, but further methodological advances might enhance its effectiveness and range of use. Here, we present Exerscent, a portable, low-cost olfactory display designed primarily for uses outside of the laboratory and that can be operated with a personal computer. Exerscent includes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags that are attached to odor stimuli and read with a MFRC522 module RFID reader/antenna that encodes the odor in order to provide adaptive challenges for the user (e.g., an odor identification task). Hardware parts are commercially available or 3D printed. Instructions and code for building the Exerscent are freely available online (https://osf.io/kwftm/). As a proof of concept, we present a case study in which a participant trained daily to identify 54 odors, improving from 81% to 96% accuracy over 16 consecutive days. In addition, results from a laboratory experiment with 11 volunteers indicated a very high level of perceived usability and engagement. Exerscent may be used for olfactory skills development (e.g., perfumery, enology), and rehabilitation purposes (e.g., postviral olfactory loss), but it also allows for other forms of technological interactions such as olfactory-based recreational interactions.

Most reported data relate to incidence, risk factors, and outcome of severe COVID-19. The safety of systemic anti-cancer therapy in oncology patients with non-severe COVID-19 is an important matter in daily practice. METHODS: ONCOSARS-1 was a single-center, academic observational study. Adult patients with solid tumors treated in the oncology day unit with systemic anti-cancer therapy during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium were prospectively included. All patients (n = 363) underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological testing after the first peak of the pandemic in Belgium. Additionally, 141 of these patients also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the pandemic. The main objective was to retrospectively determine the safety of systemic cancer treatment, measured by the rate of adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two (6%) of the 363 eligible patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and/or serology. Of these, three required transient oxygen supplementation, but none required admission to the intensive care unit. Hematotoxicity was the only adverse event more frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2 -positive patients than in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients: 73% vs 35% (P < 0.001). This association remained significant (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, P = 0.009) even after adjusting for performance status and type of systemic treatment. Hematological adverse events led to more treatment delays for the SARS-CoV-2-positive group: 55% vs 20% (P < 0.001). Median duration of treatment interruption was similar between the two groups: 14 and 11 days, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, infections unrelated to COVID-19, and bleeding events occurred at a low rate in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Systemic anti-cancer therapy appeared safe in ambulatory oncology patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were, however, more treatment delays in the SARS-CoV-2-positive population, mainly due to a higher rate of hematological adverse events.","van Marcke, C; Honoré, N; van der Elst, A; Beyaert, S; Derouane, F; Dumont, C; Aboubakar Nana, F; Baurain, J F; Borbath, I; Collard, P; Cornélis, F; De Cuyper, A; Duhoux, F P; Filleul, B; Galot, R; Gizzi, M; Mazzeo, F; Pieters, T; Seront, E; Sinapi, I; Van den Eynde, M; Whenham, N; Yombi, J C; Scohy, A; van Maanen, A; Machiels, J P",BMC Cancer,42,3

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through electronic explorations of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Besides, three Chinese databases were searched. A snowballing method searching the bibliographies of the retrieved references was applied to identify potentially relevant articles. Articles published within 1 year prior to April 20th, 2020, were screened with no language restriction imposed. Databases were searched for terms related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and neurological manifestations, using a pre-established protocol registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (ID: CRD42020187994). RESULTS: A total of 2441 articles were screened for relevant content, of which 92 full-text publications were included in the analyses of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Headache, dizziness, taste and smell dysfunctions, and impaired consciousness were the most frequently described neurological symptoms, the latter more often among patients with a severe or critical disease course. To date, only smaller cohort studies or single cases have reported cerebrovascular events, seizures, meningoencephalitis, and immune-mediated neurological diseases, not suitable for quantitative analysis. CONCLUSION: The most frequent neurological symptoms reported in association with COVID-19 are non-specific for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to gain direct access to the nervous system, so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in two cases only. Standardized international registries are needed to clarify the clinical relevance of the neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and to elucidate a possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on common neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.","Chen, Xiangliang; Laurent, Sarah; Onur, Oezguer A; Kleineberg, Nina N; Fink, Gereon R; Schweitzer, Finja; Warnke, Clemens",J. neurol,42,2

For example, currently, the debate continues to reveal when and where the first spread of COVID-19 occured. For this problem, most of the works have assumed a static network topology, that is, the connections between nodes do not change over time. This is impractical because many nodes have some mobility in the network, or the connections can be changed. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic network, in the sense that the node connectivity varies over time. We first introduce a simple dynamic model, named k-flip dynamic such that k &gt; 0 connections in the network may be changed with some probability at each time. Next, we design a proper estimation algorithm using some investigation for the contact information between infected nodes, named dynamic network source estimation (DNSE)(k) for the dynamic model. We perform various simulations for the algorithm compared to several existing source estimation methods. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms and is efficient for finding the epidemic source compared to other methods.

It has claimed more than 0.8 million lives worldwide, and more than 27 million people have been infected as of 07th September 2020. In Sri Lanka, the first case of COVID-19 was reported late January 2020 which was a Chinese national and the first local case was identified in the second week of March. Since then, the government of Sri Lanka introduced various sequential measures to improve social distancing such as closure of schools and education institutes, introducing work from home model to reduce the public gathering, introducing travel bans to international arrivals, and more drastically, imposed island wide curfew expecting to minimize the burden of the disease to the Sri Lankan health system and the entire community. Currently, there are 3123 cases with 12 fatalities and also, it was reported that 2925 patients have recovered and are discharged from hospitals, according to the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. In this study, we use the SEIR conceptual model and its modified version by decomposing infected patients into two classes: patients who show mild symptoms and patients who tend to face severe respiratory problems and are required to be treated in intensive care units. We numerically simulate the models for about a five-month period reflecting the early stage of the epidemic in the country, considering three critical parameters of COVID-19 transmission mainly in the Sri Lankan context: efficacy of control measures, rate of overseas imported cases, and time to introduce social distancing measures by the respective authorities.","Wickramaarachchi, W P T M; Perera, S S N; Jayasinghe, S",Comput Math Methods Med,42,16

An additional 39 cases were identified in persons repatriated from affected areas outside the United States (1). Starting in late February, reports of cases with no recent travel to affected areas or links to known cases signaled the initiation of pandemic spread in the United States (2). By mid-March, transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had accelerated, with rapidly increasing case counts indicating established transmission in the United States. Ongoing traveler importation of SARS-CoV-2, attendance at professional and social events, introduction into facilities or settings prone to amplification, and challenges in virus detection all contributed to rapid acceleration of transmission during March. Public health responses included intensive efforts to detect cases and trace contacts, and implementation of multiple community mitigation strategies. Because most of the population remains susceptible to infection, recognition of factors associated with amplified spread during the early acceleration period will help inform future decisions as locations in the United States scale back some components of mitigation and strengthen systems to detect a potential transmission resurgence. U.S. circulation of SARS-CoV-2 continues, and sustained efforts will be needed to prevent future spread within the United States.","Schuchat, Anne",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,42,5

The disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily known as a respiratory tract infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multi-system disease with varying degrees of severity and affects several human systems including the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic, and immune systems. From the existing data, most COVID-19 cases develop a mild disease typically presented with fever and respiratory illness. However, in some patients, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 might progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction, and septic shock resulting in a critical condition. Likewise, specific organ dysfunction seems to be related to the disease complication, worsens the condition, and increases the lethality of COVID-19. The neurological manifestations in association with disease severity and mortality have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Despite the continuously increasing reports of the neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, our knowledge about the possible routes of nervous system involvement associated with COVID-19 is limited. Herein, we will primarily describe the critical aspects and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 related to nervous system impairment and then discuss possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 nervous system involvement based on the current evidence.","Norouzi, Mahnaz; Miar, Paniz; Norouzi, Shaghayegh; Nikpour, Parvaneh",Mol.

We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation. Using next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing variable clinical outcomes following COVID-19 infection. Forty-nine of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allele frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n = 13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n = 16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology. We found a significant difference in the allele frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% vs. 16.7%, P = .003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01-DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (P = .007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater frequencies in the North Western European population. This regional study provides evidence that HLA genotype influences clinical outcome in COVID-19 infection. Validation studies must take account of the complex genetic architecture of the immune system across different geographies and ethnicities.","Langton, David J; Bourke, Stephen C; Lie, Benedicte A; Reiff, Gabrielle; Natu, Shonali; Darlay, Rebecca; Burn, John; Echevarria, Carlos",HLA,42,16

SLs can exist mainly in an acidic and a lactonic form, both of which display inhibitory activity. Given the amphipathic nature of SLs it is feasible that these antimicrobial actions are the result of the perturbation of the physicochemical properties of targeted membranes. Thus, in this work we have carried out a biophysical study to unveil the molecular details of the interaction of an acidic SL with a model phospholipid membrane made of 1,2-dipalmitoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). Using differential scanning calorimetry it was found that SL altered the phase behaviour of DPPC at low molar fractions, producing fluid phase immiscibility with the result of formation of biosurfactant-enriched domains within the phospholipid bilayer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that SL interacted with DPPC increasing ordering of the phospholipid acyl chain palisade and hydration of the lipid/water interface. Small angle X-ray scattering showed that SL did not modify bilayer thickness in the biologically relevant L&#945; fluid phase. SL was found to induce contents leakage in 1-palmitoy-2-oleoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) unilamellar liposomes, at sublytic concentrations below the cmc. This SL-induced membrane permeabilization at concentrations below the onset for membrane solubilization can be the result of the formation of laterally segregated domains, which might contribute to provide a molecular basis for the reported antimicrobial actions of SLs.","Franco Marcelino, Paulo Ricardo; Ortiz, Julia; da Silva, Silvio Silvério; Ortiz, Antonio",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,42,9

Eighty-four cows with retained placenta, between July 2013 to July 2014, diagnosed by the presence of fetal membranes in the uterus up to 12 hours after partum, decrease of appetite and of milk production, as well increase of rectal temperature were included into the study. The animals were submitted to blood collection for evaluating the seropositivity for brucellosis, leptospirosis and neosporosis. The blood was collected at 15 to 45 days postpartum, avoiding false negative results due to immune deficiency observed in the transition period. After collection, the blood was centrifuged, the serum was packed in three aliquots, identified and subsequently frozen. Serology was performed to diagnose brucellosis (technique of buffered acidified antigen), leptospirosis (through the microscopic agglutination test - MAT) and neosporosis (indirect immunofluorescence test). Animals were considered positive when presenting titer >1:100 (leptospirosis) and 1:200 (neosporosis).

Questions/Purposes: We sought to evaluate patient satisfaction with telehealth visits as a platform for delivering care for the treatment of spinal pathology. Methods: Patients undergoing a telehealth visit with providers specializing in the treatment of spinal disorders (one surgeon and two physiatrists) were provided with an anonymous, online survey. Data on patient satisfaction, effectiveness of the telehealth visit (in comparison with in-person visits), and clarity of communication were collected through 5-point Likert scales; visit characteristics and free-text responses were also collected. Results: Eighty-four patients responded to the survey. Their attitudes were largely positive, with an overall mean patient satisfaction score of 4.79. Patients gave high scores for clarity of communication during the visit, and for satisfaction with the formulation of treatment plans and their ability to ask questions, they gave the lowest scores to the effectiveness of telemedicine in replacing an in-person visit and ease of interface navigation. Conclusions: The high overall patient satisfaction reported by our patients seeking care for a spinal pathology supports the growing body of evidence promoting the use of telehealth for orthopedic care.

It contains the classes of susceptible individuals, exposed, infected symptomatic and asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized and recovered. The basic reproduction number and the final size of epidemic are determined. The model is used to fit available data for some European countries. A more detailed model with two different subclasses of susceptible individuals is introduced in order to study the influence of social interaction on the disease progression. The coefficient of social interaction K characterizes the level of social contacts in comparison with complete lockdown (K=0) and the absence of lockdown (K=1). The fitting of data shows that the actual level of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.","Sharma, Swarnali; Volpert, Vitaly; Banerjee, Malay",Math Biosci Eng,42,30

Both viruses infect the respiratory tract, show similar symptoms, and use surface proteins to infect the host. Influenza requires hemagglutinin and neuraminidase to infect, whereas SARS-CoV-2 uses protein S. Both viruses depend on a viral RNA polymerase to express their proteins, but only SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading mechanism, which results in a low mutation rate compared to influenza. E1KC4 and camostat mesylate are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, achieving an effect similar to oseltamivir. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate, nucleoside analogs have been developed (such as EIDD-2801), which insert lethal mutations in the viral RNA. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate suggests that a vaccine, as well as the immunity developed in recovered patients, could provide long-lasting protection compared to vaccines against influenza, which are rendered obsolete as the virus mutates.","Manzanares-Meza, Laura D; Medina-Contreras, Oscar",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,42,1

The movement of people might be one influencing factor, this paper aims to report the situation COVID-19 and spreading in Thailand, including influencing factors of spreading and control. Subject and method: Infected, confirmed COVID-19 data were obtained from the official website of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Tourist data was downloaded from Ministry of Tourism and Sports. Researchers analyzed the situation from the first found case in Thailand until 15 April 2020 with the timeline of important influencing factors. Correlation coefficients of tourist data and infected case was calculated by person correlation coefficient. Results: The number of infected cases was significant associated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with economic factor, namely; number of visitors, generated income from both Thai and foreigner tourist (p value <0.01). The influencing factors of slow increased rate were the enforcement and implementation of both central and local government regulation, the strength of the Thai health care system, the culture and social relation, the partnership among various governmental and private sectors. Conclusion: We found that the number of tourist and their activities were significant associated with number of infected, confirmed COVID-19 cases. The public education and social supporting were the key roles for regulation enforcement and implementation.","Tantrakarnapa, Kraichat; Bhopdhornangkul, Bhophkrit; Nakhaapakorn, Kanchana",Z Gesundh Wiss,42,7

In Japan, despite the declaration of a “state of emergency”, no lockdown was implemented, and a request for self-restraint and avoidance of non-essential trips was instead issued. After a month, the state of emergency was lifted. Because patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were forced to stay during the state of emergency, resulting in a lack of physical activity, concerns about their glycemic control were raised. Therefore, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels during different time periods were compared (May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019, May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020). We analyzed 165 patients with DM. The mean age of subjects was 67.8 + 11.5 years. Male comprised 67.3% of the participants. The mean body weight was 65.6 + 14.6 kg on July 2019 and 66.1 + 15.2 kg on July 2020. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.4 + 3.6 kg/m2 on July 2019 and 24.4 + 3.6 on July 2020. Patients with Type 2 DM (T2DM) comprised 90% of the participants, while the rest had T1DM. Mean duration of DM was 12.0 + 7.4 years. In order to assess the effect of the self-restraint on plasma glucose control, HbA1c levels during these periods were compared: May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019 (one year before COVID-19 pandemic.), and May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020 (The last three months during COVID-19). March 2020 is corresponded to a period before the request for self-restraint, while June and July 2020 corresponded to the periods right after the end of self-restraint. We also compared HbA1c levels between May 2019 and July 2020 using the Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) to assess whether SMBG affected plasma glucose control during the period of self-restraint. HbA1c levels in May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019, May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020, were 7.32 + 1.23, 7.44 + 1.20, 7.16 + 1.06, 7.01 + 1.05, 7.23 + 1.06, 7.45 + 1.18, 7.15 + 10.7, and 7.11 + 1.17, respectively. Similarly, HbA1c levels between May 2019 without SMBG and May 2019 with SMBG were not statistically different. In this clinical study, we found that the request to avoid non-essential trips as a form of self-restraint during the country’s state of emergency did not affect plasma glucose control of patients with DM. We noted that the patients did not have signs of insulin resistance as their BMI on July 2019 and July 2020 were 24.4 + 3.6 and 24.4 + 3.6, respectively. Unexpectedly, the HbA1c levels were not affected by the absence or presence of SMBG. This could explain why HbA1c levels were not elevated, despite a temporarily sedentary lifestyle and a lack of exercise for a month. In addition, due to the self-restraint, the frequency of dining outside the house decreased, which could have contributed to the non-elevation of HbA1c levels.","Watanabe, Takuya Takamizawa Tetsuya Okada Junichi Yamada Eijiro Saito Tsugumichi Okada Kazuya Nakajima Yasuyo Ozawa Atsushi Temma Yuichi Okada Shuichi Yamada Masanobu Horigome Mitsuaki",Journal of the Endocrine Society,42,1

In this retrospective study, data pertaining to the 31 OHCWs diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, were retrieved and analyzed. Questionnaires were administered to the subjects over the Internet and telephone. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics and information on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were collected. There were 22 females and 9 males, with a median age of 39 y. Although the severity of most cases of COVID-19 (93.5%) was mild or moderate, 1 case was severe, and another case was critical, resulting in death. Fever was the main first symptom of COVID-19, followed by fatigue and myalgia. Most of the OHCWs routinely used PPE such as medical masks, gloves, caps, and work clothes while performing clinical work. N95 or KN95 masks were rarely available because of the scarcity of PPE during the outbreak. Nineteen OHCWs reported a contact history, among whom 7 worked in a fever clinic, 5 reported contact with dental patients suspected of having COVID-19, and 7 reported contact with family members with COVID-19-related symptoms at least 1 d earlier. Our findings indicated that there were few clusters of COVID-19 in dental settings. Since the outbreak, the Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, has provided emergency dental treatment, and none of their staff were infected while providing dental service, which indicates that comprehensive measures such as the use of advanced PPE and environmental disinfection can prevent cross-infection in dental practice. The analysis of the procedures followed during the emergency treatments indicated that OHCWs preferred to recommend conservative treatment to patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dental practitioners.","Meng, L; Ma, B; Cheng, Y; Bian, Z",J Dent Res,42,15

Strikingly, some of the functions of the ER are exploited by viruses to promote their life cycles. During entry, viruses must penetrate a host membrane and reach an intracellular destination to express and replicate their genomes. These events lead to the assembly of new viral progenies that exit the host cell, thereby initiating further rounds of infection. In this review, we highlight how three distinct viruses - polyomavirus, flavivirus, and coronavirus - co-opt key functions of the ER to cause infection. We anticipate that illuminating this virus-ER interplay will provide rational therapeutic approaches to combat the virus-induced diseases.","Chen, Yu-Jie; Bagchi, Parikshit; Tsai, Billy",Biochem Soc Trans,42,1

To capture these parameters, survey sample sizes may need to be very large, especially when the overall infection rate is still low. Therefore, we propose the use of ""snowball sampling"" to enrich serological surveys by testing contacts of infected individuals identified in the early stages of an outbreak. For future emerging pandemics, this observational study sampling design can answer many key questions, such as estimating the asymptomatic proportion of all infected cases, the probability of a given clinical presentation for a seropositive individual, or the association between characteristics of either the host or the infection and seropositivity among contacts of index individuals. We provide examples, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, of studies and analysis methods using a snowball sample and perform a simulation study that demonstrates scenarios where snowball sampling can answer these questions more efficiently than other sampling schemes. We hope such study designs can be applied to provide valuable information to slow the present pandemic as it enters its next stage and in early stages of future pandemics.","Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Qiu, Xueting; Hanage, William P",Am. j. epidemiol,42,21

This has been exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders, making people reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its evolving impact, especially related to vulnerable populations. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal topical analysis of postings between subreddits r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus, and postings between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus from January 2020 - October 2020.

Recently, it has been shown (Popov et al., 2017) that films of nematic liquid crystals doped with chiral molecules adopt biconvex lens shapes underwater. The curved shape together with degenerate planar anchoring leads to a radial variation of the optical axis along the plane of the film, providing a Pancharatnam-Berry-type phase lens that modifies geometric optical imaging. Here, we describe nematic liquid crystal microlenses formed by the addition of chiral nanoparticles. It is found that the helical twisting power of the nanoparticles, the key factor to form the lens, is about 400 µm-1, greater than that of the strongest molecular chiral dopants. We demonstrate imaging capabilities and measure the shape as well as the focal length of the chiral nanoparticle-doped liquid crystal lens. We show that measuring the shape of the lens allows one to calculate the helical pitch of the chiral nematic liquid crystal and thus determine the helical twisting power of the chiral ligand-capped nanoparticles. Such measurements require the use of only nanograms of chiral nanoparticles, which is 3 orders of magnitude less than that required by conventional techniques. Since NPs are sensitive to external stimuli such as light and electric and magnetic fields, the use of chiral NPs may allow the achievement of tunable optical properties for such microlens arrays.","Perera, Kelum; Nemati, Ahlam; Mann, Elizabeth K; Hegmann, Torsten; Jákli, Antal",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),42,20

There were 243 representative participants of the Spanish population according to sex, age, and educational level. The methodology was mixed, qualitative for the first objective and quantitative for the second. The first used the Thematic Network, while the second used logistic regression. From the qualitative analysis, three major categories were extracted: intrinsic orientation, extrinsic orientation, and empty orientation. The quantitative results showed a clear advantage in well-being for the intrinsically oriented group. The group of intrinsic orientation presented a better coping ability while the group of extrinsic orientation was as little adaptive as the group of empty orientation.

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also infect tissues besides the respiratory system, such as the ocular tissues, remains unclear. Objective: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exists intracellularly in the ocular tissues of a patient previously infected with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case study analyzed a patient previously infected with COVID-19 who had an acute glaucoma attack during her rehabilitation. Plasma samples and tissue specimens, including ones from the conjunctiva, anterior lens capsular, trabecular meshwork, and iris, were collected during phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy surgery. Specimens from another patient who had glaucoma but not COVID-19 were used as a negative control. Main Outcomes and Measures: Specimens were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was measured in the conjunctiva, trabecular meshwork, and iris using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the conjunctiva was measured using immunohistochemistry. Results: The patient with a previous COVID-19 infection was female and 64 years old, and the control patient without a COVID-19 infection history was male and 61 years old. The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the cells of the conjunctiva, trabecular, and iris of the patient infected with COVID-19 but not in the control participant, while angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor proteins were detected on the conjunctiva of both patients. Conclusions and Relevance: The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 existed intracellularly in the ocular tissues of a patient previously infected with COVID-19.

METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study, we monitored the serum lipids in 17 surviving and 4 non-surviving COVID-19 cases prior to their viral infections and duration the entire disease courses. RESULTS: In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0-4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3-3.1), pâ¯<â¯0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3-3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7-4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9-1.2), pâ¯=â¯0.02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to compare coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes in centenarians and other residents living in nursing homes. Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Worsening of pre-existing depression seems to be more frequent in centenarians with COVID-19 in nursing homes. This population had a higher mortality rate but a lower hospitalization rate than younger residents.","Couderc, Anne-Laure; Correard, Florian; Nouguerède, Emilie; Berbis, Julie; Rey, Dominique; Daumas, Aurélie; Villani, Patrick",Aging (Albany NY),42,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Students were provided with the instrumentation and materials required to complete 5 waxing projects at home during the 3 week course. In the same time period, the didactic content was presented via 11 webinar sessions. A post-course survey provided student perspectives regarding this new experience. RESULTS: Students were able to effectively complete high quality waxing projects at home by using step-by-step images and videos but the survey indicated an overwhelming preference for in-person faculty feedback. Webinars based on the students having studied the 3D Tooth Atlas and an instructor reviewing content in the Atlas was effective in teaching the didactic aspect of tooth morphology as evidenced by the student grades and survey results. However, most of the students indicated a preference for physically going to class and being able to interact with faculty and classmates as opposed to online webinars. The condensed 3-week version of the course was part of an expanded 4 week student orientation and worked well, allowing other clinical precursor courses to occur before their usual time in the curriculum, thereby allowing students to begin earlier patient treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The at-home waxing exercises produced very good results by having the students use step-by-step images and videos in the 3D Tooth Atlas. However, the students indicated a strong preference for personal faculty feedback that was not available at home. Students effectively learned the didactic aspects of tooth morphology through the webinars with accompanying use of the 3D Tooth Atlas but again most students prefer physically going to class and being able to interact with faculty and classmates. These preferences for contact with classmates and faculty supports the natural human desire for personal interactions with other human beings. This article is protected by copyright.

Endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME), play an important role for CoVs to penetrate the cell membrane barrier. In this study, a novel CoV entry manner is unraveled in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV). Using multicolor live-cell imaging, the dynamics of the fluorescently labeled clathrin structures, caveolae structures, and PEDV were dissected. During CavME of PEDV, we found that clathrin structures can fuse with caveolae near the cell plasma membrane, and the average time of PEDV penetrating the cell membrane was within â¼3 min, exhibiting a rapid course of PEDV entry. Moreover, based on the dynamic recruitment of clathrin and caveolae structures and viral motility, the direct evidence also shows that about 20% of PEDVs can undergo an abortive entry via CME and CavME. Additionally, the dynamic trafficking of PEDV from clathrin and caveolae structures to early endosomes, and from early endosomes to late endosomes, and viral fusion were directly dissected, and PEDV fusion mainly occurred in late endosomes within â¼6.8 min after the transport of PEDV to late endosomes. Collectively, this work systematically unravels the early steps of PEDV infection, which expands our understanding of the mechanism of CoV infection.IMPORTANCE Emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause serious human and animal epidemics worldwide. For many enveloped viruses, including coronavirus, it is evident that breaking the plasma membrane barrier is a pivotal and complex process, which contains multiple dynamic steps. Although great efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of coronavirus endocytic pathways, the direct real-time imaging of individual porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) internalization has not been achieved yet. In this study, we not only dissected the kinetics of PEDV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the kinetics of endosome trafficking and viral fusion but also found a novel productive coronavirus entry manner in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of PEDV. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of PEDV abortive endocytosis. In summary, the productive PEDV entry via the cooperation between clathrin and caveolae structures and the abortive endocytosis of PEDV provide new insights into coronavirus penetrating the plasma membrane barrier.","Li, Yangyang; Wang, Jian; Hou, Wei; Shan, Yanke; Wang, Shouyu; Liu, Fei",mBio (Online),42,20
346364,346364,346364,In Reply to Wayne et al,21.195951,8.591801,2021,"Background and aims: Nowadays, Covid-19 is considered as a pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 25, 2020, in more than 156 countries, about 664,731 new cases of the disease and 30,892 deaths were reported. Iran is one of the countries with the highest incidence. Although, there is a possibility of occupational accident in all health care provision environments, the offices is the main dangerous health care provider in terms of occupational infections in health systems. Ensuring the safety of employees in offices is not only crucial in protecting them against the virus but also in preventing the transmission of the virus. Protective behaviours are effective in prevention of occurrence of the disease. Protection motivation theory (PMT) helps to understand preventive behaviours better and can be used in occupational injury training programs. Considering the importance of identifying the factors of the preventive behaviours of Covid-19 in the development and implementation of preventive programs, this study was conducted for predicting the preventive behaviour againt Covid-19 based on the PMT among employees in crowded offices in Qom, Iran. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 232 employees in crowded offices in Qom, Iran have been selected using random clustering sampling method. Data collection instrument included demographic characteristics, protective behaviors against Covid-19, and PMT scale. The PMT constructs were assessed by questions composed and 7 subscales as follows: perceived vulnerability(2 items);perceived severity (2 items);perceived fear (2 items);self-efficacy (3 items);response efficacy (3 items);response cost (2 items);and protection motivation (1 items). The items were rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). According to the theoretical assumptions, the threat appraisal score is the sum of the perceived susceptibility and severity scores. In addition, the coping appraisal score is the sum of the self-efficacy and response efficacy scores minus the response cost score. Five items scale by a three-point rated ‘always’, ‘sometimes’ and ‘never scored 2, 1 and 0, respectively measured Covid-19 preventive behaviors. The validity of the scale was confirmed using the viewpoints of health-education experts. The reliability of the scale was investigated by calculating internal consistency. Data have been analyzed via descriptive statistics and structural equations through SmartPLS statistical software. In the structural model, path coefficient, and R square were used to measure relationships among constructs. The predictive power of the model was examined by calculating Q2 indexes of behavior. Finally, a goodness of fit (GoF) index was calculated to display the model fit to the model. Results: Mean and standard deviation of participants’ age has been 39.8±8.7;and, 90.1% of them have been male. More than half of participants (53.8%) have shown protective behaviors higher than average. There has been a significant relationship between coping appraisal and protection motivation (β=0.297 and p-value&lt;0.05). However, there has been no significant relationship between threat appraisal and fear constructs and protection motivation (β=0.060 and p-value&gt;0.05). In addition, there has been significant positive relationship between protection motivation and protective behaviors (β=0.214 and p-value&lt;0.05). Fit indices of the model have been desirable and the model could predict overall 5% of changes in performing protective behaviors. GoF was 0.503, indicating the model good fit. Conclusion: According to the results, coping appraisals were identified to be the significant positive associations with protection motivation. Contrary to the expectations based on the PMT, it is generally seen that none of the threat appraisals (severity, vulnerability, and fear) predicted protection motivation and preventive behavior against Covid-19. Protection motivation is a predictor factor of the protective behaviors. The results can be used in formulating training programs to optimize protective behaviors among employees working in offices. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

While most patients in the United States continue to be managed in coronary care units after primary percutaneous coronary intervention, there is a robust literature regarding the ability to triage STEMI patients safely and efficiently with low-risk features to non-ICU beds. We review the various risk scores for STEMI triage and the data supporting their usage. In summary, these findings support an approach to low-risk STEMI triage that does not come at the expense of quality patient care or outcomes, where up to two-thirds of patients with STEMI may be able to be safely managed without ICU-level care.","Lopez, John J; Ebinger, Joseph E; Allen, Sorcha; Yildiz, Mehmet; Henry, Timothy D",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,42,19

METHODS: Students (aged 11-14; grades 7-8) who received a 3-month teacher-delivered intervention embedded in the language arts curriculum (N=200) were compared to a wait-list control group (N=230) in the largest urban school board in Canada. Suicidality defined as a composite measure of self-reported suicidal ideation and attempts [primary outcome], self-reported emotion dysregulation, interpersonal chaos, confusion about self, and impulsivity [Life Problems Inventory (LPI)] and self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms [Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS)] were the outcomes of interest. Measurements occurred prior to and after curriculum delivery with independent t-tests used to compare mean change scores between groups clustered by class. RESULTS: Thirty-seven English teachers in 46 classes across 15 schools comprised the planned study cohort. Composite suicidality scores were significantly worse in the control than intervention group at endpoint (0.05±0.54 vs. 0.17±0.47, t= -2.60, df=428, p=0.01). There were also significant improvements in LPI and RCADS scores in the intervention group compared to controls (LPI:-3.74±7.98 vs. 1.16±10.77 t=5.28, df=428, p<.001; RCADS: (-3.08±5.49 vs. -1.51±6.53 t=2.96, df=429, p=0.01). Sub-analyses revealed that these improvements were largely driven by a significant difference in scores in girls. LIMITATIONS: Sample size constraints as study terminated prematurely during COVID pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates significant improvement in suicidality, emotional regulation, self-concept, interpersonal difficulties, depression and anxiety in youth, particularly girls following this intervention. Replication studies in larger samples are needed to confirm these results.","Klim-Conforti, Paula; Zaheer, Rabia; Levitt, Anthony J; Cheung, Amy H; Schachar, Russell; Schaffer, Ayal; Goldstein, Benjamin I; Fefergrad, Mark; Niederkrotenthaler, Thomas; Sinyor, Mark",J Affect Disord,42,16

The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","Williams, Terrie M; Davis, Randall W",Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol,42,24

Nowadays, COVID-19 pandemic has been adversely affecting many aspects of human life. We used the Tehran Cardio-Metabolic Genetic Study (TCGS) data that is an ongoing genetic study including the whole-genome sequencing of 1200 individuals and chip genotyping of more than 15,000 participants. Here, the effect of ACE2 variations by focusing on the receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 protease were investigated through simulations study. After analyzing TCGS data, 570 genetic variations on the ACE2 gene, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) were detected. Interestingly, two observed missense variants, K26R and S331F, which only the first one was previously reported, can reduce the receptor affinity for the viral Spike protein. Moreover, our bioinformatics simulation of 3D structures and docking of proteins explains important details of ACE2-Spike and ACE2-TMPRSS2 interactions, especially the critical role of Arg652 of ACE2 for protease function of TMPRSS2 was uncovered. As our results show that the genetic variation of ACE2 can at least influence the affinity of this receptor to its partners, we need to consider the genetic variations on ACE2 as well as other genes in the pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 for designing efficient drugs and vaccines.","Lanjanian, Hossein; Moazzam-Jazi, Maryam; Hedayati, Mehdi; Akbarzadeh, Mahdi; Guity, Kamran; Sedaghati-Khayat, Bahareh; Azizi, Fereidoun; Daneshpour, Maryam S",Sci Rep,42,16

METHOD: A retrospective-archive study was conducted between January-April 2020, compared with the parallel months in 2017-2019, in a comprehensive stroke center. We compared the time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, the number of neurologic consultations completed in the ED, patients diagnosed with AIS, patients receiving acute treatment and hospital mortality. RESULTS: During January-April 2020, we found an increase in the proportion of stroke patients arriving at the ED within 6 h of symptom onset: 68-100% per month during the study period, compared with 28-42% per month in the previous years. The number of patients admitted to the ED with suspected AIS declined by 41%, compared to the parallel period in 2019. An increase was noted in the number of patients diagnosed with AIS who underwent treatment, with the number of s endovascular thrombectomy increasing throughout the examined year. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a significant decline in the number of AIS patients admitted to the ED. Paradoxically, we have seen an increase in the proportion of patients who arrived shortly after the onset of symptoms and received timely treatment. Future studies might investigate the medical mechanism and ramifications of this phenomenon.","Saban, Mor; Reznik, Anna; Shachar, Tal; Wilf-Miron, Rachel; Sivan-Hoffmann, Rotem",J Crit Care,42,16

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were used to contain the source in Xinfadi (XFD) market. To rapidly control the outbreak, both traditional and newly introduced NPIs including large-scale management of high-risk populations and expanded severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-based screening in the general population were conducted in Beijing. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing's XFD market and inform future response efforts of resurgence across regions. METHODS: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was developed and applied to evaluate a range of different scenarios from the public health perspective. Two outcomes were measured: magnitude of transmission (i.e., number of cases in the outbreak) and endpoint of transmission (i.e., date of containment). The outcomes of scenario evaluations were presented relative to the reality case (i.e., 368 cases in 34 days) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). RESULTS: Our results indicated that a 3 to 14 day delay in the identification of XFD as the infection source and initiation of NPIs would have caused a 3 to 28-fold increase in total case number (31-77 day delay in containment). A failure to implement the quarantine scheme employed in the XFD outbreak for defined key population would have caused a fivefold greater number of cases (73 day delay in containment). Similarly, failure to implement the quarantine plan executed in the XFD outbreak for close contacts would have caused twofold greater transmission (44 day delay in containment). Finally, failure to implement expanded nucleic acid screening in the general population would have yielded 1.6-fold greater transmission and a 32 day delay to containment. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs new evidence that in form the selection of NPI to use as countermeasures in response to a COVID-19 outbreak and optimal timing of their implementation. The evidence provided by this study should inform responses to future outbreaks of COVID-19 and future infectious disease outbreak preparedness efforts in China and elsewhere.","Wang, Xiao-Li; Lin, Xin; Yang, Peng; Wu, Zun-You; Li, Gang; McGoogan, Jennifer M; Jiao, Zeng-Tao; He, Xin-Jun; Li, Si-Qi; Shi, Hong-Hao; Wang, Jing-Yuan; Lai, Sheng-Jie; Huang, Chun; Wang, Quan-Yi",Infect Dis Poverty,42,20

Given its universal appeal, sport is often perceived as a valuable soft power asset for conveying positive messages to foreign publics. Against this backdrop, the present study aims to introduce the sports diplomacy approach of Hungary, specifically focusing on the state-led utilization of sport in public diplomacy under the recent government of Viktor Orbán (2010–2020). With the institutionalization of sport in public diplomacy, Hungary has become a pioneering country in Central and Eastern Europe that can provide an example for other nation-states in the region. The Hungarian government’s sports diplomacy ambitions have not been curbed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the country continues to invest large amounts of public funding in attracting and organizing international sporting competitions. Hosting the Summer Olympic Games in Budapest remains the ultimate goal of the current government’s sports diplomacy strategy, which focuses on elite sport.","Garamvölgyi, Bence Dóczi Tamás",Physical Culture and Sport,42,33

We have witnessed the equivalent of two years of digital transformation compressed into just a few months. Whether it is in tracing epidemiological peaks or in transacting contactless payments, the impact of these developments has been almost immediate, and a window has opened up on what is to come. Here we analyze and discuss how AI can support us in facing the ongoing pandemic. Despite the numerous and undeniable contributions of AI, clinical trials and human skills are still required. Even if different strategies have been developed in different states worldwide, the fight against the pandemic seems to have found everywhere a valuable ally in AI, a global and open-source tool capable of providing assistance in this health emergency.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with significantly deranged coagulation parameters and increased incidence of thrombotic events. Deranged coagulation parameters, such as D-dimers and fibrin degradation products, can indicate a poor prognosis, and their measurement will help stratify the patients according to the disease severity, need of intensive care unit admission, and prediction of the clinical course. Gaps in understanding the natural history of the disease cause difficulties in tailoring therapies and optimizing the management of patients. Lack of specific treatment further complicates this situation. While thrombotic events can cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients, a focused approach to the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can, to a great extent, decrease the disease burden caused by thrombotic diseases. Pharmacological prophylactic anticoagulants and mechanical therapies such as pneumatic compression devices can help prevent venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic events. Thrombotic events due to COVID-19, their prevention and management, are the focus of this paper, with the prospect of providing insights into this relatively unexplored area.","Tiwari, Nishant R; Khatib, Khalid I; Dixit, Subhal B; Rathore, Prajay K; Melinkeri, Sameer; Ganapule, Abhijeet; Borawake, Kapil S; Mhatre, Ujwala",J Crit Care Med (Targu Mures),42,16

A small staff contingent of 60 personnel from US Naval Hospital (USNH) Guam was tasked with the medical care of 4,079 sailors who were placed in single room quarantine amongst 11 hotels across the island of Guam. With the assistance of the Defense Digital Service, the USNH Guam staff implemented a web-based symptom checker, which allowed for monitoring of developing COVID symptoms, and selective testing of symptomatic individuals. Materials and MethodsSailors from the TR were placed in quarantine or isolation cohorts upon debarking the ship. Sailors not positive for COVID-19 were quarantined amongst 11 hotels on Guam. Sailors positive for COVID-19 were isolated aboard Naval Base Guam (NBG). A retrospective cohort analysis and subgroup analyses were performed on symptom data obtained from sailors in quarantine. The sailors recorded their symptoms and temperature in a web-based symptom checker that assigned a symptom severity score (SSS). Sailors with a SSS >50 were evaluated by a medical provider and re-tested. Data were collected from 4 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. Sailors required two negative tests to exit quarantine and re-embark the ship. The time course, and most common cluster of symptoms associated with a positive COVID-19 PCR test were determined retrospectively after data collection. ResultsThe web-based symptom checker was successful in establishing daily positive contact and symptom monitoring of susceptible individuals in quarantine. 4,079 sailors in quarantine maintained positive contact with medical staff via the symptom checker, with at least 81% of the sailors recording their symptoms on a daily basis. Individuals with high symptom scores were quickly identified and underwent further evaluation and repeat COVID-19 testing. A cohort of 331 sailors tested positive for COVID-19 while in quarantine and recorded symptoms in the symptom checker before and after a positive COVID-19 test. In this cohort, the most frequent symptoms reported prior to a positive test were headache, anosmia, followed by cough. The symptom of anosmia was reported more frequently in sailors positive for COVID-19, compared to a cohort of matched controls. A small medical staff was able to monitor developing symptoms in a large quarantined population, while efficiently allocating resources, preserving personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintaining isolation and social distancing protocols. Conclusions and RelevanceThe application provided a tool for broad health surveillance over a large population while maintaining strict quarantine and social distancing protocols. Highly symptomatic sailors were quickly identified, triaged, and transferred to a higher level of care if indicated. The symptom checker and predictive model generated from the data can be utilized by military and civilian public health officials to triage large populations and make rapid decisions on isolation measures, resource allocation, selective testing.","Fenequito, Robert L; Houskamp, Daniel; Siu, Vincent; Rorie, Jamal; Bhatt, Nikunj; Kuang, Maya; Luartes, Brett; Shell, Donald; Reeder, John; Rainey, Katie; Olson, Niels",,42,1

Pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines, are produced in the brain by resident cells, mainly by microglia and astrocytes. Brain infiltrating immune cells constitutes another source of these molecules, contributing to an impaired neurological synapse function, affecting typical neurobehavioral and cognitive performance. Currently, there is increasing evidence supporting the notion that behavioral alterations and cognitive impairment can be associated with respiratory viral infections, such as human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and SARS-COV-2, which are responsible for endemic, epidemic, or pandemic outbreak mainly in the winter season. This article will review the brain's pro-inflammatory response due to infection by three highly contagious respiratory viruses that are the leading cause of acute respiratory illness, morbidity, and mobility in infants, immunocompromised and elderly population. How these respiratory viral pathogens induce increased secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules and their relationship with the alterations at a behavioral and cognitive level will be discussed.","Bohmwald, K.; Andrade, C.

Ordered plication of the ileum was performed in four intestinal segments, each of length 2 cm. In the reoperation, a sectioning procedure was performed, removing the plicated intestinal segments with the pre-plication jejunal segment and post-plication ileal segment, as a single piece. Two chemographs were utilized for simultaneous recording of the spontaneous intestinal waves. Analysis was done of frequencies of types I, II and III physiological waves in the proximal jejunal and distal ileal segments of groups A, B and C, separately and together. The statistical study was performed using the non-parametric methods of Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman and Wilcoxon.

The approach is motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in which many Heath National Systems were not able to satisfy the demand of ventilators, sanitary individual protection equipments or different human resources. Our tool is based in two main principles: (1) Part of the stock of equipments at a unit that is not needed (in near future) could be shared to other units; and (2) extra stock to be shared among the units in a region can be efficiently distributed taking into account the demand of the units. The decisions are taken with the aim of minimizing certain measures of the non-covered demand in a region where a given network structured set of units is given. The mathematical programming models that we provide are stochastic and multiperiod and we provide different robust objective functions.

Moreover, hospital admissions are an important contributor to health care costs and overpopulation in various hospitals. The aim of this research is to obtain a deeper insight into the phenomenon of frequent flyer hospital admissions. Our objectives were to understand the patients' perspectives on the cause of their frequent hospital admissions and to identify the perceived consequences of the frequent flyer status. METHODS: This qualitative study took place at the University Hospital of Leuven. The COREQ guidelines were followed to provide rigor to the study. Patients were included when they had at least four overnight admissions in the past 12 months, an age above 65 years and hospital admission at the time of the study. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and encoded in NVivo. RESULTS: Thirteen interviews were collected. A total of 17 perceived causes for frequent hospital admission were identified, which could be divided into the following six themes: patient, drugs, primary care, secondary care, home and family. Most of the causes were preventable or modifiable. The perceived consequences of being a frequent flyer were divided into the following six themes: body, daily life functioning, social participation, mental status and spiritual dimension. Negative experiences were linked to frequent flying and could be situated mainly in the categories of social participation, mental status and spiritual dimensions.

Firstly, a network of local and global teams was created, including an external university occupational physician team for scientific support. In July 2020, global prevention guidelines for the homogenous management of the pandemic were applied, replacing different site or regional procedures. A tool for COVID-19 monitoring was implemented to investigate the relationship between the incidence rates inside and outside the plants. In the period of May–November 2020, 565 confirmed cases (EU 330, NA 141, LATAM 94) were observed among 20,646 workers with different jobs and tasks, and in the last two months 85% EU and 70% NA cases were recorded. Only in 10% of cases was a possible internal origin of the contagion not excluded. In the EU and NA, unlike LATAM, the COVID-19 incidence rates inside the sites punctually followed the rising trend outside. In conclusion, the model, combining a global approach with the local application of the measures, maintains the sustainability in the manufacturing industry.","Lovreglio, Piero Stufano Angela Cagnazzo Francesco Bartolomeo Nicola Iavicoli Ivo",Sustainability,42,6

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable linear regression models evaluated the association between diet quality and cost for all food, food at home (FAH) and food away from home (FAFH). SETTING: Daily food intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2016). Food prices were derived using data from multiple, publicly available databases. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010. PARTICIPANTS: 30 564 individuals &#8805;20 years with complete and reliable dietary data. RESULTS: Mean per capita daily diet cost was $14·19 (95 % CI (13·91, 14·48)), including $6·92 (95 % CI (6·73, 7·10)) for FAH and $7·28 (95 % CI (7·05, 7·50)) for FAFH. Diet quality was higher for FAH compared to FAFH (P < 0·001). Higher diet quality was associated with higher food costs overall, FAH and FAFH (P < 0·001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that higher diet quality is associated with higher costs for all food, FAH and FAFH. This research provides policymakers, public health professionals and clinicians with information needed to support healthy eating habits. These findings are particularly relevant to contemporary health and economic concerns that have worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Conrad, Zach; Reinhardt, Sarah; Boehm, Rebecca; McDowell, Acree",Public Health Nutr,42,1

The immuno-pathology of this disease is neither clearly understood nor there are effective drugs for severe cases of COVID-19. Repurposing of available drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 is imperative.Areas Covered: This review has gathered the evidence from PubMed, Google Scholar, WHO, and other reliable websites on COVID-19 and summarized the existing knowledge of the immuno-pathology of COVID-19. We elucidated how vitamin D through its diverse actions on immune effector cells, epithelial cells, or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system could have a modulatory role on the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19. The epidemiological evidence associating vitamin D deficiency with the severity and incidence of COVID-19 is also presented. However, the evidence of clinical benefit to patients of COVID-19 from randomized controlled trials with vitamin D has not come as yet.Expert opinion: It is now established that fatality of COVID-19 is primarily determined by hyperactivation of the host's innate immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion, and thus the research on the immuno-modulatory and other roles of vitamin D against viral infections should be pursued vigorously. This would be also useful for future pandemics caused by other novel viruses.","Banerjee, Anindita; Ganguly, Upasana; Saha, Sarama; Chakrabarti, Suddhachitta; Saini, Reena V; Rawal, Ravindra K; Saso, Luciano; Chakrabarti, Sasanka",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,42,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The atypical imaging data of ten patients in our hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively, and the distribution, morphology, and image evolution of the lesions were analyzed. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in all cases, and the imaging features were analyzed and summarized by two senior radiologists. RESULTS: Of these ten patients, three were male, and seven were female. The age of these patients ranged from 21-53 years, with an average age of 36.3 ± 3.6. The first symptom was fever in nine cases and dry cough in one case. A total of 17 lesions were detected in these ten patients. Five patients had a single lesion, and five patients had multiple lesions, for a total of 12 lesions. Ten lesions (58.82%) were located in the inferior lobe of the right lung, four lesions (23.53%) in the left inferior lobe, two lesions (11.76%) in the left upper lobe, and one lesion (5.88%) in the right middle lobe. Among the five single lesions, two were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and one was a pure ground-glass lesion. Among the 12 multiple lesions, eight were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and two were pure ground-glass lesions. Atypical manifestations in image signs: five lesions (29.41%) had single solid and sub-solid nodules, and four lesions (23.53%) had cavitary nodules. Typical manifestation (the presence of ""white lung""): three lesions (17.65%) had an air bronchogram, two lesions (11.76%) had crazy-paving signs, two lesions (11.76%) had vascular thickening, and one lesion (5.88%) had halo signs.

Prior studies, with limited numbers, have included men in various stages of infection with most in the recovery phase of the illness. The timing of test results and severity of illness has made recruiting study participants a significant challenge. Our pilot study will examine semen from men with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as those in the convalescent phase to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected and its relationship, if any, with the severity of the disease. METHODS: Eighteen men with a median age of 32 (range, 24-57) who tested positive for COVID-19 by rt-PCR analysis were enrolled and provided a semen sample. The study group demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic to moderate and none required hospitalization. Samples were subjected to viral RNA extraction and then processed by real-time RT-PCR using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) panel of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) primers and probes to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Length of time from diagnosis to providing a specimen ranged from 1 to 28 days (median, 6 days).

Clinically, three stages have been identified based on viral infection, pulmonary involvement with inflammation, and fibrosis. Moreover, low and high elastance phenotypes can be distinguished in mechanically ventilated patients, based on lung mechanics, ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, and CT scans; these two phenotypes have presumed differences in their underlying pathophysiology. Although essential for therapeutic guidance, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is poorly understood. Here, we systematically reviewed published case reports and case series in order to increase our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology by constructing a timeline and correlating histopathological findings with clinical stages of COVID-19. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, 42 articles reporting 198 individual cases were included in our analysis. In lung samples (n = 131 cases), we identified three main histological patterns: epithelial (n = 110, 85%), with reactive epithelial changes and DAD; vascular (n = 76, 59%) with microvascular damage, (micro)thrombi, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia; and fibrotic (n = 28, 22%) with interstitial fibrosis. The epithelial and vascular patterns can present in all stages of symptomatic COVID-19, whereas the fibrotic pattern presents starting at ~3 weeks. Moreover, patients can present with more than one pattern, either simultaneously or consecutively. These findings are consistent with knowledge regarding clinical patterns of viral infection, development of hyperinflammation and hypercoagulability, and fibrosis. Close collaboration among medical staff is necessary in order to translate this knowledge and classification of pathophysiological mechanisms into clinical stages of disease in individual patients. Moreover, further research, including histopathological studies, is warranted in order to develop reliable, clinically relevant biomarkers by correlating these pathological findings with laboratory results and radiological findings, thus, increasing our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitating the move to precision medicine for treating patients.","Polak, Samuel B; Van Gool, Inge C; Cohen, Danielle; von der Thüsen, Jan H; van Paassen, Judith",Mod Pathol,42,26

However, the functional role and the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation during insect organ or tissue development are far from being clear. RESULTS: Here, we found that DNA methylation inhibitor (5-aza-dC) treatment in newly molted pupae decreased the chitin content of pupal wing discs and adult wings and resulted in wing deformity of Bombyx mori. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the up-regulation of chitinase 10 (BmCHT10) gene might be related to the decrease of chitin content induced by 5-aza-dC treatment. Further, the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that DNA methylation suppressed the promoter activity of BmCHT10 by down-regulating the transcription factor, homeobox protein araucan (Bmara). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNA pull-down and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bmara directly bound to the BmCHT10 promoter. Therefore, DNA methylation is involved in keeping the structural integrity of the silkworm wings from unwanted chitin degradation, as a consequence, it promotes the wing development of B. mori. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that DNA methylation plays an important role in the wing development of B. mori. Our results support that the indirect transcriptional repression of a chitin degradation-related gene BmCHT10 by DNA methylation is necessary to keep the proper wing development in B. mori.","Xu, Guanfeng; Yi, Yangqin; Lyu, Hao; Gong, Chengcheng; Feng, Qili; Song, Qisheng; Peng, Xuezhen; Liu, Lin; Zheng, Sichun",Epigenetics Chromatin,42,24

Methods: We utilized the data from four main official databases, including WHO reports, the Statistics and Research of the Coronavirus Disease, and the Southeast Asia Program of the Center for Strategic and International Study. The spread of the COVID- 19 pandemic, current burden and the COVID-19 medical response capacities were extracted before April 11, 2020. Results: As of April 13, 2020, the ASEAN countries reported 19 547 COVID-19 positive cases with 817 deaths (case-facility rate of 4.2%). Thailand was the first country in the region that reported having the COVID-19 cases, while Laos was the last to report confirmed COVID-19 cases. Durations for the number of deaths to double were between 8-12 days. For the testing and treatment capacities, the number of PCR tests provided to the populations was the highest in Vietnam, followed by Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. Meanwhile, the percentage of the population being tested was the highest in Brunei (2.31%), followed by Singapore (1.30%). Conclusions: A wide range of interventions were taken into practice in response to the outbreak with an effort of curbing the rise of this pandemic. However, special care should not be overlooked as the pandemic is placing a huge impact on the population and becomes increasingly unpredictable. To tackle the spread of the pandemic in the region, the ASEAN countries should work together as one community to provide better responses to future pandemics and other transboundary public health challenges.","Hoang, Minh; Nguyen, Phuong; Tran, Thao; Khuong, Long; Dao, An; Nguyen, Huy; Djalante, Riyanti; Tran, Hanh",Asian Pac.

Additionally, such location annotated datasets can provide a pathway for deep learning models to be used for downstream tasks. However, acquiring quality annotations is expensive on human resources and usually requires domain expertise. On the other hand, medical reports contain a plethora of information both about pneumonia characteristics and its location. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised attention-driven deep learning model that leverages encoded information in medical reports during training to facilitate better localization. Our model also performs classification of attributes that are associated to pneumonia and extracted from medical reports for supervision. Both the classification and localization are trained in conjunction and once trained, the model can be utilized for both the localization and characterization of pneumonia using only the input image. In this paper, we explore and analyze the model using chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the introduction of textual information improves pneumonia localization. We showcase quantitative results on two datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Chest X-ray-8, and we also showcase severity characterization on the COVID-19 dataset.","Bhalodia, Riddhish; Hatamizadeh, Ali; Tam, Leo; Xu, Ziyue; Wang, Xiaosong; Turkbey, Evrim; Xu, Daguang",,42,24

The detailed topology of cryptocurrency network on the Binance platform from bitcoin perspective is also considered. Finally, an interesting observation on the Covid-19 pandemic impact on the cryptocurrency market is presented and discussed: recently we have witnessed a""phase transition""of the cryptocurrencies from being a hedge opportunity for the investors fleeing the traditional markets to become a part of the global market that is substantially coupled to the traditional financial instruments like the currencies, stocks, and commodities. The main contribution is an extensive demonstration that structural self-organization in the cryptocurrency markets has caused the same to attain complexity characteristics that are nearly indistinguishable from the Forex market at the level of individual time-series. However, the cross-correlations between the exchange rates on cryptocurrency platforms differ from it. The cryptocurrency market is less synchronized and the information flows more slowly, which results in more frequent arbitrage opportunities.

We reviewed the literature for cases of documented reinfection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive computerized search in PubMed, through 15 December 2020, using the following terms in combination: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, reinfection, reactivation, recurrence. To exclude cases due to prolonged viral shedding or protracted infection, only cases occurring at least 12 weeks apart or confirmed as being sustained by genetically different viruses by viral genome analysis were included. RESULTS: We identified 23 cases globally, for which viral genome analysis was performed in 10 cases and serology in 19 cases. The mean interval between the two episodes was 15 weeks. Mean age of cases was 44.5 years, and 10 (43.5%) were women. In 17/23 cases, no comorbidity was observed. In 10 cases, the first episode was more severe than the ensuing episode, whereas in seven cases the ensuing episode was more severe. In four cases, there was no difference in severity and in two cases both episodes were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: From this sample of 23 cases, a clear pattern of the second episode being less or more severe did not emerge. A better understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, necessary to assess the probability of a second infection and the durability of protection conferred by vaccination, is warranted.","Roberts, Anna Teresa; Piani, Fiorella; Longo, Benedetta; Andreini, Roberto; Meini, Simone",Infect Dis (Lond),42,18

Importantly, the human, economic and political tolls of these crises are being amplified by health systems' inabilities to respond quickly and effectively. Improving resilience within health systems can build on pre-existing strengths to enhance the readiness of health system actors to respond to crises, while also maintaining core functions. Using data gathered from a scoping literature review, interviews with key informants and from stakeholders who attended a workshop held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we developed a Health System Resilience Checklist ('the checklist'). The aim of the checklist is to measure the specific capacities, capabilities and processes that health systems need in order to ensure resilience in the face of both infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards. The checklist is intended to be adapted and used in a broad set of countries as a component of ongoing processes to ensure that health actors, institutions and populations can mount an effective response to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards while also maintaining core healthcare services. The checklist is an important first step in improving health system resilience to these threats, but additional research and resources will be necessary to further refine and prioritise the checklist items and to pilot the checklist with the frontline health facilities that would be using it. This will help ensure its feasibility and durability for the long-term within the health systems strengthening and health security fields.","Meyer, Diane; Bishai, David; Ravi, Sanjana J; Rashid, Harunor; Mahmood, Shehrin Shaila; Toner, Eric; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",,42,20

To investigate the discrepancy in state-wise CFRs, datasets on various factors related to demography, socio-economy, public health, and healthcare capacity have been collected to study their association with CFR. METHODS: State-wise COVID-19 data was collected till April 22, 2021. The latest data on the various factors have been collected from reliable sources. Pearson correlation, two-tailed P test, Spearman rank correlation, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures have been used to assess the association between various factors and CFR. RESULTS: Life expectancies, prevalence of overweight, COVID-19 test positive rates, and H1N1 fatality rates show a significant positive association with CFR. Human Development Index, per capita GDP, public affairs index, health expenditure per capita, availability of govt. doctors & hospital beds, prevalence of certain diseases, and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension show insignificant association with CFR. Sex ratio, health expenditure as a percent of GSDP, and availability of govt. hospitals show a significant negative correlation with CFR. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that older people, males of younger age groups, and overweight people are at more fatality risk from COVID-19. Certain diseases and common comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension do not seem to have any significant effect on CFR. States with better COVID-19 testing rates, health expenditure, and healthcare capacity seem to perform better with regard to COVID-19 fatality rates.","Upadhyay, Ashwini Kumar; Shukla, Shreyanshi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,42,20

An initial assessment of the potential effects of COVID-19 emission reductions was made using a set of six scenarios that variously assumed annual European and global emission reductions of 30% and 50% for the energy, industry, road transport and international shipping sectors, and 80% for the aviation sector. The greatest ozone reductions during the growing season reached up to 12 ppb over crop growing regions in Asia and up to 6 ppb in North America and Europe for the 50% global reduction scenario. In Europe, ozone responses are more sensitive to emission declines in other continents, international shipping and aviation than to emissions changes within Europe. We demonstrate that for wheat the overall magnitude of ozone precursor emission changes could lead to yield improvements between 2% and 8%. The expected magnitude of ozone precursor emission reductions during the Northern Hemisphere growing season in 2020 presents an opportunity to test and improve crop models and experimentally based exposure response relationships of ozone impacts on crops, under real-world conditions.

We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being. METHODS: In this observational study in Leicestershire, UK, patients with COPD under a secondary care clinic were recruited. Exacerbation frequency in the first 6 weeks of COVID lockdown was compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, and behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal. RESULTS: 160 participants were recruited (mean [sd] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted). 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 versus 99, p=0.026). The increase was a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% versus 33.8%). During “lockdown” participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001). DISCUSSION: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first 6 weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change.","McAuley, Hamish; Hadley, Kate; Elneima, Omer; Brightling, Christopher E; Evans, Rachael A; Steiner, Michael C; Greening, Neil J",ERJ Open Res,42,16

We conducted two studies to examine emotional self-efficacy and distinct emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators in the relationship between cybervictimization and lower well-being among German adolescents during the school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. In Study 1, 107 adolescents (M(age) = 15.76) reported their cybervictimization frequency, emotional self-efficacy beliefs, and aspects of well-being (i.e., self-esteem, perceived social support, and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 related school closures). Emotional self-efficacy mediated the link between cybervictimization and all well-being measures. Specifically, cybervictimization was related to lower well-being through lower self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. For further examination, in Study 2, 205 adolescents (M(age) = 15.45) were asked to report their cybervictimization experiences, use of specific emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, and suppression), and well-being (i.e., self-esteem and life satisfaction). Cybervictimization was related to lower well-being through more rumination, but not through reappraisal or suppression. Taken together, our findings suggest that cybervictims may have lower emotional self-efficacy beliefs and engage in more rumination, a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. These deficits in adolescents’ beliefs and capabilities for effectively managing negative emotions may be accountable for the adverse psychological consequences of cybervictimization. Notably, exploratory analyses suggest that cybervictimization frequency did not increase among adolescents during the lockdown (e.g., homeschooling, social distancing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schunk, Fabian; Zeh, Franziska; Trommsdorff, Gisela",Comput Human Behav,42,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 249 patients who underwent curative transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for primary or recurrent NMIBC were asked to complete the Korean version of EORTC QLQ-C30 and -NMIBC24 questionnaires three times (preoperative, post-TURBT 3 months and 6 months). Linguistic validation and psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire was conducted. RESULTS: Multitrait scaling analysis confirmed satisfactory construct validity in five scales except the malaise scale. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ 0.70) for the five scales except the malaise scale at the all three time points. Known-group comparison analyses showed better quality-of-life (QOL) scores in patients with higher performance status as expected, and better sexual function in men than women (p < 0.05). Most of the scales had low correlations (< 0.40) with the scales in QLQ-C30 showing divergent validity, except for malaise scale which showed higher correlations (0.42 to 0.60). Responsiveness to change was consistent with clinical implications over time after TURBT.

The aim of this study was to study the impact of vaccination on reducing the average length of stay (ALOS), intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, mortality and cost of the treatment among COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study all the patients above 45 years who underwent treatment for COVID-19 were included. The data of patients treated pan India during the period March & April 2021 with the diagnosis of COVID-19, under health insurance cover, were extracted to study parameters like the ALOS, mortality, ICU requirement, total hospital expenses incurred and the vaccination status. Results: Among 3820 patients with COVID-19, 3301 (86.4%) were unvaccinated while 519 (13.6%) were vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated the mean (s.d) ALOS was 7 days. Fourteen days after second dose of vaccination this was significantly less (p=0.01) at 4.9. The mean total hospital expense among the unvaccinated was Rs. 277850. Fourteen days after second dose of vaccination this was further less (p=0.001) at Rs. 217850. Among the unvaccinated population 291/3301 (8.8%) required ICU and this was significantly less (p=0.03) at 31/519 (6%) among the vaccinated. Among those who received two doses of vaccination it was further less at 1/33 (3%). The mortality among unvaccinated patients was 16/3301 (0.5%) while there was no mortality among the vaccinated. Among those who received two doses of vaccination there was a 66% relative risk reduction in ICU stay and 81% relative risk reduction in mortality. Conclusions: There was a significant reduction in ALOS, ICU requirement, mortality & treatment cost in patients who had completed two doses of vaccination. These findings may be used in motivating public and promoting vaccination drive.","Ramakrishnan, M.; Subbarayan, P.",,42,20

METHODOLOGY: We analyzed patients aged from 1 month to 17 years admitted between March 2018 and April 2020 who were hospitalized for ALRTI. For all patients, history, clinical parameters, microbiological data, and lung ultrasound data were collected. Patients were stratified into three main groups (“bacterial”, “viral”, “atypical”) according to the presumed microbial etiology and LUS findings evaluated according to the etiological group. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from all patients. A qualitative diagnostic test developed by Nurex S.r.l. was used for identification of bacterial and fungal DNA in respiratory samples. The Seegene Allplex™ Respiratory assays were used for the molecular diagnosis of viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, bacterial culture of blood and respiratory samples were performed, when indicated. RESULTS: A total of 186 children with suspected ALRTI (44% female) with an average age of 6 were enrolled in the study. We found that some ultrasound findings as size, number and distribution of consolidations, the position and motion of air bronchograms, pleural effusions and distribution of vertical artifacts significantly differ (p < 0.05) in children with bacterial, viral and atypical ALRTI. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a detailed analysis of LUS features able to predict the ALRTI ethology in children. These findings may help the physicians to better manage a child with ALRTI and to offer personalized approach, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up.","Buonsenso, Danilo; Musolino, Annamaria; Ferro, Valentina; De Rose, Cristina; Morello, Rosa; Ventola, Chiara; Liotti, Flora Marzia; De Sanctis, Rita; Chiaretti, Antonio; Biasucci, Daniele Guerino; Spanu, Teresa; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Valentini, Piero",J Ultrasound,42,20

Consequently, Columbia University, with its large portfolio of human subjects research, had to address the challenges of protecting thousands of research participants and research staff from potential exposure to COVID-19 while facilitating essential biomedical research, especially pandemic-related studies. The authors describe, from the perspective of Columbia's research administration leadership, how the university and its primary teaching hospital ramped down-and later ramped up-human subjects research, and reflect on the lessons learned. As the pandemic unfolded, only studies that could offer the prospect of direct benefit to subjects were permitted to continue with in-person contact. New in-person participant enrollment ceased, except for COVID-19 prevention or treatment studies. Centralized, frequently updated communication about policies and procedures was disseminated to the Columbia research community. Procedural efficiencies were rapidly developed and implemented for review and oversight of human subjects research and contractual agreements for clinical trials. More frequent institutional review board meetings and 24-hour support led to markedly reduced turnaround time for COVID-19 studies, without delaying approvals of non-COVID-19 research. Research administration worked closely with relevant principal federal agencies, whose regulatory flexibility facilitated the efficient implementation of COVID-19-related research. Overall, the ramp-down and ramp-up of the majority of human subjects research, with specified priorities and accelerated processes, worked well. Adjustments were made to handle the increase in administrative tasks, the need to respond rapidly to added oversight responsibilities, and the management of the many new COVID-19 related research protocols. Timely, centralized communication, support for staff needs, prioritization, and collaboration were critical to successful research oversight at a large-scale academic setting in the midst of a pandemic. These perspectives may be useful to academic research centers addressing the current and future pandemics.","Stiles, Deborah F; Ruotolo, Brenda L; Kim, Helen; Cho, Jane; Appelbaum, Paul S; Green, Nancy S",Acad. med,42,25

Fluoroquinolones are broad spectrum synthetic antimicrobial agents, being chemical derivatives of quinoline, the prodrome of chloroquine. Interestingly, fluoroquinolones may exert antiviral actions against vaccinia virus, papovavirus, CMV, VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCV and HIV. A recent in silico study has shown that the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by exhibiting stronger capacity for binding to its main protease than chloroquine and nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor antiretroviral drug. Remarkably, fluoroquinolones have shown multiple immunomodulatory actions leading to an attenuation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Noteworthy, respiratory fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, constitute fist line therapeutic agents for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia. They are characterized by advantageous pharmacokinetic properties; higher concentrations in the lungs; and an excellent safety profile comparable to other antibiotics used to treat respiratory infections, such as macrolides and b-lactams. Based on their potential antiviral activity and immunomodulatory properties, the favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile, we propose the use of respiratory fluoroquinolones as adjuncts in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia.","Karampela, Irene; Dalamaga, Maria",Arch Med Res,42,18

The aim of our study was to examine the effect of dietary habits on weight and physical activity (PA) during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was distributed using social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and email communication. A total of 472 adults (age range, 18–59 years), over half of the study population (68.0%) being females, 55.5% being between 19 and 29 years old, 15.0%—between 30 and 39 years old, and 11.2%—older than 50 years old, participated in the study. Our results indicated that the overall body weight was slightly increased among the 50+ age group (47.2%, p > 0.05), but it highly increased among the 30–39-years-old age group (32.4%, p > 0.05) as compared to before the pandemic lockdown period. Therefore, our results show that a significant difference (p < 0.05) was found for all the assessments: weight status, physical activity patterns, hours spent on screen time, homemade meals, and changes in dietary habits before and during the full COVID-19 curfew period. This study demonstrated that changes in eating habits were commonly reported among the participants who represented the full COVID-19 curfew period and that changes in eating habits and decreased physical activity led to weight gain.","Abdulsalam, Nisreen M.; Khateeb, Najla A.; Aljerbi, Sarah S.; Alqumayzi, Waad M.; Balubaid, Shaima S.; Almarghlani, Atheer A.; Ayad, Amira A.; Williams, Leonard L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,42,21

Reducing the amount of aerosols to a minimum is mandatory, especially during the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19. The study aimed to evaluate the amount of aerosol generated during standard dental procedures such as caries removal (using dental bur on a high and low-speed handpiece and Er:YAG laser), ultrasonic scaling, and tooth polishing (using silicon rubber on low-speed handpiece) combined with various suction systems. The airborne aerosols containing particles in a range of 0.3–10.0 μm were measured using the PC200 laser particle counter (Trotec GmbH, Schwerin, Germany) at three following sites, manikin, operator, and assistant mouth, respectively. The following suction systems were used to remove aerosols: saliva ejector, high volume evacuator, saliva ejector with extraoral vacuum, high volume evacuator with extraoral vacuum, Zirc(®) evacuator (Mr.Thirsty One-Step®), and two customized high volume evacuators (white and black). The study results showed that caries removal with a high-speed handpiece and saliva ejector generates the highest amount of spray particles at each measured site. The aerosol measurement at the manikin mouth showed the highest particle amount during caries removal with the low and high-speed handpiece. The results for the new high volume evacuator (black) and the Zirc(®) evacuator showed the lowest increase in aerosol level during caries removal with a high-speed handpiece. The Er:YAG laser used for caries removal produced the lowest aerosol amount at the manikin mouth level compared to conventional dental handpieces. Furthermore, ultrasonic scaling caused a minimal aerosol rise in terms of the caries removal with bur. The Er:YAG laser and the new wider high volume evacuators improved significantly suction efficiency during dental treatment. The use of new suction systems and the Er:YAG laser allows for the improvement of biological safety in the dental office, which is especially crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Matys, Jacek; Grzech-Leśniak, Kinga",Materials (Basel),42,26
597946,597946,597946,COVID-19: From bench to bed side,21.050077,8.766303,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND: Endemic to the hospital environment, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading bacterial pathogen that causes deadly infections such as bacteremia and endocarditis. In past viral pandemics, it has been the principal cause of secondary bacterial infections, significantly increasing patient mortality rates. Our world now combats the rapid spread of COVID-19, leading to a pandemic with a death toll greatly surpassing those of many past pandemics. However, the impact of co-infection with S. aureus remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to perform a high-quality scoping review of the literature to synthesize the existing evidence on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and S. aureus co-infection. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, medRxiv, and the WHO COVID-19 database using a combination of terms. Articles that were in English, included patients infected with both COVID-19 and S. aureus, and provided a description of clinical outcomes for patients were eligible. From these articles, the following data were extracted: type of staphylococcal species, onset of co-infection, patient sex, age, symptoms, hospital interventions, and clinical outcomes. Quality assessments of final studies were also conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Searches generated a total of 1922 publications, and 28 articles were eligible for the final analysis. Of the 115 co-infected patients, there were a total of 71 deaths (61.7%) and 41 discharges (35.7%), with 62 patients (53.9%) requiring ICU admission. Patients were infected with methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, with the majority (76.5%) acquiring co-infection with S. aureus following hospital admission for COVID-19. Aside from antibiotics, the most commonly reported hospital interventions were intubation with mechanical ventilation (74.8 %), central venous catheter (19.1 %), and corticosteroids (13.0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Given the mortality rates reported thus far for patients co-infected with S. aureus and COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccination and outpatient treatment may be key initiatives for reducing hospital admission and S. aureus co-infection risk. Physician vigilance is recommended during COVID-19 interventions that may increase the risk of bacterial co-infection with pathogens, such as S. aureus, as the medical community’s understanding of these infection processes continues to evolve.

Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory milieu and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications. COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased utilization of healthcare services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection. Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and cardiovascular implications of COVID-19, its impact on existing pathways of care, the role of modern technologies to tackle the pandemic, and a proposal of novel management algorithms for the most common acute cardiac conditions.","Boukhris, Marouane; Hillani, Ali; Moroni, Francesco; Annabi, Mohamed Salah; Addad, Faouzi; Ribeiro, Marcelo Harada; Mansour, Samer; Zhao, Xiaohui; Ybarra, Luiz Fernando; Abbate, Antonio; Vilca, Luz Maria; Azzalini, Lorenzo",Can J Cardiol,42,20

Lung transplantation is the last line of treatment for chronic end-stage lung diseases. There were several cases of lung transplantation reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, anesthetic management of lung transplantation in this subpopulation is rare. We report the anesthetic and perioperative management of lung transplantation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old man with a 7-day history of fever was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. His throat swab was positive for COVID-19, but negative for other common viruses. Chest radiography showed multiple inflammatory foci in both lungs. By day 5, he presented respiratory distress. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed progressive deterioration of both lungs. Starting on day 7, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage samples were continuously negative. However, his lung condition deteriorated. By day 17, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. After 10 days of ECMO support, the patient's lung condition did not improve. CT scan revealed bilateral parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis and hydrothorax. DIAGNOSIS: Irreversible lung function loss induced by COVID-19 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Bilateral transplantation was performed because the patient's lung condition did not improve and CT scan revealed parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis after 10 days of ECMO support. Thirty-six hours after the surgery, ECMO was discontinued. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation were performed because of acute coronary syndrome and myocardial ischemia 4 days postoperatively. OUTCOMES: The patient remained hospitalized because of requirements for intermittent assisted ventilation via tracheostomy. LESSONS: This case further supports the consideration that lung transplantation can potentially be the successful therapy for these patients who have developed irreversible lung function lose due to COVID-19 pneumonia. However, most critical patients with COVID-19 are older individuals with various comorbidities, which present new anesthetic challenges.","Guo, Shao-Hui; Li, Ang; Yin, Peng-Fei; Zhu, Sheng-Mei; Yao, Yong-Xing",Medicine (Baltimore),42,18

PURPOSE: To investigate CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the accuracy of CT with RT-PCR. METHODS: In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: chest CT with contrast medium performed for vascular indications, patients who refused chest CT or hospitalization, and severe CT motion artifact. All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT. Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as reference. Chest CT features were calculated in a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients. CT features of hospitalized patients and patient in home isolation were compared by using Pearson chi squared test. RESULTS: Our study population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57 y ±17).

However, use of these mAbs in combination with a vaccine program has not been considered in public health strategic planning. Methods We developed an agent-based model to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the US population during an aggressive phase of the pandemic (October 2020 to April 2021), and simulated the effects on infections and mortality of combining mAbs as treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a vaccine program plus non-pharmaceutical interventions. We also interrogated the impact of rapid diagnostic testing, increased mAb supply, and vaccine rollout. Findings Allocation of mAbs as PEP or targeting those [≥]65 years provided the greatest incremental benefits relative to vaccine in averting infections and deaths, by up to 17% and 41%, respectively. Rapid testing, facilitating earlier diagnosis and mAb use, amplified these benefits. The model was sensitive to mAb supply; doubling supply further reduced infections and mortality, by up to two-fold, relative to vaccine. mAbs continued to provide incremental benefits even as proportion of the vaccinated population increased. Interpretation Use of anti-viral mAbs as treatment and PEP in combination with a vaccination program would substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pandemic burden. These results may help guide resource allocation and patient management decisions for COVID-19 and can also be used to inform public health policy for current and future pandemic preparedness.","Kamal, M.

An analysis of continuous glucose monitoring metrics,20.984354,8.474345,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone or combined with azithromycin (AZM) was authorized as a treatment for COVID-19 in many countries. The therapy proved ineffective with long QT and deadly cardiac arrhythmia risks, illustrating challenges to determine the new safety profile of repurposed drugs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate proarrhythmic effects and mechanism of HCQ and AZM (combined and alone) with high doses of HCQ as in the COVID-19 clinical trials. METHODS: Proarrhythmic effects of HCQ and AZM are quantified using optical mapping with voltage-sensitive dyes in ex vivo Langendorff-perfused guinea pig (GP) hearts and with numerical simulations of a GP Luo-Rudy and a human O’Hara-Virag-Varro-Rudy models, for Epi, Endo, and M cells, in cell and tissue, incorporating the drug’s effect on cell membrane ionic currents. RESULTS: Experimentally, HCQ alone and combined with AZM leads to long QT intervals by prolonging the action potential duration and increased spatial dispersion of action potential (AP) repolarization across the heart, leading to proarrhythmic discordant alternans. AZM alone had a lesser arrhythmic effect with less triangulation of the AP shape. Mathematical cardiac models fail to reproduce most of the arrhythmic effects observed experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: During public health crises, the risks and benefits of new and repurposed drugs could be better assessed with alternative experimental and computational approaches to identify proarrhythmic mechanisms. Optical mapping is an effective framework suitable to investigate the drug’s adverse effects on cardiac cell membrane ionic channels at the cellular level and arrhythmia mechanisms at the tissue and whole-organ level.","Uzelac, Ilija; Kaboudian, Abouzar; Iravanian, Shahriar; Siles-Paredes, Jimena G.; Gumbart, James C.; Ashikaga, Hiroshi; Bhatia, Neal; Gilmour, Robert F.; Cherry, Elizabeth M.; Fenton, Flavio H.",Heart Rhythm O2,42,27

However, there is no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that the excessive prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) accumulation mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was the key pathological basis of COVID-19. Methods: The urine PGE2 levels were measured by mass spectrometry. An experimental study about Celebrex to treat COVID-19 was conducted based on routine treatment. A total of 44 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled (Experimental group n=37, Control group n=7). Patients in experimental group were given Celebrex once or twice a day (0.2 g/time) for 7-14 days. The dosage or duration was modified for individuals. Clinical outcomes of Celebrex adjuvant therapy were evaluated by vital signs, laboratory tests, and computed tomography upon the discontinuance of Celebrex. Results: We found that the concentrations of PGE2 in urine samples of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (mean value is 170 ng/ml vs 18.8 ng/ml, p<0.01) and positively correlated with the progression of COVID-19. Among the experimental group (ordinary n=29, severe n=7, critical n=1), 25 cases were treated with full dose and 11 cases with half dose of Celebrex, and 1 case with Ibuprofen. The remission rate were 100%, 82% and 57% in full dose, half dose and control group respectively. Celebrex significantly reduced the PGE2 levels and promoted recovery of ordinary or severe COVID-19.

The magnitude and risk factors associated with these are unknown. Objectives: We investigated the prevalence and risk factors associated with PCF and other complications in patients discharged after COVID-19 infection. Methods: Patients had phone assessment 6 weeks post hospital discharge after COVID-19 infection using a set protocol. Those with significant respiratory symptoms were investigated with a CTPA, Pulmonary Function Tests and echocardiogram. Prevalence of myalgia, fatigue, psychological symptoms and PCF was obtained. Risk factors associated with these were investigated. Results: A large number of patients had persistent (45.1%) fatigue, breathlessness (36.5%), myalgia (20.5%) and psychological symptoms (19.5%). PCF was seen in 9.5% of the patients and was associated with persistent breathlessness at 6 weeks and inpatient ventilation [adjusted OR 5.02(1.76-14.27) and 4.45(1.27-15.58)] respectively.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, have numerous purported benefits although the safety and efficacy of their use in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 has yet to be evaluated. Materials and Methods Single-center, retrospective cohort study of 21 ICU patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease treated with apixaban for atrial fibrillation (AFib), venous thromboembolism (VTE), catheter-induced thrombosis, and/or COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. The primary objective was to evaluate the incidence of bleeding events and secondary objectives included thromboembolic events, coagulation parameters, and mortality. Results Ninety percent of patients were non-White, 43% were obese, 90% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 76% required mechanical ventilation. Nearly half of (47.6%) also experienced renal dysfunction and required renal replacement therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received prophylaxis or treatment with UFH or LMWH within the 24-hour period prior to apixaban initiation. Patients were initiated on apixaban for the treatment of suspected or confirmed VTE (67%) or AFib (33%). All coagulation parameters remained abnormal but stable throughout the 10-day monitoring period. No patients experienced any major bleeding events or thrombosis throughout the study period.

Health Education England's Knowledge for Healthcare: A Development Framework for Library and Knowledge Services in England 2015–2020 advocates embedding librarians within clinical and management teams in order to provide access to high-quality evidence at the point of need. CASE PRESENTATION: In April 2019, Royal Papworth Hospital relocated twelve miles from its historic village location in Papworth Everard to its new state-of-the-art hospital on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. The design for this new hospital did not accommodate a traditional library space and therefore necessitated a transformation of the LKS. The organization opted to embed the LKS staff into the clinical setting and relegate 80% of the print collection to off-site storage. This project and its associated steps are presented as an example of health care library transformation. CONCLUSION: Embedding the LKS team in the clinical setting, engaging in proactive outreach activity, and improving our marketing led to a 44% increase in literature searches requested compared to the same eleven-month period in the previous year. A 40% decrease in our print book loans indicates additional barriers to using a click-and-collect service and the need for greater investment in our e-book provision. However, early outcomes for our best-fit service transformation are positive. Having an open, dual mindset has enabled the service to embrace change and maximize emerging opportunities to collaborate with clinical staff on new projects.","Scott, Rebecca Jean",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,42,8

A longitudinal model-based clustering system on the disease trajectories over time was used to identify “vulnerable” clusters of counties that would benefit from allocating additional resources by federal, state and county policymakers. County-level COVID-19 cases and deaths, together with a set of potential risk factors were collected for 3050 U.S. counties during the 1st wave of COVID-19 (Mar25–Jun3, 2020), followed by similar data for 1344 counties (in the “sunbelt” region of the country) during the 2nd wave (Jun4–Sep2, 2020), and finally for 1055 counties located broadly in the great plains region of the country during the 3rd wave (Sep3–Nov12, 2020). We used growth mixture models to identify clusters of counties exhibiting similar COVID-19 MIR growth trajectories and risk-factors over time. The analysis identifies “more vulnerable” clusters during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19. Further, tuberculosis (OR 1.3–2.1–3.2), drug use disorder (OR 1.1), hepatitis (OR 13.1), HIV/AIDS (OR 2.3), cardiomyopathy and myocarditis (OR 1.3), diabetes (OR 1.2), mesothelioma (OR 9.3) were significantly associated with increased odds of being in a more vulnerable cluster. Heart complications and cancer were the main risk factors increasing the COVID-19 MIR (range 0.08–0.52% MIR↑). We identified “more vulnerable” county-clusters exhibiting the highest COVID-19 MIR trajectories, indicating that enhancing the capacity and access to healthcare resources would be key to successfully manage COVID-19 in these clusters. These findings provide insights for public health policymakers on the groups of people and locations they need to pay particular attention while managing the COVID-19 epidemic.","Vahabi, Nasim; Salehi, Masoud; Duarte, Julio D.; Mollalo, Abolfazl; Michailidis, George",Sci Rep,42,26

OBJECTIVE: To develop a mapping method from ICD-10-GM into ICD-10 clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) to calculate the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) and ISS of each patient using the ICDPIC-R and to compare the manually and automatically calculated scores. METHODS: Between January 2019 and June 2021, the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS were manually calculated using medical documentation and radiology reports of all major trauma patients of a German level I trauma centre. The ICD-10-GM codes of these patients were exported from the electronic medical data system SAP, and a Java program was written to transform these into ICD-10-CM codes. Afterwards, the ICDPIC-R was used to automatically generate the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS. The automatically and manually determined ISS and AIS scores were then tested for equivalence. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that the manually and automatically calculated ISS were significantly equivalent over the entire patient cohort. Further sub-group analysis, however, showed that equivalence could only be demonstrated for patients with an ISS between 16 and 24. Likewise, the highest AIS scores of each body region were not equal in the manually and automatically calculated group. CONCLUSION: Though achieving mapping results highly comparable to previous mapping methods of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, it is not unrestrictedly possible to automatically calculate the AIS and ISS using ICD-10-GM codes.","Niemann, Marcel; Märdian, Sven; Niemann, Pascal; Tetteh, Liv; Tsitsilonis, Serafeim; Braun, Karl F; Stöckle, Ulrich; Graef, Frank",PLoS One,42,1

We aimed to investigate the relationship between von Willebrand factor (VWF) biomarkers, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID-19 patients and study their association with disease severity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 181 hospitalized COVID-19 patients randomly selected with balanced distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who died had significantly lower ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, significantly increased shistocyte/RBC fragment counts, and significantly elevated VWF antigen and activity levels compared with patients discharged alive. These biomarkers correlate with markedly elevated D-dimers. Additionally, only 30% of patients who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 43% on admission survived, yet 60% of patients survived who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of greater than 43% on admission. In conclusion, COVID-19 may present with low ADAMTS13 activity in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes/RBC fragment and elevated D-dimer on admission may warrant a work-up for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen and activity levels. These findings indicate the need for future investigation to study the relationship between endothelial and coagulation activation and the efficacy of treatments aimed at prevention and/or amelioration of microangiopathy in COVID-19.","Sweeney, Joseph M.; Barouqa, Mohammad; Krause, Gregory J.; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D.; Rahman, Shafia; Gil, Morayma Reyes",TH Open,42,27

In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.","Zhu, Yuanmei; Yu, Danwei; Yan, Hongxia; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",bioRxiv,42,8

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed data failings that have hindered service development and research for years. Fundamental gaps, in terms of population and service demographics coupled with difficulties identifying the population in routine data are a significant limitation. These challenges are a key factor underpinning the failure to provide timely and responsive policy decisions to support care homes. In this commentary we propose changes that could address this data gap, priorities include: (1) Reliable identification of care home residents and their tenure; (2) Common identifiers to facilitate linkage between data sources from different sectors; (3) Individual-level, anonymised data inclusive of mortality irrespective of where death occurs; (4) Investment in capacity for large-scale, anonymised linked data analysis within social care working in partnership with academics; (5) Recognition of the need for collaborative working to use novel data sources, working to understand their meaning and ensure correct interpretation; (6) Better integration of information governance, enabling safe access for legitimate analyses from all relevant sectors; (7) A core national dataset for care homes developed in collaboration with key stakeholders to support integrated care delivery, service planning, commissioning, policy and research. Our suggestions are immediately actionable with political will and investment. We should seize this opportunity to capitalise on the spotlight the pandemic has thrown on the vulnerable populations living in care homes to invest in data-informed approaches to support care, evidence-based policy making and research.","Burton, JK; Goodman, C; Guthrie, B; Gordon, AL; Hanratty, B; Quinn, TJ",International journal of population data science,42,1

With hundreds of studies published daily on COVID‐19, for example, we struggle to find, stay up‐to‐date, and synthesize information—all hampering evidence‐informed decision making. This COVID‐19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the “Search Triangle” model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit‐for‐purpose search systems.","Gusenbauer, Michael; Haddaway, Neal R.",Res Synth Methods,42,16

This study aimed to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality within 56 days in patients with severe infection of COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective multicentre cohort study. SETTING: Five tertiary hospitals of Daegu, South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 1005 participants over 19 years old confirmed COVID-19 using real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory support were analysed to ascertain the risk factors for mortality using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The relationship between overall survival and risk factors was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. OUTCOME: In-hospital mortality for any reason within 56 days. RESULTS: Of the 1005 patients, 289 (28.8%) received respiratory support, and of these, 70 patients (24.2%) died. In multivariate analysis, high fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4; HR 2.784), low lymphocyte count (HR 0.480), diabetes (HR 1.917) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (HR 1.714) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory support (all p<0.05). Regardless of respiratory support, survival in the high FIB-4 group was significantly lower than in the low FIB-4 group (28.8 days vs 44.0 days, respectively, p<0.001). A number of risk factors were also significantly related to survival in patients with COVID-19 regardless of respiratory support (0–4 risk factors, 50.2 days; 49.7 days; 44.4 days; 32.0 days; 25.0 days, respectively, p<0.001).

METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in a university hospital emergency department (ED) in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Patients older than 17 years and presenting between February 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, with a clinical diagnosis of goutlike arthritis were randomized to receive either oral prednisolone/acetaminophen or oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy. Primary outcome measures were pain scores, time to resolution of symptoms and signs, and adverse effects. Secondary outcome measures were the need for additional acetaminophen and relapse rate. RESULTS: There were 90 patients randomized: 46 patients to the indomethacin group and 44 patients to the prednisolone group. Baseline characteristics, including pain scores, were similar in the 2 groups. Both treatment groups had a similar decrease in pain score in the ED. The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was −1.7±1.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was −2.9±2.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.0 mm/day; P=.0026). Although these differences were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. Therefore, it is unclear whether these differences are clinically significant. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than in the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g). Twenty-nine patients in the indomethacin group and 12 patients in the prednisolone group experienced adverse effects (P<.05). The commonest adverse effects in the indomethacin group were nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal bleeding (N=5; 11%). None of the patients in the prednisolone group developed gastrointestinal bleeding. The relapse rate for both groups was similar. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis, oral prednisolone/acetaminophen combination is as effective as oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination in relieving pain but is associated with fewer adverse effects.","Man, Chi Yin; Cheung, Ian T.F.; Cameron, Peter A.; Rainer, Timothy H.",Ann Emerg Med,42,22

This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL—C), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. RESULTS: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events.

In cystic fibrosis, where airway mucus is dehydrated, it has been shown that inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) produces both acute and sustained enhancement of mucociliary clearance (MCC). The current study was designed to assess the acute and sustained effect of inhaled 7% HS on MCC in adult asthma. METHODS: Well-controlled, moderate–severe female asthmatic patients (n=8) were screened with a single test dose of albuterol (four puffs by metered-dose inhaler) followed by HS (7% sodium chloride, 4 mL using PARI LC Star nebuliser). Spirometry was measured pre-treatment and 5 and 30 min post-treatment for safety. MCC was measured using γ-scintigraphy on three separate visits: at baseline, during inhalation and 4 h after a single dose of HS. RESULTS: MCC was acutely enhanced during HS treatment; mean±sd clearance over 60 min of dynamic imaging (Ave60Clr) was 8.9±7.9% (baseline) versus 23.4±7.6% (acute HS) (p<0.005). However, this enhancement was not maintained over a 4-h period where post-HS treatment Ave60Clr was 9.3±8.2%. In this small cohort we found no decrements in lung function up to 30 min post-treatment (forced expiratory volume in 1 s 97.4±10.0% predicted pre-treatment and 98.9±10.7% predicted 30 min post-treatment). CONCLUSION: While MCC was rapidly enhanced during 7% HS treatment there was no effect on MCC at 4 h post-treatment. While these findings may not support aerosolised HS use for maintenance therapy, they do suggest a benefit of treating acute exacerbations in patients with moderate–severe asthma.","Bennett, William D.; Burbank, Allison; Almond, Martha; Wu, Jihong; Ceppe, Agathe; Hernandez, Michelle; Boucher, Richard C.; Peden, David B.",ERJ Open Res,42,1

Here, they act as a gastric tumor suppressor (TFF1) or they play different roles in mucosal innate immune defense (TFF2, TFF3). Minute amounts are also secreted as endocrine, e.g., by the immune and central nervous systems. As a hallmark, TFF peptides have different lectin activities, best characterized for TFF2, but also TFF1. Pathologically, ectopic expression occurs during inflammation and in various tumors. In this review, the role of TFF peptides during inflammation is discussed on two levels. On the one hand, the expression of TFF1-3 is regulated by inflammatory signals in different ways (upstream links). On the other hand, TFF peptides influence inflammatory processes (downstream links). The latter are recognized best in various Tff-deficient mice, which have completely different phenotypes. In particular, TFF2 is secreted by myeloid cells (e.g., macrophages) and lymphocytes (e.g., memory T cells), where it modulates immune reactions triggering inflammation. As a new concept, in addition to lectin-triggered activation, a hypothetical lectin-triggered inhibition of glycosylated transmembrane receptors by TFF peptides is discussed. Thus, TFFs are promising players in the field of glycoimmunology, such as galectins and C-type lectins.","Hoffmann, Werner",Int J Mol Sci,42,22

As in similar cases in the past, also with this one, the main interest is on the “first response”. Fully appreciating the efforts of those risking their lives facing pandemics, this paper tries to identify the main elements of the larger, possibly global, framework, supported by international standards, needed to deal with new (emerging) risks resulting from threats like Corona and assess the resilience of systems affected. The paper proposes that future solutions should include a number of new elements, related to both risk and resilience. That should include broadening the scope of attention, currently focused onto preparation and response phases, to the phases of “understanding risks”, including emerging risks, and transformation and adaptation. The paper suggests to use resilience indicators in this process. The proposed approach has been applied in different cases involving critical infrastructures in Europe (energy supply, water supply, transportation, etc., exposed to various threats), including the health system in Austria. The detailed, indicator-based, resilience analysis included mapping resilience, resilience stress-testing, visualization, etc., showing, already before the COVID-19, the resilience (stress-testing) limits of the infrastructures.

In this study, we produced a nanovaccine based on virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are safe vaccine platforms as they lack any replication-competent genetic material, and are used since many years against hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and human papilloma virus (HPV). In order to produce a vaccine that is readily scalable, we genetically fused the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of MERS-CoV spike protein into the surface of cucumber-mosaic virus VLPs. The employed CuMV(TT)-VLPs represent a new immunologically optimized vaccine platform incorporating a universal T cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin (TT). The resultant vaccine candidate (mCuMV(TT)-MERS) is a mosaic particle and consists of unmodified wild type monomers and genetically modified monomers displaying RBM, co-assembling within E. coli upon expression. mCuMV(TT)-MERS vaccine is self-adjuvanted with ssRNA, a TLR7/8 ligand which is spontaneously packaged during the bacterial expression process. The developed vaccine candidate induced high anti-RBD and anti-spike antibodies in a murine model, showing high binding avidity and an ability to completely neutralize MERS-CoV/EMC/2012 isolate, demonstrating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate for dromedaries and humans.","Mohsen, Mona O.; Rothen, Dominik; Balke, Ina; Martina, Byron; Zeltina, Vilija; Inchakalody, Varghese; Gharailoo, Zahra; Nasrallah, Gheyath; Dermime, Said; Tars, Kaspars; Vogel, Monique; Zeltins, Andris; Bachmann, Martin F.",NPJ Vaccines,42,5

Understanding the nature and prevalence of these neurologic manifestations is essential for identifying higher-risk patients and projecting demand for ongoing resource utilisation. This review and meta-analysis report the neurologic manifestations identified in hospitalised COVID-19 patients and provide a preliminary estimate of disease prevalence. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus were searched for studies reporting the occurrence of neurological complications in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 2,207 unique entries were identified and screened, among which 14 cohort studies and 53 case reports were included, reporting on a total of 8,577 patients. Central nervous system manifestations included ischemic stroke (n = 226), delirium (n = 79), intracranial haemorrhage (ICH, n = 57), meningoencephalitis (n = 13), seizures (n = 3), and acute demyelinating encephalitis (n = 2). Peripheral nervous system manifestations included Guillain-Barrè Syndrome (n = 21) and other peripheral neuropathies (n = 3). The pooled period prevalence of ischemic stroke from identified studies was 1.3% [95%CI: 0.9–1.8%, 102/7,715] in all hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and 2.8% [95%CI: 1.0–4.6%, 9/318] among COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. The pooled prevalence of ICH was estimated at 0.4% [95%CI: 0–0.8%, 6/1,006]. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic exerts a substantial neurologic burden which may have residual effects on patients and healthcare systems for years. Low quality evidence impedes the ability to accurately predict the magnitude of this burden.

This new disease includes multiple symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. The disease is mild in most people; however, in some patients, it may develop to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple dysfunctions in the organs which may lead to death. There are two routes of transmission for this virus, the first route is the direct transmission, through cough or droplet inhalation, while the second route is through contact, for example, contact with oral and nasal mucous membranes; consequently, extensive and intensive measures should be taken to decrease the transmission of COVID-19 from person to person. Due to the nature of dental work and its procedures, the dental professionals are in a high risk of transmission.

Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. METHODS: A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health’s personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. RESULTS: Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R(2) value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. CONCLUSIONS: Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants’ genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.","Sinha, Ranjan; Kachru, Dashyanng; Ricchetti, Roshni Ray; Singh-Rambiritch, Simitha; Muthukumar, Karthik Marimuthu; Singaravel, Vidhya; Irudayanathan, Carmel; Reddy-Sinha, Chandana; Junaid, Imran; Sharma, Garima; Francis-Lyon, Patricia Alice",J Med Internet Res,42,32

This study was conducted not only to disclose the energy use change under COVID-19 but also to identify the corresponding facilities management strategies for future learning and teaching delivery modes under virtual campuses. This study collected the energy use data of 122 buildings across five campuses in Griffith University, located in Southeast Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 academic year (February 17, 2020, to February 21, 2021) and during a typical normal academic year (February 18, 2019, to February 16, 2020) by PI Vision Platform, and compared the data using the t-test and multiple linear regression. The results indicated that learning and administration activities became off campus during the pandemic, while research activities remained on campus. During the COVID-19 academic year, an amount of 9,646,933 kWh energy or around 24.88 kWh/m(2) of energy use intensity was saved, which accounted for 16% of the total energy use per academic year. Specifically, the shutting down of air conditioning in academic buildings, administration buildings, retail buildings and teaching buildings during COVID-19 saved 4,566 kWh (1.13 kWh/m(2)), 966 kWh (0.8 kWh/m(2)), 1,472 kWh (1.4 kWh/m(2)) and 860 kWh (1.3 kWh/m(2)) of electricity use per week, respectively, which accounted for 51.5%, 44.3%, 48.3% and 57.1% of total energy use per week during this period, respectively. Based on this analysis and the changing educational environment, this study also speculated on the energy implications of future teaching and learning practices, which provided guidance to the facilities management under virtual campuses.","Gui, Xuechen; Gou, Zhonghua; Zhang, Fan; Yu, Rongrong",Energy Build,42,22

Venezuela has one of the weakest testing infrastructures in Latin America and the low number of reported cases in the country has been attributed to substantial underreporting. However, the Venezuelan epidemic seems to have lagged behind other countries in the region, with most cases occurring within the capital region and four border states. Here, we describe the spatial epidemiology of COVID-19 in Venezuela and its relation to the population mobility, migration patterns, non-pharmaceutical interventions and fuel availability that impact population movement. Using a metapopulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, we explore how movement patterns could have driven the observed distribution of cases. Low within-country connectivity most likely delayed the onset of the epidemic in most states, except for those bordering Colombia and Brazil, where high immigration seeded outbreaks. NPIs slowed early epidemic growth and subsequent fuel shortages appeared to be responsible for limiting the spread of COVID-19 across the country.","Lampo, Margarita; Hernández-Villena, Juan V.; Cascante, Jaime; Vincenti-González, María F.; Forero-Peña, David A.; Segovia, Maikell J.; Hampson, Katie; Castro, Julio; Grillet, Maria Eugenia",Vaccines (Basel),42,1

METHODS: A total of 938 public workers answered anonymous questionnaires in May 2020. The survey included rating scales such as the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2 items (CD-RISC 2), and subjects also answered whether they were employed in COVID-19 related fields. RESULTS: Married, female, junior, public workers reported a higher level of stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic. Furthermore, high levels of stress and anxiety toward the epidemic are defined by high PHQ-9, high GAD-7, and low CD-RISC 2 scores. It could also be seen that resilience mediated the effect of depression in public workers and their stress and anxiety levels toward the epidemic. CONCLUSION: It is important to reduce the psychological burden of public workers and manage their mental health to help them cope with the epidemic wisely and efficiently. Among many mental health factors, psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention among public workers.","Ju, Gawon; Lee, Jeonghwan; Ahn, Myung Hee; Lee, Joohee; Kim, Eun Jeong; Suh, Sooyeon; Chung, Seockhoon",J Korean Med Sci,42,29

Empirically, an intensified dose of thrombosis prophylaxis is being used in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and several guidelines on this topic have been published, although the insufficiency of high quality and direct evidence has led to weak recommendations. In this Viewpoint we summarise the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy in the context of patients who are ambulant, admitted to hospital, and critically ill or non-critically ill, and those post-discharge from hospital. We also review data from randomised controlled trials in the past year of antithrombotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. These data provide the first high-quality evidence on optimal use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended. In the upcoming months we expect numerous data from the ongoing antithrombotic COVID-19 studies to guide clinicians at different stages of the disease.","Leentjens, Jenneke; van Haaps, Thijs F; Wessels, Pieter F; Schutgens, Roger E G; Middeldorp, Saskia",Lancet Haematol,42,1

We utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyd's tragic death on May 25, 2020, to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Our sample period spans from January 22, 2020, to June 20, 2020, and consists of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the change in COVID-19 case counts following the protests, we employ a differences in differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting, in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties. We also control for covariates that may influence COVID-19 transmission, and implement placebo tests using a Monte Carlo simulation. Findings: We document a country wide increase of over 3.06 cases per day, per 100,000 population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2.47-3.65), and a further increase of 1.73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place (95%CI: 0.59- 2.87). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests, this represents a 61.2% country wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and a further 34.6% increase in the protest counties. Interpretation: Our study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance.","Gagnon, L.; Lloyd, J.; Gagnon, S.",,42,1

METHODS: Development and pilot testing of hypothetical cervical cancer health states, specifically through the lens of being an Indigenous Australian woman, was done with an Indigenous Reference Group in conjunction with five female Indigenous community members. Six health states were developed. These included: (1) Screened: cytology normal; (2) human papillomaviruses (HPV) positive with cytology normal; (3) low grade cytology (LSIL);(4) high grade cytology (HSIL); (5) early stage cervical cancer and; (6) later stage cervical cancer. Utility scores were calculated using a two-stage standard gamble approach among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women taking part in a broader study involving oral HPV infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the rank, percentage of respondents with a utility = 1 (perfect health) and utility score of each health state was summarised. Mean (SD) and medians and inter-quartile range (IQR) over 12 months and lifetime duration were calculated. Potential differences by age and residential location were assessed using the Wilcox Sum Rank test. RESULTS: Data was obtained from 513 Indigenous women aged 19+ years. Mean utility scores were higher for the four non-cancer health states than for invasive cervical cancer states (p-values <0.05). Lower mean utility scores were observed for late stage cervical cancer, with 0.69 at 12 months and 0.70 for lifetime duration (Intra-class correlation coefficients = 0.425). Higher utility scores were observed for the four non-cancer health states among non-metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.93 to 0.98) compared with metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.86 to 0.93) (p-values<0.05). CONCLUSION: Among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women, the reduction in quality of life (which utilities reflect) was perceived to be greater with increasing severity of cervical cancer health states. There were differences observed by geographic location, with positive cervical screening and precursor cancer-related quality of life being much higher among non-metropolitan-dwelling participants. These utility values, from one of the largest such studies ever performed in any population will be uniquely able to inform modelled evaluations of the benefits and costs of cervical cancer prevention interventions in Indigenous women.","Ju, Xiangqun; Canfell, Karen; Howard, Kirsten; Garvey, Gail; Hedges, Joanne; Smith, Megan; Jamieson, Lisa",PLoS One,42,16

These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive methods that can easily measure brain waves alone to predict and monitor stroke diseases in real time during daily life. These findings are expected to lead to significant improvements for early stroke detection with reduced cost and discomfort compared to other measuring techniques.","Choi, Yoon-A; Park, Se-Jin; Jun, Jong-Arm; Pyo, Cheol-Sig; Cho, Kang-Hee; Lee, Han-Sung; Yu, Jae-Hak",Sensors (Basel),42,27

Areas Covered: Extensive information related to the optimization and usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods based on sensitivity and specificity as definitive and feasible investigative tools is discussed. Moreover, an option of combining laboratory diagnostic methods to improve diagnostic strategies is also proposed and discussed in the comparative section of optimization studies. Expert Opinion: The review article explains the importance of optimization strategies for SARS-CoV-2 detection in children and older adults. There are advancements in COVID-19 detection including CRISPR-based, electrochemical, and optical-based sensing systems. However, the lack of sufficient studies on a comparative evaluation of standardized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods among children and older adults, limit the authentication of commercialized kits.","Chauhan, Nidhi; Soni, Shringika; Jain, Utkarsh",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,42,20

Countries around the world have taken extraordinary steps to control the disease. The preventive measures face challenges in low and lower middle income countries (LICs and LMICs). Especially the marginalized communities, e.g., women are the hardest hit of the virus. This study took Bangladesh as a representative LMIC and aimed to determine the level of knowledge, perception, attitude, and preparedness related to COVID-19 among the adult women in the country. Using a comprehensive questionnaire, we channeled a cross-sectional study among adult women in Bangladesh. Participant's self-reported data on the knowledge, attitude, and preparedness were tabulated and analyzed using suitable statistical tools. A total of 1,869 adults from 61 districts of Bangladesh took part in this study. Ninety seven percentage of the participants claimed to have heard of COVID-19 before it arrived in Bangladesh. Regarding the general knowledge related to COVID-19's causal agent, symptoms, and treatment, the positive response rate was nearly 80%, with a mean of 10.68 ± 1.72. Younger and educated women had better knowledge levels compared to the older and lower-educated participants (p < 0.01). More efforts are required to educate women with older age and lower socioeconomic status. An overall positive attitude and perception were observed, although a significant proportion of the participants opined that the Government's efforts in controlling the outbreak were not adequate. Although the participants had a satisfactory level of knowledge and a positive attitude in adopting preventive measures against COVID-19, greater efforts are needed from the healthcare authorities and Government.","Anwar, Saeed; Araf, Yusha; Newaz Khan, Asir; Ullah, Md.

There is no existing literature that focuses on such impact on RD organisations in any jurisdictions, nor RD populations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to RD organisations between April and May 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 on RD organisations and patients were collected from the organisation representative’s perspective. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. A follow-up focus group meeting was conducted in August 2020 to validate the survey findings and to discuss specific needs, support and recommendations for sustainable healthcare systems during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 80 RD organisations from Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, India, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan participated in the study. Of all, 89% were concerned about the impact of pandemic on their organisations. Results indicate that 63% of the organisations functioned at a reduced capacity and 42% stated a decrease in funding as their biggest challenge. Overall, 95% believed their patients were impacted, particularly in healthcare access, social lives, physical health, psychological health and financial impact. Specifically, 43% identified the reduced healthcare access as their top impact, followed by 26% about the impact on daily living and social life. Focus group meeting discussed differential impact across jurisdictions and point towards telemedicine and digitalisation as potential solutions. CONCLUSIONS: This serves as the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on RD patients and organisations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, identifying major themes on the impact on both RD patients and organisations. By including 80 organisations from ten jurisdictions, our study presents the most comprehensive assessment of the pandemic’s impact to date. It highlights the need for mental health support and sheds light on moving towards telemedicine and digitalisation of organisation operation, which constitutes a sustainable model in times of pandemics and beyond.

SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes seasonal outbreaks with a case fatality rate of ~37 %. Here we show that there exists a theoretical possibility of future recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA. Through computational analyses, we have identified homologous genomic regions within the ORF1ab and S genes that could facilitate recombination, and have analysed co-expression patterns of the cellular receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, ACE2 and DPP4, respectively, to identify human anatomical sites that could facilitate co-infection. Furthermore, we have investigated the likely susceptibility of various animal species to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing known virus spike protein–receptor interacting residues. In conclusion, we suggest that a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA is possible and urge public health laboratories in high-risk areas to develop diagnostic capability for the detection of recombined coronaviruses in patient samples.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Doxey, Andrew C.; Tremblay, Benjamin J.-M.; Mansfield, Michael J.; Subudhi, Sonu; Hirota, Jeremy A.; Miller, Matthew S.; McArthur, Andrew G.; Mubareka, Samira; Mossman, Karen",J Gen Virol,42,1

People’s adherence to control measures is influenced by their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the disease. Therefore, in the present study we assessed pharmacy senior students’ knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was created and it consisted of 12 questions testing their knowledge about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, transmission routes and prevention and control steps. Among senior pharmacy students (n = 238), 70% were females and 63% were living in greater Cairo. Their main source of information included social media (70%), published articles (48%) and television (48%). The overall correct knowledge score was 83%. Most of the students displayed a good COVID-19 knowledge level (72.5% of the students). The students were least informed when trying to answer questions about hyper-coagulation, as a major cause for death in patients with severe COVID-19, and about the timings on the necessity to wear masks. Assessment of students’ attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 reflected that 87% of them were confident that health care teams and scientists could win the fight against the virus. In addition, 72% of students agreed that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully. The greater the students’ knowledge, the more confident they felt that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–4.72). Good behavioral practice towards COVID-19 control was confirmed when 87% of students answered that they didn’t go out to any crowded place. Females were 3.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–3.11) more likely to avoid going out than males. Bad behavioral practice became evident when approximately 50% of students admitted that they did not wear masks when they left their house. Therefore, more efforts should be taken to protect future pharmacists from this pandemic.","Hamza, Marwa S.; Badary, Osama A.; Elmazar, Mohamed M.",J Community Health,42,20

Our objective was to investigate the mental health of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Trauma Exposure Scale, abbreviated version of the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Demographic Questionnaire were used to examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, trauma exposure, resilience and perceived social support among 898 patients who were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. The data were analyzed with t tests, one-way ANOVA and multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety was 13.2, 21.0 and 16.4%, respectively. Hospitalized patients who were more impacted by negative news reports, had greater exposure to traumatic experiences, and had lower levels of perceived social support reported higher PTSD, depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Effective professional mental health services should be designed to support the psychological wellbeing of hospitalized patients, especially those who have severe disease, are strongly affected by negative news and have high levels of exposure to trauma.","Chen, Yaru; Huang, Xin; Zhang, Chengyuan; An, Yuanyuan; Liang, Yiming; Yang, Yufang; Liu, Zhengkui",BMC Psychiatry,42,24

The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical performance of XPEN60. METHODS: The analytical performance of XPEN60 was evaluated on the basis of several parameters, including the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantitation (LoQ), precision, accuracy, carryover, linearity, clinical reportable range (CRR), and interference test. In addition, method comparisons between CBC and 5‐DIFF, CRP, and SAA were performed on several systems. RESULTS: Total imprecision and accuracy for all parameters fell within acceptable criteria, and excellent measurements were observed in the dilution linearity (coefficient of determination, R (2) > .99). LoBs and LoDs (0 and 0.21 mg/L for CRP, 1.1 and 2.27 mg/L for SAA) satisfy the manufacturer's statement. LoQs were 0.61 and 3.62 mg/L for CRP and SAA, respectively. No significant carryover or interference tests (<10%) were observed in this study. The comparison analysis demonstrated strong agreement between XPEN60 results and those of Sysmex–XN1000 (XN1000), except for basophils (Bas) and eosinophils (Eos). The data correlated well with E601 and Mindray CRP‐M100 for CRP. CONCLUSION: XPEN60 was demonstrated satisfactory analytical performance, which made it well‐suited for use in clinical laboratories, emergency departments, and community hospitals.","Zong, Zengyan; Kan, Lijuan; Luo, Yanping; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Xibu; Wang, Mengmeng; Xiong, Dan; Zhang, Xiuming",J Clin Lab Anal,42,11

These activities are determined by integrating signals in space and time; thus, improving control over the densities, combinations, and durations with which immune signals are delivered is a central goal to better combat infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmunity. Self-assembly presents a unique opportunity to synthesize materials with well-defined compositions and controlled physical arrangement of molecular building blocks. This review highlights strategies exploiting these capabilities to improve the understanding of how precisely-displayed cues interact with immune cells and tissues. We present work centered on fundamental properties that regulate the nature and magnitude of immune response, highlight pre-clinical and clinical applications of self-assembled technologies in vaccines, cancer, and autoimmunity, and describe some of the key manufacturing and regulatory hurdles facing these areas.","Tostanoski, Lisa H.; Jewell, Christopher M.",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,42,27

The impact of these social times, collectively—social time pressure, on sleep has been studied epidemiologically via quantification of the discrepancy between sleep times on workdays and those on work-free days. This discrepancy is known as the social jetlag (SJL). COVID-19-mandated social restrictions (SR) constituted a global intervention by affecting social times worldwide. We launched a Global Chrono Corona Survey (GCCS) that queried sleep–wake times before and during SR (preSR and inSR). 11,431 adults from 40 countries responded between April 4 and May 6, 2020. The final sample consisted of 7517 respondents (68.2% females), who had been 32.7 ± 9.1 (mean ± sd) days under SR. SR led to robust changes: mid-sleep time on workdays and free days was delayed by 50 and 22 min, respectively; sleep duration increased on workdays by 26 min but shortened by 9 min on free days; SJL decreased by ~ 30 min. On workdays inSR, sleep–wake times in most people approached those of their preSR free days. Changes in sleep duration and SJL correlated with inSR-use of alarm clocks and were larger in young adults. The data indicate a massive sleep deficit under pre-pandemic social time pressure, provide insights to the actual sleep need of different age-groups and suggest that tolerable SJL is about 20 min. Relaxed social time pressure promotes more sleep, smaller SJL and reduced use of alarm clocks.","Korman, Maria; Tkachev, Vadim; Reis, Cátia; Komada, Yoko; Kitamura, Shingo; Gubin, Denis; Kumar, Vinod; Roenneberg, Till",Sci Rep,42,16

While three-layer masks are generally advised, many commonly available or makeshift masks contain single or double layers. Using carefully designed experiments involving high-speed imaging along with physics-based analysis, we show that high-momentum, large-sized (>250 micrometer) surrogate cough droplets can penetrate single- or double-layer mask material to a significant extent. The penetrated droplets can atomize into numerous much smaller (<100 micrometer) droplets, which could remain airborne for a significant time. The possibility of secondary atomization of high-momentum cough droplets by hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous network of the single/double-layer mask material needs to be considered in determining mask efficacy. Three-layer masks can effectively block these droplets and thus could be ubiquitously used as a key tool against COVID-19 or similar respiratory diseases.","Sharma, Shubham; Pinto, Roven; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",Sci Adv,42,26

It is a major concern for individuals living with chronic disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Increasing evidence suggests an involvement of oxidative stress and contribution of NFκB in the development of both COVID-19 and PD. Although, it is early to identify if SARS-CoV-2 led infection enhances PD complications, it is likely that oxidative stress may exacerbate PD progression in COVID-19 affected individuals and/or vice versa. In the current study, we sought to investigate whether NFκB-associated inflammatory pathways following oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 and PD patients are correlated. Toward this goal, we have integrated bioinformatics analysis obtained from Basic Local Alignment Search Tool of Protein Database (BLASTP) search for similarities of SARS-CoV-2 proteins against human proteome, literature review, and laboratory data obtained in a human cell model of PD. A Parkinson’s like state was created in 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)-induced differentiated dopamine-containing neurons (dDCNs) obtained from an immortalized human neural progenitor cell line derived from the ventral mesencephalon region of the brain (ReNVM). The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection and 6OHDA-induced toxicity triggered stimulation of caspases-2, -3 and -8 via the NFκB pathway resulting in the death of dDCNs. Furthermore, specific inhibitors for NFκB and studied caspases reduced the death of stressed dDCNs. The findings suggest that knowledge of the selective inhibition of caspases and NFκB activation may contribute to the development of potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 and PD.","Chaudhry, Zahara L.; Klenja, Donika; Janjua, Najma; Cami-Kobeci, Gerta; Ahmed, Bushra Y.",Brain Sci,42,20
