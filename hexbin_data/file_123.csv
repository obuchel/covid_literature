881,881,881,Clinical review: Special populations - critical illness and pregnancy,19.332485,10.857505,2011-08-12,"Critical illness is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of pregnancy. The majority of pregnancy-related critical care admissions occur postpartum. Antenatally, the pregnant patient is more likely to be admitted with diseases non-specific to pregnancy, such as pneumonia. Pregnancy-specific diseases resulting in ICU admission include obstetric hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, amniotic fluid embolus syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Alternatively, critical illness may result from pregnancy-induced worsening of pre-existing diseases (for example, valvular heart disease, myasthenia gravis, and kidney disease). Pregnancy can also predispose women to diseases seen in the non-pregnant population, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (for example, pneumonia and aspiration), sepsis (for example, chorioamnionitis and pyelonephritis) or pulmonary embolism. The pregnant patient may also develop conditions co-incidental to pregnancy such as trauma or appendicitis. Hemorrhage, particularly postpartum, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain the most frequent indications for ICU admission. This review focuses on pregnancy-specific causes of critical illness. Management of the critically ill mother poses special challenges. The physiologic changes in pregnancy and the presence of a second, dependent, patient may necessitate adjustments to therapeutic and supportive strategies. The fetus is generally robust despite maternal illness, and therapeutically what is good for the mother is generally good for the fetus. For pregnancy-induced critical illnesses, delivery of the fetus helps resolve the disease process. Prognosis following pregnancy-related critical illness is generally better than for age-matched non-pregnant critically ill patients.","Neligan, Patrick J; Laffey, John G",Crit Care,123,12
2013,2013,2013,Prolonged prone positioning under VV-ECMO is safe and improves oxygenation and respiratory compliance,19.49678,10.948318,2015-11-04,"BACKGROUND: Data are sparse regarding the effects of prolonged prone positioning (PP) during VV-ECMO. Previous studies, using short sessions (<12 h), failed to find any effects on respiratory system compliance. In the present analysis, the effects of prolonged PP sessions (24 h) were retrospectively studied with regard to safety data, oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. METHODS: Retrospective review of 17 consecutive patients who required both VV-ECMO and prone positioning. PP under VV-ECMO was considered when the patient presented at least one unsuccessful ECMO weaning attempt after day 7 or refractory hypoxemia combined or not with persistent high plateau pressure. PP sessions had a duration of 24 h with fixed ECMO and respiratory settings. PP was not performed in patients under vasopressor treatment and in cases of recent open chest cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Despite optimized protective mechanical ventilation and other adjuvant treatment (i.e. PP, inhaled nitric oxide, recruitment maneuvers), 44 patients received VV-ECMO during the study period for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome. Global survival rate was 66 %. Among the latter, 17 patients underwent PP during VV-ECMO for a total of 27 sessions. After 24 h in prone position, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio significantly increased from 111 (84–128) to 173 (120–203) mmHg (p < 0.0001) while respiratory system compliance increased from 18 (12–36) to 32 (15–36) ml/cmH(2)O (p < 0.0001). Twenty-four hours after the return to supine position, tidal volume was increased from 3.0 (2.2–4.0) to 3.7 (2.8–5.0) ml/kg (p < 0.005). PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased by over 20 % in 14/14 sessions for late sessions (≥7 days) and in 7/13 sessions for early sessions (<7 days) (p = 0.01). Quantitative CT scan revealed a high percentage of non-aerated or poorly-aerated lung parenchyma [52 % (41–62)] in all patients. No correlation was found between CT scan data and respiratory parameter changes. Hemodynamics did not vary and side effects were rare (one membrane thrombosis and one drop in ECMO blood flow). CONCLUSION: When used in combination with VV-ECMO, 24 h of prone positioning improves both oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. Moreover, our study confirms the absence of serious adverse events.

Although forbidden since 1987 for domestic use, it is still used in industry, for example, to fumigate agricultural fields which are for importation in the United States. Here is the case of a 74-year-old man who was accidentally exposed to methyl bromide after using an old fire extinguisher. Even though he finally survived, he developed a severe multiple organ failure and spent 2 months in intensive care unit.

Some studies have demonstrated an association between CMV disease and increased mortality rates, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and nosocomial infections. However, there is a considerable controversy whether such association represents a causal relationship between CMV disease and unfavorable outcomes or just a marker of the severity of the critical illness. Detection of CMV using polymerase chain reaction and CMV antigenemia is the standard diagnostic approach. CMV may have variety of clinical manifestations reflecting the involvement of different organ systems. Treatment of CMV in critical care is challenging due to diagnostic challenge and drug toxicity, and building predictive model for CMV disease in critical care setting would be promising to identify patients at risk and starting prophylactic therapy. Our objective was to broadly review the current literature on the prevalence and incidence, clinical manifestations, potential limitations of different diagnostic modalities, prognosis, and therapeutic options of CMV disease in critically ill patients.","Al-Omari, Awad; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alhazzani, Waleed; Salih, Samer; Arabi, Yaseen",Ann Intensive Care,123,12
3273,3273,3273,The endotoxin-induced pulmonary inflammatory response is enhanced during the acute phase of influenza infection,19.47396,11.1922655,2018-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Influenza infections are often complicated by secondary infections, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality, suggesting that influenza profoundly influences the immune response towards a subsequent pathogenic challenge. However, data on the immunological interplay between influenza and secondary infections are equivocal, with some studies reporting influenza-induced augmentation of the immune response, whereas others demonstrate that influenza suppresses the immune response towards a subsequent challenge. These contrasting results may be due to the use of various types of live bacteria as secondary challenges, which impedes clear interpretation of causal relations, and to differences in timing of the secondary challenge relative to influenza infection. Herein, we investigated whether influenza infection results in an enhanced or suppressed innate immune response upon a secondary challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in either the acute or the recovery phase of infection. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were intranasally inoculated with 5 × 10(3) PFU influenza virus (pH1N1, strain A/Netherlands/602/2009) or mock treated. After 4 (acute phase) or 10 (recovery phase) days, 5 mg/kg LPS or saline was administered intravenously, and mice were sacrificed 90 min later. Cytokine levels in plasma and lung tissue, and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) content were determined. RESULTS: LPS administration 4 days after influenza infection resulted in a synergistic increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 concentrations in lung tissue, but not in plasma. This effect was also observed 10 days after influenza infection, albeit to a lesser extent. LPS-induced plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were enhanced 4 days after influenza infection, whereas a trend towards increased pulmonary IL-10 concentrations was found. LPS-induced increases in pulmonary MPO content tended to be enhanced as well, but only at 4 days post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: An LPS challenge in the acute phase of influenza infection results in an enhanced pulmonary pro-inflammatory innate immune response. These data increase our insight on influenza-bacterial interplay. Combing data of the present study with previous findings, it appears that this enhanced response is not beneficial in terms of protection against secondary infections, but rather damaging by increasing immunopathology.","Koch, R.

However, little is known about herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurring in patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We tried to determine the frequency of Herpesviridae reactivation and its impact on patients’ prognosis during ECMO for severe ARDS. RESULTS: During a 5-year period, 123 non-immunocompromised patients with a severe ARDS requiring a veno-venous ECMO were included. Sixty-seven patients (54%) experienced HSV and/or CMV reactivation during ECMO course (20 viral co-infection, 40 HSV alone, and 7 CMV alone). HSV reactivation occurred earlier than CMV after the beginning of MV [(6–15) vs. 19 (13–29) days; p < 0.01] and after ECMO implementation [(2–8) vs. 14 (10–20) days; p < 0.01]. In univariate analysis, HSV/CMV reactivation was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(22–52.5) vs. 17.5 (9–28) days; p < 0.01], a longer duration of ECMO [15 (10–22.5) vs. 9 (5–14) days; p < 0.01], and a prolonged ICU [29 (19.5–47.5) vs. 16 (9–30) days; p < 0.01] and hospital stay [44 (29–63.5) vs. 24 (11–43) days; p < 0.01] as compared to non-reactivated patients. However, in multivariate analysis, viral reactivation remained associated with prolonged MV only. When considered separately, both HSV and CMV reactivation were associated with a longer duration of MV as compared to non-reactivation patients [29 (19.5–41) and 28 (20.5–37), respectively, vs. 17.5 (9–28) days; p < 0.05]. Co-reactivation patients had a longer duration of MV [58.5 (38–72.3); p < 0.05] and ICU stay [51.5 (32.5–69) vs. 27.5 (17.75–35.5) and 29 (20–30.5), respectively] as compared to patients with HSV or CMV reactivation alone. In multivariate analysis, HSV reactivation remained independently associated with a longer duration of MV and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Herpesviridae reactivation is frequent among patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous ECMO and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation. The direct causative link between HSV and CMV reactivation and respiratory function worsening under ECMO remains to be confirmed.","Hraiech, Sami; Bonnardel, Eline; Guervilly, Christophe; Fabre, Cyprien; Loundou, Anderson; Forel, Jean-Marie; Adda, Mélanie; Parzy, Gabriel; Cavaille, Guilhem; Coiffard, Benjamin; Roch, Antoine; Papazian, Laurent",Ann Intensive Care,123,12

Therefore, the aims of our study were to evaluate the basal level of expression of pivotal genes in the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation, as well as to evaluate the ability of this cell line to respond to infectious or non-infectious stressors. As surmised in our working hypothesis, we demonstrated the constitutive expression of genes involved in the innate immune response and cell defense alike, including TLRs, Interleukins, Myd88, p65/NF-kB and p53. Moreover, we described the ability of this cell line to respond to LPS and cadmium (Cd2+) in terms of gene expression and cytokine release.

It’s necessary to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for MDRI in PICU, to provide insights into the prophylaxis of MDRI clinically. METHODS: Clinical data of 79 PICU children with MDRI were identified, and 80 children in PICU without MDRI in the same period were selected as control group. The related children’s characteristics, clinical care, microbiologic data, treatments provided, and outcomes of the patients with were reviewed and collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the potential risks of MDRI in PICU. RESULTS: Of the diagnosed 79 cases of MDRI, there were28 cases of CR-AB, 24 cases of MRSA, 22 cases of PDR-PA,3 cases of VRE and 2 cases of CRE respectively. Univariate analyses indicated that the length of PICU stay, the duration of mechanical ventilation > 5 days, parenteral nutrition, coma, urinary catheter indwelling, invasive operation, 2 or more antibiotics use were associated with MDRIs (all p < 0.05); The logistic multiple regression analyses indicated that coma, parenteral nutrition, 2 or more antibiotics use and the duration of mechanical ventilation > 5 days were independent risk factors associated with MDRI (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This present study has identified several potentially modifiable risk factors for MDRI in PICU, it’s conducive to take appropriate measures targeting risk factors of MDRI for health care providers to reduce MDRI.","Wang, Zaihua; Xia, Zhongfang",Ital J Pediatr,123,12

Daily emotional regulation in reaction to constantly watching suffering patients may be intensified among those hospice professionals who have high levels of compassion fatigue. The main object of this study was to examine the relationship between daily exposition to seeing patient suffering and daily emotional work, and to assess whether compassion fatigue (secondary traumatic stress and burnout) buffers this relationship. METHODS: We used a diary research design for collecting daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering and emotional work display. Participants filled in a general survey and daily survey over a period of eight consecutive workdays. A total of 39 hospice professionals from two Italian hospices participated in the study. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses demonstrated that daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering was positively related to daily emotional work display after controlling for daily death of patients. Moreover, considering previous levels of compassion fatigue, a buffering effect of high burnout on seeing patients suffering - daily emotional work display relationship was found. CONCLUSIONS: A central finding of our study is that fluctuations in daily witness of patients suffering are positively related to daily use of positive emotional regulations. Further, our results show that burnout buffers this relationship such that hospice professionals with high burnout use more emotional display in days where they recurrently witness patients suffering.","Portoghese, Igor; Galletta, Maura; Larkin, Philip; Sardo, Salvatore; Campagna, Marcello; Finco, Gabriele; D’Aloja, Ernesto",BMC Palliat Care,123,12

The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between ventilatory settings during ECMO for refractory hypoxemia and outcome in ARDS patients. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis of observational studies in adult ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia, a time-dependent frailty model was used to determine which ventilator settings in the first 3 days of ECMO had an independent association with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies including 545 patients were included. Initiation of ECMO was accompanied by significant decreases in tidal volume size, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), plateau pressure, and driving pressure (plateau pressure − PEEP) levels, and respiratory rate and minute ventilation, and resulted in higher PaO(2)/FiO(2), higher arterial pH and lower PaCO(2) levels. Higher age, male gender and lower body mass index were independently associated with mortality. Driving pressure was the only ventilatory parameter during ECMO that showed an independent association with in-hospital mortality [adjusted HR, 1.06 (95 % CI, 1.03–1.10)]. CONCLUSION: In this series of ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia, driving pressure during ECMO was the only ventilator setting that showed an independent association with in-hospital mortality.

DESIGN: Retrospective case notes analysis. SETTING: University Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. PATIENTS: All children admitted to the intensive care unit between November 1985 and May 1992 with a primary diagnosis of severe sepsis who also received blood filtration therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous haemofiltration (HF) 18 patients; continuous haemofiltration and plasmafiltration (PF) 9 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: 27 children with sepsis-induced MOSF, median age 26.6 months (range 0.33–185), median weight 12 kg (range 2.5–58), mean PRISM score 19.4 (SD 8.6), mean number of organs failing 2.78 (SD 0.9) received filtration for a median duration of 36 hours (range 2–145). Eight (30%) survived (HF5/18, PF3/9). There was no significant difference in the demographic features between the HF group and the PF group and no difference in mortality. The two groups were pooled to assess the effect of commencement of filtration on clinical wellbeing. Arterial blood gases, electrolytes, full blood examination, ventilator settings and doses of inotropes were recorded immediately prior to commencement of filtration and 18 h after commencement. Serum anion gap and osmolality were calculated using conventional formulae. There were no significant changes in the level of cardiorespiratory support, or biochemical markers of severity following commencement of filtration. Platelet count fell 32% (p=0.029) but no bleeding was encountered. No severe complications were observed during 1222 h of filtration. No bleeding or infection was observed at the site of cannulation.

Two closely but biologically distinct variants have been described. HHV-6 variant B causes the common childhood disease exhanthem subitum, and although the pathologic characteristics for HHV-6 variant A are less well defined, HHV-6A has been suggested to be more neurotropic. We studied the effect of both HHV-6 variants in an oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3.13). Infection of M03.13 was monitored by cytopathic effect (CPE), quantitative TaqMan PCR for viral DNA in cells and supernatant, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) to detect viral protein expression. HHV-6A infection induced significantly more CPE than infection with HHV-6B. HHV-6B induced an abortive infection associated with a decrease of the initial viral DNA load over time, early RNA expression, and no expression of viral antigen. In contrast, infection with HHV-6A DNA persisted in cells for at least 62 days. During the acute phase of infection with HHV-6A, intracellular and extracellular viral load increased and cells expressed the viral protein IE-2 and gp116/54/64. No HHV-6A RNA or protein was expressed after 30 days post infection, suggesting that HHV-6A formed a latent infection. These studies provide in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes. Our results suggest that HHV-6A and HHV-6B have different tropism in MO3.13 cells and that an initially active HHV-6A infection can develop latency. Differences between HHV-6A and -6B infection in different neural cell types may be associated with different neurological diseases.","Ahlqvist, Jenny; Fotheringham, Julie; Akhyani, Nahid; Yao, Karen; Fogdell-Hahn, Anna; Jacobson, Steven",J Neurovirol,123,12
5813,5813,5813,What’s new in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the critically ill,19.50816,11.208494,2014-03-20,"PURPOSE: Antithrombin III (AT III) is an anticoagulant with anti-inflammatory properties. We assessed the benefits and harms of AT III in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched from inception to 27 August 2015 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAB, BIOSIS and CINAHL. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published or language. RESULTS: We included 30 RCTs with a total of 3933 participants. The majority of included trials were at high risk of bias. Combining all trials, regardless of bias, showed no statistically significant effect of AT III on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.88–1.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 29 trials, 3882 participants). Among those with severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), AT III showed no impact on mortality (RR 0.95, 95 % Cl 0.88–1.03, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 12 trials, 2858 participants). We carried out multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the benefits and harms of AT III and to examine the impact of risk of bias. AT III significantly increased bleeding events (RR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.35–1.84, I (2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, 11 trials, 3019 participants). However, for all other outcome measures and analyses, the results did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support AT III substitution in any category of critically ill participants including those with sepsis and DIC.

5821,5821,5821,Early steroid therapy for patients with H1N1 influenza A virus infection,19.332447,10.895721,2011-06-21,"INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common cause of nosocomial infection, and is related to significant utilization of health-care resources. In the past decade, new data have emerged about VAP epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. RESULTS: Classifying VAP strictly based on time since hospitalization (early- and late-onset VAP) can potentially result in undertreatment of drug-resistant organisms in ICUs with a high rate of drug resistance, and overtreatment for patients not infected with resistant pathogens. A combined strategy incorporating diagnostic scoring systems, such as the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and either a quantitative or qualitative microbiological specimen, plus serial measurement of biomarkers, leads to responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The newly proposed ventilator-associated events (VAE) surveillance definition, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing VAP and the ability to prevent VAE is uncertain, making it a questionable surrogate for the quality of ICU care. The use of adjunctive aerosolized antibiotic treatment can provide high pulmonary concentrations of the drug and may facilitate shorter durations of therapy for multi-drug-resistant pathogens. A group of preventive strategies grouped as a ‘ventilator bundle’ can decrease VAP rates, but not to zero, and several recent studies show that there are potential barriers to implementation of these prevention strategies. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality related to VAP remain high and, in the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis, suspected VAP patients should be started on antibiotics based on recommendations per the 2005 ATS guidelines and knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Using a combination of clinical severity scores, biomarkers, and cultures might help with reducing the duration of therapy and achieving antibiotic de-escalation.","Nair, Girish B.; Niederman, Michael S.",Intensive Care Med,123,12

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AKI was defined as risk, injury or failure, according to the RIFLE classification. Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring on intensive care unit (ICU) day 2 or before, or after ICU day 2, respectively. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, AKI developed in 43 patients (51%). Twenty (24%) needed renal replacement therapy. Early and late AKI were found in 28 (33%) and 15 (18%) patients, respectively. Patients with AKI, as compared with patients without AKI, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and ICU mortality (72% versus 39%, p < 0.01) and presented on admission more marked cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematological dysfunction. Patients with early but not late AKI presented on admission higher APACHE II score and more marked organ dysfunction, as compared with patients without AKI. ICU mortality was higher in late versus early AKI (93% versus 61%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, only APACHE II score and late but not early AKI [odds ratio (OR) 1.1 (95% confidence interval 1.0–1.1) and 15.1 (1.8–130.7), respectively] were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is a frequent complication of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viral pneumonia. AKI developing after 2 days in ICU appears to be associated with different risk factors than early AKI, and is related to a higher mortality rate.","Nin, N.; Lorente, J.

In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2,3,4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.

Subperiosteal bone formation and generalized osteosclerosis are the most common radiological findings. Here we present a new case with RS. A 9-month-old male patient on a home-type ventilator was referred for hypophosphatemia. He was born with a weight of 3800 g to non-consanguineous parents. Prenatal ultrasound had demonstrated nasal bone agenesis. A large anterior fontanel, frontal bossing, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose, high arched palate, low set ears, triangular mouth, and corneal opacification were detected on physical examination. Serial skeletal X-rays revealed diffuse osteosclerosis at birth which was gradually decreased by the age of 5 months with subperiosteal undermineralized bone formation and medullary space of long bone could be distinguishable with bone-within-a-bone appearance. At 9 months of age, hand X-ray revealed cupping of the ulna with loose radial bone margin with minimal fraying and osteopenia. Cranial computed tomography scan showed bilateral periventricular calcification and hydrocephalus in progress. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological examinations were consistent with RS. Molecular analyses revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in FAM20C gene (a known pathogenic mutation, c.1645C > T, p.Arg549Trp; and a novel c.863 + 5 G > C variant). The patient died due to respiratory failure at 17 months of age. This case allowed us to demonstrate natural progression of skeletal features in RS. Furthermore, we have described a novel FAM20C variant causing RS. Previous literature on RS is also reviewed.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of ST compared with an external fixator (EF) on respiratory complications and mechanical ventilation requirements in patients with severe trauma with a femoral shaft fracture managed by DCO strategy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with severe trauma patients with a unilateral femoral shaft fracture admitted to our institution from 2010 to 2015. Patients who did not undergo definitive osteosynthesis during the first 24 h were included and divided into two groups: DCO-ST group and DCO-EF group. In addition to trauma severity, global management of respiratory complications, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation requirements and outcome were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were managed with DCO strategy (mean Injury Severity Score, 28.4); there were 31 in the DCO-ST group and 24 in the DCO-EF group. No significant difference in terms of the main characteristics, initial severity and associated injuries was observed between the two groups. In contrast, ARDS was found more frequently in the DCO-ST group (81% versus 54%; P = 0.035). Number of ventilation days also tended to be higher in the DCO-ST group (9 days [IQR 3–15 days] versus 7 [IQR 2–16 days]; P = 0.24). No difference was found for mortality and hospitalization duration between the DCO-ST and DCO-EF groups. CONCLUSION: The prolonged use of an ST device in the present cohort was associated with a higher incidence of impaired respiratory function. Therefore, our findings suggest that EF is preferable to ST in the DCO setting for femoral shaft fracture, especially in trauma patients at high risk of developing delayed respiratory failure.","Maury, Camille; Ramin, Severin; Bonfils, Jordi; Dagneaux, Louis; Faure, Patrick; Canovas, François; Capdevila, Xavier; Charbit, Jonathan",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,123,12

METHODS: Prospective observational study in 86 neonates <32 weeks’ gestation. LISA was performed according to a standardized protocol without use of sedative premedication. Outcome measures were success rates of LISA attempts, reasons for failure and quality of technical conditions. In 37 neonates, heart rate and oxygen saturation levels from 20 min before until 30 min after start of LISA were collected. RESULTS: In 48% of LISAs the first attempt failed and in 34% quality of technical conditions was inadequate. The success rate was significantly correlated with quality of technical conditions and experience of the performer. Desaturations <80% occurred in 54% of patients while bradycardia <80/min did not occur.

Although research documents the benefits of CM in healthy populations, its use in the context of psychopathology is largely unexamined.

To this end, our research team developed and refined a manualized protocol, CBCT-Vet, over 4 sets of groups involving 36 Veterans. This protocol was delivered in 8–10 sessions, each lasting 90–120 min and led by a CBCT®-trained clinical psychologist. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to identify areas to be improved and to assess change that occurred during the treatment period. Based on pooled data from this series of groups, CM appears to be acceptable to Veterans with PTSD. Group participation was associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD (partial eta squared = .27) and depression (partial eta squared = .19), but causality should not be inferred given the nonrandomized design. No change was observed in additional outcomes, including positive emotion and social connectedness.

A retrospective observational cohort study including critically ill patients with respiratory tract infections during a 2-year period was conducted. Intervention group included patients that received nebulized and systemic antimicrobials. Patients in the control group received only systemic antimicrobials. Clinical resolution was the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included change in fever, inflammatory parameters, and creatinine clearance; length of hospital stay, systemic therapy, and mechanical ventilation; hospital readmission; and mortality. Regression models were performed to estimate the effect of nebulized antibiotics on outcome variables adjusted by potential confounders. A total of 136 patients were included (93 in control group and 43 in intervention group). The intervention group had higher odds of clinical resolution (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 7.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.2, 43.3). Nebulized antibiotic therapy was independently associated with reduction in procalcitonin (adjusted OR: 12.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 109.7).

Even though newly developed ICU severity scales have disease-specific properties, they still lack radiologic parameters, which is crucial for ICH. AIMS: To compare the performance of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), ICH, max-ICH, ICH functional outcome score (ICH-FOS), and Essen-ICH for prediction of in-hospital and one-year mortality of patients with ICH. METHODS: A single-center analysis of 137 patients with ICH was conducted over 5 years. The performance of scoring systems was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis. The independent predictors of one-year mortality were investigated with a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The SAPS-III score was calculated both in the emergency department (ED) and ICU. RESULTS: Among the independent variables, the need for mechanical ventilation, hematoma volume, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and hematoma originating from both lobar and nonlobar regions were found as the strongest predictor of one-year mortality. For in-hospital mortality, the discriminative power of SAPS-II, APACHE-IV, and LODS was excellent, and for SAPS-III-ICU and SAPS-III-ED, it was good. For one-year mortality, the discriminative power of SAPS-II, APACHE-IV, LODS, and SAPS-III-ICU was good, and for SAPS-III-ED, Essen-ICH, ICH, max-ICH, and ICH-FOS, it was fair. CONCLUSIONS: Although all three ICH-specific prognostic scales performed satisfactory results for predicting one-year mortality, the common intensive care severity scoring showed better performance.

However, uncertainty remained regarding the effect of AD itself and comorbidities (e.g., allergic diseases, cataract surgery) on RRD occurrence in a large, population-based paediatric population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the 12-year National Health Insurance Service database (2002–2013) covering the entire Korean population to estimate the association between AD and RRD in people aged under 20 years. RESULTS: We identified 3142 RRD patients, and matched 18,852 controls (six controls to each RRD patient); therefore, we included 21,994 peoples under aged 20 years in the analyses. AD was more prevalent in the RRD group (329 patients, 10.47%) than the control group (1043 patients, 5.53%; P < 0.001), and so were severe AD (153 patients [4.87%] and 223 patients [1.18%], respectively; P < 0.001). In conditional logistic regression analysis, AD was associated with RRD (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.93–1.87) even after adjusting for allergic conditions, connective tissue disease, uveitis, and cataract surgery. In addition, severity of AD was associated with an increased risk of RRD (OR for non-severe AD and severe AD, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05–1.51] and 2.88 [95% CI, 2.25–3.68]). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that AD itself is a risk factor of RRD in children by showing the association between AD and RRD occurrence and the biologic gradient even after adjustment for known confounders including allergic conditions, uveitis, and cataract surgery.","Choi, M.; Byun, S.

Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the major catabolic enzyme for the endocannabinoid anandamide, has been proposed as a key regulator of the amygdala-PFC circuit that subserves emotion regulation. We tested the hypothesis that FAAH levels measured with [(11)C]CURB positron emission tomography in amygdala and PFC would be elevated in BPD and would relate to hostility and aggression. Twenty BPD patients and 20 healthy controls underwent FAAH genotyping (rs324420) and scanning with [(11)C]CURB. BPD patients were medication-free and were not experiencing a current major depressive episode. Regional differences in [(11)C]CURB binding were assessed using multivariate analysis of covariance with PFC and amygdala [(11)C]CURB binding as dependent variables, diagnosis as a fixed factor, and sex and genotype as covariates. [(11)C]CURB binding was marginally elevated across the PFC and amygdala in BPD (p = 0.08). In a priori selected PFC, but not amygdala, [(11)C]CURB binding was significantly higher in BPD (11.0%, p = 0.035 versus 10.6%, p = 0.29). PFC and amygdala [(11)C]CURB binding was positively correlated with measures of hostility in BPD (r > 0.4; p < 0.04). This study is the first to provide preliminary evidence of elevated PFC FAAH binding in any psychiatric condition. Findings are consistent with the model that lower endocannabinoid tone could perturb PFC circuitry that regulates emotion and aggression. Replication of these findings could encourage testing of FAAH inhibitors as innovative treatments for BPD.","Kolla, N. J.; Mizrahi, R.; Karas, K.; Wang, C.; Bagby, R. M.; McMain, S.; Simpson, A.

The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the main forms of stroke-induced distal organ damage, providing new pathophysiological insights and recommendations for clinical management. Non-neurological complications of stroke can affect outcomes, with potential for serious short-term and long-term consequences. Many of these complications can be prevented; when prevention is not feasible, early detection and proper management can still be effective in mitigating their adverse impact. The general care of stroke survivors entails not only treatment in the acute setting but also prevention of secondary complications that might hinder functional recovery. Acute ischaemic stroke triggers a cascade of events—including local and systemic activation of the immune system—which results in a number of systemic consequences and, ultimately, may cause organ failure. Understanding the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of non-neurological complications is a crucial component in the proper treatment of patients with acute stroke. Little evidence-based data is available to guide management of these complications. There is a clear need for improved surveillance and specific interventions for the prevention, early diagnosis, and proper management of non-neurological complications during the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, which should reduce morbidity and mortality.","Robba, Chiara; Battaglini, Denise; Samary, Cynthia S.; Silva, Pedro L.; Ball, Lorenzo; Rocco, Patricia R.

The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has demonstrated promise as a novel therapy for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Several medical conditions have been treated using bispecific or multi-specific antibodies that recognize two or more distinct epitopes simultaneously. However, bispecific or multi-specific antibodies often encounter protein expression and product stability problems. In this study, we developed an IgG-like bispecific antibody (E18-F1) comprising two anti-EVA71 antibodies: E18 mAb and llama-derived F1 single-domain antibody. E18-F1 was demonstrated to exhibit superior binding affinity and antiviral activity compared with E18 or F1. Additionally, E18-F1 not only improved survival rate, but also reduced clinical signs in human SCARB2 receptor (hSCARB2) transgenic mice challenged with a lethal dose of EVA71. Altogether, our results reveal that E18-F1 is a simple format bispecific antibody with promising antiviral activity for EVA71.","Wang, Hsiang-Ching; Hung, Hui-Chen; Huang, Peng-Nien; Kung, Yu-An; Tseng, Sung-Nien; Wang, Yun-Ming; Shih, Shin-Ru; Tsu-An Hsu, John",Biochem Biophys Rep,123,12

Relationships between HFI and nutrition, physical growth, and development have been elucidated; less is known about the non-nutritional impacts among individuals living in rural areas in low-income countries. The aim of this study was to determine if HFI is a risk factor for suboptimal mental health and overall health in rural Honduras. In a population of 24,696 adults with 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we collected data on household food insecurity and physical and mental health outcome measures. Using logistic regression with and without adjusting for village and household level unobservables invariant across individual respondents, we show that females (OR: 1.11, p <0.01)), indigenous people (OR: 2:00, p < 0.01), and those planning to migrate (OR: 1.24, p <0.01) have higher odds of experiencing food insecurity. The risks of food insecurity and poor health were mitigated among respondents living where they were born and having multi-generations of relatives living in the same village—a measure of the opportunity and availability of social networks. Living in a food insecure compared to a food secure household was associated with 77 percent higher odds of being depressed, 35 percent higher odds of low overall mental health, and 20 percent higher odds for low overall health.","Kumar, Sanjeev; Christakis, Nicholas A.; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael",SSM Popul Health,123,12

This study investigated the association between NLR and HZ in 1688 patients who underwent LDLT between January 2010 and July 2020 and evaluated risk factors for HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The predictive power of NLR was assessed through the concordance index and an integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis. Of the total cohort, 138 (8.2%) had HZ. The incidence of HZ after LT was 11.2 per 1000 person-years and 0.1%, 1.3%, 2.9%, and 13.5% at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In the Cox regression analysis, preoperative NLR was significantly associated with HZ (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.09; p = 0.005) and PHN (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13; p = 0.001). Age, sex, mycophenolate mofetil use, and hepatitis B virus infection were risk factors for HZ versus age and sex for PHN. In the IDI analysis, NLR was discriminative for HZ and PHN (p = 0.020 and p = 0.047, respectively).

This stage can be reversible with appropriate lifestyle and dietary modifications. Existing solutions are mostly developed to deal with T2D instead of preventing it in the first place. In this study, we propose a framework to aid in the development of self-care systems to prevent T2D, which integrates behavioral change theories and techniques and offers features, such as goal setting, activity planning, and health monitoring. We then assessed the feasibility of a prediabetes self-care system designed based on the proposed framework. Quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted in evaluating i-PreventDiabetes, a prototype. Numerous aspects of the prototype were evaluated, including (1) its effectiveness in assisting individuals with prediabetes in improving their health management behaviors, (2) its effect on users’ attitudes toward diabetes prevention, (3) users’ motivation levels, (4) user acceptability of the system, and (5) user experience. Users viewed i-PreventDiabetes positively and experienced a positive change in their attitude toward their health.

Because many diseases are related to genes, the genes associated with CNV need to be identified. In this study, we proposed a network-based approach for identifying novel CNV-associated genes. To execute such method, we first employed a protein-protein interaction network reported in STRING. Then, we applied a network diffusion algorithm, Laplacian heat diffusion, on this network by selecting validated CNV-related genes as the seed nodes. As a result, some novel genes that had unknown but strong relationships with validated genes were identified. Furthermore, we used a screening procedure to extract the most essential genes. Eleven latent CNV-related genes were finally obtained.

We estimated etiology for each child in 2 Bangladesh sites that represent rural and urban South Asian settings with moderate child mortality. METHODS: As part of the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study, we enrolled children 1–59 months of age with World Health Organization–defined severe and very severe pneumonia, plus age-frequency-matched controls, in Matlab and Dhaka, Bangladesh. We applied microbiologic methods to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, blood, induced sputum, gastric and lung aspirates. Etiology was estimated using Bayesian methods that integrated case and control data and accounted for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the measurements. RESULTS: We enrolled 525 cases and 772 controls over 24 months. Of the cases, 9.1% had very severe pneumonia and 42.0% (N = 219) had infiltrates on chest radiograph. Three cases (1.5%) had positive blood cultures (2 Salmonella typhi, 1 Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). All 4 lung aspirates were negative. The etiology among chest radiograph–positive cases was predominantly viral [77.7%, 95% credible interval (CrI): 65.3–88.6], primarily respiratory syncytial virus (31.2%, 95% CrI: 24.7–39.3). Influenza virus had very low estimated etiology (0.6%, 95% CrI: 0.0–2.3). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (3.6%, 95% CrI: 0.5–11.0), Enterobacteriaceae (3.0%, 95% CrI: 0.5–10.0) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%, 95% CrI: 0.0–5.9) were the only nonviral pathogens in the top 10 etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood severe and very severe pneumonia in young children in Bangladesh is predominantly viral, notably respiratory syncytial virus.","Brooks, W.

Participants expressed that Play Streets provided more than just PA; they provided opportunities to access and share resources, build perceptions of safety and trust in the community, and develop relationships with others. Fostering community connection through Play Streets may reduce health inequities in rural communities by building community resilience. Community-based PA programming that enhance and capitalize on community connectedness could be effective ways to improving the overall health and wellbeing of residents.","Umstattd Meyer, M.

At the end of the pregnancy, the concentration of maternal antibodies is higher in the cord blood, than in the maternal circulation. Simultaneously, the immune system of the fetus begins to work and from the second trimester, fetal IgM is produced by the fetal immune system specific to microorganisms and antigens passing the maternal-fetal barrier. The same time the fetal immune system has to cope and develop tolerance and T(REG) cells to the maternal microchimeric cells, latent virus-carrier maternal cells and microorganisms transported through the maternal-fetal barrier. The maternal phenotypic inheritance may hide risks for the newborn, too. Antibody mediated enhancement results in dengue shock syndrome in the first 8 month of age of the baby. A series of pathologic maternal antibodies may elicit neonatal illnesses upon birth usually recovering during the first months of the life of the offspring. Certain antibodies, however, may impair the fetal or neonatal tissues or organs resulting prolonged recovery or initiating prolonged pathological processes of the children. The importance of maternal anti-idiotypic antibodies are believed to prime the fetal immune system with epitopes of etiologic agents infected the mother during her whole life before pregnancy and delivery.

Numerous viruses are also pathogenic to animals and plants, and many of them, mutating, become pathogenic also to humans. Several cases of affecting humans by originally animal viruses have been confirmed. Viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans, the increase of which is caused by general immunosuppression of the world population, changes in climate, and overall globalization. In spite of the fact that the pharmaceutical industry pays great attention to human viral infections, many of clinically used antivirals demonstrate also increased toxicity against human cells, limited bioavailability, and thus, not entirely suitable therapeutic profile. In addition, due to resistance, a combination of antivirals is needed for life-threatening infections. Thus, the development of new antiviral agents is of great importance for the control of virus spread. On the other hand, the discovery and development of structurally new antivirals represent risks.

Trying to understand the disease mechanisms and finding the remedial measures have been the quest of humankind. The susceptibility to disease of an individual in a given population is determined by ones genetic buildup. Response to treatment and the disease prognosis also depends upon individual’s genetic predisposition. The environmental stress induces mutations and is leading to the emergence of ever-increasing more dreaded infectious pathogens, and now we are in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance that has thrown up a challenge to find new treatment regimes. Discoveries in the science of high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have shown new hope and are bringing a revolution in human health. The information gained from sequencing of both human and pathogen genomes is a way forward in deciphering host-pathogen interactions. Deciphering the pathogen virulence factors, host susceptibility genes, and the molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of disease has paved the way for discovery of new molecular targets for drugs, diagnostic markers, and vaccines. The genomic diversity in the human population leads to differences in host responses to drugs and vaccines and is the cause of poor response to treatment as well as adverse reactions. The study of pharmacogenomics of infectious diseases is still at an early stage of development, and many intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction are yet to be understood in full measure. However, progress has been made over the decades of research in some of the important infectious diseases revealing how the host genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect the bioavailability of the drugs which further determine the efficacy and toxicology of the drugs used for treatment. Further, the field of structural biology and chemistry has intertwined to give rise to medical structural genomics leading the way to the discovery of new drug targets against infectious diseases.

The Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and its homologs in human and mouse represent an important C-type lectin family. DC-SIGN contains a lectin domain that recognizes in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner carbohydrates such as mannose-containing structures present on glycoproteins such as ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. DC-SIGN is a prototype C-type lectin organized in microdomains, which have their role as pathogen recognition receptors in sensing microbes. Although the integrin LFA-1 is a counter-receptor for both ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 on DC, DC-SIGN is the high affinity adhesion receptor for ICAM-2/-3. While cell–cell contact is a primary function of selectins, collectins are specialized in recognition of pathogens. Interestingly, DC-SIGN is a cell adhesion receptor as well as a pathogen recognition receptor. As adhesion receptor, DC-SIGN mediates the contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes, by binding to ICAM-3, and mediates rolling of DCs on endothelium, by interacting with ICAM-2. As pathogen receptor, DC-SIGN recognizes a variety of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and several parasites (Cambi et al. 2005). The natural ligands of DC-SIGN consist of mannose oligosaccharides or fucose-containing Lewis-type determinants. In this chapter, we shall focus on the structure and functions of DC-SIGN and related CTLDs in the recognition of pathogens, the molecular and structural determinants that regulate the interaction with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The heterogeneity of carbohydrate residues exposed on cellular proteins and pathogens regulates specific binding of DC-expressed C-type lectins that contribute to the diversity of immune responses created by DCs (van Kooyk et al. 2003a; Cambi et al. 2005).","Gupta, Rajesh K.; Gupta, G.

When diagnostic efforts and/or empiric treatment fails, thoracic surgeons have traditionally been called upon to perform surgical biopsy of the lung to aid in the diagnosis of indeterminate, life-threatening pulmonary disease. Such biopsy has been requested specifically in the case of diffuse lung disease among patients receiving treatment for solid-organ or hematologic cancers, particularly when symptoms of respiratory failure progress and when noninvasive diagnostic tests and empiric treatments fail to halt progression. In such circumstances, radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons may be consulted and asked to provide tissue specimens that will allow rapid, accurate diagnosis leading to specific treatment.

At the same time, we know that public opinion tends to become polarized on highly salient issues, except when political elites are in consensus (Berinsky, 2009; Zaller, 1992). Avoiding elite and public polarization is thus essential for an effective societal response to the pandemic. In the United States, there appears to be elite and public polarization on the severity of the pandemic (Gadarian et al., 2020). Other evidence suggests that polarization is undermining compliance with social distancing (Cornelson and Miloucheva, 2020).

Node classification, as well as community detection tasks, are still open research problems in SNA. Hence, SNA has become an interesting and appealing domain in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Immanent facts about social network structures can be effectively harnessed for training AI models in a bid to solve node classification and community detection problems in SNA. Hence, crucial aspects such as the individual attributes of spatial social actors, and the underlying patterns of relationship binding these social actors must be taken into consideration in the course of analyzing the social network. These factors determine the nature and dynamics of a given social network. In this paper, we have proposed a unique framework, Representation Learning via Knowledge-Graph Embeddings and ConvNet (RLVECN), for studying and extracting meaningful facts from social network structures to aid in node classification as well as community detection tasks. Our proposition utilizes an edge sampling approach for exploiting features of the social graph, via learning the context of each actor with respect to neighboring actors/nodes, with the goal of generating vector-space embedding per actor. Successively, these relatively low-dimensional vector embeddings are fed as input features to a downstream classifier for classification tasks about the social graph/network. Herein RLVECN has been trained, tested, and evaluated on real-world social networks.","Molokwu, Bonaventure C.; Shuvo, Shaon Bhatta; Kar, Narayan C.; Kobti, Ziad",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,123,12

In this paper, we describe a new strategy for controlling the amount of reasoning with explicit theory axioms. The strategy refines a recently proposed two-layer-queue clause selection and combines it with a heuristic measure of the amount of theory reasoning in the derivation of a clause. We implemented the new strategy in the automatic theorem prover Vampire and present an evaluation showing that our work dramatically improves the state-of-the-art clause-selection strategy in the presence of theory axioms.","Gleiss, Bernhard; Suda, Martin",Automated Reasoning,123,19

However, it has been demonstrated that bacterial biofilm can also be formed on the external surface of ETTs. Our objective was to test in vitro the efficacy of selective digestive decontamination solution (SDDs) onto ETT to prevent biofilm formation and eradicate preformed biofilms of three different microorganisms of VAP. METHODS: We used an in vitro model in which we applied, at the subglottic space of ETT, biofilms of either P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, or E. coli ATCC 25922, or S. aureus ATCC 29213, and the SDDs at the same time (prophylaxis) or after 72 h of biofilm forming (treatment). ETT were incubated during 5 days with a regimen of 2 h-locks. ETT fragments were analyzed by sonication and confocal laser scanning microscopy to calculate the percentage reduction of cfu and viable cells, respectively. RESULTS: Median (IQR) percentage reduction of live cells and cfu/ml counts after treatment were, respectively, 53.2% (39.4%—64.1%) and 100% (100%–100.0%) for P. aeruginosa, and 67.9% (46.7%–78.7%) and 100% (100%–100.0%) for E. coli. S. aureus presented a complete eradication by both methods. After prophylaxis, there were absence of live cells and cfu/ml counts for all microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: SDDs used as “lock therapy” in the subglottic space is a promising prophylactic approach that could be used in combination with the oro-digestive decontamination procedure in the prevention of VAP.","Pérez-Granda, María Jesús; Alonso, Beatriz; Zavala, Ricardo; Latorre, María Consuelo; Hortal, Javier; Samaniego, Rafael; Bouza, Emilio; Muñoz, Patricia; Guembe, María",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,123,22

Attempts in this area tend to develop new forms to make their applications more convenient and wider. Here, we propose a novel Chinese herb microneedle (CHMN) patch by integrating the herbal extracts, Premna microphylla and Centella asiatica, with microstructure of microneedle for wound healing. Such path is composed of sap extracted from the herbal leaves via traditional kneading method and solidified by plant ash derived from the brine induced process of tofu in a well-designed mold. Because the leaves of the Premna microphylla are rich in pectin and various amino acids, the CHMN could be imparted with medicinal efficacy of heat clearing, detoxicating, detumescence and hemostatic. Besides, with the excellent pharmaceutical activity of Asiatic acid extracted from Centella asiatica, the CHMN is potential in promoting relevant growth factor genes expression in fibroblasts and showing excellent performance in anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity. Taking advantages of these pure herbal compositions, we have demonstrated that the derived CHMN was with dramatical achievement in anti-bacteria, inhibiting inflammatory, collagen deposition, angiogenesis and tissue reconstruction during the wound closure. These results indicate that the integration of traditional Chinese herbs with progressive technologies will facilitate the development and promotion of traditional Chinese medicine in modern society.","Chi, Junjie; Sun, Lingyu; Cai, Lijun; Fan, Lu; Shao, Changmin; Shang, Luoran; Zhao, Yuanjin",Bioact Mater,123,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all participants provided informed consent. The study included 152 consecutive patients with 173 breast lesions diagnosed on MG or CESM. All MG examinations and consults were conducted in one oncology centre. Non-ionic contrast agent, at a total dose of 1.5 mL/kg body weight, was injected intravenous. Subsequently, CESM exams were performed with a mammography device, allowing dual-energy acquisitions. The entire procedure was done within the oncology centre. Images from low and high energy exposures were processed together and the combination provided an ""iodine"" image which outlined contrast up-take in the breast. RESULTS MG detected 157 lesions in 150 patients, including 92 infiltrating cancers, 12 non-infiltrating cancers, and 53 benign lesions. CESM detected 149 lesions in 128 patients, including 101 infiltrating cancers, 13 non-infiltrating cancers, and 35 benign lesions. CESM sensitivity was 100% (vs. 91% for MG), specificity was 41% (vs. 15% for MG), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.86 (vs. 0.67 for MG), and accuracy was 80% (vs. 65% for MG) for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Both MG and CESM overestimated lesion sizes compared to histopathology (p < 0.001).

METHODS We pretreated bone marrow-derived MSCs with ascorbic acid and the FDA-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and then transplanted the MSCs into full-thickness cartilage defects in the distal femurs of Göttingen minipigs. Untreated cartilage defects served as negative controls. We evaluated the cartilage repair site with magnetic resonance imaging at 4 and 12 weeks after MSC implantation, followed by histological examination and immunofluorescence staining at 12 weeks. RESULTS Ascorbic acid plus iron-pretreated MSCs demonstrated a significantly better MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score (73.8 ± 15.5), better macroscopic cartilage regeneration score according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (8.6 ± 2.0), better Pineda score (2.9 ± 0.8), and larger amount of collagen type II (28,469 ± 21,313) compared with untreated controls (41.3 ± 2.5, 1.8 ± 2.9, 12.8 ± 1.9, and 905 ± 1326, respectively). The obtained scores were also better than scores previously reported in the same animal model for MSC implants without ascorbic acid. CONCLUSION Pretreatment of MSCs with ascorbic acid and an FDA-approved iron supplement improved the chondrogenesis of MSCs and led to hyaline-like cartilage regeneration in the knee joints of minipigs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Ascorbic acid and iron supplements are immediately clinically applicable. Thus, these results, in principle, could be translated into clinical applications.","Theruvath, Ashok Joseph; Mahmoud, Elhussein Elbadry; Wu, Wei; Nejadnik, Hossein; Kiru, Louise; Liang, Tie; Felt, Stephen; Daldrup-Link, Heike Elisabeth",The American journal of sports medicine,123,1

However, the existence of this relationship has never been tested. METHODS After two sessions to measure peak [Formula: see text], peak power output (POpeak), and [Formula: see text] kinetics responses in the unfatigued state (τ [Formula: see text] MOD), 10 healthy young adults performed a 6-min cycling bout at 80% POpeak (INT6-min). [Formula: see text] kinetics responses were also measured during INT6-min. Neuromuscular fatigue was measured isometrically pre- and post-INT6-min (immediately post- and 15-s post-INT6-min) with an innovative cycle ergometer. RESULTS Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force, high-frequency doublet amplitude, and the ratio of low- to high-frequency doublet amplitudes decreased by 34 ± 7, 43 ± 11, and 31 ± 13%, respectively (all P < 0.01). A significant Spearman's rank correlation was observed between the change in low-frequency doublet force (ΔDb10) immediately after INT6-min and both τ [Formula: see text] MOD and τ [Formula: see text] INT6-min (ρ = -0.68 and ρ = -0.67, both P < 0.05). When considering the largest responses from the two neuromuscular evaluations post-INT6-min, significant correlations were also found between τ [Formula: see text] MOD and ΔDb10 (ρ = -0.74; P < 0.05) and between τ[Formula: see text] INT6-min and both ΔDb10 and low-frequency fatigue (ρ = -0.70 and ρ = -0.66; both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The present results suggest that subjects with slow [Formula: see text] kinetics experience more peripheral fatigue, in particular more excitation-contraction coupling failure, likely due to a greater accumulation of protons and/or inorganic phosphates.","Temesi, John; Mattioni Maturana, Felipe; Peyrard, Arthur; Piucco, Tatiane; Murias, Juan M; Millet, Guillaume Y",European journal of applied physiology,123,31

80707,80707,80707,Videolaryngoscopy in critically ill patients.,19.094685,10.945011,2019,"OBJECTIVES Many hospitals recently instituted policies mandating preoperative COVID-19 testing. However, it is uncertain whether institutions can dictate such policies based on infection rates found in the general population. Therefore, the main aims of the study were to determine (1) what proportion of preoperative patients tested positive, (2) what percentage were asymptomatic, and (3) whether variations throughout time in numbers of positive patients reflected changes observed in our state. METHODS All COVID-19 preoperative screening tests (nasopharyngeal-swab RT-PCR testing) performed in our hospital between 04/13/2020 and 08/27/2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The unit of analysis was number of patients who tested negative/positive. Medical records of positive patients were reviewed to determine presence of COVID-19 symptoms. A curve was created showing our number of positive patients per week and another one presenting the number of positive patients per day in Florida, both figures were compared. RESULTS A total of 7,213 patients from all specialties were preoperatively tested out of which 85 were positive for an overall infection rate of 1.2%. In 18% (15/85) of positive patients, it was not possible to determine symptomatology. Among remaining patients, 49% (34/70) were asymptomatic while 51% (36/70) were symptomatic for COVID-19. Peak of positive cases occurred on mid-July in both curves, the upward and downward tendencies in positive numbers mirrored each other. CONCLUSION COVID-19 infection rate among our preoperative patients was very low. Nearly 50% of positive patients were asymptomatic. Our data suggests that a tertiary hospital can promulgate COVID-19 preoperative screening policies based on infection trends observed in the general population. However, in addition to the test, patients should be encouraged to self-quarantine for 14 days before surgery.","Villa, Jesus M; Pannu, Tejbir S; McWilliams, Carla; Kizer, Chandra; Rosenthal, Raul J; Higuera, Carlos A; Patel, Preetesh D",Hospital practice,123,1

Unfortunately, revisional surgery is required in 20-30% of cases. Data comparing revisional and primary gastric bypass procedures are scarce. This study compared revisional malabsorptive laparoscopic very very long limb (VVLL) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with primary VVLL RYGB and tested the hypothesis that one-stage revisional laparoscopic VVLL RYGB is an effective procedure after failed LAGB. METHODS In this study, 48 revisional VVLL RYGBs were matched one-to-one with 48 primary VVLL RYGBs. The outcome measures were operating time, conversion to open surgery, excess weight loss (EWL), and early and late morbidity. RESULTS Surgical and medical morbidities did not differ significantly. No conversions occurred. The revisional group showed an EWL of 41.8% after 12 months of follow-up evaluation and 45.1% after 24 months based on the pre-revisional weight. The total EWL based on the weight before the LAGB was calculated to be 54.3% after 12 months and 57.2% after 24 months. The EWL in the primary RYGB group was significantly higher for both types of calculation: 41.8%/54.3% versus 64.1 % (p < 0.001 and <0.01) after 12 months and 45.1%/57.2% versus 70.4% (p < 0.001 and <0.002) after 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Revisional laproscopic VVLL RYGB can be performed as a one-stage procedure by experienced bariatric surgeons but shows less effective EWL than primary RYGB procedures.","Delko, Tarik; Köstler, Thomas; Peev, Miroslav; Esterman, Adrian; Oertli, Daniel; Zingg, Urs",Surgical endoscopy,123,1

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a cornerstone of clinical effectiveness. An EBP capacity-building project commenced in Ireland in 2016, in collaboration with the Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford. A key part of this project, reported here, was the development of a competency framework for education in EBP and clinical effectiveness to ensure responsiveness of education standards and curricula of healthcare professionals in this area. METHODS Following a review of national and international reports, professional guidance documents and empirical literature pertaining to clinical effectiveness education (CEE), a preliminary competency framework was developed.

Colorectal cancer surgery can lead to metastatic disease due to release of disseminated tumor cells and the induction of surgical stress response. To explore the overall effects on surgically-induced changes in serum composition, in vitro model systems are useful. Methods A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed to identify studies describing in vitro models used to investigate cancer cell growth/proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion and cell death of serum taken pre- and postoperatively from patients undergoing colorectal tumor resection. Results Two authors (MG and TK) independently reviewed 984 studies and identified five studies, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were solved by discussion. All studies investigated cell proliferation and cell invasion, whereas three studies investigated cell migration, and only one study investigated cell death/apoptosis. One study investigated postoperative peritoneal infection due to anastomotic leak, one study investigated mode of anesthesia (general anesthesia with volatile or intravenous anesthetics), and one study investigated preoperative intervention with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF). In all studies an increased proliferation, cell migration and invasion was demonstrated after surgery. Anesthetics with propofol and intervention with GMCSF significantly reduced postoperative cell proliferation, whereas peritoneal infection enhanced the invasive capability of tumor cells. Conclusion This study suggests that in vitro cell models are useful and reliable tools to explore the effect of surgery on colorectal cancer cell proliferation and metastatic ability. The models should therefore be considered as additional tests to investigate the effects of perioperative interventions.","Kirkegaard, Tove; Gögenur, Mikail; Gögenur, Ismail",PeerJ,123,24

METHODS We screened 6969 patients who had organ transplantations in our center for COVID-19. Specific data on presentation, clinical course, treatment and prognosis was acquired. RESULTS We found 85 patients (66 liver, 16 kidney, 2 kidney-pancreas and 1 liver-kidney recipient) who acquired COVID-19. Most common symptoms included fever (48.2%), cough (41.2%), myalgia (41.2%), and fatigue (40%). Dyspnea developed in 33% of patients. Overall, one-third of patients had an oxygen saturation of bellow 90% on admission. Patients were hospitalized for a median (IQR) of 9 (5, 13.7) days and had a 33.9% ICU admission rate. Overall, 17 patients (20%) died which included 31.3% of patients with kidney transplantations and 21.9% of patients with liver transplantations.All 4 pediatric patients in our series died. In our univariate analysis among adults, rates of leukopenia (38.4% vs. 13.2%; p=0.04), low albumin levels (53.8% vs. 10.2%; p=0.001), and shorter duration between transplantation and COVID-19 (p=0.02), were higher among patients who died.In our LASSO regression model, low albumin levels (OR: 4.48, 95% CI= 1.16-17.27) were associated with higher risk of death.

Prior studies of telehealth clinical swallowing evaluations provide positive evidence for telemanagement of swallowing. However, the reliability of these measures in clinical practice, as opposed to well-controlled research conditions, remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of outcome measures derived from clinical swallowing tele-evaluations in real-world clinical practice (e.g., variability in devices and Internet connectivity, lack of in-person clinician assistance, or remote patient/caregiver training). Method Seven raters asynchronously judged clinical swallowing tele-evaluations of 12 movement disorders patients. Outcomes included the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST), Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS), and common observations of oral intake. Statistical analyses were performed to examine inter- and intrarater reliability, as well as qualitative analyses exploring patient and clinician-specific factors impacting reliability. Results Forty-four trials were included for reliability analyses. All rater dyads demonstrated ""good"" to ""excellent"" interrater reliability for measures of the TWST (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs] ≥ .93) and observations of oral intake (≥ 77% agreement). The majority of TOMASS outcomes demonstrated ""good"" to ""excellent"" interrater reliability (ICCs ≥ .84), with the exception of the number of bites (ICCs = .43-.99) and swallows (ICCs = .21-.85). Immediate and delayed intrarater reliability were ""excellent"" for most raters across all tasks, ranging between ICCs of .63 and 1.00. Exploratory factors potentially impacting reliability included infrequent instances of suboptimal video quality, reduced camera stability, camera distance, and obstruction of the patient's mouth during tasks. Conclusions Subjective observations of oral intake and objective measures taken from the TWST and the TOMASS can be reliably measured via telehealth in clinical practice. Our results provide support for the feasibility and reliability of telehealth for outpatient clinical swallowing evaluations during COVID-19 and beyond.

Currently, since the management of BPFs is difficult to assess, the best therapeutic approach is prevention. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on the healing of the bronchial stump in an experimental animal model. METHODS Left pneumonectomy was performed in 37 Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 13), an ASC group (n = 12), and an ASC plus Tissucol(®) group (ASCT) (n = 12). The ASCs and ASCTs were locally administered at the bronchial stump after surgical pneumonectomy. Animals were killed at 10 and 20 days. We analyzed histological changes and changes in the expression of relevant genes involved in wound repair in the bronchial stump. RESULTS Two control animals, one animal from the ASC group, and one from the ASCT group died from early BPF. All the remaining animals had an adequate postoperative outcome. ASCs and ASCTs significantly decreased the necrosis and ulcerations of the bronchial stump at 10 and 20 days. ASCs significantly decreased mRNA expression of Igf1 at 10 days and Igf1, Tgfb1, Vegfa, and Col2a1 at 20 days, whereas there was increased expression of Agc1 and Col2a1 at 10 days and Sox6 at 20 days. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that local ASCs protected the bronchial stump after pneumonectomy and induced local changes in gene expression related to their protective action. These results could lead to a potential new therapeutic modality for the prevention of BPF.","Llontop, Pedro; Santana-Rodríguez, Norberto; Clavo, Bernardino; Quintana, Ardiel; Fiuza, María D; Camacho, Rafael; Santana-Rodríguez, Alfredo; Santana, Carlos; Ruíz-Caballero, José A",Lung,123,24
96978,96978,96978,Noninvasive mechanical ventilation.,19.054874,11.1982565,2012,"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of a priori non-symptomatic but infectious humans (either by random or cohort testing) significantly improves the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to intervention strategies relying on data from symptomatic cases only. This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to (Anderson) localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.","Müller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",Physical biology,123,20

Although recent advances in cell-type resolved approaches hold great promise for studying complex diseases, their implementation relies on local access to fresh tissue, as traditional tissue storage methods do not allow viable cell isolation. To overcome these hurdles, we developed a versatile workflow that allows storage of lung tissue with high viability, permits thorough sample quality check before cell isolation, and befits sequencing-based profiling. We demonstrate that cryopreservation enables isolation of multiple cell types from both healthy and diseased lungs. Basal cells from cryopreserved airways retain their differentiation ability, indicating that cellular identity is not altered by cryopreservation. Importantly, using RNA sequencing and EPIC Array, we show that gene expression and DNA methylation signatures are preserved upon cryopreservation, emphasizing the suitability of our workflow for -omics profiling of lung cells. Moreover, we obtained high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing data of cells from cryopreserved human lung, demonstrating that cryopreservation empowers single-cell approaches. Overall, thanks to its simplicity, our workflow is well-suited for prospective tissue collection by academic collaborators and biobanks, opening worldwide access to viable human tissue.","Llamazares Prada, Maria; Espinet, Elisa; Mijošek, Vedrana; Schwartz, Uwe; Lutsik, Pavlo; Tamas, Raluca; Richter, Mandy; Behrendt, Annika; Pohl, Stephanie T; Benz, Naja P; Muley, Thomas; Warth, Arne; Heußel, Claus Peter; Winter, Hauke; Landry, Jonathan J M; Herth, Felix Jf; Mertens, Tinne Cj; Karmouty-Quintana, Harry; Koch, Ina; Benes, Vladimir; Korbel, Jan O; Waszak, Sebastian M; Trumpp, Andreas; Wyatt, David M; Stahl, Heiko F; Plass, Christoph; Jurkowska, Renata Z",JCI insight,123,8

Thrombosis has been a critical manifestation in severe Covid-19 infection. The increased arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with Covid-19 is proving to be life threatening. Sticky platelet syndrome and sickle cell disease are genetic disorders with procoagulant nature of the disease, while in Glanzmann syndrome there is an enhanced bleeding tendency, with pathological defect leading to altered platelet aggregation and delayed clot formation. Considering the thrombotic episodes of Covid-19, we decided to review the literature on data bases such as PubMed and Medline for knowing the coagulant status in genetically associated diseases such as sticky platelet syndrome, sickle cell disease and Glanzmann syndrome. We planned to review various published studies with the aim to find whether the coagulant profiles in these conditions alter the thrombotic manifestations and prognosis if these patients contract Covid-19. Various research studies revealed that patients with sticky platelet syndrome develop arterial and venous thrombosis, while those with sickle cell disease are known to develop complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Moreover, patients with Glanzmann syndrome who usually have a bleeding tendency also rarely present with severe venous and arterial thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients with sticky platelet syndrome and sickle cell disease and,, occasionally those with Glanzmann syndrome have a higher risk for thrombosis if infected with Covid-19.

Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to aggregate dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Summary effect measures were presented together with their 95 per cent confidence intervals. RESULTS Some 711 patients from three RCTs were included. The 30-day mortality rate was 2·0 per cent in the drain group versus 3·4 per cent after no drainage (OR 0·68, 95 per cent c.i. 0·26 to 1·79; P = 0·43). The morbidity rate was 65·6 per cent in the drain group and 62·0 per cent in the no-drain group (OR 1·17, 0·86 to 1·60; P = 0·31). Clinically relevant pancreatic fistulas were seen in 11·5 per cent of patients in the drain group and 9·5 per cent in the no-drain group. Reinterventions, intra-abdominal abscesses and duration of hospital stay also showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION Pancreatic resection with, or without abdominal drainage results in similar rates of mortality, morbidity and reintervention.","Hüttner, F J; Probst, P; Knebel, P; Strobel, O; Hackert, T; Ulrich, A; Büchler, M W; Diener, M K",The British journal of surgery,123,1

Currently, there are several different CEM models in existence within the UK and Ireland which confer multiple benefits including provision of a senior clinical decision-maker early in the patient's journey, frontloading of time-critical interventions, easing pressure on busy EDs and reducing inpatient bed days. This is achieved through increased community-based management supplemented by utilisation of alternative care pathways. This study aimed to undertake a national comparison of CEM services currently in operation. METHOD A data collection tool was distributed to CEM services by the Pre-Hospital trainee Operated Research Network in October 2020 which aimed to establish current practice among services in the UK and Ireland. It focused on six key sections: service aims; staffing and training; job tasking and patient selection; funding and vehicles used; equipment and medication; data collection, governance and research activity. RESULTS Seven services responded from across England, Wales and Ireland. Similarities were found with the aims of each service, staffing structures and operational times. There were large differences in equipment carried, categories of patient targeted and with governance and research activity. CONCLUSION While some national variations in services are explained by funding and geographical location, this review process revealed several differences in practice under the umbrella term of CEM. A national definition of CEM and its aim, with guidance on scope of practice and measurable outcomes, should be generated to ensure high standard and cost-effective emergency care is delivered in the community.","Hanks, Anthony; Ramage, Lisa; Leech, Caroline",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,123,16

A physiological cross-over study : Pressure support versus proportional ventilation during lower limb exercise in ventilated critically ill patients.,19.138844,10.958225,2017,"INTRODUCTION A recent meta-analysis showed that weaning with SmartCare™ (Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) significantly decreased weaning time in critically ill patients. However, its utility compared with respiratory physiotherapist-protocolized weaning is still a matter of debate. We hypothesized that weaning with SmartCare™ would be as effective as respiratory physiotherapy-driven weaning in critically ill patients. METHODS Adult critically ill patients mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours in the adult intensive care unit of the Albert Einstein Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil, were randomly assigned to be weaned either by progressive discontinuation of pressure support ventilation (PSV) with SmartCare™. Demographic data, respiratory function parameters, level of PSV, tidal volume (VT), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO2) and airway occlusion pressure at 0.1 second (P0.1) were recorded at the beginning of the weaning process and before extubation. Mechanical ventilation time, weaning duration and rate of extubation failure were compared. RESULTS Seventy patients were enrolled 35 in each group. There was no difference between the two groups concerning age, sex or diagnosis at study entry. There was no difference in maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, forced vital capacity or rapid shallow breathing index at the beginning of the weaning trial. PEEP, VT, FIO2, SpO2, respiratory rate, EtCO2 and P0.1 were similar between the two groups, but PSV was not (median: 8 vs. 10 cmH2O; p =0.007). When the patients were ready for extubation, PSV (8 vs. 5 cmH2O; p =0.015) and PEEP (8 vs. 5 cmH2O; p <0.001) were significantly higher in the respiratory physiotherapy-driven weaning group. Total duration of mechanical ventilation (3.5 [2.0-7.3] days vs. 4.1 [2.7-7.1] days; p =0.467) and extubation failure (2 vs. 2; p =1.00) were similar between the two groups. Weaning duration was shorter in the respiratory physiotherapy-driven weaning group (60 [50-80] minutes vs. 110 [80-130] minutes; p <0.001). CONCLUSION A respiratory physiotherapy-driven weaning protocol can decrease weaning time compared with an automatic system, as it takes into account individual weaning difficulties.

We have observed that the addition of cytokines IL-2, IL-21 and irradiated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells can successfully stimulate switch-memory B cells to produce high concentrations of IgG in the supernatant. The supernatant may then be screened by appropriate assays for binding or for other functions. This protocol can be completed in 2 weeks. It is adaptable to use in other species and enables the efficient isolation of antibodies with a desired functional characteristic without prior knowledge of specificity.","Huang, Jinghe; Doria-Rose, Nicole A; Longo, Nancy S; Laub, Leo; Lin, Chien-Li; Turk, Ellen; Kang, Byong H; Migueles, Stephen A; Bailer, Robert T; Mascola, John R; Connors, Mark",Nature protocols,123,33

RECENT FINDINGS Postoperative delirium affects on average 36.8% of surgical patients, ranging from 9 to 87% depending on age, setting, type of surgery and other risk factors. This number may in fact be an underestimation based on the variation in screening practices. Meta-analyses show that in a mix of medical and surgical patients, a single episode of delirium resulted in a doubling of the odds ratio for death as well as an increase in the risk of admission to an institution and increase in dementia. It is also associated with an increase in length of mechanical ventilation in addition to total length of ICU and hospital length of stay. SUMMARY All told, the cost of delirium in the United States alone is estimated to be between US$ 38 and 152 billion. Thus, it is no surprise that there is considerable interest in understanding and treating the problem.","McDaniel, Mathew; Brudney, Charles",Current opinion in critical care,123,16

Guide RNAs shorter than 16 nucleotides in length effectively recruit Cas9 to complementary sites in the genome but do not permit Cas9 nuclease activity. Here we describe CRISPR Guide RNA Assisted Reduction of Damage (CRISPR GUARD) as a method for protecting off-targets sites by co-delivery of short guide RNAs directed against off-target loci by competition with the on-target guide RNA. CRISPR GUARD reduces off-target mutagenesis while retaining on-target editing efficiencies with Cas9 and base editor. However, we discover that short guide RNAs can also support base editing if they contain cytosines within the deaminase activity window. We explore design rules and the universality of this method through in vitro studies and high-throughput screening, revealing CRISPR GUARD as a rapidly implementable strategy to improve the specificity of genome editing for most genomic loci. Finally, we create an online tool for CRISPR GUARD design.","Coelho, Matthew A; De Braekeleer, Etienne; Firth, Mike; Bista, Michal; Lukasiak, Sebastian; Cuomo, Maria Emanuela; Taylor, Benjamin J M",Nature communications,123,24

Recently, the study of children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies has gathered attention. However, little is known on the corresponding adults' representation, adults who in case of disasters are frequently key informants on children's reactions. Examining the influence of earthquake experience, we explored adults' expectations on children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies. The participants were 572 Italian university students. Referring to what happens during and after earthquakes, they were asked to list children's (a) expected emotions, and (b) coping strategies for diminishing fear and sadness. We coded (a) number of fear, sadness, and anger terms; (b) presence of 13 coping strategies. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Fear was more frequent than sadness, and more frequent during vs. after earthquakes (and vice versa for sadness). Some coping strategies were reported rarely, while others were more salient (i.e. problem-solving, information-seeking, self-reliance, support-seeking, and accommodation). Earthquake experience had a marginal impact. Our findings enable us to deepen knowledge on the emotional representation of earthquakes.

INTERVENTION Each of the three ICU early mobilization programs required an interprofessional team-based approach to plan, educate, and implement the ICU early mobility program. Champions from each profession-nursing, physical therapy, physician, and respiratory care-were identified to facilitate changes in ICU culture and clinical practice and to identify and address barriers to early mobility program implementation at each institution. SETTING The medical ICU at Wake Forest University, the medical ICU at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the mixed medical-surgical ICU at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. RESULTS Establishing an ICU early mobilization quality improvement program resulted in a reduced ICU and hospital length of stay at all three institutions and decreased rates of delirium and the need for sedation for the patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins ICU early mobility program.

We refer to this phenomenon as kidney-induced cardiac allograft tolerance (KICAT). In this study, we have developed a murine model for KICAT to determine the underlining cellular/molecular mechanisms. Here, we show that spontaneously accepted DBA/2J kidneys in C57BL/6 recipients induce systemic tolerance that results in the long-term acceptance of DBA/2J heart allografts but not third-party cardiac allografts. The state of systemic tolerance of hearts was established 2 weeks after transplantation of the kidney, after which time, the kidney allograft is no longer required. Depletion of Foxp3+ T cells from these mice precipitated rejection of the heart allografts, indicating that KICAT is dependent on Treg function. Acceptance of kidney allografts and cotransplanted heart allografts did not require the thymus. In conclusion, these data show that kidney allografts induce systemic, donor-specific tolerance of cardiac allografts via Foxp3 cells, and that tolerance is independent of the thymus and continued presence of the kidney allograft. This experimental system should promote increased understanding of the tolerogenic mechanisms of the kidney.","Yang, Chao; Ge, Jifu; Rosales, Ivy; Yuan, Qing; Szuter, Edward; Acheampong, Ellen; Russell, Paul S; Madsen, Joren C; Colvin, Robert B; Alessandrini, Alessandro",JCI insight,123,1

To report success rates determined retrospectively of CVCPs in dogs using external landmarks at a tertiary referral institution. STUDY DESIGN Prospective blinded comparison of techniques. Retrospective analysis of case records. ANIMALS Adult Beagles weighing 11.9 +/- 2.6 kg were used in the experimental group (n = 38). Various breeds of dogs were in the retrospective clinical group (n = 33). METHODS Laboratory dogs were anesthetized and CVCPs were placed using a modified Seldinger technique. Catheter tip position was first based on external landmarks and then the catheter was repositioned using an ECG-guided placement. The ECG-guided technique used the V-lead with the positive electrode attached to the guide wire. Catheter placement was determined by moving the catheter cephalad and caudad to the point of maximum p-wave amplitude and then withdrawing the catheter 1-2 cm from this point. Catheter position with each technique was determined using a lateral thoracic radiograph. Retrospective data were collected from the medical records of dogs that had CVCPs using anatomical landmarks and corresponding thoracic radiographs. RESULTS The number of successful CVCP attempts was the same for both prospective groups (21/38). There was no statistically significant difference in success between the ECG-guided technique and the blind technique. From the retrospective investigation 10/33 of the cases that fit the criteria had correct CVCPs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The odds of correctly placing a central venous catheter by ECG-guidance were the same as the external landmark technique.

However, little is known about the dynamics of these prophages beyond V. cholerae. In this study, we characterized and quantified the zot-encoding filamentous phage VAIϕ, spontaneously induced from the fish pathogen V. anguillarum. VAIϕ contained 6117 bp encoding 11 ORFs, including ORF8pVAI, exhibiting 27%-73% amino acid identity to Inovirus Zot-like proteins. A qPCR method revealed an average of four VAIϕ genomes per host genome during host exponential growth phase, and PCR demonstrated dissemination of induced VAIϕ to other V. anguillarum strains through re-integration in non-lysogens. VAIϕ integrated into both chromosomes of V. anguillarum by recombination, causing changes in a putative ORF in the phage genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the V. anguillarum Inoviridae elements revealed mosaic genome structures related to mainly V. cholerae. Altogether, this study contributes to the understanding of Inovirus infection dynamics and mobilization of zot-like genes beyond human pathogenic vibrios, and discusses their potential role in the evolution of the fish pathogen V. anguillarum.","Mauritzen, Jesper Juel; Castillo, Daniel; Tan, Demeng; Svenningsen, Sine Lo; Middelboe, Mathias",Viruses,123,16

Determining multiple transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to improving safety practices for the public and stemming the spread of SARS-CoV-2 effectively. This article mainly focuses on published studies on the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 including contact transmission, droplet transmission, aerosol transmission and fecal-oral transmission, as well as related research approaches, such as epidemiological investigations, environmental sampling in hospitals and laboratories and animal models. We also provide four specific recommendations for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 that may help reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection under different environmental conditions. First, social distancing, rational use of face masks and respirators, eye protection, and hand disinfection for medical staff and the general public deserve further attention and promotion. Second, aerodynamic characteristics, such as size distribution, release regularity, aerosol diffusion, survival and decline, infectious dose and spread distance, still require further investigation in order to identify the transmissibility of COVID-19. Third, background monitoring of the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms and environmental disinfection in crowded public places, such as railway stations, schools, hospitals and other densely populated areas, can give early warning of outbreaks and curb the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in those high-risk areas. Forth, establishing novel predictive models can help us to not only assess transmission and impacts in communities, but also better implement corresponding emergency response measures.","Wang, Zhongyi; Fu, Yingying; Guo, Zhendong; Li, Jiaming; Li, Jingjing; Cheng, Hongliang; Lu, Bing; Sun, Qiang",Biochemical Society transactions,123,1

BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a minimally invasive technique being recently applied to colorectal surgery. A number of studies comparing SILC to conventional MLC have recently been published. METHODS A literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies comparing SILC to conventional MLC was conducted. The primary outcome measures for meta-analysis were postoperative complications, length of stay, and operative time. Secondary outcome measures were incision length, estimated blood loss, and number of lymph nodes harvested. RESULTS Fifteen studies comparing 467 patients undergoing SILC to 539 patients undergoing conventional MLC were reviewed and the data pooled for analysis. Patients undergoing SILC had a shorter length of stay (pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.68; 95 % CI = -1.20 to -0.16; p = 0.0099), shorter incision length (pooled WMD = -1.37; 95 % CI = -2.74 to 0.000199; p = 0.05), less estimated blood loss (pooled WMD = -20.25; 95 % CI = -39.25 to -1.24; p = 0.037), and more lymph nodes harvested (pooled WMD = 1.75; 95 % CI = 0.12 to 3.38; p = 0.035), while there was no significant difference in the number of postoperative complications (pooled odds ratio = 0.83; 95 % CI = 0.57 to 1.20; p = 0.33) or operative time (pooled WMD = 5.06; 95 % CI = -2.91 to 13.03; p = 0.21).

RECENT FINDINGS We evaluated peer-reviewed articles published between August 2013 and January 2021 that assessed adults, included a measure of cognitive functioning with neutral stimuli, and compared individuals in a fasted state to individuals in a fed state (either within- or between-subject designs). Nineteen articles (21 studies) met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes, fasting methods, and tasks varied across studies. Review of studies indicated that fasting was associated with deficits in cognitive functioning; few studies indicated a benefit in cognitive functioning following a single voluntary fast. The heterogeneity and rarity of available studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Several crucial psychosocial and sociodemographic moderators remain unexplored. Recommendations for future work are discussed.","Benau, Erik M; Makara, Amanda; Orloff, Natalia C; Benner, Eleanor; Serpell, Lucy; Timko, C Alix",Current nutrition reports,123,16

New distal emboli may negatively impact clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and angiographic pattern of distal emboli associated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire Flow Restoration device and evaluate their correlation with clinical outcome. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiography of all patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the use of the Solitaire FR device from 2012 to 2013. Angiographic microcatheter runs prior to Solitaire deployment and after thrombectomy were compared to identify new distal filling defects. Clinical outcome was assessed at discharge and after 90 days. RESULTS Successful revascularization using the Solitaire device occurred in 36 of 39 patients (92%). Three distinct patterns were identified: new distal emboli in the same vascular territory (n = 3), new distal emboli in a new vascular territory (n = 3), and distal emboli that resolved after proximal revascularization (n = 7). Thirteen patients had distal emboli before and after Solitaire runs, and 13 showed no evidence of distal emboli. Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scores 0-2) was seen in 54% of all patients and 83% of patients with new distal emboli; thus, there was no correlation between new emboli and unfavorable clinical outcome (P = .67). CONCLUSION We report an incidence rate of at least 15% of new emboli associated with use of the Solitaire device during thrombectomy in our series. Filling defects after Solitaire use were not associated with poor outcomes at discharge or 90-day follow-up.","Mazur, Marcus D; Kilburg, Craig; Park, Min S; Taussky, Philipp",Neurosurgery,123,1

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Chughtai Institute of Pathology from April to May 2020. METHODOLOGY Fifty pre-pandemic samples (healthy population) and 75 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into 3 equal groups (25 each), according to the days of symptom onset. The samples were analysed using electro-chemiluminescence as assay principle. Positive and negative agreement of COVID-19 antibodies was calculated using EP evaluator to find out the sensitivity of chemiluminescence assay for total antibody detection. The results were analysed using SPSS version 23.0. RESULTS All the pre-pandemic samples tested were negative for antibodies with a negative agreement of 100%. Total agreement at day 7 post-symptom onset was 84%; whereas, it was 94% at day 14 and increased rapidly to 100% at day 21 post-symptom onset.

We evaluated the ambulance driving time to primary PCI centres in the Netherlands and assessed to what extent ambulance driving times were impacted by the expansion of off-site PCI centres. METHODS AND RESULTS We calculated the driving routes from every Dutch postal code to the nearest PCI centre with (on-site) or without (off-site) surgical back-up. We used data from ambulance records to estimate the ambulance driving time on each route. There were 16 on-site and 14 off-site PCI centres. The median (interquartile range) time to on-site PCI centres was 18.8 min (12.2-26.3) compared with 14.9 min (8.9-20.9) to any PCI centre (p < 0.001). In postal code areas that were impacted by the initiation of off-site PCI, the median driving time decreased from 25.4 (18.2-33.1) to 14.7 min (8.9-20.9) (p < 0.001). Ambulance driving times of >120 min were only seen in non-mainland areas. CONCLUSION Based on a computational model, timely ambulance transfer to a PCI centre within 120 min is available to almost all STEMI patients in the Netherlands. Expansion of off-site PCI has significantly reduced the driving time to PCI centres.","Hoedemaker, N P G; de Winter, R J; Kommer, G J; Giesbers, H; Adams, R; van den Bosch, S E; Damman, P",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,123,31

METHODS Ninety-three patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted in Ezhou Central Hospital from February to April in 2020 were analyzed. Among them, 43 patients were selected from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of critical type of COVID-19, and 50 cases of common type were selected from the Department of Respiratory Medicine. The baseline data, blood routine test and biochemical indexes of the patients were collected on the first day of admission. NLRs of the patients were calculated, and COX survival analysis according to the NLR 4-category method was performed. The patients' outcomes were analyzed with receiver operating curves (ROCs). The patients were divided into two groups according to NLR cutoff value for comparison of the biochemical indexes. Based on the patients' outcomes, NLR cutoff value classification and clinical classification, multiple binary logistics regression was performed to screen the key variables and explore their significance in COVID-19. RESULTS The NLR four-category method was not applicable for prognostic evaluation of the patients. The cut-off value of NLR for predict the prognosis of COVID-19 was 11.26, with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.839; the laboratory indicators of the patients with NLR < 11.26 were similar to those in patients of the common type; the indicators were also similar between patients with NLR≥11.26 and those with critical type COVID-19. NLR, WBC, NEUT, PCT, DD, BUN, TNI, BNP, and LDH had significant effects on the clinical classification and outcome of the patients (P < 0.05); Cr, Ca, PH, and Lac had greater impact on the outcome of the patients (P < 0.05), while Na, PCO2 had greater impact on the clinical classification of the patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS NLR can be used as an important reference for clinical classification, prognostic assessment, and biochemical abnormalities of COVID-19. Patients of critical type more frequently have bacterial infection with more serious inflammatory reactions, severer heart, lung and kidney damages, and much higher levels of DD and LDH than those of the common type. NLR, NEUT, DD, TNI, BNP, LDH, Ca, PCT, PH, and Lac have obvious influence on the prognosis of COVID-19 and should be observed dynamically.","Li, Hongbing; Zhao, Maojun; Xu, Yingsheng",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,123,13

Combining small molecule immuno-stimulators can improve treatment efficacy, but they are restricted by poor pharmacokinetics. In this study, TLR7 agonists conjugated onto silica nanoparticles showed extended drug localization after intratumoral injection. The nanoparticle-based TLR7 agonist increased immune stimulation by activating the TLR7 signaling pathway. When treating CT26 colon cancer, nanoparticle conjugated TLR7 agonists increased T cell infiltration into the tumors by > 4× and upregulated expression of the interferon γ gene compared to its unconjugated counterpart by ~2×. Toxicity assays established that the conjugated TLR7 agonist is a safe agent at the effective dose. When combined with checkpoint inhibitors that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), a 10-100× increase in immune cell migration was observed; furthermore, 100 mm3 tumors were treated and a 60% remission rate was observed including remission at contralateral non-injected tumors. The data show that nanoparticle based TLR7 agonists are safe and can potentiate the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapy resistant tumor models and promote a long-term specific memory immune function.","Huang, Ching-Hsin; Mendez, Natalie; Echeagaray, Oscar Hernandez; Weeks, Joi; Wang, James; Yao, Shiyin; Blair, Sarah L; Gude, Natalie; Trogler, William C; Carson, Dennis A; Hayashi, Tomoko; Kummel, Andrew C",Advanced therapeutics,123,1

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies. SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples.

Pathogen-specific Abs are typically a major predictor of protective immunity, yet human B cell and Ab responses during COVID-19 are not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed Ab-secreting cell and Ab responses in 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific Ab-secreting cells in all 20 COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot Assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Abs by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM Ab levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Ab titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing Abs in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Last, we showed that IL-6 and C-reactive protein serum concentrations were higher in patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and C-reactive protein could be used as markers for COVID-19 severity.

The studies of the diversity of species, taxonomy, mechanisms of evolution, geographic distribution, and mechanisms of interaction of these pathogens with the host have greatly increased in recent years. Furthermore, the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and advanced metagenomics approaches have enabled the elucidation of viromes and the identification of many viral agents in a large number of plant species. As a result, determining the nomenclature and taxonomically classifying geminiviruses turned into complex tasks. In addition, the gene responsible for viral replication (particularly, the viruses belonging to the genus Mastrevirus) may be spliced due to the use of the transcriptional/splicing machinery in the host cells. However, the current tools have limitations concerning the identification of introns. RESULTS This study proposes a new method, designated Fangorn Forest (F2), based on machine learning approaches to classify genera using an ab initio approach, i.e., using only the genomic sequence, as well as to predict and classify genes in the family Geminiviridae. In this investigation, nine genera of the family Geminiviridae and their related satellite DNAs were selected. We obtained two training sets, one for genus classification, containing attributes extracted from the complete genome of geminiviruses, while the other was made up to classify geminivirus genes, containing attributes extracted from ORFs taken from the complete genomes cited above. Three ML algorithms were applied on those datasets to build the predictive models: support vector machines, using the sequential minimal optimization training approach, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. RF demonstrated a very high predictive power, achieving 0.966, 0.964, and 0.995 of precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC), respectively, for genus classification. For gene classification, RF could reach 0.983, 0.983, and 0.998 of precision, recall, and AUC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, Fangorn Forest is proven to be an efficient method for classifying genera of the family Geminiviridae with high precision and effective gene prediction and classification.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a large-sized graft for recipient influenced the post-transplant outcomes. METHODS A total of 273 patients undergoing LT were enrolled and divided into a large and a normal-sized graft group by graft weight to recipient weight (GWRW) >2.5% (n = 76) or GWRW ≤2.5% (n = 197). Post-operative complications and outcomes were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics. The rate of complications was significantly higher in the large-sized graft group including early allograft dysfunction (36.8% versus 17.8%, P = 0.001), hepatic necrosis (26.3% versus 13.7%, P = 0.01) and massive hydrothorax (25% versus 14.7%, P = 0.04). The large-sized graft group suffered higher early mortality compared with the normal-sized graft group (30 days: 14.5% versus 5.6%, P = 0.02, 90 days: 21.1% versus 9.6%, P = 0.01). The primary causes of early death were multiple organ failure (10.5% versus 2%, P = 0.002) and sepsis (2.6% versus 1.5%, P = 0.54). Four parameters including donor alanine transaminase, GWRW, estimated blood loss and model for end-stage liver disease score were significant on multivariate analysis, and indicated significant risk factors for the early mortality of recipients. CONCLUSION In deceased donor LT, GWRW >2.5% is associated with increased liver injury, risk of early mortality and other adverse outcomes. Thus, donor livers should be allocated to recipients with GWRW ≤2.5%.","Shen, Zhenhua; Wang, Zhize; Jiang, Yuancong; Wu, Tianchun; Zheng, Shusen",ANZ journal of surgery,123,12

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between brain oscillatory activity and headache pain in MDD subjects. METHODS A total of 64 subjects with MDD who were free of psychoactive medications were evaluated for severity of headache pain in the past week. Brain function was assessed using resting-state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). We derived cordance in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency bands at each electrode, and examined correlations with headache pain in regions of interest while controlling for depression severity. Frontal and posterior asymmetry in alpha power was calculated in regions of interest. RESULTS Headache pain severity was associated with depression severity ( r = 0.447, P < .001). In bilateral frontal and right posterior regions, alpha cordance was significantly associated with headache intensity, including when controlling for depression severity. The direction of the correlation was positive anteriorly and negative posteriorly. Frontal left dominant alpha asymmetry correlated with severity of headache but not depression symptoms. CONCLUSION Alterations in brain oscillations identified by alpha cordance and alpha asymmetry may be associated with the pathophysiology of headache pain in depression.

The prevalence of untreated caries decreased by greater than 50%: from 39% to 18% in phase 1, and from 28% to 10% in phase 2. The per-visit adjusted odds ratio of untreated decay was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.85). Conclusions and Practical Implications. We show that a school-based comprehensive caries prevention program was associated with substantial reductions in children's caries, supporting the concept of expanding traditional practices to include office- and community-based aerosol-free care.","Starr, J.

This unexpected situation could predict an exacerbation of anxiety, depressions, obsessions, and even multiple cases of psychosis.ObjectivesThe aim of this literature review is to identify and analyze studies conducted in 2020 that investigate the incidence of psychotic disorders, related to COVID-19 pandemic and describe its symptoms.MethodsA systematic search in the PubMed electronic database was performed using keywords “COVID-19”, “pandemics”, “psychotic symptoms”, and “ first episode of psychosis” Relevant literature was limited to articles describing studies conducted and published in 2020.Results9 papers met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies reported 20 cases of psychosis in patients with no psychiatric history, directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and by social distancing and quarantine. All cases were characterized by sudden behavioral changes out of character, increased concern about coronavirus risk infection, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and insomnia. In multiple cases, psychotic symptoms were characterized by thoughts of reference, persecution, and structured delusional. 5 patients were convinced that COVID-19 Pandemic was part of a conspiracy and that someone was trying to infect them by diffusing the COVID-19 or other pollutants. Half of the patients had the delusional conviction that they got infected and they were contagious.ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic appears to be the trigger for precipitating psychosis which has a high risk of suicidal behavior. During pandemics, mental health professionals should carry out more focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Brahmi, L.; Ammar, H.

There are several methods which can indicate a male genotype by the presence of the amplified product of SRY gene. The aim of this study was to identify the SRY gene for embryo sex determination in human during pregnancy using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. METHODS: A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected, and Plasma DNA was extracted. LAMP assay was performed using DNA obtained for detection of SRY gene. Furthermore, colorimetric LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of SRY gene was developed. RESULTS: LAMP results revealed that the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes, while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes. A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos (46.6%) and eight female embryos (53.4%). All used visual components in the colorimetric assay could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones. CONCLUSION: The LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable tool capable of monitoring the purity and detection of SRY gene for sex determination.","Almasi, Mohammad Amin; Almasi, Galavizh",J Reprod Infertil,123,4

We asked how the perception of these characteristics is influenced by the set of faces that observers are exposed to. Previous studies have shown that the appearance of a face can be biased strongly after viewing an altered image of the face, and have suggested that these after-effects reflect response changes in the neural mechanisms underlying object or face perception. Here we show that these adaptation effects are pronounced for natural variations in faces and for natural categorical judgements about faces. This suggests that adaptation may routinely influence face perception in normal viewing, and could have an important role in calibrating properties of face perception according to the subset of faces populating an individual's environment.","Webster, Michael A; Kaping, Daniel; Mizokami, Yoko; Duhamel, Paul",Nature,123,7

Different serotypes of this virus show little cross-protection. The present study investigated the relationship between differences in the genotype based on the N-terminus of the spike protein and the protection provided by vaccination with IBVs. Cross-immunization tests were performed using both killed and live viruses in specific-pathogen-free chicks. One-day-old chicks were immunized with killed or high [10(5) 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50)] or low (10(3) EID50) doses of live IBV viruses and challenged with homologous or heterologous IBV strains. The immunization efficacy was evaluated by virus isolation from the challenged chicks. In the killed-virus and high-dose live-virus test groups, IBV vaccination protected against challenge by homologous but not heterologous IBV strains. However, a low dose of live IBV showed no protection against virulent IBV challenge. These results indicate that both the genotype based on the N-terminus of the spike protein and the virus dose are essential to IBV protection from immunization. Thus, development of vaccines from different local strains is necessary to control infectious bronchitis in poultry.","Lin, Kuan-Yu; Wang, Hui-Chung; Wang, Ching-Ho","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",123,7

Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) precede each gene and include a conserved core sequence (CS) surrounded by relatively variable sequences (5' TRS and 3' TRS). Regulation of transcription in coronaviruses has been studied by reverse-genetics analysis of the sequences immediately flanking a unique CS in the Transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome (CS-S2), located inside the S gene, that does not lead to detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, in spite of its canonical sequence. The transcriptional inactivity of CS-S2 was genome position independent. The presence of a canonical CS was not sufficient to drive transcription, but subgenomic synthesis requires a minimum base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) provided by the CS and its adjacent nucleotides. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA S2, demonstrating that base pairing between the leader and body beyond the CS is a determinant regulation factor in coronavirus transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in DeltaG values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, specifically that it consists of the central CS and around 4 nucleotides flanking 5' and 3' the CS. Sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on the template-switching decision according to a model of polymerase strand transfer and template switching during minus-strand synthesis.","Sola, Isabel; Moreno, José L; Zúñiga, Sonia; Alonso, Sara; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,123,7

METHODS We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The patients were randomized 1：1 to HCQ group and the control group. Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only. The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517). RESULTS One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment. On day 7, nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (P>0.05). The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P>0.05]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day]. Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations. Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good. Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.

The gene was cloned and expressed in bacteria. A fusion protein of ns4b with maltose-binding protein was injected into rabbits to generate specific antibodies that were used to demonstrate the expression of ns4b in HCV-229E-infected cells using flow cytometry. Given a previously reported contiguous five amino acid shared region between ns4b and myelin basic protein, a purified recombinant histidine-tagged ns4b protein and (or) human myelin basic protein were injected into mice to evaluate whether myelin-viral protein cross-reactive antibody responses could be generated. Each immunogen induced specific but not cross-reactive antibodies.

Gene therapy strategies involve gene manipulation on broad biological processes responsible for the spreading of diseases. Cancer, monogenic diseases, vascular and infectious diseases are the main targets of gene therapy. In order to obtain valuable experimental and clinical results, sufficient gene transfer methods are required. Therapeutic genes can be administered into target tissues via gene carriers commonly defined as vectors. The retroviral, adenoviral and adeno-associated virus based vectors are most frequently used in the clinic. So far, gene preparations may be administered directly into target organs or by intravenous, intramuscular, intratumor or intranasal injections. It is common knowledge that the number of gene therapy clinical trials has rapidly increased. However, some limitations such as transfection efficiency and stable and long-term gene expression are still not resolved. Consequently, great effort is focused on the evaluation of new strategies of gene delivery. There are many expectations associated with intranasal delivery of gene preparations for the treatment of diseases. Intranasal delivery of therapeutic genes is regarded as one of the most promising forms of pulmonary gene therapy research. Gene therapy based on inhalation of gene preparations offers an alternative way for the treatment of patients suffering from such lung diseases as cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin defect, or cancer. Experimental and first clinical trials based on plasmid vectors or recombinant viruses have revealed that gene preparations can effectively deliver therapeutic or marker genes to the cells of the respiratory tract. The noninvasive intranasal delivery of gene preparations or conventional drugs seems to be very encouraging, although basic scientific research still has to continue.","Podolska, Karolina; Stachurska, Anna; Hajdukiewicz, Karolina; Małecki, Maciej",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,123,19

Bacterial barrier dressings are a first line of protection against developing wound infections. Most bacterial barrier dressings contain microbicidal chemicals (eg, silver ions, iodine, chlorhexidine) that are released from the dressings, which can be toxic to wound cells. A need exists for cost effective bacterial barrier dressings that absorb wound exudate and do not release toxic materials into the wound or increase the risk for developing bacterial resistance to the microbicidal chemical. The present study reports the development and properties of a novel bacterial barrier dressing that meets these needs. METHODS A high molecular weight (~250 k Daltons) polymer containing a high density of quaternary amines (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride [polyDADMAC]) was permanently bonded onto cellulose fibers (gauze). Microbicidal and mammalian cell cytotoxicity tests were conducted using standard methods. Development of bacterial resistance to the microbicidal fibers was assessed over 10 passages. RESULTS The polyquat-treated bacterial barrier gauze dressing (BIOGUARD [BBD]) had high microbicidal activity even in the presence of proteinaceous fluid against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The BBD dressing passed all mammalian cell toxicity tests due to the non-leaching of the bactericidal polymer. Furthermore, the BBD dressing did not demonstrate any ability to induce bacterial resistance in selection vector testing. CONCLUSION This novel dressing featuring a bound microbicide offers another choice for wound caregivers to provide patients with an antimicrobial barrier dressing safe enough for prophylactic use to protect against wound infections.","Mikhaylova, Albina; Liesenfeld, Bernd; Moore, David; Toreki, William; Vella, Jillian; Batich, Christopher; Schultz, Gregory",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,123,28

Our aim was to compare the outcome of hospitalized coronavirus disease 219 (COVID-19) patients in low and high SES group. Prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals. Electronic case notes were analyzed for baseline characteristics and admission investigations. Scottish index for multiple deprivation (SIMD) was used to divide patients into two groups: more deprived (SIMD 1-5) and less deprived (SIMD 6-10) and results compared. Poor outcome was defined as either need for intubation and/or death. One hundred and seventy-three patients were identified, one was excluded. One hundred and eight (62.8%) were males, mean age was 68.5 ± 14.7 years. Commonest comorbidity was hypertension 87 (50.6%). One hundred and seventeen (68.0%) patients were in more deprived group. Baseline characteristics, admission blood profile and reason for admission were evenly matched in both groups. Outcomes were comparable in both groups: transfer to critical care (27.4% vs 27.3%; P = .991), intubation (18.8% vs 20.2%; P = .853), 30-day all-cause mortality (19.7% vs 14.5%; P = .416) and overall poor outcome (30.8% vs 30.9%; P = .985). Median time to discharge was 7 days longer (17 vs 10 days; P = .018) and median time to death was 4.5 days longer in more deprived group (17 vs 12.5 days; P = .388). Contrary to recent literature on COVID-19 in other geographical areas, our study suggests that the SES does not have any impact on outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, however it negatively impacts length of stay.","Khan, Khurram Shahzad; Torpiano, Giuliana; McLellan, Morag; Mahmud, Sajid",J. med. virol,123,20

The review offers explanations, ranging from the technical difficulty involved in detecting as broad a group as the thermodurics, which covers the spores of multiple sporeforming genera as well at least six genera of mesophilic nonsporeformers, to the taxonomically controversial issue as to what constitutes a fecal Streptococcus or SRBs/SRCs We review two problematic areas for assay developers: validation/certification and the nature of dairy food matrices Development and implementation of rapid alternative test methods for the dairy industry is influenced by regulations relating to both the microbiological quality standards and the criteria alternative methods must meet to qualify as acceptable test methods However, the gap between the certification of developer's test systems as valid alternative methods in only a handful of representative matrices, and the requirement of dairy industries to verify the performance of alternative test systems in an extensive and diverse range of dairy matrices needs to be bridged before alternative methods can be widely accepted and adopted in the dairy industry This study concludes that many important dairy matrices have effectively been ignored by assay developers",,,123,1

The COVID-19 public health crisis is a significant, global, and (mostly) simultaneous test of the behavioral implications arising from this confidence. We explore whether populations reporting low levels of confidence in the health care system exhibit a stronger behavioral reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. We track the dynamic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across 38 European countries and 621 regions by employing a large dataset on human mobility generated between February 15 and June 5, 2020 and a broad range of contextual factors (e.g., deaths or policy implementations). Using a time-dynamic framework we find that societies with low levels of health care confidence initially exhibit a faster response with respect to staying home. However, this reaction plateaus sooner, and after the plateau it declines with greater magnitude than does the response from societies with high health care confidence. On the other hand, regions with higher confidence in the health care system are more likely to reduce mobility once the government mandates that its citizens are not to leave home except for essential trips, compared to those with lower health care system confidence. Regions with high trust in the government but low confidence in the health care system dramatically reduce their mobility, suggesting a correlation for trust in the state with respect to behavioral responses during a crisis.","Chan, Ho Fai; Brumpton, Martin; Macintyre, Alison; Arapoc, Jefferson; Savage, David A; Skali, Ahmed; Stadelmann, David; Torgler, Benno",PLoS One,123,12

We find that Democrats discussed the crisis more frequently-emphasizing threats to public health and American workers-while Republicans placed greater emphasis on China and businesses. Polarization in elite discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in mid-February-weeks after the first confirmed case in the United States-and continued into March.

One of the main concerns is the impact of this pandemic on health outcomes, mainly on mental health. Even though there are a few empirical studies on COVID-19 and mental health, so far, there is no systematic review about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of young people and adults yet. We aim to critically synthesise the scientific evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people and adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be performed through eight databases: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), ISI-of-Knowledge, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), SCOPUS, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), PsycINFO (Psychology Information) and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), from inception until 30 June 2020. No restriction regarding the publication date, setting or languages will be considered. Preliminary search strategies were carried out on 29 March 2020 and will be updated in June 2020. The primary outcomes will be the prevalence and the severity of psychological symptoms in young people and adults (>18 years old) resulting from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Pooled standardised mean differences and 95% CIs will be calculated. The risk of bias of the observational studies will be assessed through the Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS). Additionally, if sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Heterogeneity between the studies will be determined by the I2 statistics. Subgroup analyses will also be performed. Publication bias will be checked with funnel plots and Egger's test. Heterogeneity will be explored by random-effects analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical assessment was not required. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and will be presented at conferences related to this field.

In this paper, we carry out further experimentation using a novel experimental setup, in which a strobe light is used to emulate impulsive temporal sampling, in order to investigate the spatiotemporal envelope of the human visual system and the effect of a stimulus. For non-periodic stimuli, experimental results show that critical sampling rates increase with motion speed and decrease with stimulus width. These interactions can be described using simple log-linear models, and characterized using the temporal aliasing visibility function, where maximum critical frame rates up to 1500 Hz are predicted. For periodic stimuli, we demonstrate that both perceptible temporal aliasing artifacts and stimulus aliasing can cause stroboscopic effects.","Mackin, Alex; Bull, David",J Opt Soc Am A Opt Image Sci Vis,123,23

Beta regression models are primarily used to model rates and proportions. However, these models are usually specified in terms of a conditional mean. Therefore, they may be inadequate if the observed response variable follows an asymmetrical distribution, such as CFR data. In addition, beta regression models do not consider the effect of the covariates across the spectrum of the dependent variable, which is possible through the conditional quantile approach. In order to introduce the proposed GB3 regression model, we first reparameterize the GB3 distribution by inserting a quantile parameter and then we develop the new proposed quantile model. We also propose a simple interpretation of the predictor-response relationship in terms of percentage increases/decreases of the quantile. A Monte Carlo study is carried out for evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood estimates and the choice of the link functions. Finally, a real COVID-19 dataset from Chile is analyzed and discussed to illustrate the proposed approach.","Bourguignon, Marcelo; Gallardo, Diego I.; Saulo, Helton",,123,26

The utility of telepsychiatry is relevant now more than ever as the world endures the COVID-19 global pandemic. This paper describes the prior state and the changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to telepsychiatry in a selected group of Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Patients and Methods: We invited twelve early-career psychiatrists from different Arab nations to share information related to telepsychiatry in their respective countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information was collected using a semi-structured guide. This was complemented by a search for relevant articles in five search engines using terms such as ""COVID-19,"" ""telepsychiatry,"" and ""Arab world"". Results: Before the pandemic, digital mental health services were provided in several Arab countries, mainly through hotlines and messaging services. The COVID-19 pandemic has marked a major shift in digital psychiatric services in the Arab MENA world, through the transformation of many clinics and some hospitals into digital mental health systems. Many non-governmental organizations also started remote initiatives for psychological support and psychiatric counseling. Three main barriers of patient-related, healthcare-related, and system-related hurdles of using telepsychiatry emanated from the analysis. Conclusion: The use of digital mental health services varies between different Arab countries. Even though some nations have laws that regulate the provision of such services, most struggle with multifactorial barriers. As affordable and attainable solutions cannot only rely on training and recruiting more psychiatrists, telepsychiatry would help meet the exceeding demands in the Arab world, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak.","El Hayek, Samer; Nofal, Marwa; Abdelrahman, Doaa; Adra, Ali; Al Harthi, Mansour; Al Shamli, Siham; AlNuaimi, Nawaf; Bensid, Lynda; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; Emberish, Alkhansa Mahdi; Larnaout, Amine; Radwan, Ahmed; Slaih, Mohammad; Kobeissy, Firas; Bizri, Maya",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,123,20

However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young noncritically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the coronavirus disease 2019 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes occurring in patients aged 37-68 yrs with varying coronavirus disease 2019 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (eg, focal and nonfocal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes. The duration of the coronavirus disease 2019-related prothrombotic state is unknown, and it is unclear whether patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more coronavirus disease 2019 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Because of the variable presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with either acute focal or nonfocal neurologic symptoms. Additional studies are needed to clarify prothrombotic state duration, determine prognosis for recovery, and establish the physiatrist's role in long-term disease management.","Diaz-Segarra, Nicole; Edmond, Arline; Kunac, Anastasia; Yonclas, Peter",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,123,0

Direct virus invasion, myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance and vascular endothelial and coagulation dysfunction may be important mechanisms for cardiovascular injury in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 (the cell membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in various organs and the peripheral blood not only mediates the direct invasion and damage of the organs, but also participates in regulation of the balance of systematic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus affecting the susceptibility and outcomes of the patients.

Studies revealed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased under this condition. PTSD can change the structure of patients' central nervous system, and increase the risk of anxiety or depression, thus greatly affecting the quality of patients' life and their families. PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application. METHODS: The literatures that are related to the smartphone app based intervention and PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials repositories, PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science databases.

So far, few effective drugs have emerged to assist in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, though some herbal medicine candidates may assist in the fight against COVID-19 deaths. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main active ingredient of black seed oil, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anticoagulant activities. TQ also increases the activity and number of cytokine suppressors, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages, and it has demonstrated antiviral potential against a number of viruses, including murine cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and other coronaviruses. Recently, TQ has demonstrated notable antiviral activity against a SARSCoV-2 strain isolated from Egyptian patients and, interestingly, molecular docking studies have also shown that TQ could potentially inhibit COVID-19 development through binding to the receptor-binding domain on the spike and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which may hinder virus entry into the host cell and inhibit its ion channel and pore forming activity. Other studies have shown that TQ may have an inhibitory effect on SARS CoV2 proteases, which could diminish viral replication, and it has also demonstrated good antagonism to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, allowing it to interfere with virus uptake into the host cell. Several studies have also noted its potential protective capability against numerous chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, renal dysfunction and malignancy. TQ has recently been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of several different diseases, and this review thus aims to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of TQ in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Badary, Osama A; Hamza, Marwa S; Tikamdas, Rajiv",Drug Des Devel Ther,123,6

WHAT DOES THIS ARTICLE ADD: Our study adds a longitudinal approach to emotional wellbeing and defines different groups of youths according to their evolution over a two-year period. Stress and perceived health status seem to be the most important factors related to emotional wellbeing. Our research shows the importance of health care professionals exploring psychological health, especially when a youth has atypical somatic complaints. This could allow the early detection of psychological problems and the provision of proper timely treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess how emotional wellbeing evolves over a two-year period among youths in Switzerland, and to assess their characteristics. METHODS: Data were obtained from the first and third waves of the GenerationFRee study (n = 1311, aged 15&ndash;24 at baseline). The sample was divided into four groups according to the evolution of their emotional wellbeing (WB): good at both waves (GoodWB: 67.9%), poor at T1 and good at T3 (BetterWB: 8.4%), good at T1 and poor at T3 (WorseWB: 13.2%), or poor at both waves (PoorWB: 10.4%). Significant variables at the bivariate level were included in a multinomial regression analysis using GoodWB as the reference category. Results are given as relative risk ratios (RRRs). RESULTS: The BetterWB group reported more stress at T1 (RRR 1.34), as did the WorseWB group at T3 (1.43). Those in the WorseWB group were more likely to report poorer health status at T3 (6.51). Finally, the PoorWB group reported more stress at T1 (1.33) and T3 (1.44), and poorer health status at T1 (9.39) and T3 (5.75). Other variables not significant in all groups were perceived onset of puberty, having a chronic condition, area of residence and relationships with parents. CONCLUSION: Using a longitudinal approach, stress and perceived health status seem to be the main factors that change with emotional wellbeing among youths. Inquiring about stress could be a good proxy for emotional wellbeing, especially among males, who tend to underestimate their emotional worries.","Gubelmann, Alicia; Auderset, Diane; Akre, Christina; Barrense-Dias, Yara; Surís, Joan-Carles",Swiss Med Wkly,123,12

We hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will reduce risk of hospitalization/death among those with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection and will reduce risk of COVID-19 infection among their close household contacts. METHODS: We report the rationale and design of a planned pragmatic, cluster randomized, double-blinded trial (N = 2700 in total nationwide), with 1500 newly diagnosed individuals with COVID-19 infection, together with up to one close household contact each (~1200 contacts), randomized to either vitamin D3 (loading dose, then 3200 IU/day) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and a household cluster design. The study duration is 4 weeks. The primary outcome for newly diagnosed individuals is the occurrence of hospitalization and/or mortality. Key secondary outcomes include symptom severity scores among cases and changes in the infection (seroconversion) status for their close household contacts. Changes in vitamin D 25(OH)D levels will be assessed and their relation to study outcomes will be explored. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pragmatic trial will allow parallel testing of vitamin D3 supplementation for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The household cluster design provides a cost-efficient approach to testing an intervention for reducing rates of hospitalization and/or mortality in newly diagnosed cases and preventing infection among their close household contacts.","Wang, Rui; DeGruttola, Victor; Lei, Quanhong; Mayer, Kenneth H; Redline, Susan; Hazra, Aditi; Mora, Samia; Willett, Walter C; Ganmaa, Davaasambuu; Manson, JoAnn E",Contemp Clin Trials,123,9

OBJECTIVE: To promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for speech-language pathologists. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from five different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for speech-language pathologists during this pandemic context. RESULTS: The clinical guide provides 65 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics. CONCLUSION: This guideline should be taken only as recommendation; each clinician must attempt to mitigate the risk of infection and achieve the best therapeutic results taking into account the patient's particular reality.","Castillo-Allendes, Adrián; Contreras-Ruston, Francisco; Cantor-Cutiva, Lady Catherine; Codino, Juliana; Guzman, Marco; Malebran, Celina; Manzano, Carlos; Pavez, Axel; Vaiano, Thays; Wilder, Fabiana; Behlau, Mara",J. voice,123,20

These cases often remain unnoticed, so it is difficult to estimate the actual numbers of infections. Aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody in Austrian blood donors. METHODS: 20,228 blood donors aged between 18 and 72 years resident in four Austrian federal states were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody between 5th of June and 4th of December 2020. To evaluate the impact of sex, age, AB0-blood group and donation period on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, multiple logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Our data reveal an anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.5% overall, significantly depending on the time point of blood donation: after the first Austrian lockdown the seroprevalence was lower compared to the following months, when the rate was constantly rising. While younger blood donors showed significantly higher seroprevalence, no differences were found concerning sex or AB0 blood group. CONCLUSION: Broad testing strategies are required to better determine the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Screening blood donors as a representative group for the adult population could be a valid tool to determine the number of recorded and unrecorded cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Weidner, Lisa; Nunhofer, Verena; Jungbauer, Christof; Hoeggerl, Alexandra Domnica; Grüner, Lydia; Grabmer, Christoph; Zimmermann, Georg; Rohde, Eva; Laner-Plamberger, Sandra",Infection,123,1

Our key contributions include: 1) an unsupervised Periphery-aware Spatial Prediction (PSP) task which is designed to introduce important spatial patterns into deep networks; 2) an adaptive Contrastive Repre-sentation Enhancement (CRE) mechanism which can effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference of various types of pneumonia. We integrate PSP and CRE to obtain the representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening. We evaluate our approach comprehensively on our constructed large-scale dataset and two public datasets. Extensive experiments on both volume-level and slice-level CT images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with PSP and CRE for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Hou, Junlin; Xu, Jilan; Jiang, Longquan; Du, Shanshan; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Yuejie; Shan, Fei; Xue, Xiangyang",Pattern Recognit,123,16

As many countries are accelerating efforts to eliminate malaria or to prevent the re-establishment of malaria from recently eliminated countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause major interruptions to ongoing anti-malaria operations and risk jeopardizing the gains that have been made so far. Sri Lanka, having eliminated malaria in 2012, was certified by the World Health Organization as a malaria-free country in 2016 and now implements a rigorous programme to prevent its re-establishment owing to the high receptivity and vulnerability of the country to malaria. Sri Lanka has also dealt with the COVID-19 epidemic quite successfully limiting the cumulative number of infections and deaths through co-ordinated efforts between the health sector and other relevant sectors, namely the military, the Police Department, Departments of Airport and Aviation and Foreign Affairs, all of which have been deployed for the COVID-19 epidemic under the umbrella of a Presidential Task Force. The relevance of imported infections and the need for a multi-sectoral response are features common to both the control of the COVID-19 epidemic and the Prevention of Re-establishment (POR) programme for malaria. Sri Lanka's malaria POR programme has, therefore, creatively integrated its activities with those of the COVID-19 control programme. Through highly coordinated operations the return to the country of Sri Lankan nationals stranded overseas by the COVID-19 pandemic, many from malaria endemic countries, are being monitored for malaria as well as COVID-19 in an integrated case surveillance system under quarantine conditions, to the success of both programmes. Twenty-three imported malaria cases were detected from February to October through 2773 microscopic blood examinations performed for malaria in quarantine centres, this number being not much different to the incidence of imported malaria during the same period last year. This experience highlights the importance of integrated case surveillance and the need for a highly coordinated multi-sectoral approach in dealing with emerging new infections. It also suggests that synergies between the COVID-19 epidemic control programme and other health programmes may be found and developed to the advantage of both.","Ranaweera, Prasad; Wickremasinghe, Rajitha; Mendis, Kamini",Malar J,123,5

Most resource-limited healthcare settings lack complex air handling systems to filter air and create pressure gradients that are necessary for minimising viral transmission. This review explores the association between ventilation and the transmission of respiratory viruses like SAR-CoV-2. When used appropriately, both natural and mechanical ventilation can decrease the concentration of viral aerosols, thereby reducing transmission. Although mechanical ventilation systems are more efficient, installation and maintenance costs limit their use in resource-limited settings, whereas the prevailing climate conditions make natural ventilation less desirable.

The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the spike proteins (S) and ACE2 receptor proteins with Macrolide antibiotics like Azithromycin, (AZM), Clarithromycin (CLAM) and Erythromycin (ERY) along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These compounds were able to block the residues (Arg553, Arg555, and Ala558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (Val557) of RdRp and thus plays an important role in tight blocking of enzyme active site. Reference drug Remdesivir was used to compare the docking score of antibiotics with RdRp. Docking value exhibited good binding energy (-7.7 up to -8.2 kcal/mol) with RdRp, indicating their potential as a potent RdRp inhibitor. Interaction of CLAM and ERY presented low binding energy (-6.8 and -6.6) with the ACE2 receptor. At the same time, CLAM exhibited a good binding affinity of -6.4 kcal/mol, making it an excellent tool to block the attachment of spike protein to ACE2 receptors. Macrolides not only affected the attachment to ACE2 but also blocked the spike proteins further, consequently inhibiting the internalization in the host cell. Three Alkyl bonds between Arg555, Ala558, and Met542 by CLAM and two Alkyl bonds of Arg624 and Lys621 by ERY plays an important role for RdRp inactivation that can prevent the rise of newly budded progeny virus. These macrolides interacted with the main protease protein in the pocket responsible for the dimerization and catalytic function of this protein. The interaction occurred with residue Glu166, along with the catalytic residues (Tyr343, and His235) of Endoribonuclease (NSP15) protein. The present study gives three-way options either by blocking S proteins or ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by macrolide and could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 till some better option available.","Anwar, Firoz; Altayb, Hisham N; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Kumar, Vikas; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Curr. pharm. des,123,16

Simply put, our interest in and enjoyment of sport occurs through a process of “knowing better”. Here, one’s knowledge of the unimportance of sport is achieved by associating the illusion of sport with a naïve observer–i.e. someone who does believe in sport’s importance. In the wake of the global pandemic, COVID-19, it would seem that Pfaller’s remarks have taken on an added significance. With major sporting events and domestic competitions being indefinitely postponed or canceled, Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, commented that football was “the most important of the least important things”.

294837,294837,294837,Tissue-specific Immunopathology in Fatal COVID-19,19.544416,11.06385,2020,"BACKGROUND: As of November 1, 2020, there have been more than 230K deaths and 9M confirmed and probable cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.","Zelner, Jon; Trangucci, Rob; Naraharisetti, Ramya; Cao, Alex; Malosh, Ryan; Broen, Kelly; Masters, Nina; Delamater, Paul",Clin Infect Dis,123,30

Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has frequently been reported in patients with COVID-19, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and hematological alterations. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended for patients who require chronic anticoagulation to continue therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. To avoid regular and frequent blood tests and unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during contacts with medical personnel, direct oral anticoagulants should be strongly preferred whenever possible. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of VTE or in whom the diagnosis is confirmed, parenteral therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in the absence of contraindications. If heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, nonheparin anticoagulants should be used such as bivalirudin or fondaparinux. In case of confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, treatment should be guided by risk stratification as defined in the current guidelines.","Kosior, Dariusz A; Undas, Anetta; Kopec, Grzegorz; Hryniewiecki, Tomasz; Torbicki, Adam; Mularek-Kubzdela, Tatiana; Windyga, Jerzy; Pruszczyk, Piotr",Kardiol Pol,123,3

In this paper, we try to analyze the variation of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries in the light of some modifications to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The SIR model was modified by taking time-dependent rate parameters. From this modified SIR model, the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, herd immunity, and herd immunity threshold are redefined. The re-outbreak of the COVID-19 is a real threat to various countries. We have used the above-mentioned quantities to find the reasons behind the re-outbreak of this disease. Also, the effectiveness of herd immunity to prevent an epidemic has been analyzed with respect to this model. We have also tried to show that there are certain universal aspects in the spread and containment of the disease in various countries for a short period of time. Finally, we have also analyzed the current pandemic situation in India and have attempted to discuss the possibilities in order to predict its future behavior using our model.

Symptom prevalence and overall duration for symptoms persisting for more than 30 days were calculated. Logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: In total, 447 (4%) of the participants were SARS-CoV-2-seropositive. Loss of sense of smell and taste was reported by 50% of seropositives compared with 3% of seronegatives. Additionally, seropositives more frequently reported fever, dyspnoea, muscle or joint ache, fatigue, cough, headache and sore throat, and they were more likely to report symptoms persisting for more than 30 days. In adjusted models, they had a higher risk of reporting symptoms, with the strongest association observed for loss of sense of taste and smell (OR = 35.6; 95% CI: 28.6-44.3). CONCLUSION: In this large study, SARS-CoV-2-seropositive participants reported COVID-19-associated symptoms more frequently than those who were seronegative, especially loss of sense of taste and smell.

COVID-19 was then declared as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The initial mortality rate of COVID-19 declared by WHO was 2%; however, this rate has increased to 3.4% as of 3 March 2020. People of all ages can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but those aged 60 or above and those with underlying medical conditions are more prone to develop severe symptoms that may lead to death. Patients with severe infection usually experience a hyper pro-inflammatory immune reaction (i.e., cytokine storm) causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been shown to be the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. However, the factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, resistance and severity remain poorly understood.

The association between career situation and financial problems caused by cancer has a substantial impact on quality of life (QoL) among cancer patients. Indeed, the QoL such as physical and mental health of cancer patients is lower when the risk of psychological disorders or distress increases, and chances for cancer cure are reduced. Progress in therapeutic intervention allows many cancer patients a social reintegration into their careers. About one third of cancer patients are younger than 65 years, and with the constant increase in work life periods, a cancer diagnosis also presents a financial burden for those affected. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to analyse the social QoL in the context of factors related to career and financial situation among patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). METHODS: A descriptive non-experimental research design was used to conduct a cross-sectional survey over a period of 6 months, between May and November 2016, in collaboration with the Sarcoma Unit at the Mannheim University Medical Centre, Mannheim, Germany, the patient organisation ""Das Lebenshaus e.V.,"" and the German Pension Insurance Hessen (Deutsche Ren-tenversicherung: DRV Hessen)/Pension Fund. We analysed data of 30 patients diagnosed with STS using self-outcome questionnaires in combination with retirement insurance data from the date of first diagnosis up to 3 years afterwards. Out of 280 questionnaires, we received 86 completed forms, of which 56 were excluded. The remaining questionnaires of 30 patients were analysed according to self-determined outcomes and included a calculation of the financial changes caused by the disease. Only patients covered by pension insurance were included in the study. RESULTS: Thirty patients (24 women) whose median age at first diagnosis was 48.7 years (range 31-61 years) were included in the analysis. The average unemployment rate was 8.8 months, and for 67% (20 patients) the employment situation changed after the period of unemployment. Eight patients requested a retirement pension (reduced income insurance), 4 patients reduced their weekly working hours, and 3 patients lost their jobs due to complications of the disease. The data analysis revealed that, among these patients, one benefited from an income increase of about 24%, another one received a regular old-age pension, and 4 patients reported reduced income for other reasons. In total, mean income has been reduced by 26%. Considering only the 8 patients who applied for a pension, partial or total unemployment benefits resulted in an average loss of income of up to 62%. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ability to work may cause severe financial problems for those affected by the diagnosis of STS. We found an average income reduction of 26%, for those requesting pension payments of 62%. This eventually relates to a higher risk of reduced wealth and may lower the patients' social standing.","Laros, Nele; Sungu-Winkler, Kiangenda Trésor; Gutermuth, Susanne; Wartenberg, Markus; Hohenberger, Peter; Seifart, Ulf; Kasper, Bernd",Oncol Res Treat,123,10

To that end, public health authorities intervened aggressively to institute social distancing, lock-down policies, and other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Given the high social, educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them, alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect, a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in parts of the United States, daily infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This paper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a simple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics model. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by adaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social distancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems of data fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model. The paper also discusses how this simple model allows for meaningful study of the effect of population size, vaccinations, and the emergence of second waves.","Al-Radhawi, M.

However, the complexity of chemotherapy regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research on observational health databases. OBJECTIVE: To compare the anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type using the chemotherapy episodes determined by the algorithm. METHODS: We developed an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application software that visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated the trends in type of the regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two of EHR based OMOP-CDM database. The time of onset of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured as a pilot study using the AUSOM database. The anti-cancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database. RESULTS: We generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (positive predictive value over 98% in average). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimen from 2008 to 2018 were identified for 8,236 patients. In a total of 12 regimens, the number of repeated treatments, which held the largest proportion of patients, was concordant with the protocols for certain cases in wiki for standard chemotherapy regimen. Moreover, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8,315 patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to cluster in days 9 to 15, whereas it tended to be clustered in days 2 to 8 for certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. The proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework through a distributed research network.","Jeon, Hokyun; You, Seng Chan; Kang, Seok Yun; Seo, Seung In; Warner, Jeremy L; Belenkaya, Rimma; Park, Rae Woong",,123,26

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of five valved holding chambers (VHCs) on the inhalation of ciclesonide from Alvesco MDI. The aerodynamic particle size distribution of ciclesonide discharged from Alvesco MDI was evaluated using a Next Generation Impactor in the presence and absence of VHCs. The use of VHCs retained or slightly increased the amount of ciclesonide in the fine particle diameter range (aerodynamic particle size below 3 µm) (FPD) and reduced the amount at the induction port after coordinated inhalation. However, the use of VHC reduced the FPD of the formulation by increasing the time between the MDI discharge and the pump suction by various degrees among the five VHCs. These results indicated that use of the VHCs and minimizing the inhalation delay time should ensure sufficient inhalation of ciclesonide particles.","Yoshida, Hiroyuki; Abe, Yasuhiro; Usui, Akiko; Izutsu, Ken-Ichi",Yakugaku Zasshi,123,16

However, despite its diverse role in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological functions, knowledge about the KKS in vivo remains limited. The short half-lives of kinins, their low abundance and structural similarities and the artificial generation of the kinin bradykinin greatly hinder reliable and accurate determination of kinin levels in plasma. To address these issues, a sensitive LC-MS/MS platform for the comprehensive and simultaneous determination of the four active kinins bradykinin, kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and des-Arg(10)-kallidin and their major metabolites bradykinin 2-9, bradykinin 1-7 and bradykinin 1-5 was developed. This platform was validated according to the bioanalytical guideline of the US Food and Drug Administration regarding linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, carry-over, recovery, parallelism, matrix effects and stability in plasma of healthy volunteers. The validated platform encompassed a broad calibration curve range from 2.0-15.3 pg/mL (depending on the kinin) up to 1000 pg/mL, covering the expected concentrations in disease states. No source-dependent matrix effects were identified, and suitable stability of the analytes in plasma was observed. The applicability of the developed platform was proven by the determination of endogenous levels in healthy volunteers, whose plasma kinin levels were successfully detected in the low pg/mL range. The established platform facilitates the investigation of kinin-mediated diseases (e.g. angioedema, COVID-19) and enables the assessment of the impact of altered enzyme activities on the formation or degradation of kinins.","Gangnus, Tanja; Burckhardt, Bjoern B",Anal Bioanal Chem,123,25

These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness and is associated with variations in coinfection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE: Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as related to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this article seeking to further clarify the effects and underlying immunologic imprinting. METHODS: Here, we have combined a model of chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady-state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we have uncovered previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T-cell responses during immunization that are dependent on vaccine formulation and have functional impact on the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION: In addition to steady-state modifications to CD4+ T-cell polarization and B-cell priming, we have traced these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal cross talk.","Lacorcia, Matthew; Bhattacharjee, Sonakshi; Laubhahn, Kristina; Alhamdan, Fahd; Ram, Marija; Muschaweckh, Andreas; Potaczek, Daniel P; Kosinska, Anna; Garn, Holger; Protzer, Ulrike; Renz, Harald; Prazeres da Costa, Clarissa",J. allergy clin. immunol,123,20

Advancements in technology (e.g., digital devices and mHealth) enrich our ability to collect social networks and health data. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and map the use of technology in measuring older adults' social networks for health and social care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Joanna Briggs Institute methodology was followed. PubMed (MEDLINE), Sociological Abstracts, SocINDEX, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. Conference abstracts and proceedings were searched via Conference Papers Index, the American Sociological Society, and The Gerontological Society of America. Studies published in English from January 2004 to March 2020 that aimed to improve health or social care for older adults and used technology to measure social networks were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using an a priori extraction tool. RESULTS: The majority of the 18 reviewed studies were pilot or simulation research conducted in Europe that focused on older adults living in the community. The various types of technologies used can be categorized as environment-based, person-based, and data-based. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Technology facilitates objective and longitudinal data collection on the social interactions and activities of older adults. The use of technology to measure older adults' social networks, however, is primarily in an exploratory phase. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to overcome operational, analytical, and implementation challenges. Future studies should leverage technologies for addressing social isolation and care for older adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wei, Sijia; Kang, Bada; Bailey, Donald E; Caves, Kevin; Lin, Yufen; McConnell, Eleanor S; Thurow, Maria; Woodward, Amanda; Wright-Freeman, Kayla; Xue, Tingzhong Michelle; Corazzini, Kirsten N",GerontologistGerontologist,123,16

METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey on remote systems use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through the European reference center for rare and complex epilepsies (EpiCARE) network, the International and the French Leagues Against Epilepsy, and the International and the French Child Neurology Associations. After descriptive statistical analysis, we compared the results of France, China, and Italy. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two respondents from 35 countries completed the survey. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.4% had experienced remote systems for clinical care. During the pandemic, the use of remote clinics, either institutional or personal, significantly increased (pâ¯<â¯10-4). Eighty-three percent used remote systems with video, either institutional (75%) or personal (25%). During the pandemic, 84.6% of respondents involved in academic activities transformed their courses to online teaching. From February to July 2020, few scientific meetings relevant to epileptologists and routinely attended was adapted to virtual meeting (median: 1 [25th-75th percentile: 0-2]).

Time spent on internet-related activities, problematic use of internet-related activities, and psychological distress were collected from primary school students (N = 535; 265 boys; M age = 10.32 years [SD = 0.84]). The data were first collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., early November 2019) and then collected again during the school suspension due to COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., end of March 2020) for comparisons of changes. Results: Schoolchildren spent significantly more time on the smartphone (increased 1.02 h daily; P < 0.001) and social media (increased 0.73 h daily; P < 0.001) but not gaming (increased 0.14 h daily; P = 0.07) during the school suspension compared to the baseline. Schoolchildren who increased by 15 or 30 min daily on internet-related activities showed an increased level of psychological distress. The association between problematic use of social media and psychological distress was stronger during the school suspension (ß = 0.584) than at the baseline (ß = 0.451; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Increased problematic use of internet-related activities among schoolchildren was associated with greater psychological distress. Parents should therefore monitor internet-related activities and psychological distress of their children to support their mental health.","Chen, I-Hua; Chen, Chao-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Lin, Chung-Ying; Li, Xu-Dong; Tsang, Hector W H",J. behav. addict.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that brings with it fear and anxiety for all involved inclusive of nurses and patients. New guidelines for nurses to follow such as attention to physical distance coupled with the wearing of defined personal protective equipment, gloves, long-sleeved disposable gown, FFP2 face mask and eye protection place additional strain on nurses to engage therapeutically with patients. Evidence suggests that the wearing of face masks and personal protective equipment acts as barriers to effective therapeutic engagement with patients. We found an absence of communication models to help nurses engage therapeutically with patients. DESIGN: This is a position paper that draws on previous research to inform the design of a new model for nurses to engage therapeutically with patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19. METHOD: We reviewed the literature on caring for patients in isolation, the barriers to therapeutic communication and the psychological impact of infectious diseases on nurses and patients. CONCLUSION: Remaining emotionally present to self, whilst being present to others can be challenging for nurses in a pandemic environment. We believe that the ""TAGEET"" model (T-Tune-in, A-Approach and introduce, G-Ground self, E-Engage and respond, E-End encounter, T-Tune-out), although devised for nurses to engage therapeutically with patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19 could be used by all healthcare professionals in any challenging clinical environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This new therapeutic communication model will provide support for nurses with how to manage self in the context of caring for others in a COVID-19 environment.","McCarthy, Bridie; O039,; Donovan, Moira; Trace, Anna",J. clin. nurs,123,1

It is challenging to deal with these deliveries from a carrier perspective since it entails additional planning constraints, preventing an efficient consolidation of deliveries which is possible when demand is well known in advance. Furthermore, such time-sensitive deliveries are requested to a wider spatial scope than retail centers, including homes and offices. Therefore, an increase in such deliveries is considered to exacerbate negative externalities such as congestion and emissions. One of the solutions is to leverage spare capacity in passenger transport modes. This concept is often denominated as cargo-hitching. While there are various possible system designs, it is crucial that such solution does not deteriorate the quality of service of passenger trips. This research aims to evaluate the use of Mobility-On-Demand services to perform same-day parcel deliveries. For this purpose, we use SimMobility, a high-resolution agent-based simulation platform of passenger and freight flows, applied in Singapore. E-commerce demand carrier data are used to characterize simulated parcel delivery demand. Operational scenarios that aim to minimize the adverse effect of fulfilling deliveries with Mobility-On-Demand vehicles on Mobility-On-Demand passenger flows (fulfillment, wait and travel times) are explored. Results indicate that the Mobility-On-Demand services have potential to fulfill a considerable amount of parcel deliveries and decrease freight vehicle traffic and total vehicle-kilometers-travelled without compromising the quality of Mobility On-Demand for passenger travel.","Alho, Andre; Sakai, Takanori; Oh, Simon; Cheng, Cheng; Seshadri, Ravi; Chong, Wen Han; Hara, Yusuke; Caravias, Julia; Cheah, Lynette; Ben-Akiva, Moshe",,123,26

We intend to screen for crucial genes and potential molecular mechanisms in FT1D in this study. Method: We downloaded GSE44314, which includes six healthy controls and five patients with FT1D, from the GEO database. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by NetworkAnalyst. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of DEGs were screened by an online tool-Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integration Discovery (DAVID). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub genes among DEGs were analyzed by NetworkAnalyst. And we also use NetworkAnalyst to find out the microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which regulate the expression of DEGs. Result: We identified 130 DEGs (60 upregulated and 70 downregulated DEGs) between healthy controls and FT1D patients. GO analysis results revealed that DEGs were mostly enriched in generation of precursor metabolites and energy, neurohypophyseal hormone activity, and mitochondrial inner membrane. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mostly involved in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Results indicated that NCOA1, SRF, ERBB3, EST1, TOP1, UBE2S, INO80, COX7C, ITGAV, and COX6C were the top hub genes in the PPI network. Furthermore, we recognized that LDLR, POTEM, IFNAR2, BAZ2A, and SRF were the top hub genes in the miRNA-target gene network, and SRF, TSPAN4, CD59, ETS1, and SLC25A25 were the top hub genes in the TF-target gene network. Conclusion: Our study pinpoints key genes and pathways associated with FT1D by a sequence of bioinformatics analysis on DEGs.

The clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role of ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis. ACE2 blockade results in increased angiotensin II activity with simultaneous hampering of functions of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Acute respiratory distress due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and shock reported in COVID-19 patients can be explained by imbalanced angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) activities. Failure of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections indicates the importance of simultaneous induction of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis for correcting pathological conditions in COVID-19 through its anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and cardioprotective roles.

The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was employed to visualize the impact of each laboratory test on the differentiation. ResultsThe RF model incorporating results from 15 laboratory tests and demographic characteristics discriminated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, with an area under the ROC curve value 0.90 in the independent testing set. The overall agreement with the RT-PCR results was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The test with the greatest impact on the differentiation was serum total calcium level.

The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that ""The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease"" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",J. biol. regul. homeost. agents,123,26

Conclusions: Restricted measures of lockdown period during COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant reduction of QoL in our cohort of ALS patients, while caregiver burden significantly increased. ALS motor impairment may have played a role in the unchanged life conditions of patients. Instead, the restriction of family help for primary caregivers could be responsible of their increased burden, reflecting the importance of a wide social support in the management of this clinical condition.","Giusiano, Silvia; Peotta, Laura; Iazzolino, Barbara; Mastro, Enza; Arcari, Martina; Palumbo, Francesca; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Bombaci, Alessandro; Grassano, Maurizio; Cabras, Sara; Di Pede, Francesca; DeMattei, Filippo; Matteoni, Enrico; Solero, Luca; Daviddi, Margherita; Salamone, Paolina; Fuda, Giuseppe; Manera, Umberto; Canosa, Antonio; Chiò, Adriano; Calvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Vasta, Rosario",Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,123,2

Desta forma, o conhecimento sobre os patógenos que estes animais albergam passa a ser importante para orientação dos proprietários quanto aos cuidados adequados que devem ser adotados com estes animais. Os microrganismos que compõem a microbiota podem se tornar patogênicos para seus hospedeiros quando os mesmos encontram-se debilitados, bem como a eliminação contínua destes microrganismos (pelas fezes, por exemplo) por répteis aparentemente saudáveis ou mesmo doentes, pode representar um importante problema para pessoas que tenham contato com eles. Crianças, idosos e indivíduos imunossuprimidos ou imunocomprometidos são bastante suscetíveis às infecções após manipulação de répteis criados como pet.

In the animal nervous system, a systematic shift toward distal sites of transcription termination produces transcript signatures that are crucial for neuron development and function. Here, we report that, in Drosophila, the highly conserved protein ELAV globally regulates all sites of neuronal 3' end processing and directly binds to proximal polyadenylation sites of target mRNAs in vivo. We uncover an endogenous strategy of functional gene rescue that safeguards neuronal RNA signatures in an ELAV loss-of-function context. When not directly repressed by ELAV, the transcript encoding the ELAV paralog FNE acquires a mini-exon, generating a new protein able to translocate to the nucleus and rescue ELAV-mediated alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. We propose that exon-activated functional rescue is a more widespread mechanism that ensures robustness of processes regulated by a hierarchy, rather than redundancy, of effectors.","Carrasco, Judit; Rauer, Michael; Hummel, Barbara; Grzejda, Dominika; Alfonso-Gonzalez, Carlos; Lee, Yeon; Wang, Qingqing; Puchalska, Monika; Mittler, Gerhard; Hilgers, Valérie",Mol Cell,123,24

Additionally the suspension of OSCE's in 2020 due to the pandemic ,has meant this cohort of final year students have never been examined on psychiatry skills. Our aims were to assess if our student psychiatry society (PsychSoc) run OSCE could help to prepare medical students for novel virtual stations ahead of their final examinations, and how this format of mock examination could be improved in the future.MethodOur PsychSoc (QUB Mind Matters) hosted a virtual mock psychiatry OSCE for 24 final year medical students using the video conference platform Zoom, approximately 1 month before their finals. The OSCE comprised 4 stations each lasting 8 minutes, and covered psychiatric history taking, risk assessment and drug counselling. Stations were marked by psychiatry trainees in individual breakout rooms to closely simulate real examination conditions. A post-event online questionnaire was distributed to all participants. 5-point Likert scales and free text responses were used to gather feedback regarding the content and delivery of the mock. A response rate of 100% was achieved (n = 24).ResultThe feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, with 100% (n = 24) agreeing/strongly agreeing that the mock OSCE left them feeling more prepared for their final exam. 95.8% (n = 23) agreed that the opportunity to practice virtual OSCE stations improved their confidence, and all 24 students agreed/strongly agreed that they would like more practice of virtual OSCE stations. A common theme that emerged when asked how our mock could have been improved was the need for a group feedback session covering common pitfalls in addition to individual feedback.ConclusionThe lack of clinical experience and shift towards online learning has led to increased stress around clinical exams in the student population. PsychSocs can supplement formal teaching by providing students the opportunity to practice virtual communication and history taking skills that are not always covered in their undergraduate curriculum. However, as a psychiatry society our mock only assessed psychiatry skills, many of which may be relatively well suited to an online format. We would welcome further evaluation of the applicability of student run virtual mock OSCE's to other specialties. We have demonstrated that PsychSocs can offer much needed practice for students through mock OSCE's and have highlighted ways to enhance their delivery.","Conti, Isabella Gilkinson Chloe",BJPsych Open,123,24

Compared with pre-lockdown, the air quality index and concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO during the lockdown reduced, but the reductions were not very significant. NO2 levels exhibited the largest decrease (52%) during lockdown, owing to the remarkable decreased motor vehicle emissions. The highest K+ and lowest Ca2+ concentrations in PM2.5 samples could be attributed to the increase in household biomass fuel consumption in suburbs and rural areas around Xi’an and the decrease in human physical activities in Xi’an (e.g., human travel, vehicle emissions, construction activities), respectively, during the lockdown period. Secondary chemical reactions in the atmosphere increased in the lockdown period, as evidenced by the increased O3 level (increased by 160%) and OC/EC ratios in PM2.5 (increased by 26%), compared with pre-lockdown levels. The results, based on a natural experiment in this study, can be used as a reference for studying the formation and source of air pollution in Xi’an and provide evidence for establishing future long-term air pollution control policies.","Feng, Rong Xu Hongmei Wang Zexuan Gu Yunxuan Liu Zhe Zhang Haijing Zhang Tian Wang Qiyuan Zhang Qian Liu Suixin Shen Zhenxing Wang Qin",Atmosphere,123,26

Early data from China and the United States showed an increase risk in mortality in those individuals with comorbidities including chronic lung disease. Given the increase prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worldwide there was concern of increase mortality in this vulnerable population. We describe the Northwestern Medicine (NM) Hospital system experience with individuals with COPD. MethodsPatient data was obtained via the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW), which is obtained via ten hospitals in the greater Chicagoland area that supply daily data to the NMEDW. Individuals who had a hospital encounter were identified with an ICD-10 coding for CoV-19 via the NM system between March 1, 2020 and July 16, 2020. Individuals would also be identified to have COPD via ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding. A simple chi-square analysis was done between characteristics using RStudio. ResultsA total of 5,585 individuals, with a CoV-19 diagnosis, were identified, of which 4,723 had a hospital encounter. Of those, a total of 296 patients were identified to have a COPD diagnosis. Of 4,427 without COPD, 53.1% were female, 17.9% Black, 38.2% Hispanic, 5.3% were current smokers, 47.3% required hospitalization, 13.9% required ICU admission, 8.1% required mechanical ventilation, and had a mortality rate of 3.8%. Of 296 patients with a COPD, 52.0% were female, 23.6% were black, 9.1% were Hispanic, 11.8% were current smokers, 84.1% required hospitalization, 31.8% required ICU admission, 19.6% required mechanical ventilation, and had a mortality rate of 14.2%. Table 1 below shows full characteristics of patients with CoV-19 diagnosis. ConclusionsInitial data of disease severity due to CoV-19 brought concerns about patients with COPD diagnosis and their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We showcase NM system experience with individuals with COPD, that highlight higher rates of hospitalization, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, investigational use of medication, and mortality. Given the discrepancy in age between groups, we acknowledge that it likely is a potential confounding variable for our outcomes. Further research into the severity of COPD and the outcomes of individuals with CoV-19 is required. .","Meza, D.; Reyfman, P.

Although, Covid-19 commonly presents with marked respiratory symptoms in the form of cough and dyspnoea, a neurotropic presentation has been described of late as well. OBJECTIVE: In this brief communication we report four cases of Covid-19 who presented to our hospital with features suggestive of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). DISCUSSION: The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-related injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibres. The pathogenesis of GBS secondary to Covid-19 is not well understood. It is hypothesised that viral illnesses related GBS could be due to autoantibodies or direct neurotoxic effects of viruses. CONCLUSION: Nervous system involvement in Covid-19 may have been grossly underestimated. In this era of pandemic, it is very important for the physicians to be aware of association of GBS with Covid-19, as early diagnosis and treatment of this complication could have gratifying results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case series of Guillain-Barre Syndrome associated with Covid-19 to be reported from India.","Nanda, Satyan; Handa, Rahul; Prasad, Atul; Anand, Rajiv; Zutshi, Dhruv; Dass, Sujata K; Bedi, Prabhjeet Kaur; Pahuja, Aarti; Shah, Pankaj Kumar; Sharma, Bipan",Am. j. emerg. med,123,5

Although critical to reducing the virus’ reproduction rate, these restrictions come with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers who were working from home. Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal study (N = 192), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety, distractions, coping strategies, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation. This design allowed us to identify the variables that explained unique variance in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual’s well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves;(2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively;(3) productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time;and (4) longitudinal analyses did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and productivity. Overall, we conclude that working from home was per se not a significant challenge for software engineers. Finally, our study can assess the effectiveness of current work-from-home and general well-being and productivity support guidelines and provides tailored insights for software professionals.","Russo, Daniel Hanel Paul H.

Although glial populations are tightly regulated, the mechanisms regulating the population size remain poorly understood. Since Drosophila glial cells are similar to the human counterparts in their functions and shapes, rendering them an excellent model system to understand the human glia biology. Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) are important for regulating bioactive lipids. In Drosophila, there are three known LPP-encoding genes; wunen, wunen-2 and lazaro. The wunens are important for the germ cell migration and survival, and septate junction formation during tracheal development. Lazaro is involved in phototransduction. In the present study, we characterized a novel Drosophila LPP-encoding gene, CG11426. Suppression of CG11426 increased glial cell number in the eye imaginal disc during larval development, while ectopic CG11426 expression decreased it. Both types of mutation also caused defects in axon projection to the optic lobe in larval eye-brain complexes. Moreover, CG11426 promoted apoptosis via inhibiting ERK signaling in the eye imaginal disc. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that CG11426 gene product negatively regulates ERK signaling to promote apoptosis for proper maintenance of glial population in the developing eye disc.

Technical developments in Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) enable the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of DNA markers, which improves successful Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP). The EU-funded VISAGE (VISible Attributes through GEnomics) Consortium has developed various targeted MPS-based lab tools to apply FDP in routine forensic analyses. Here, we present an evaluation of the VISAGE Basic tool for appearance and ancestry prediction based on PowerSeq chemistry (Promega) on a MiSeq FGx System (Illumina). The panel consists of 153 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide information about EVCs (41 SNPs for eye, hair and skin color from HIrisPlex-S) and continental BGA (115 SNPs; three overlap with the EVCs SNP set). The assay was evaluated for sensitivity, repeatability and genotyping concordance, as well as its performance with casework-type samples. This targeted MPS assay provided complete genotypes at all 153 SNPs down to 125 pg of input DNA and 99.67% correct genotypes at 50 pg. It was robust in terms of repeatability and concordance and provided useful results with casework-type samples. The results suggest that this MPS assay is a useful tool for basic appearance and ancestry prediction in forensic genetics for users interested in applying PowerSeq chemistry and MiSeq for this purpose.","Palencia-Madrid, Leire; Xavier, Catarina; de la Puente, María; Hohoff, Carsten; Phillips, Christopher; Kayser, Manfred; Parson, Walther",,123,26

Viral pneumonia is commonly observed in COVID-19 pandemic. The number of deaths caused by viral pneumonia is mainly due to secondary bacterial or fungal infection. The immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia is poorly understood with reference to human clinical data collected from patients infected by virus and secondary bacterial or fungal infection occurring simultaneously. The co-infection inside the lungs caused by pneumonia has direct impact on the changing lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Understanding the attribution of these two immunological cells triggered by cytokines level change is of great importance to identify the progression of pneumonia from non-severe to severe state in hospitalized patients.

Unfortunately, as discussed in this article, moderate doses of genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin typical of those achieved in the clinic often invoke a cytostatic/dormancy rather than cytotoxic/apoptosis response in solid tumour-derived cell lines. This is commonly manifested by an extended apoptotic threshold, with extensive apoptosis only being seen after very high/supralethal doses of such agents. The dormancy response can be associated with senescence-like features, polyploidy and/or multinucleation, depending in part on the p53 status of the cells. In most solid tumour-derived cells, dormancy represents a long-term survival mechanism, ultimately contributing to disease recurrence. This review highlights the nonlinearity of key aspects of the molecular and cellular responses to bulky DNA lesions in human cells treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cisplatin) or ultraviolet light-C (a widely used tool for unraveling details of the DNA damage-response) as a function of the level of genotoxic stress.

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak. RESULTS: We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages. DISCUSSION: We propose a configurational approach for hospitals to design response strategies to pandemic outbreaks based on their available resources.

Nonetheless, the lignocellulose saccharification process, to release sugars for downstream applications, is one of the most crucial challenging economic factors. The synergism required among the various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) for efficient lignocellulose breakdown is often not satisfactorily achieved with an enzyme mixture from a single strain. To overcome this challenge enrichment strategies can be applied to develop microbial communities with an efficient CAZymes arsenal, incorporating complementary and synergistic properties, to improve lignocellulose deconstruction. We report a comprehensive and deep analysis of an enriched rumen anaerobic consortium (ERAC) established on sugarcane bagasse (SB). The lignocellulolytic abilities of ERAC were confirmed by analyzing the depolymerization of bagasse by scanning electron microscopy, enzymatic assays, and mass spectrometry. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S sequencing elucidated the community enrichment process, which was marked by a higher abundance of Firmicutes and Synergistetes species. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of ERAC disclosed 41 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), harboring cellulosomes and polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), along with a high diversity of CAZymes. The majority of the CAZymes predicted (60 % of the total) shared less than 90 % amino acid identity compared to sequences found in public databases. Additionally, a clostridial MAG identified in this study produces proteins during consortia development with scaffoldin domains and CAZymes appended to dockerin modules, thus representing a novel cellulosome-producing microorganism.IMPORTANCE The lignocellulolytic ERAC displays a unique set of plant polysaccharide degrading enzymes (with multimodular characteristics), cellulosomal complexes, and PULs. The MAGs described herein represent an expansion of the genetic content of rumen bacterial genomes dedicated to plant polysaccharides degradation, therefore providing a valuable resource for the development of biocatalytic toolbox strategies to be applied towards lignocellulose-based biorefineries.","Tomazetto, Geizecler; Pimentel, Agnes C; Wibberg, Daniel; Dixon, Neil; Squina, Fabio M",,123,25

Pooling the clinical samples before testing can be a good cost-saving and rapid alternative for screening large populations. The aim of this study was to compare the performance characteristics, feasibility and effectiveness of pooling nasal swab and throat swab samples for screening and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The pool testing was applied on a set of samples coming from low COVID-19 positivity areas. A total of 2410 samples were tested in pools of five samples each. A total of five pools of five samples each were generated and tested for E gene. Results: Of the total of 482 pools (2410 samples) 24 pools flagged positive. Later on pool de-convolution, a total of 26 samples were detected as positive for COVID-19, leading to positivity of about one per cent in the test population. For the diagnosis of individual samples, the pooling strategies resulted in cost savings of 75 per cent (5 samples per pool). Interpretation & conclusions: It was observed that testing samples for COVID-19 by reverse transcription (RT)- PCR after pooling could be a cost-effective method which would save both in manpower and cost especially for resource-poor countries and at a time when test kits were short in supply.","Prakash, Shantanu; Prakash, Om; Mishra, Hricha; Khan, Danish N; Shukla, Suruchi; Pandey, Ajay; Rade, Kiran; Gupta, Nivedita; Bhatt, M L B; Jain, Amita",Indian J Med Res,123,17

As a result, each species has its own distinct pattern of steroids, steroidogenic enzymes, receptors, and transporters to support its individual physiological requirements. Although the circulating steroid profile is well characterized during equine pregnancy, there is much yet to be explored regarding the factors that support steroidogenesis and steroid signaling. To obtain a holistic view of steroid-related transcripts, we sequenced chorioallantois (45 days, 4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and post-partum) and endometrium (4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and diestrus) throughout gestation, then looked in-depth at transcripts related to steroid synthesis, conjugation, transportation, and signaling. Key findings include: 1) differential expression of HSD17B isoforms among tissues (HSD17B1 high in the chorioallantois, while HSD17B2 is the dominant form in the endometrium) 2) a novel isoform with homology to SULT1A1 is the predominant sulfotransferase transcript in the chorioallantois; and 3) nuclear estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone (PGR) expression is minimal to nonexistant in the chorioallantois and pregnant endometrium. Additionally, several hypotheses have been formed, including the possibility that the 45-day chorioallantois is able to synthesize steroids de novo from acetate and that horses utilize glucuronidation to clear estrogens from the endometrium during estrous, but not during pregnancy. In summary, these findings represent an in-depth look at equine steroid-related transcripts through gestation, providing novel hypotheses and future directions for equine endocrine research.","Loux, S C; Conley, A J; Scoggin, K E; El-Sheikh Ali, H; Dini, P; Ball, B A",Reproduction,123,20

There were no significant differences in the frequency of preterm birth (8.5% vs 7.6%, standardized difference=0.032), stillbirth (0.4% vs 0.4%, standardized difference=−0.002), small for gestational age (6.4% vs 6.5%, standardized difference=−0.002), large for gestational age (7.7% vs 7.7%, standardized difference=−0.001), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (16.3% vs 15.8%, standardized difference=0.014), placental abruption (0.5% vs 0.4%, standardized difference=0.007), cesarean birth (31.2% vs 29.4%, standardized difference=0.039), or postpartum hemorrhage (3.4% vs 3.1%, standardized difference=0.019) between those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and those classified as testing negative. CONCLUSION: In a geographically diverse U.S. cohort, the frequency of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes did not differ between those delivering before compared with during the pandemic, nor between those classified as positive compared with negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.","Son, Moeun; Gallagher, Kieran; Lo, Justin Y.; Lindgren, Eric; Burris, Heather H.; Dysart, Kevin; Greenspan, Jay; Culhane, Jennifer F.; Handley, Sara C.",Obstet Gynecol,123,12

However, little is known about viral etiology related to AECOPD in Asia. We aimed to study the viral etiology of AECOPD in Hong Kong. METHODS: Patients admitted to an acute hospital in Hong Kong with AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Spirometry was performed in the stable phase at 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: There were 262 episodes of AECOPD among 196 patients (mean age, 75.7 ± 7.7 years [± SD]; 160 men). Mean FEV(1) was 39.6 ± 18.9% of predicted normal, and FEV(1)/FVC ratio was 58.0 ± 15.2%. Fifty-eight episodes (22.1%) yielded positive viral PCR results. The viruses identified were influenza A (7.3%), coronavirus OC43 (4.6%), rhinovirus (3.1%), influenza B (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (2.3%). The diagnostic yield of viral identification by PCR was 2.7 times higher than that based on conventional viral culture. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV(1) ≥ 50%, ≥ 30 to 50%, and < 30% of predicted normal. Viral infection appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year CONCLUSION: Influenza A and two less-attended viruses, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus, were the common etiologic agents in patients hospitalized with AECOPD in Hong Kong. These should be considered in developing diagnostic and intervening strategies pertaining to AECOPD.","Ko, Fanny W.S.; Ip, Margaret; Chan, Paul K.S.; Chan, Michael C.H.; To, Kin-Wang; Ng, Susanna S.S.; Chau, Shirley S.L.; Tang, Julian W.; Hui, David S.C.",Chest,123,28

Dogs’ sense of smell seems to be the main sense, allowing them to not only gather both current and historical information about their surrounding environment, but also to find the source of the smell, which is crucial for locating food, danger, or partners for reproduction. Dogs can be trained by humans to use their olfactory abilities in a variety of fields, with a detection limit often much lower than that of sophisticated laboratory instruments. The specific anatomical and physiological features of dog olfaction allow humans to achieve outstanding results in the detection of drugs, explosives, and different illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, or infectious disease. This article provides an overview of the anatomical features and physiological mechanisms involved in the process of odor detection and identification, as well as behavioral aspects of canine olfaction and its use in the service of humans in many fields. ABSTRACT: Olfaction in dogs is crucial for gathering important information about the environment, recognizing individuals, making decisions, and learning. It is far more specialized and sensitive than humans’ sense of smell. Using the strength of dogs’ sense of smell, humans work with dogs for the recognition of different odors, with a precision far exceeding the analytical capabilities of most modern instruments. Due to their extremely sensitive sense of smell, dogs could be used as modern, super-sensitive mobile area scanners, detecting specific chemical signals in real time in various environments outside the laboratory, and then tracking the odor of dynamic targets to their source, also in crowded places. Recent studies show that dogs can detect not only specific scents of drugs or explosives, but also changes in emotions as well as in human cell metabolism during various illnesses, including COVID-19 infection. Here, we provide an overview of canine olfaction, discussing aspects connected with anatomy, physiology, behavioral aspects of sniffing, and factors influencing the olfactory abilities of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris).","Kokocińska-Kusiak, Agata; Woszczyło, Martyna; Zybala, Mikołaj; Maciocha, Julia; Barłowska, Katarzyna; Dzięcioł, Michał",Animals (Basel),123,1

Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation (RCEP), the leading trading union, covers nearly third of global economy, world population, is responsible for thirty percent of global trade and global gross domestic product. The existent study tests the impact of financial, economic, political, and composite risk on consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions (CCO(2)) in selected RCEP economies during the period of 1990 to 2020. The empirical analysis consists of cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, cross-sectional augmented panel unit root test, Westerlund cointegration, second-generation cross-section augmented autoregressive distributed lags model (CS-ARDL), and panel causality test. Further, we explore the role of imports, renewable energy supply, exports, and gross domestic product per-capita on CCO(2). The empirical results suggest that the less political risk help to mitigate while the lower financial, economic, and composite risk increase CCO(2) emissions in selected RCEP economies. Moreover, exports and renewable energy supply show mitigating effect, whereas imports show upsurge in CCO(2). Additionally, a bidirectional causality exists between exports and CCO(2), imports and CCO(2), GDP per-capita and CCO(2), political risk and CCO(2), and renewable energy and CCO(2) emissions, while a one-way causality from financial risk, composite risk, and economic risk to CCO(2). Renewable energy supplies along with the improvement in sub-components of political risk, for instance, corruption, government stability, would help to effectively tackle the issue of CCO(2) emissions.","Hassan, Taimoor; Song, Huaming; Kirikkaleli, Dervis",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,123,24

In this study, hesperetin was used in a crayfish pathogen challenge to discover its effects on the innate immune system of invertebrates. The crayfish Procambarus clarkii was used as an experimental model and challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Pathogen challenge experiments showed that hesperetin treatment significantly reduced the mortality caused by WSSV infection, while the VP28 copies of WSSV were also reduced. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that hesperetin increased the expression of several innate immune-related genes, including NF-kappaB and C-type lectin. Further analysis showed that hesperetin treatment plays a positive effects on three immune parameters like total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activity. Nevertheless, whether or not infected with WSSV, hesperetin treatment would significantly increase the hemocyte apoptosis rates in crayfish. These results indicated that hesperetin could regulate the innate immunity of crayfish, and delaying and reducing the mortality after WSSV challenge. Therefore, the present study provided novel insights into the potential therapeutic or preventive functions associated with hesperetin to regulate crayfish immunity and protect crayfish against WSSV infection, provide certain theoretical basis for production practice.","Qian, Xiyi; Zhu, Fei",Fish Shellfish Immunol,123,1

Here, A9, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of the tyrphostin class, is identified as a robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell-based assays. Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.","Dong, Wanyu; Xie, Wenting; Liu, Yunbo; Sui, Baokun; Zhang, Hao; Liu, Liran; Tan, Yubei; Tong, Xiaohan; Fu, Zhen F.; Yin, Ping; Fang, Liurong; Peng, Guiqing",Antiviral Res,123,12

METHODS We searched the electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar from January 2020 to February 2021. To perform meta-analysis, the random effects model was used. To assess the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies, the I2 index was used, and 95% CI was estimated. Data analysis was performed by R software. RESULTS In the final analysis, 46 articles with the total sample size of 61 551 hospital staff members were included. Accordingly, anxiety prevalence among healthcare workers (HCWs) was 26.1% (95% CI 19% to 34.6%). The prevalence rates of anxiety in health technicians and medical students were 39% (95% CI 13% to 73%) and 36% (95% CI 15% to 65%), respectively, indicating a much higher prevalence than other hospital staff members. Furthermore, a positive significant relationship between prevalence of anxiety among HCWs and their age was approved (p<0.001). The prevalence rate of anxiety was higher among women 37.7% (95% CI 25.4% to 51.8%) than men 27.2% (95% CI 18.2% to 38.6%). CONCLUSION The findings show a moderately high prevalence rate of anxiety in hospital staff. Due to the high prevalence of this mental health problem in health technicians, medical students and frontline health workers, it is highly suggested that healthcare institutions offer mental health programmes for these working groups in order to appropriately manage anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raoofi, Samira; Pashazadeh Kan, Fatemeh; Rafiei, Sima; Khani, Saghar; Hosseinifard, Hossein; Tajik, Fatemeh; Masoumi, Maryam; Raoofi, Neda; Ahmadi, Saba; Aghalou, Sepideh; Torabi, Fatemeh; Dehnad, Afsaneh; Hoseinipalangi, Zahra; Rezaei, Sepide; Shabaninejad, Hosein; Ghashghaee, Ahmad",BMJ supportive & palliative care,123,26

Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.","Pramanik, Avijit; Gao, Ye; Patibandla, Shamily; Mitra, Dipanwita; McCandless, Martin G.; Fassero, Lauren A.; Gates, Kalein; Tandon, Ritesh; Chandra Ray, Paresh",Nanoscale advances,123,26

This led not only to a delayed end of treatment but also to accidents and complications. The present study tried to evaluate the orthodontic situation both from the patient’s and orthodontist’s point of view, so the patients were given a few questions to answer, and the orthodontist analyzed each treatment before and after the two-month lockdown and decided if it was mildly or severely affected by the absence of check-ups. The study group consisted of 105 patients evaluated by three orthodontists in the same private practice. Patients that have gotten worse after the lockdown or who had problems were included in the study. Also, all the patients were given a 7-question form in order to find out their opinion. After two months without check-ups, our orthodontists found that 9.52% got worse because of the lack of intermaxillary elastics, broken brackets, broken removable orthodontic appliances, and others. Most of the patients believe that their treatment was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, but none of the patients felt unsafe when visiting the clinic.

Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay of acute stroke in China. Methods: This study included patients with acute stroke admitted in two hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Patients admitted before and after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak (January 31, 2020, as officially announced by Chinese government) were compared for pre- (measured as onset-to-door time) and post-hospital delay (measured as door-to-needle time). The influence factors for delayed treatment (indicated as onset-to-needle time >4.5 hours) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Onset-to-door time increased from 202 min (IQR 65-492) before to 317 min (IQR 75-790) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.001). Door-to-needle time increased from 50min (IQR 40-75) before to 65 min (IQR 48-84) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.048). The proportion of patients with intravenous thrombolysis in those with acute ischemic stroke was decreased significantly after the pandemic (15.4% vs 20.1%; P=0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients after COVID-19 pandemic, lower educational level, rural residency, mild symptoms and transported by other means than ambulance were associated with delayed treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has remarkable impacts on the management of acute ischemic stroke. Both pre- and post-hospital delays were prolonged significantly, and proportion of patient arrived within the 4.5-hour time window for intravenous thrombolysis treatment was decreased. Given that anti-COVID-19 measures are becoming medical routines, efforts are warranted to shorten the delay so that the outcomes of stroke could be improved.","Xu, G.; Gu, S.",,123,16

These predictions are often based on parasite optima or evolutionary equilibria derived from models of host-parasite dynamics. Yet even when such models accurately capture the parasite optima, newly invading parasites will typically not be at their optima. Here we show that parasite invasion of a host population can occur despite highly nonoptimal virulence. Fitness improvements soon after invasion may proceed through many steps with wide changes in virulence, because fitness depends on transmission as well as virulence, and transmission improvements can overwhelm nonoptimal virulence. This process is highly sensitive to mutation supply and the strength of selection. Importantly, the same invasion principle applies to the evolution of established parasites, whenever mutants arise that overcome host immunity/resistance. A host population may consequently experience repeated invasions of new parasite variants and possible large shifts in virulence as it evolves in an arms race with the parasite. An experimental study of phage lysis time and examples of mammalian viruses matching some of these characteristics are reviewed.","Bull, James J; Ebert, Dieter",Evol Appl,123,21

Herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions are ongoing. However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available, and inexpensive treatment. Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of established molecular targets could provide a pause in disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 shares extensive structural and functional conservation with SARS-CoV-1, including engagement of the same host cell receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains. These lipid-enveloped viruses encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment in a critical step of infection and maturation. Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare monogenic neurodegenerative disease caused by deficient efflux of lipids from the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L). The NP-C disease-causing gene (NPC1) has been strongly associated with viral infection, both as a filovirus receptor (e.g., Ebola) and through LE/L lipid trafficking. This suggests that NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in preclinical studies, without causing NP-C disease. Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity. We suggest that known mechanistic information on NPC1 could be utilized to identify existing and future drugs to treat COVID-19.","Sturley, Stephen L.; Rajakumar, Tamayanthi; Hammond, Natalie; Higaki, Katsumi; Márka, Zsuzsa; Márka, Szabolcs; Munkacsi, Andrew B.",J Lipid Res,123,1

We examine the effectiveness of such policies using a cross-country variation in socio-economic, environmental and geographic, and health system dimensions. The effectiveness of policies that prescribe closures of schools and workplaces is declining with population density, country surface area, employment rate and proportion of elderly in the population; and increasing with GDP per capita and health expenditure. Cross-country human mobility data reinforce some of these results. We argue that the findings can be explained by behavioural response to risk perceptions and resource constraints. Voluntary practice of social distancing might be less prevalent in communities with lower perceived risk, associated with better access to health care and smaller proportion of elderly population. Higher population density, larger geographical area, and higher employment rate may require more resources to ensure compliance with lockdown policies.","Castex, Gonzalo; Dechter, Evgenia; Lorca, Miguel",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,123,20

However, the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) severity and long‐term anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody level is poorly understood. Here, we measured the longevity of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific IgG antibodies in survivors who had recovered from COVID‐19 1 year previously. In a cohort of 473 survivors with varying disease severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe), we observed a positive correlation between virus‐specific IgG antibody titers and COVID‐19 severity. In particular, the highest virus‐specific IgG antibody titers were observed in patients with severe COVID‐19. By contrast, 74.4% of recovered asymptomatic carriers had negative anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG test results, while many others had very low virus‐specific IgG antibody titers. Our results demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific IgG persistence and titer depend on COVID‐19 severity.","Yan, Xiquan; Chen, Guoqiang; Jin, Zhaoxia; Zhang, Zhongwei; Zhang, Bing; He, Jiangming; Yin, Siqing; Huang, Juanshu; Fan, Maiying; Li, Zhenyuan; Chen, Fang; Zeng, Yong; Han, Xiaotong; Zhu, Yimin",J Med Virol,123,1

The effect of the pandemic on the quantity and quality of pediatric traumas is unclear and has a direct bearing on how scarce hospital resources should be allocated in a pandemic situation. METHODS: A retrospective review of the trauma registry was performed for trauma activations in the years 2018 through 2020 during the months of March, April, and May. Demographic and injury specific datapoints were compared across calendar years. RESULTS: There were 111, 100, and 52 trauma activations during the study interval in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. There were fewer highest severity level activations in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019 (1 vs 5 and 9; p < 0.01). The median Injury Severity Score was 5 in 2020 compared to 4 in both 2018 and 2019 (p < 0.01). More patients went directly to the operating room in 2020 compared to prior years (21.2% vs 8% and 6.1%; p < 0.01). There were fewer discharges from the emergency department (ED) (12.1% vs 36.6% and 32.7%). No increase in the number of child abuse reports and investigations was noted. There was no difference in the proportion of blunt versus penetrating trauma between years (p = 0.57). No pedestrians were struck by automobiles in 2020 compared to 12 and 14 in 2018 and 2019. However, there were a greater proportion of injuries from falls during 2020 compared to prior years. CONCLUSIONS: There were fewer trauma activations during the peak of the COVID pandemic compared to prior years. Due to the decrease in trauma volume during the peak of the pandemic, hospital resources could potentially be reallocated toward areas of greater need.

In this study, we describe a modified protocol of this assay for sensitive detection of functional antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells using a monoclonal antibody (clone m24 Ab) specific for the open, high-affinity conformation of the β(2)-integrin. The kinetics of β(2)-integrin activation was different on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (several hours vs. few minutes, respectively); however, m24 Ab readily stained both cell types 4–6 h after antigen stimulation. With this protocol, we were able to monitor ex vivo effector and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in whole blood or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected or vaccinated individuals. By costaining β(2)-integrin with m24 and CD154 Abs, we assessed extremely low frequencies of polyfunctional CD4(+) T cell responses. The novel assay used in this study allows very sensitive and simultaneous screening of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell reactivities, with versatile applicability in clinical and vaccination studies.","Schöllhorn, Anna; Schuhmacher, Juliane; Besedovsky, Luciana; Fendel, Rolf; Jensen, Anja T.

The spectrum of COVID-19 is broad, from clinical disease requiring intensive medical care to less severe symptoms that are treated with supportive care. The majority of COVID-19 cases fall into the mild-to-moderate category, with symptoms lasting less than 6 weeks. Nevertheless, the morbidity from COVID-19 is significant and can affect multiple body systems, most frequently the cardiac, pulmonary, hematologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems. For patients who wish to return to exercise after mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the wide range of disease expression presents a challenge for clinicians seeking to offer counsel. This literature review on return to activity following mild to moderate COVID-19 in the recreational athlete includes evidence-based considerations and recommendations for clinicians in guiding the safest return to activity.

PARTICIPANTS & SETTING: Participants were recruited at the pediatric hematology-oncology clinic of a university hospital in Turkey. A purposive sampling strategy was used to identify participants. Parents who had a child aged 0-18 years with cancer were eligible. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: This study was conducted using a descriptive qualitative research design. Semistructured individual interviews with 14 parents of children with cancer were used for data collection. Data were analyzed using the content analysis method. FINDINGS: Two main themes with related subthemes were identified that revealed the lived experiences of parents of children with cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Pediatric oncology nurses can develop clinical practices that help parents to cope with anxiety about COVID-19. Nurses should share with parents current and valid information about the child's care during the pandemic. Future research should examine the experiences of children with cancer and their parents from different cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Gürcan, Meltem; Çelebi, Tugba; Turan, Sevcan",Oncol Nurs Forum,123,2
