422,"A cross-sectional survey to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination among European travellers to resource-limited destinations",2010-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in travellers. By performing two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys during winter 2009 and winter 2010 among European travellers to resource-limited destinations, we aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in the waiting room to the visitors of the University of Zurich Centre for Travel' Health (CTH) in January and February 2009 and January 2010 prior to travel health counselling (CTH09 and CTH10). Questions included demographic data, travel-related characteristics and KAP regarding influenza vaccination. Data were analysed by using SPSS(® )version 14.0 for Windows. Differences in proportions were compared using the Chi-square test and the significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. Predictors for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination were determined by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: With a response rate of 96.6%, 906 individuals were enrolled and 868 (92.5%) provided complete data. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 13.7% (n = 119). Only 43 (14.2%) participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1, mostly having received both vaccines simultaneously, the seasonal and pandemic one. Job-related purposes (44, 37%), age > 64 yrs (25, 21%) and recommendations of the family physician (27, 22.7%) were the most often reported reasons for being vaccinated. In the multiple logistic regression analyses of the pooled data increasing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), a business trip (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 - 0.92) and seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous winter seasons (OR = 12.91, 95% CI 8.09 - 20.58) were independent predictors for seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009 or 2010. Influenza vaccination recommended by the family doctor (327, 37.7%), travel to regions with known high risk of influenza (305, 35.1%), and influenza vaccination required for job purposes (233, 26.8%) were most frequently mentioned to consider influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception and vaccination coverage concerning seasonal and pandemic influenza was very poor among travellers to resource-limited destinations when compared to traditional at-risk groups. Previous access to influenza vaccination substantially facilitated vaccinations in the subsequent year. Information strategies about influenza should be intensified and include health professionals, e.g. family physicians, travel medicine practitioners and business enterprises.","Pfeil, Alena; Mütsch, Margot; Hatz, Christoph; Szucs, Thomas D",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912811/,180
1282,Sociotechnical Challenges and Progress in Using Social Media for Health,2013-10-22,"Social media tools that connect patients, caregivers, and health providers offer great potential for helping people access health advice, receive and give social support, manage or cope with chronic conditions, and make day-to-day health decisions. These systems have seen widespread adoption, but often fail to support the goals as fully as designers and users would like. Through Ackerman’s lens of the “sociotechnical gap” and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) as a science of the artificial, we review contemporary sociotechnical challenges and progress for using social media to support health. These challenges include a tension between privacy and sharing, policy information credibility, accessibility, and tailoring in social spaces. Those studying, building, deploying, and using social media systems to further health goals will benefit from approaching this work by borrowing from Ackerman’s framing of CSCW. In particular, this requires acknowledgment that technical systems will not fully meet our social goals, and then adopting design and educational approaches that are appropriate to fill this gap, building less-nuanced systems as partial solutions and tools for advancing our understanding, and by working with the CSCW research community to develop and pursue key lines of inquiry.","Munson, Sean A; Cavusoglu, Hasan; Frisch, Larry; Fels, Sidney",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3806390/,180

Method: Before starting the study, YouTube(TM) search terms were determined by consensus by two General Surgeons. Then, on 10/10/2020, the terms such as “pancreatic cancer”, “diagnosis of pancreatic cancer” and “treatment of pancreatic cancer” were entered separately in the search bar of YouTube, “relevance” was selected among the filtering options and the most viewed videos were listed. The videos were evaluated with the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the DISCERN scoring system (Quality Criteria for Consumer Health Information, http://www.discern.org.uk), and video power index. Results: Among the 50 videos analysed, 19 videos were uploaded by hospital channels, 17 videos by health channels, seven videos by patients, four videos by blog channels, and three videos by doctors. The mean GQS score of the first researcher was 3.24 ± 0.99 and the mean GQS score of the second researcher was 3.18 ± 0.88 with a significantly high agreement between them (r= 0.628). The mean DISCERN score of the first researcher was 3.48 ± 0.77 and the mean DISCERN score of the second researcher was 3.46 ± 1.09 with a significantly high agreement between them (r= 0.814). Conclusion: In our study, the majority of the videos were found to be of moderate quality. Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to upload more videos with useful content. However, we think that the uploaded videos should definitely go through a professional peer-review process before they are published.","Cakmak, Guner; Mantoglu, Baris",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065091/,180

The present study focuses on the still unanswered questions about what happens with the chemical composition and the physicochemical properties of these products using Hypericum Perforatum L as a representative paradigm. All samples were prepared according to manufacturing procedures described mainly in S. Hahnemann's “Organon” and were examined by SEM, XRD, FTIR, DLS micro Mastersizer, DLS nano Zetasizer, UV-Vis and TEM. Measurements of electrical conductivity and pH were effectuated by the appropriate devices. During trituration of source material in alpha-lactose monohydrate some functional chemical groups present in source material disappeared and some others new ones came in view at the end of the process. A differentiation upon physicochemical properties between the source material and final triturating product was viewed, as well as micro-nanoparticles in colloidal form in all potencies derived trituration or extraction origin were present. The findings showed that the whole preparation process leads to the creation of micro nanoparticles something that for solid origin these products are created by trituration and for extract origin products these nanoparticles exist from the beginning.","Kalliantas, Dimitris; Kallianta, Meletia; Kordatos, Konstantinos; Karagianni, Chaido Stefania",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082213/,180
17834,Stoma care research in low- and middle-income countries: update from the NIHR global health research unit on global surgery,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most serious complications after diabetes poor control, which seriously threatens human life, health, and safety. DKA can rapidly develop within hours or days leading to death. Early evaluation of the prognosis of DKA patients and timely and effective intervention are very important to improve the prognosis of patients. The combination of several variables or characteristics is used to predict the poor prognosis of DKA, which can allocate resources reasonably, which is beneficial to the early classification intervention and clinical treatment of the patients. METHODS: For the acquisition of required data of eligible prospective/retrospective cohort study or randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we will search for publications from PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google scholar, China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP). Two independent reviewers will read the full English text of the articles, screened and selected carefully, removing duplication. Then we evaluate the quality and analyses data by Review Manager (V.5.4). Results data will be pooled and meta-analysis will be conducted if there's 2 eligible studies considered. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the value of the prediction models for the prognosis of DKA in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide clinical basis for predicting the prognosis of DKA. It helps us to understand the value of predictive models in evaluating the early prognosis of DKA. The conclusions drawn from this study may be beneficial to patients, clinicians, and health-related policy makers.

18110,Contributions of family physicians to health care services in Nigeria,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Cape Town Minstrel Carnival is one of the oldest and most authentic indigenous New Year’s customs in South Africa. Musicians who perform at this carnival are exposed to excessively loud music and therefore at a risk of acquiring noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine patterns of exposure to loud music and prevalence of hearing loss amongst Cape Town Minstrel Carnival musicians. METHOD: A descriptive, observational exploratory survey design was used and 43 participants (21 males and 22 females; mean age, 21 ± 9 years) took part in this study. Sound level measurements were conducted to assess musicians’ sound exposure during rehearsals and performances. All participants underwent the following audiological test battery at least 2 h before music exposure: Case history, otoscopic examination, tympanometry, pure tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). RESULTS: Average noise levels recorded were 86 dBA during rehearsals and 98.7 dBA at performances and average durations of exposure were 240 and 10 min at rehearsals and performances, respectively. One out of 43 (1/43) participants presented with sensorineural hearing loss. Audiometric results of the remaining participants were normal and did not show a pattern suggestive of NIHL. A high proportion of participants (21/43) reported experiencing tinnitus. CONCLUSION: Despite being exposed to high levels of noise, there was a low prevalence of hearing loss amongst these musicians. However, a high proportion of them reported tinnitus, which could be an indication that they were at a high risk of NIHL from the music that they played.","Ramma, Lebogang",S Afr J Commun Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182564/,180
18583,A focus group study of older Chinese people with CVD patients in the North West of the UK,2021-06-02,"Omics data can be integrated into a reference model using various model extraction methods (MEMs) to yield context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). How to chose the appropriate MEM, thresholding rule and threshold remains a challenge. We integrated mouse transcriptomic data from a Cyp51 knockout mice diet experiment (GSE58271) using five MEMs (GIMME, iMAT, FASTCORE, INIT an tINIT) in a combination with a recently published mouse GEM iMM1865. Except for INIT and tINIT, the size of extracted models varied with the MEM used (t-test: p-value [Formula: see text] 0.001). The Jaccard index of iMAT models ranged from 0.27 to 1.0. Out of the three factors under study in the experiment (diet, gender and genotype), gender explained most of the variability ([Formula: see text] 90%) in PC1 for FASTCORE. In iMAT, each of the three factors explained less than 40% of the variability within PC1, PC2 and PC3. Among all the MEMs, FASTCORE captured the most of the true variability in the data by clustering samples by gender. Our results show that for the efficient use of MEMs in the context of omics data integration and analysis, one should apply various MEMs, thresholding rules, and thresholding values to select the MEM and its configuration that best captures the true variability in the data. This selection can be guided by the methodology as proposed and used in this paper. Moreover, we describe certain approaches that can be used to analyse the results obtained with the selected MEM and to put these results in a biological context.","Walakira, Andrew; Rozman, Damjana; Režen, Tadeja; Mraz, Miha; Moškon, Miha",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225705/,180
18667,COVID‐19 in schools,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Stepping into the role of an unpaid caregiver to offer help is often considered a natural expectation of family members or friends. In Canada, such contributions are substantial in terms of healthcare provision but this comes at a considerable cost to the caregivers in both health and economic terms. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of a collection of qualitative interviews with 39 caregivers of people with chronic physical illness to assess how they described their particular roles in caring for a loved one. We used a model of caregiving roles, originally proposed by Twigg in 1989, as a guide for our analysis, which specified three predominant roles for caregivers – as a resource, as a co-worker, and as a co-client. RESULTS: The caregivers in this collection spoke about their roles in ways that aligned well with these roles, but they also described tasks and activities that fit best with a fourth role of ‘care-coordinator’, which required that they assume an oversight role in coordinating care across institutions, care providers and often advocate for care in line with their expectations. For each of these types of roles, we have highlighted the limitations and challenges they described in their interviews. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that a deeper understanding of the different roles that caregivers assume, as well as their challenges, can contribute to the design and implementation of policies and services that would support their contributions and choices as integral members of the care team. We provide some examples of system-level policies and programs from different jurisdictions developed in recognition of the need to sustain caregivers in their role and respond to such limitations.","Law, Susan; Ormel, Ilja; Babinski, Stephanie; Kuluski, Kerry; Quesnel-Vallée, Amélie",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243301/,180

19582,The silent half,2021-03-25,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the etiology, previous cardiac procedure methods and outcomes of redo aortic root replacement after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who underwent aortic root replacement surgery in our hospital from February 2010 to February 2020 who underwent at least one cardiac surgery in the past, including 27 males and 14 females, with an average age of 49.5 ± 10.2 years old. Indications for reoperation include: aortic sinus dilation and ascending aortic aneurysm in 20 cases (48.8%), recurrent aortic dissection in 7 cases (17.1%), pseudoaneurysm of aortic root in 4 cases (9.8%), prosthetic valve endocarditis in 5 cases (12.2%) and paravalvular leakage in 5 cases (12.2%). According to whether the previous procedure involved aortic root surgery, they were divided into 2 groups, namely aortic root surgery-involved (ARS) group and non-aortic root surgery-involved (NRS) group. After the patients were discharged from hospitals, follow-ups were carried out through outpatient clinic or telephone for 5 years. Kaplan-Meier was used for survival analysis. RESULTS: All patients underwent Bentall procedure with a median sternum incision. Six patients (14.6%) died during the postoperative hospitalization and 3 patients (8.6%) died during the follow-up. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in ARS group were 92.6, 92.6, and 92.6%, respectively; the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in NRS group were 100, 85.7, and 85.7%, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the cause of redo aortic root replacement, procedure time, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, hospital mortality, and 5-year cumulative survival (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Redo aortic root replacement is difficult and high risk. Bentall procedure is still a reliable surgical option for redo aortic root replacement, with good short- and mid-term results. The prognosis of redo aortic root replacement is not necessarily related to the etiology of patient’s surgery and the methods of previous cardiac procedure.","Deng, Jianying; Zhong, Qianjin",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316709/,180
19813,How to improve the quality of care for people on home mechanical ventilation from the perspective of healthcare professionals: a qualitative study,2021-08-05,"Most previous research has examined the relationship between FB addiction and burnout level by conducting cross-sectional studies. Little is known about the impact of changes in burnout on FB addiction in an educational context. Through a two-way longitudinal survey of a student population sample (N = 115), this study examined the influence of changes in academic burnout over time and FB motives and importance (measured at the beginning and the end of the semester) on FB intrusion measured at the end of the academic semester. The findings show that: (1) increases in cynicism and in FB motives and importance significantly predicted time2 FB intrusion; (2) FB importance enhanced the prediction power of changes in the academic burnout total score, exhaustion and personal inefficacy, and reduced the regression coefficient of changes in cynicism; (3) the interaction effects between FB social motive use and changes in academic burnout, as well as between FB importance and personal inefficacy and exhaustion, accounted for a significant change in the explained variance of time2 FB intrusion. About 20–30% of the variance in time2 FB intrusion was explained by all the examined variables and by the interactions between them. The results suggest that changes in academic burnout and FB motives and importance are suppressive variables, as including these variables in the regression model all together changed the significance of the relationship between independent variables and FB intrusion.","Tomaszek, Katarzyna; Muchacka-Cymerman, Agnieszka",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345621/,180
21304,Collaboration amongst general practitioners and gynaecologists working in primary health care in Germany: a cross-sectional study,2020-05-06,"Telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes, shorten with age, as telomerase, the enzyme responsible for the compensation of telomere erosion, is inactive in the majority of cells. Telomere shortening and subsequent cell senescence lead to tissue aging and age-related diseases. Neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by the progressive loss of neurons among other hallmarks of aged tissue, and poor cognitive function, have been associated with a short telomere length. Thus, telomerase activity has emerged as a therapeutic target, with novel agents being under investigation. The present study aimed to examine the effects of a novel natural telomerase activator, 'Reverse™', containing Centella asiatica extract, vitamin C, zinc and vitamin D3 on the brains of 18-month-old rats. The administration of the 'Reverse™' supplement for 3 months restored telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression in the brains of rats, as revealed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In addition, the findings from PCR-ELISA demonstrated an enhanced telomerase activity in the cerebellum and cortex cells in the brains of rats treated with the 'Reverse™' supplement. The histopathological findings confirmed a structural reversibility effect close to the differentiation observed in the young control group of rats treated with two capsules/kg body weight of the 'Reverse™' supplement. On the whole, the findings of the present study provide a strong indication that an increased telomerase activity and TERT expression may be achieved not only in the postnatal or embryonic period, but also in the brains of middle-aged rats through nutraceutical supplementation. The use of the 'Reverse™' supplement may thus contribute to the potential alleviation of a number of central nervous system diseases.","Tsoukalas, Dimitris; Buga, Ana Maria; Docea, Anca Oana; Sarandi, Evangelia; Mitrut, Radu; Renieri, Elisavet; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Rogoveanu, Ion; Cercelaru, Liliana; Niculescu, Mihaela; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Calina, Daniela",Int J Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448543/,180
21506,Assessing Barriers to Effective Coverage of Health Services for Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Scoping Review,2021-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Registered midwives in British Columbia (BC) are primary health care practitioners for healthy people throughout pregnancy and for approximately 6 weeks postpartum. BC registered midwives are authorized to prescribe and administer certain vaccines to adults under their care during the perinatal period and hepatitis B vaccine to high‐risk newborns. However, little has been documented about their recommendations for, and administration of, prenatal and infant vaccinations. This study surveyed midwives currently practicing in British Columbia to understand their vaccination practices. METHODS: An online survey was administered to the members of the Midwives Association of BC in spring 2018. Outcome measures were the proportion of midwives who discussed, recommended, and administered the following vaccines: influenza, varicella, rubella, and infant hepatitis B. The proportion of midwives who discussed and recommended infant vaccines was measured. Barriers to discussion, recommendation, and administration of vaccines were captured. RESULTS: Sixty‐three percent of 108 respondents administered vaccines to their clients. Hepatitis B and rubella were the most frequent vaccines administered. Logistical concerns were the greatest barrier to vaccine administration. This was followed by the perception that vaccine administration is not within the scope of practice of midwives, especially for influenza vaccine. Midwives who administered vaccines were significantly more likely to discuss and recommend vaccines to their clients and their infants. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of BC midwives discuss, recommend, and administer vaccines to their clients. Our survey highlighted key areas to address to strengthen midwifery capacity to discuss, recommend, and provide prenatal and infant vaccines.","Bettinger, Julie A.; Rubincam, Clara; Greyson, Devon; Weissinger, Sandra; Naus, Monika",Birth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8453565/,180

23247,Le contrôle des infections au cabinet du pédiatre,2008-05-01,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections have been associated with altered host defense and increased susceptibility to secondary infection. In previous experiments, we observed impaired migratory and chemotactic activity of neutrophils harvested from mice during sublethal murine CMV (MCMV) infection. To investigate further the effects of CMV infection upon phagocytic leukocytes, we incubated murine leukocyte suspensions (95% neutrophils) in vitro with MCMV derived either from tissue culture passage or salivary gland homogenate. Neutrophils incubated with salivary gland MCMV had depressed chemotactic activity at 2 and 4 h. For example, at 4 h the mean chemotactic index of neutrophils incubated with MCMV was 0.92 vs 2.56 in controls (p<0.01). Phagocytic activity at 4 h was also reduced (mean of 1.53 latex particles/cell in MCMV-incubated vs 2.39 in controls, p<0.01). In contrast, tissue culture-passed MCMV did not alter leukocyte function. Adherence of MCMV to phagocytic leukocytes was comparable to adherence of virus to mouse embryo fibroblast cells (2 to 3 log plaque forming units of MCMV/10(6) cells). Transmission electron microscopy at 4 h demonstrated occasional intracytoplasmic virions. These results indicate that impaired chemotactic and phagocytic activity of phagocytic leukocytes occurs after in vitro incubation with salivary gland-derived MCMV but not with tissue culture-passed virus. These differences may be attributable to altered virulence of MCMV or to the presence of soluble factors in salivary gland MCMV pools","Bale, James F; O'Neil, Marsha",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100069/,180

The most common form of treatment is antibiotics, even though many cases may not have a bacterial etiology. The most common bacterial organisms in childhood sinusitis belong to the group that cause many childhood upper respiratory and lower respiratory infections and include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Besides antibiotics, other treatments are aimed at assisting with drainage, and this can be accomplished by reducing the inflammation and edema that prevents venting of the sinus structures. These medications can include antihistamines, decongestants, intranasal steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and, in some countries, mucolytics. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) techniques including Chinese herbal medications are often used, but there is little scientific evidence to support their use.

The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations—to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data.

Therefore, 243 students (sport science, humanities, natural sciences) answered questions concerning (a) the amount and type of their physical activity before and during the pandemic, (b) their well-being and (c) their optimism/pessimism. The main result of the study is that the type and the motives for sports and physical activity changed for the study participants during the coronavirus pandemic: Team sports and swimming decreased, while individual sports and physical activity not associated with a sports club/business and with digital media increased. In this study the difference in sports and physical activity seemed to be related to well-being, especially for the students of sport science and humanities.

They are also applicable to spin density matrices associated with Slater determinants. When the ranks of the matrices differ, unit eigenvalues occur. In addition, there are ±w pairs of eigenvalues where |w| ≤ 1, whose values are related to overlaps, t, between the corresponding orbitals of Amos and Hall, and Löwdin by the formula w=±1-t2 12. Generalized overlap amplitudes, including Dyson orbitals and their probability factors, may be inferred from these eigenvalues, which provide numerical criteria for: classifying transitions according to the number of holes and particles in final states with respect to initial states, identifying the most important effects of orbital relaxation produced by self-consistent fields, and the analysis of Fukui functions. Two similar theorems that apply to sums of idempotent matrices regenerate formulae for the natural orbitals and occupation numbers of an unrestricted Slater determinant that were published first by Amos and Hall.","Ortiz, J V; Zalik, R A",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0019542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962381/,180

METHODS We conducted a retrospective national cohort study using Veterans Affairs administrative data including subjects >or=65 years of age hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation. Our primary analysis was a multilevel model with the dependent variable of 90-day mortality and hospital as a random effect, controlling for preexisting comorbid conditions, demographics, and other medications prescribed. RESULTS We identified 11,212 subjects with a mean age of 74.0 years, 98% were male, and 12.4% of subjects died within 90-days of hospital presentation. In this cohort, 20.3% of subjects were using statins, 32.0% were using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). After adjusting for potential confounders, current statin use (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.64) and ACE inhibitor/ARB use (0.55, 0.46-0.66) were significantly associated with decreased 90-day mortality. CONCLUSION Use of statins and ACE inhibitors prior to admission is associated with decreased mortality in subjects hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation. Randomized controlled trials are needed to examine whether the use of these medications are protective for those patients with COPD exacerbations.","Mortensen, Eric M; Copeland, Laurel A; Pugh, Mary Jo V; Restrepo, Marcos I; de Molina, Rosa Malo; Nakashima, Brandy; Anzueto, Antonio",Respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19493329/,180

66354,From Housing Instability to a Home: The Effects of Furniture and Household Goods on Well-being.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Biodiversity has intrinsic value and a fundamental role in human health. The relationship between them is complex, and the specific sustaining processes are still not well understood. In view of the rapidly evolving landscape, this literature review investigated scientific evidence for specific links between biodiversity and human infectious and non-communicable diseases to characterise identifiable relationships. METHODS A search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases using keyword algorithms identified relevant manuscripts published between 1 January 2000 and 18 April 2019. Qualitative data were extracted from 155 studies investigating links between or mechanisms linking biodiversity and infectious disease, non-communicable disease, allergic/inflammatory disease and microbiomes. RESULTS None of the reviewed studies documented causal evidence for a mechanism linking biodiversity and human health. The main mechanisms proposed to link biodiversity and transmission of infectious disease were dilution and amplification. The dilution hypothesis argues that an increase in species diversity leads to a decrease in pathogen prevalence. The amplification effect is the converse, that there is a positive correlation between species diversity and disease risk/infection prevalence. Several driving factors are postulated, including encounter reduction, interspecies competition and predation. In addition, it appears that scale, both spatial and temporal, highly impacts diversity-disease relationships. There is strong evidence that the early environment of a child, including maternally transferred prenatal signals, affects immune maturation, modifying later disease risk. Bi-directional axes communicate between the gut microbiome and the brain, as well as between the skin microbiome and the lung, leading to direct and indirect immune, humoral and neural mechanisms. The main challenges in assessing links between biodiversity and human health are the wide variation in definitions of health and biodiversity, and the heterogeneity in types of studies encountered, as well as the complexity of interactions in dynamic systems. CONCLUSIONS Contextually adapted integrative approaches, which maintain dialogue across disciplines and amongst all stakeholders, are most likely to generate robust evidence. Because of the relevance of local scale, research engagement must occur across levels to generate legitimate practices and translate into sustainable, equitable policies. Recommendations for future action include: improve the knowledge base on contribution of biodiversity to health, increase awareness of health effects of natural and near-natural environments and biodiversity, and promote synergies by increasing policy coherence.","Crump, Lisa; Martinoli, Danièle; Zinsstag, Jakob",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.20485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33873205/,180
67685,New long-acting monoclonal antibody reduces RSV infections in healthy preterm infants.,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE Case management (CM) interventions are effective for frequent users of health care services, but little is known about which intervention characteristics lead to positive outcomes. We sought to identify characteristics of CM that yield positive outcomes among frequent users with chronic disease in primary care. METHODS For this systematic review of both quantitative and qualitative studies, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO (1996 to September 2017) and included articles meeting the following criteria: (1)population: adult frequent users with chronic disease, (2)intervention: CM in a primary care setting with a postintervention evaluation, and (3)primary outcomes: integration of services, health care system use, cost, and patient outcome measures. Independent reviewers screened abstracts, read full texts, appraised methodologic quality (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool), and extracted data from the included studies. Sufficient and necessary CM intervention characteristics were identified using configurational comparative methods. RESULTS Of the 10,687 records retrieved, 20 studies were included; 17 quantitative, 2 qualitative, and 1 mixed methods study. Analyses revealed that it is necessary to identify patients most likely to benefit from a CM intervention for CM to produce positive outcomes. High-intensity intervention or the presence of a multidisciplinary/interorganizational care plan was also associated with positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Policy makers and clinicians should focus on their case-finding processes because this is the essential characteristic of CM effectiveness. In addition, value should be placed on high-intensity CM interventions and developing care plans with multiple types of care providers to help improve patient outcomes.","Hudon, Catherine; Chouinard, Maud-Christine; Pluye, Pierre; El Sherif, Reem; Bush, Paula Louise; Rihoux, Benoît; Poitras, Marie-Eve; Lambert, Mireille; Zomahoun, Hervé Tchala Vignon; Légaré, France",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501208/,180

In this article, we draw on data collected in a multidisciplinary, international study exploring promising practices in long-term care homes across Canada, Norway, and Germany, to investigate conditions that either allow for or create barriers to residents' social participation. Within a feminist political economy framework using a team-based rapid ethnography approach, observations and in-depth interviews were conducted with management, staff, volunteers, students, families, and residents. We argue that the conditions of work are the conditions of care. Such conditions as care home location, building layout, staffing levels, and work organization, as well as governing regulations, influence if and how residents can and do engage in meaningful everyday social life in/outside the nursing home. The presence of promising conditions that facilitate resident social participation, particularly those promoting flexibility and choice for residents, directly impacts their overall health and well-being.","Lowndes, Ruth; Struthers, James; Ågotnes, Gudmund",Canadian journal on aging = La revue canadienne du vieillissement,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0714980820000318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985390/,180

Our modelling, based on data from the UK, shows that contrary to reducing demand, the effect on both mortality and bed occupancy would be negative with 158 additional deaths per year for each 10% reduction in primary angioplasty and at a cost of ∼8,000 additional bed days per year for the same reduction. Our analysis demonstrates that specialist services such as heart attack pathways should be protected during the COVID crisis to maximise the appropriate use of resource and prevent unnecessary mortality.","Dancy, Luke; O'Gallagher, Kevin; Ryan, Matthew; MacCarthy, Philip A; Shah, Ajay M",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719037/,180

MATERIAL AND METHODS Three hundred and four patients with CCI and COVID-19 were observed, group 1 (n=152) consisted of patients receiving basic therapy and mexidol, group 2 (n=152) received only basic therapy. Mexidol was administered intravenously for 14 days, 500 mg (10 ml) per 400 ml of saline solution, then Mexidol FORTE 250 was administered in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day for 2 months. The state of cognitive functions (MoCA scale), sleep (Spiegel questionnaire), asthenia (MFI-20 scale), and quality of life (SIP questionnaire) were evaluated. Examinations were performed before treatment, 30 and 75 days after start of treatment. RESULTS In group 1, there was a more complete and earlier recovery of the state of cognitive functions (an increase in indicators on the MoCA scale, p<0.01), a regression of asthenia (p<0.05), and normalization of sleep (p<0.01). By the end of the study, there were significantly more patients in group 1 with complete or significant recovery of all quality of life indicators. CONCLUSION Long-term sequential therapy with mexidol provides a more complete recovery of impaired functions in patients with CCI and COVID-19.","Kovalchuk, V V; Ershova, I I; Molodovskaya, N V",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

70404,A failed COVID poem.,2020-12-14,"The well-being movement in medical education has been underway for over a decade. It seems appropriate to examine and evaluate these efforts in order to support the mental health needs of learners, faculty, and staff as medicine and medical education evolve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. To date, most interventions intended to promote well-being have focused on individual strategies rather than environmental drivers of distress, and the primary offerings have comprised strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Responses to this programming from medical learners have primarily ranged from ambivalence to resentment, with many feeling that the programming failed to adequately address their particular needs and the challenges they were experiencing. In this commentary, the author challenges the assumption that well-being per se should be the ideal target or goal. Learners and faculty may be better served by considering other goals-those that do not focus directly on well-being, but that are instead foundational for well-being in that they directly address the challenges that students, residents, and faculty are facing. In other words, goals and associated interventions would focus on the experience of school and work, rather than focusing primarily on encouraging healthy practices outside of school and work. The author proposes using the lens of satisfaction through which to view and assess progress toward well-being, increasing satisfaction within 3 interconnected domains: (1) school and/or work, (2) self, and (3) life. Attention to these domains may be more likely to produce improvements in well-being that have been sought for years, but that remain elusive.","Slavin, Stuart",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635840/,180

Although the association between limited range of motion (ROM) and prevalence of LBP has been widely investigated in other sports, there is no research about this topic in inline hockey (IH). The main purposes of this study in IH players were (1) to analyze the association between hip ROM and LBP and (2) to establish a diagnostic cutoff for ROM of high risk of LBP. Twenty elite IH players from the two Spanish National Teams (male and female) were assessed for passive maximum hip ROMs; the movement evaluated were the hip external [HER] and internal [HIR] rotation, hip flexion with flexed [HF-KF] and extended [HF-KE] knee, hip adduction with flexed hip [HAD-HF], hip abduction with neutral [HAB] and flexed [HAB-HF] hip, and hip extension [HE]. LBP was retrospectively monitored for the last 12 months before the date of ROM assessment by using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed via a binary logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. The 70% of players had developed LBP during the retrospective study period.

We examined socioeconomic factors associated with low resilience in women, the relationship of low resilience with psychiatric morbidity, and the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Using a quota-based sample from a national panel, we conducted a web-based survey of 3200 US women in April 2020. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of pandemic-related stress, and coincident depression and anxiety symptoms among those with and without low resilience. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate resilience as a mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Risk factors for low resilience included younger age, lower household income, lower education, unemployment, East/Southeast Asian race, unmarried/unpartnered status, and higher number of medical comorbidities. Low resilience was significantly associated with greater odds of depression symptoms (OR = 3.78, 95% CI [3.10-4.60]), anxiety symptoms (OR = 4.17, 95% CI [3.40-5.11]), and pandemic-related stress (OR = 2.86, 95% CI [2.26-3.26]). Resilience acted as a partial mediator in the association between pandemic-related stress and anxiety symptoms (proportion mediated = 0.23) and depression symptoms (proportion mediated = 0.28). In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, low resilience mediated the association between pandemic-related stress and psychiatric morbidity. Strategies proven to enhance resilience, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and addressing socioeconomic factors, may help mitigate mental health outcomes.","Kumar, Shivani; Lee, Nita Karnik; Pinkerton, Elizabeth; Wroblewski, Kristen E; Lengyel, Ernst; Tobin, Marie",Archives of women's mental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01184-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651237/,180

PATIENTS AND METHODS We previously conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis in patients with treatment-naive metastatic NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 50% receiving first-line pembrolizumab. Here, we report the results of the irAE analysis and the potential correlation between irAEs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1010 patients were included in this analysis; after a 6-week landmark selection, 877 (86.8%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Any grade irAEs (P < .0001), grade 3/4 irAEs (P = .0025), leading to discontinuation irAEs (P = .0144), multiple-site and single-site irAEs (P < .0001), cutaneous irAEs (P = .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0227), pulmonary irAEs (P = .0479), and rheumatologic irAEs (P = .0018) were significantly related to a higher objective response rate. Any grade irAEs (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), multiple-site irAEs (P = .0005), cutaneous irAEs (P = .0042), endocrine irAEs (P < .0001), gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0391), and rheumatologic irAEs (P = .0086) were significantly related to progression-free survival. Any grade irAEs (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), multiple-site irAEs (P = .0003), cutaneous irAEs (P = .0002), endocrine irAEs (P = .0001), and rheumatologic irAEs (P = .0214) were significantly related to overall survival. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the feasibility and the safety of first-line, single-agent pembrolizumab, in a large, real-world cohort of patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. The occurrence of irAEs may be a surrogate of clinical activity and improved outcomes in this setting.","Cortellini, Alessio; Friedlaender, Alex; Banna, Giuseppe L; Porzio, Giampiero; Bersanelli, Melissa; Cappuzzo, Federico; Aerts, Joachim G J V; Giusti, Raffaele; Bria, Emilio; Cortinovis, Diego; Grossi, Francesco; Migliorino, Maria R; Galetta, Domenico; Passiglia, Francesco; Berardi, Rossana; Mazzoni, Francesca; Di Noia, Vincenzo; Signorelli, Diego; Tuzi, Alessandro; Gelibter, Alain; Marchetti, Paolo; Macerelli, Marianna; Rastelli, Francesca; Chiari, Rita; Rocco, Danilo; Inno, Alessandro; Di Marino, Pietro; Mansueto, Giovanni; Zoratto, Federica; Santoni, Matteo; Tudini, Marianna; Ghidini, Michele; Filetti, Marco; Catino, Annamaria; Pizzutilo, Pamela; Sala, Luca; Occhipinti, Mario Alberto; Citarella, Fabrizio; Marco, Russano; Torniai, Mariangela; Cantini, Luca; Follador, Alessandro; Sforza, Vincenzo; Nigro, Olga; Ferrara, Miriam G; D'Argento, Ettore; Leonetti, Alessandro; Pettoruti, Linda; Antonuzzo, Lorenzo; Scodes, Simona; Landi, Lorenza; Guaitoli, Giorgia; Baldessari, Cinzia; Bertolini, Federica; Della Gravara, Luigi; Dal Bello, Maria Giovanna; Belderbos, Robert A; De Filippis, Marco; Cecchi, Cristina; Ricciardi, Serena; Donisi, Clelia; De Toma, Alessandro; Proto, Claudia; Addeo, Alfredo; Cantale, Ornella; Ricciuti, Biagio; Genova, Carlo; Morabito, Alessandro; Santini, Daniele; Ficorella, Corrado; Cannita, Katia",Clinical lung cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cllc.2020.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680806/,180

We prospectively assessed whether weight loss following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) leads to a significant reduction in the epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and the correlation between the decline in the epicardial fat thickness with other clinical parameters. METHODS A prospective analysis of 98 cases that were scheduled to undergo LSG and followed up for 12 months was conducted. EFT was assessed using two-dimensional (2 D) echocardiography. RESULTS A total of 98 cases and 70 controls were enrolled. EFT demonstrated a significant reduction at follow-up in the whole group (median 8.9 (1.95) versus 7.65 (1.67) mm, respectively). The degree of reduction was higher in the LSG cohort compared to control cohort 1.3 (0.4) versus 1 (0.4), respectively; p < .001). The univariate regression analysis demonstrated a notable correlation of the EFT with the weight, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and creatinine with a p-value of <.0001, .001, .022, and .018, respectively while the multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation between EFT and weight and creatinine with a p-value of <.0001 and .033 respectively.

79313,Probiotics in preterm infants.,2021-04-08,"The purpose of the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Guideline on Intraoperative Management of Adult Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is to present recommendations based on current scientific evidence. This guideline seeks to address questions regarding the intraoperative care of patients with OSA, including airway management, anesthetic drug and agent effects, and choice of anesthesia type. Given the paucity of high-quality studies with regard to study design and execution in this perioperative field, recommendations were to a large part developed by subject-matter experts through consensus processes, taking into account the current scientific knowledge base and quality of evidence. This guideline may not be suitable for all clinical settings and patients and is not intended to define standards of care or absolute requirements for patient care; thus, assessment of appropriateness should be made on an individualized basis. Adherence to this guideline cannot guarantee successful outcomes, but recommendations should rather aid health care professionals and institutions to formulate plans and develop protocols for the improvement of the perioperative care of patients with OSA, considering patient-related factors, interventions, and resource availability. Given the groundwork of a comprehensive systematic literature review, these recommendations reflect the current state of knowledge and its interpretation by a group of experts at the time of publication. While periodic reevaluations of literature are needed, novel scientific evidence between updates should be taken into account. Deviations in practice from the guideline may be justifiable and should not be interpreted as a basis for claims of negligence.","Memtsoudis, Stavros G; Cozowicz, Crispiana; Nagappa, Mahesh; Wong, Jean; Joshi, Girish P; Wong, David T; Doufas, Anthony G; Yilmaz, Meltem; Stein, Mark H; Krajewski, Megan L; Singh, Mandeep; Pichler, Lukas; Ramachandran, Satya Krishna; Chung, Frances",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000003434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944522/,180

However, outcomes vary among patients who present in advanced clinical stages of disease. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether racial disparity exists at initial presentation and response to intervention. METHODS A retrospective database was created to include all radiofrequency ablation procedures performed by a single surgeon from January 14, 2009, through May 25, 2011. Demographics, clinical traits, race, procedure, and outcomes were analyzed. Stepwise model selection reduced candidate baseline factors to a final parsimonious model, which was analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS The database consisted of 300 patients with a predominant female (n = 215, 85%) base and 85 (15%) males, with a mean age distribution of 53 years. The mean body mass index was 30.2. Racial distribution revealed Asian (n = 9, 3.3%), Pacific Islander (n = 1, 0.4%), African American (n = 37, 13.6%), and Caucasian (CAU, n = 225, 82.7%). African Americans presented with more advanced clinical stages than the CAU group-C2: African American 21.6%, CAU 36.7%; C4: African American 35%, CAU 24.3%; and C6: African American 35.1%, CAU 7.5%. African Americans demonstrated a higher preoperative venous clinical severity score (VCSS) than their CAU counterparts. Postprocedural decrease in VCSS score was lower in African Americans than their CAU counterparts. CONCLUSION African American patients present with more advanced venous insufficiency than CAUs.

86422,Comprehensive Medication Review Completion in Medically Underserved Areas and Populations.,2021,"BACKGROUND Understanding how nutrient intake in older women compares with recommendations is important. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement summarizes the nutrient needs of older adults (aged ≥60 years) based on a systematic review. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare nutrient intake of Women's Health Initiative Long Life Study participants to the Dietary Reference Intakes for nutrients reviewed in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement. DESIGN The study is a cross-sectional analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING Participants (n=7,875) were mailed the General Nutrition Assessment Food Frequency Questionnaire during 2012-2013, of whom 77% (n=6,095) completed it, and 5,732 were included in the analytic sample after exclusion for implausible energy intakes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mean intake of energy and protein, calcium, fiber, folate, potassium, sodium, vitamins B-12, D, E, and K were described overall and compared with recommendations. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of participants meeting recommendations was computed. RESULTS Mean age of completers was 79±7 years and 53.5% were non-Hispanic white, 30% were non-Hispanic black, and 16.5% were Hispanic/Latina. Only one-third of women consumed ≥21 g/day fiber, whereas fewer met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for calcium (18.6%), vitamin E (16.9%), and vitamin D (1.7%). Just more than half (56%) of participants met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day, and just less than half (47.0%) met potassium guidelines. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest older women within the Women's Health Initiative were generally not achieving recommended intake for several key nutrients highlighted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement. These findings underscore the need to identify effective approaches for improving the nutrient density of dietary intake in older women.","Beasley, Jeannette M; Rillamas-Sun, Eileen; Tinker, Lesley F; Wylie-Rosett, Judith; Mossavar-Rahmani, Yasmin; Datta, Mridul; Caan, Bette J; LaCroix, Andrea Z",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680817/,180

The diagnosis of metastatic infectious foci is difficult because localizing symptoms are often absent. We investigated whether (18)F-FDG PET/CT was able to detect such foci and whether detection influenced clinical outcome. METHODS One hundred fifteen nonneutropenic patients with gram-positive bacteremia were prospectively included. Patients with positive blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, or Enterococcus species were eligible when a risk factor for developing metastatic infectious foci was present. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed within 2 wk after the first positive blood culture. Abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake had to be confirmed by radiologic, microbiologic, or pathologic studies. Results were compared with a matched historical control group of 230 patients in whom no (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed. RESULTS Significantly more patients were diagnosed with metastatic foci in the study group (67.8% vs. 35.7%). Of the imaging investigations performed, (18)F-FDG PET/CT was the first to delineate infectious foci in 35 patients (30%). In the remaining 70%, either symptoms on physical examination or other imaging techniques first revealed infectious foci. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 100%, 87%, 100%, and 89%, respectively. Relapse rates decreased from 7.4% to 2.6% among study patients (P = 0.09) and from 8.9% to 1.4% in patients with S. aureus (P = 0.04). Overall mortality after 6 mo decreased from 32.2% to 19.1% in the (18)F-FDG PET/CT group (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION In the diagnostic work-up of high-risk patients with gram-positive bacteremia, (18)F-FDG PET/CT is a valuable technique that results in lower mortality rates. In patients with S. aureus bacteremia, relapse rates decreased significantly after the addition of (18)F-FDG PET/CT.","Vos, Fidel J; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Sturm, Patrick D; Krabbe, Paul F M; van Dijk, Arie P J; Cuijpers, Maria L H; Adang, Eddy M M; Wanten, Geert J A; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Oyen, Wim J G","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.109.072371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660384/,180

Here, we used a proteomic approach to identify biomarkers for diagnosis of these devastating conditions. In a case-control study comprising 77 sepsis/NEC and 77 nonsepsis cases (10 in each group being monitored longitudinally), plasma samples collected at clinical presentation were assessed in the biomarker discovery and independent validation phases. We validated the discovered biomarkers in a prospective cohort study with 104 consecutively suspected sepsis/NEC episodes. Proapolipoprotein CII (Pro-apoC2) and a des-arginine variant of serum amyloid A (SAA) were identified as the most promising biomarkers. The ApoSAA score computed from plasma apoC2 and SAA concentrations was effective in identifying sepsis/NEC cases in the case-control and cohort studies. Stratification of infants into different risk categories by the ApoSAA score enabled neonatologists to withhold treatment in 45% and enact early stoppage of antibiotics in 16% of nonsepsis infants. The negative predictive value of this antibiotic policy was 100%. The ApoSAA score could potentially allow early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis/NEC. Upon confirmation by further multicenter trials, the score would facilitate rational prescription of antibiotics and target infants who require urgent treatment.","Ng, Pak Cheung; Ang, Irene Ling; Chiu, Rossa Wai Kwun; Li, Karen; Lam, Hugh Simon; Wong, Raymond Pui On; Chui, Kit Man; Cheung, Hon Ming; Ng, Eddy Wing Yin; Fok, Tai Fai; Sung, Joseph Jao Yiu; Lo, Yuk Ming Dennis; Poon, Terence Chuen Wai",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci40196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592468/,180

93366,Insurance-based Disparities in Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients.,2021,"Workplace bullying in the medical field is a significant occupational hazard and health care safety concern, though many cases go unreported. Often regarded as a rite of passage to desensitize and toughen up new employees and students, psychological harm during medical preparation creates an unsafe working environment resulting in health complications, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and self-harm. Decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, high turnover rates, and inappropriate patient care are linked to bullying, perpetrating organizational dysfunction. This research study evaluated workplace bullying (prevalence, frequency, and behaviors; associated characteristics; effects on patient care; and awareness and enforcement of antibullying protocols) in nuclear medicine departments and clinical education. Methods: A quantitative single-group correlational analysis was used to survey certified nuclear medicine technologists and students in the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board email database (n = 20,389). The highest response rate for any individual question was n = 836. Data were collected using the Short Negative Acts Questionnaire along with a researcher-created survey and analyzed using chi-square and central tendencies. Results: Bullying existed in varying degrees (46.8%) within the previous 6 months; predominantly by being ignored, excluded, subjected to repeated reminders of errors, and withholding information affecting their performance. Nuclear medicine professionals are more likely to witness and experience workplace bullying than students and are more likely to be bullied by a fellow technologist. Characteristics, such as gender, age, and occupation, were statistically significant while others, such as race, height, body type, experience, and education showed no significant correlation. Attention to patient care decreased (39.6%) when bullying was present. An 8% variation exists between antibullying policies being enforced/not enforced, with 26% of professionals unaware of antibullying policies at their place of work. Conclusion: Explanations for underreported workplace bullying include fear of retaliation; nonenforcement and lack of awareness of antibullying policies; organizational complacency; and perceived hierarchical power. Recommendations to minimize workplace bullying include adopting and publicizing a descriptive definition, implementing antibullying policies, mediation procedures, and noncompliance penalties. Decreasing incidences of workplace bullying increase employee satisfaction and retention, patient safety, and enhances student success.","Youngblood, Shannon Nixon",Journal of nuclear medicine technology,https://doi.org/10.2967/jnmt.120.257204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361177/,180

We also succeed in monitoring UB tip cells by utilizing the ability of tip cells to uptake very-low-density lipoprotein, cryopreserving UB progenitor cells, and expanding UB tip cells that can reconstitute the organoids and differentiate into collecting duct progenitors. Moreover, we successfully reproduce some phenotypes of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) using the UB organoids. These methods will help elucidate the developmental mechanisms of UB branching and develop a selective differentiation method for collecting duct cells, contributing to the creation of disease models for congenital renal abnormalities.","Mae, Shin-Ichi; Ryosaka, Makoto; Sakamoto, Satoko; Matsuse, Kyoko; Nozaki, Aya; Igami, Maiko; Kabai, Ryotaro; Watanabe, Akira; Osafune, Kenji",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726627/,180
94521,Protecting Health Care Workers from Transmissible Airborne Diseases: Challenges and Opportunities.,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To review the current status of artificial intelligence systems in ophthalmology and highlight the steps required for clinical translation of artificial intelligence into personalized health care (PHC) in retinal disease. RECENT FINDINGS Artificial intelligence systems for ophthalmological application have made rapid advances, but are yet to attain a state of technical maturity that allows their adoption into real-world settings. There remains an 'artificial intelligence chasm' in the spheres of validation, regulation, safe implementation, and demonstration of clinical impact that needs to be bridged before the full potential of artificial intelligence to deliver PHC can be realized. SUMMARY Ophthalmology is currently in a stage between the demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence and widespread deployment. Next stages include aggregating and curating datasets, training and validating artificial intelligence systems, establishing the regulatory framework, implementation and adoption with ongoing evaluation and model adjustment, and finally, meaningful human-artificial intelligence interaction with clinically validated tools that have demonstrated measurable impact on patient and healthcare system outcomes. Ophthalmologists should leverage the ability of artificial intelligence systems to glean insights from large volumes of multivariate data, and to interpret artificial intelligence recommendations in a clinical context. In doing so, the field will be well positioned to lead the transformation of health care in a personalized direction.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analytical study. Place and Duration of the Study: Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan from 10th June till 31st August 2020. METHODOLOGY Fifty-four patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included. All patients had received TCZ (4 mg/kg) in addition to standard treatment. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer levels, full blood count, and liver function tests (LFTs) were checked before and 24 hours after receiving TCZ. Short-term outcome, defined as survival at day 28, was determined from hospital record/telephonic contact. Paired t-test was employed to assess the statistical significance of mean differences between the pre- and post-TCZ variables, considering a p-value of <0.05 as significant. RESULTS Overall, the mean pre- and post-TCZ CRP was 18.7 ± 10.7 and 10.2 ± 8.6 mg/dl (p <0.001). It was 18.0 ± 10.3 and 10.3 ± 8.8 mg/dl (p=0.003) in survivors; and 19.4 ± 11.4 and 10.2 ± 8.7 mg/dl (p=0.005) in non-survivors, respectively. Overall, mean D-dimer level decreased from 12.5 ± 23 to 10.3 ± 12.2 µg/ml following TCZ (p=0.643); it decreased from 15.8 ± 29.8 to 11.4 ± 10.6 µg/ml (p=0.612) in survivors; and 9.0 ± 12.8 to 9.2 ± 14.1 µg/ml (p=0.961) in non-survivors, respectively. There were no significant differences in the pre- and post-TCZ LDH levels overall and between the groups. The 28-day mortality was 46.3%.

99195,Physical accessibility of primary care facilities for people with disabilities: a cross-sectional survey in 31 countries.,2021-02-01,"Introduction: Many of the sleep problems experienced by children with epilepsy (CWE) have the same behavioural basis as common sleep problems seen in typically developing (TD) children. Behavioural sleep interventions (BSIs) are widely used to treat these sleep problems in TD children and are hypothesised to be effective for CWE. However, specific considerations need to be addressed and incorporated into a BSI for CWE to ensure the intervention is tailored to this population's needs. This paper details developing and tailoring an online BSI for parents of CWE, to be used in the CASTLE (Changing Agendas on Sleep, Treatment and Learning in Epilepsy) Sleep-E clinical trial. Method: In phase one, two existing theory-driven paediatric BSIs were adapted into a novel online behavioural sleep intervention (CASTLE Online Sleep Intervention or COSI) which specifically incorporated the needs and requirements reported by nine parents of CWE. Scoping their needs included conducting interviews with three CWE so that they could contribute to the overall intervention content. In phase two, six of these parents evaluated COSI, reviewing and feeding back on COSI until parental approval for content and functionality was achieved. Results: In phase one, a range of adaptations was made to the content and presentation of standardised intervention material to acknowledge and emphasise the key seizure-specific issues to ensure COSI best met parents of CWE's needs. Adaptations included embedding parent and child experiences in the intervention, including particular information requested by parents, such as the links between sleep and seizures and managing child and parental anxieties around sleep, as well as developing functionality to personalise the delivery of content. In phase two, parents confirmed that they found the final version of COSI to be functional and appropriate (after one round of review) for use by parents of CWE and that 100% would recommend it to other families who have CWE. Discussion: It is hoped that the use of evidence-based BSIs, adapted to consider salient epilepsy-specific factors, will increase parent-engagement, COSI's relevance for this particular patient group and overall efficacy in improving sleep in CWE. The effectiveness of COSI will be tested in the CASTLE Sleep-E clinical trial (https://castlestudy.org.uk/).","Wiggs, Luci; Cook, Georgia; Hiscock, Harriet; Pal, Deb K; Gringras, Paul",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.679804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276499/,180

The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades.","Kock, Richard",The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.4102/ojvr.v81i2.739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005349/,180

Immunosuppressive drugs are the main treatment and may increase risk of infection. AREAS COVERED This systematic review included studies incorporating adult patients with primary ITP and infectious outcomes. Studies comparing risk of infection with the general population were included as primary and studies without this comparison were considered secondary.Three primary and ten secondary studies were included. The main findings: 1-year adjusted relative-risk of infection was 4.5 (95% CI, 3.3 - 6.1) fold elevated compared to the general population. When comparing splenectomized with non-splenectomized ITP patients, the +1-year adjusted relative-risk of infection was 4.0 (95% CI, 2.8 - 5.6). The unadjusted 5-year mortality rate-ratio for infection-related deaths was 6.0 (95% CI, 3.0 - 11.8) in one study, and the hazard ratio was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0 - 5.7) for fatal infections in another.

Mechanical toughness, adhesion, and degradation of these new formulations are tested in both accelerated in vitro conditions and up to 16 weeks in vivo. These degradable tough adhesives are engineered with equivalent mechanical and adhesive properties to nondegradable tough adhesives, capable of achieving stretches >20 times their initial length, fracture energies >6 kJ m-2 , and adhesion energies >1000 J m-2 . All degradable systems show complete degradation within 2 weeks under accelerated aging conditions in vitro and weeks to months in vivo depending on the degradable crosslinker selected. Excellent biocompatibility is observed for all groups after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implantation, with minimal fibrous encapsulation and no signs of organ toxicity.

A small proportion of these patients will also have intestinal complications requiring necrosectomy with diverting loop ileostomy. Later, these patients require cholecystectomy and ileostomy reversal. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is fraught with difficulty in these patients due to dense intra-abdominal adhesions, and many surgeons resort to an open approach. We describe a technique which takes advantage of the ileostomy site for initial access. Materials and Surgical Technique Ileostomy reversal is done and a SILS™ (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA) port is inserted under direct vision, through the ileostomy site.

103152,Rapid whole-exome sequencing facilitates precision medicine in paediatric rare disease patients and reduces healthcare costs.,2020-08-01,"This paper presents the simulated performance assessment of an artificial iris embedded on a scleral contact lens using real data from an aniridia patient. The artificial iris is based on guest-host liquid crystal cells (GH-LCD) in order to actively modify the transmittance of the lens and effective pupil size. Experimental validation of the GH-LCD spectrum and iris contrast (determined to be 1:2.1) enabled the development of optical models that include the effect of a small pupil on image quality and visual quality on an optical system with aniridia characteristics. Visual simulations at different light conditions (high/low photopic and mesopic) demonstrated the theoretical capacity of the customized artificial iris smart contact lens to expand the depth-of-focus and decrease the optical aberrations (in particular, the spherical aberration). The visual modelling suggests a maximum depth-of-focus value for a 2-mm pupil diameter for both eyes as follows: 3D (1,000 cd/m2), 2D (10 cd/m2) and 0.75D (1 cd/m2). This work demonstrates the beneficial optical effects of an active artificial iris, based on visual simulations in response to different light levels, and enables further experimental investigation on patients to validate the dynamic light attenuation and visual performance of smart contact lenses with GH-LCD.","Vásquez Quintero, Andrés; Pérez-Merino, Pablo; De Smet, Herbert",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71376-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887927/,180

A multicenter, age-matched, case-control study was therefore designed to explore the dynamic changes in laboratory parameters during the first 10 days after admission and identify early risk indicators for in-hospital mortality in this patient cohort. Methods Demographics and clinical data were extracted from the medical records of 93 pairs of patients who had been admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19. These patients had either been discharged or were deceased by March 3, 2020. Data from days 1, 4, 7, and 10 of hospital admission were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were employed to identify early risk indicators of in-hospital death in this cohort. Results On admission, in-hospital mortality was associated with five risk indicators (ORs in descending order): aspartate aminotransferase (AST, >32 U/L) 43.20 (95% CI: 2.63, 710.04); C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than 100 mg/L 13.61 (1.78, 103.941); lymphocyte count lower than 0.6×109/L 9.95 (1.30, 76.42); oxygen index (OI) less than 200 8.23 (1.04, 65.15); and D-dimer over 1 mg/L 8.16 (1.23, 54.34). Sharp increases in D-dimer at day 4, accompanied by decreasing lymphocyte counts, deteriorating OI, and persistent remarkably high CRP concentration were observed among non-survivors during the early stages of hospital admission. Conclusions The potential risk factors of high D-dimer, CRP, AST, low lymphocyte count and OI could help clinicians identify patients at high risk of death early in the hospital admission. This might assist with rationalization of health care resources.","Zhou, Wei; Liu, Yisi; Xu, Beibei; Wang, Sa; Li, Shusheng; Liu, Hong; Huang, Ziting; Luo, Yan; Hu, Ming; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhang, Zhanguo; Long, Xin; Zou, Wenbin; Bian, Yi; Zou, Xiaojing; Elliott, Malcolm; Yue, Lanxin; Deng, Huifang; Chen, Hairong; Gao, Xueli; Wu, Ying; Fang, Minghao; Zhang, Boli; Gao, Yue",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-2568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841931/,180

We performed this study to evaluate the potential diagnostic value and radiation dose reduction of this technique for imaging of intracranial stents and flow diverters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven patients were imaged with a VOI C-arm CT scan following treatment with a flow diverter or stent-assisted coiling. The radiation dose-area product was recorded for VOI scans. For comparison, the dose-area product from 30 previously acquired consecutive full-view DynaCTs was used. Thermoluminescence dosimetry by using 35 evenly distributed thermoluminescence dosimeters in an anthropomorphic head phantom was also performed by using both conventional full field and VOI acquisitions. Three observers were presented with VOI images for assessment of the potential diagnostic value. RESULTS The dose-area product measurements showed an exposure reduction of 85% compared with the full field acquisitions used for comparison. The thermoluminescence dosimetry evaluations also showed a considerable dose reduction of 79.8% throughout the volume. For most of the evaluated cases, the observers thought that diagnostically useful information was provided by the VOI images (α = .810). Visualization of device details, such as the extent of opening, positioning, wall apposition, and aneurysm coverage, was judged of good diagnostic quality for most cases (88.9%-92.6%). CONCLUSIONS In this study, VOI C-arm CT provided high-quality diagnostic images of intracranial stents and flow diverters at a dramatic reduction of radiation exposure. Image content was thought to add useful information. It is a promising method to assess device status during procedures and at follow-up.","Yang, P; Ahmed, A; Schafer, S; Niemann, D; Aagaard-Kienitz, B; Royalty, K; Strother, C",AJNR.

106545,ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME-LIKE LESIONS IN A CHILD.,2021-02-26,"AIM To examine the association between the certification as bariatric surgery center and volume and patient outcome, data collected in the German Bariatric Surgery Registry were evaluated. All data were registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS Data collection began in 2005 for all bariatric procedures in an online database. Participation in the quality assurance study is required for all certified bariatric surgery centers in Germany. Descriptive evaluation and matched pairs analysis were performed. Patients were matched via propensity score taking into account BMI, age, and incidence of comorbidities. RESULTS During the period from 2005 to 2013, 3083 male and 10,639 female patients were operated on with the RYGB primary approach. In Centers of Competence (77.2 %) and non-accredited hospitals (76.3 %), the proportion of female patients was significantly lower than in Centers of Reference/Excellence (78.7 %; p = 0.002). The mean age in Centers of Reference/Excellence (41.2 years) was significantly lower than in Centers of Competence (43.2 years; p < 0.05). Propensity score analysis was performed to compare matched patients with regard to BMI, age, and incidence of comorbidities. The rate of general and surgical postoperative complications and mortality rate was significantly lower in certified Centers of Reference/Excellence compared to Centers of Competence with 29 and non-certified hospitals. CONCLUSION There is evidence of improved patient outcome in certified bariatric surgery centers with higher volume. The study supports the concept of certification. There are different factors which can and cannot be preoperatively modified and influence the perioperative outcome.","Stroh, Christine; Köckerling, F; Lange, V; Wolff, S; Knoll, C; Bruns, C; Manger, Th",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2340-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558621/,180
106973,'We're just seen as people that give out the methadone…': exploring the role of community pharmacists in the opioid substitution treatment team.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is used to attenuate the pain and distress that may otherwise be experienced during diagnostic and interventional medical or dental procedures. As the risk of adverse events increases with the depth of sedation induced, frequent monitoring of level of consciousness is recommended. Level of consciousness is usually monitored during PSA with clinical observation. Processed electroencephalogram-based depth of anaesthesia (DoA) monitoring devices provide an alternative method to monitor level of consciousness that can be used in addition to clinical observation. However, there is uncertainty as to whether their routine use in PSA would be justified. Rigorous evaluation of the clinical benefits of DoA monitors during PSA, including comprehensive syntheses of the available evidence, is therefore required. One potential clinical benefit of using DoA monitoring during PSA is that the technology could improve patient safety by reducing sedation-related adverse events, such as death or permanent neurological disability. We hypothesise that earlier identification of lapses into deeper than intended levels of sedation using DoA monitoring leads to more effective titration of sedative and analgesic medications, and results in a reduction in the risk of adverse events caused by the consequences of over-sedation, such as hypoxaemia. The primary objective of this review is to determine whether using DoA monitoring during PSA in the hospital setting improves patient safety by reducing the risk of hypoxaemia (defined as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg or percentage of haemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen [SpO(2)] less than 90 %). Other potential clinical benefits of using DoA monitoring devices during sedation will be assessed as secondary outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the use of depth of anaesthesia monitoring devices with clinical observation of level of consciousness during PSA. Language restrictions will not be imposed. Screening, study selection and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion. Meta-analyses will be performed if suitable. DISCUSSION This review will synthesise the evidence on an important potential clinical benefit of DoA monitoring during PSA within hospital settings.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is considered an important modulator for mediating nociceptive pathways in chronic pain. The present study aimed to investigate whether there was thalamus-related abnormal functional connectivity or relevant serum BDNF level alterations during periovulation in long-term primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). Thalamic subregions were defined according to the Human Brainnetome Atlas. Functional connectivity analyses were performed in 36 patients in the periovulatory phase and 29 age-, education-, and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum BDNF levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a significantly higher BDNF level was detected in PDM patients. Compared with HCs, PDM patients had abnormal functional connectivity of thalamic-subregions, mainly involving with prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and temporal cortex. In addition, the functional connectivity of thalamic-subregions showed significant interactive effect correlated with serum BDNF level between PDM and HCs. It has been suggested that there were maladaptive or adoptive alteration associated with chronic menstrual pain even without the ongoing menstrual pain. BDNF might play a role in the development and chronicity of central nervous system dysfunction. These findings provided more accurate information about the involvement of the thalamus in the pathophysiology of PDM.","Han, Fang; Liu, Hongjuan; Wang, Ke; Yang, Jing; Yang, Ling; Liu, Jixin; Zhang, Ming; Dun, Wanghuan",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632254/,180

115202,Peculiar footprints in a child with agenesis of corpus callosum.,2021-03-01,"The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is a trimeric complex of heterodimers composed of a surface glycoprotein, gp120, and a transmembrane component, gp41. The association of this complex with CD4 stabilizes the coreceptor-binding site of gp120 and promotes the exposure of the gp41 helical region 1 (HR1). Here, we show that a 15-amino-acid peptide mimetic of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 fused to a dimeric antibody Fc domain (CCR5mim-Ig) bound two gp120 molecules per envelope glycoprotein complex and by itself promoted HR1 exposure. CCR5mim-Ig also stabilized the association of a CD4-mimetic peptide with the envelope glycoprotein. A fusion of the CD4- and CCR5-mimetic peptides, DM1, bound gp120 and neutralized R5, R5X4, and X4 HIV-1 isolates comparably to CD4, and they did so markedly more efficiently than either peptide alone. Our data indicate that the potency of DM1-Ig derives from its avidity for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer and from the bidirectional induction of its receptor-mimetic components. DM1 has significant advantages over other inhibitors that target both coreceptor and CD4-binding sites, and it may serve as a lead for a new class of HIV-1 inhibitor peptides.","Kwong, Jo Ann; Dorfman, Tatyana; Quinlan, Brian D; Chiang, Jessica J; Ahmed, Asim A; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00630-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21613393/,180

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of brewers' yeast (1,3)-(1,6)-beta-glucan on incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). METHODS Generally healthy men and women (n = 299) reporting at least three URTIs during the previous year were randomized to receive either a placebo or 900 mg of yeast beta-glucan daily for 16 weeks during winter. In cases of acute URTI, the severity of URTI symptoms was assessed via the WURSS-21 questionnaire and the Jackson scale, and a clinical confirmation was implemented by the investigator. RESULTS Overall, 70 subjects under placebo and 71 subjects under yeast beta-glucan experienced at least one clinically confirmed URTI episode. The global severity using WURSS-21 had been quite similar between the study groups (p = 0.5267), whereas during the first days of URTIs the severity was less pronounced in the yeast beta-glucan group. On the episode level, the severity of physical symptoms was significantly lower for all investigated time intervals up to 7 days under yeast beta-glucan (WURSS (Q2-11) (days 1-2: p = 0.0465, days 1-3: p = 0.0323, days 1-4: p = 0.0248, days 1-7: p = 0.0278), also confirmed for the Jackson scale). The reduction of severity was accompanied by a significant increase in the joy subscore of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ20) (p = 0.0148). In addition, there was a reduction of systolic (p = 0.0458) and diastolic (p = 0.1439) blood pressure. CONCLUSION Subjects supplementing with yeast beta-glucan benefit by a reduced severity of physical URTI symptoms during the first week of an episode, even though the incidence and global severity of common colds could not be altered in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, accompanying benefits in terms of blood pressure and mood were identified. Altogether, yeast beta-glucan supports the immune function.","Dharsono, Tanita; Rudnicka, Karolina; Wilhelm, Manfred; Schoen, Christiane",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2018.1478339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198828/,180

How multiple mutualistic partners that provide the same service and compete for resources are maintained in mutualistic networks is an open question. We use a model bacterial community in which multiple 'partner strains' of Escherichia coli compete for a carbon source and exchange resources with a 'shared mutualist' strain of Salmonella enterica. In laboratory experiments, competing E. coli strains readily coexist in the presence of S. enterica, despite differences in their competitive abilities. We use ecological modeling to demonstrate that a shared mutualist can create temporary resource niche partitioning by limiting growth rates, even if yield is set by a resource external to a mutualism. This mechanism can extend to maintain multiple competing partner species. Our results improve our understanding of complex mutualistic communities and aid efforts to design stable microbial communities.","Hammarlund, Sarah P; Gedeon, Tomáš; Carlson, Ross P; Harcombe, William R",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-20922-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504808/,180

Online learning can vary in terms of how ""socially"" the material is presented (e.g., live or recorded), but there are limited data on which is most effective, with the majority of studies conducted on children4-8 and inconclusive results on adults.9,10 Here, we examine how young adults (aged 18-35) learn information about unknown objects, systematically varying the social contingency (live versus recorded lecture) and social richness (viewing the teacher's face, hands, or slides) of the learning episodes. Recall was tested immediately and after 1 week. Experiment 1 (n = 24) showed better learning for live presentation and a full view of the teacher (hands and face). Experiment 2 (n = 27; pre-registered) replicated the live-presentation advantage. Both experiments showed an interaction between social contingency and social richness: the presence of social cues affected learning differently depending on whether teaching was interactive or not. Live social interaction with a full view of the teacher's face provided the optimal setting for learning new factual information. However, during observational learning, social cues may be more cognitively demanding11 and/or distracting,12-14 resulting in less learning from rich social information if there is no interactivity. We suggest that being part of a genuine social interaction catalyzes learning, possibly via mechanisms of joint attention,15 common ground,16 or (inter-)active discussion, and as such, interactive learning benefits from rich social settings.17,18.","De Felice, Sara; Vigliocco, Gabriella; Hamilton, Antonia F de C",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.08.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34525343/,180

127425,Letter to the Editor.,2020-05-01,"In chalcocite (Cu2S) bioleaching, the lack of iron metabolism is a key restricting factor. As the most common sulfide mineral, pyrite (FeS2) can release Fe(Ⅱ) and compensate for the iron metabolism deficiency in chalcocite bioleaching. The bioleaching of chalcocite in an imitated industrial system was improved by enhancing the iron-sulfur metabolism simultaneously using pyrite and sulfur oxidizers based on the joint utilization of waste resources, while the bioleaching performance and community structure in the leachate were systematically investigated. Due to the active sulfur/iron metabolism, the pH reached 1.2, and Fe3+ was increased by 77.78%, while the biomass of planktonic cells was improved to 2.19×107 cells/mL. Fourier transform infrared reflection (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results showed that more iron-sulfur crystals were produced due to more active iron-sulfur metabolism. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that many derivative particles and corrosion marks appeared on the surface of the ore, implying that the mineral-microbe interaction was strengthened. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed the accumulation of cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the ore surface, indicating a stronger contact leaching mechanism. Furthermore, the community structure and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that the introduction of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and pyrite could maintain the diversity of dominant leaching microorganisms at a high level. Sulfobacillus (27.75%) and Leptospirllillum (20.26%) were the dominant sulfur-oxidizing and iron-oxidizing bacteria during the bioleaching process. With the accumulation of multiple positive effects, the copper ion leaching rate was improved by 44.8%. In general, this new type of multiple intervention strategy can provide an important guide for the bioleaching of low-grade ores.","Feng, Shoushuai; Yin, Yijun; Yin, Zongwei; Zhang, Hailing; Zhu, Deqiang; Tong, Yanjun; Yang, Hailin",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400950/,180

METHODS Fifty-six established patients who had video-based telemedicine visits with an otolaryngology-head and neck surgery faculty member between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, completed unstructured telephone interviews. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to determine the patients' demographic, disease, and treatment information. RESULTS The primary benefits of telemedicine were accessibility and cost and time savings. Primary limitations included the ability to perform a physical examination. Most patients expressed a willingness to participate in future remote visits if appropriate or necessitated by social circumstances. DISCUSSION Telemedicine is a disruptive process, and long-term adoption requires understanding patient perception of and satisfaction with telemedicine. Head and neck cancer patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine. The study elucidated patient perceived benefits and limitations of telemedicine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Continued implementation of telemedicine in otolaryngology-head and neck ambulatory clinics will require consideration of contextual features surrounding the virtual delivery of care, with particular attention to visit appropriateness for telemedicine and social circumstances.","Triantafillou, Vasiliki; Layfield, Eleanor; Prasad, Aman; Deng, Jie; Shanti, Rabie M; Newman, Jason G; Rajasekaran, Karthik",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820943523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662749/,180

However, the effects of THP pre-treated sludge on microbial diversity, interspecies interactions, and metabolism in AD systems remain largely unknown. We therefore setup and operated an anaerobic digester during a long-term period to shed light on the effect of THP pre-treatment on AD microbial ecology in comparison to conventional AD via Illumina based 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and genome-centric metagenomics analysis. Results showed THP sludge significantly reduced the microbial diversity, shaped the microbial community structure, and resulted in more intense microbial interactions. Compared to WAS as the feed sludge, THP sludge shaped the core functional groups, but functional redundancy ensured the system's stability. The metabolic interactions between methanogens and syntrophic bacteria as well as the specific metabolic pathways were further elucidated. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanospirillum sp. and Methanolinea sp., were the primary contributors for methane production when treating THP and WAS, respectively, which also have potential for acetate oxidation to methane. Collectively, this study provides in-depth information on the interspecies interactions to better understand how THP pre-treatment influences AD microbial community.","Zhang, Liang; Gong, Xianzhe; Wang, Li; Guo, Kun; Cao, Shenbin; Zhou, Yan",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118665/,180
131428,Supporting black lives 'mattering' with flexible health care.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Companies use brand websites as a promotional tool to engage consumers on the web, which can increase product use. Given that some products are harmful to the health of consumers, it is important for marketing associated with these products to be subject to public health surveillance. However, terms of service (TOS) governing the use of brand website content may impede such important research. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to explore the TOS for brand websites with public health significance to assess possible legal and ethical challenges for conducting research on consumer product websites. METHODS Using Statista, we purposefully constructed a sample of 15 leading American tobacco, alcohol, psychiatric pharmaceutical, fast-food, and gun brands that have associated websites. We developed and implemented a structured coding system for the TOS on these websites and coded for the presence versus absence of different types of restriction that might impact the ability to conduct research. RESULTS All TOS stated that by accessing the website, users agreed to abide by the TOS (15/15, 100%). A total of 11 out of 15 (73%) websites had age restrictions in their TOS. All alcohol brand websites (5/15, 33%) required users to enter their age or date of birth before viewing website content. Both websites for tobacco brands (2/15, 13%) further required that users register and verify their age and identity to access any website content and agree that they use tobacco products. Only one website (1/15, 7%) allowed users to display, download, copy, distribute, and translate the website content as long as it was for personal and not commercial use. A total of 33% (5/15) of TOS unconditionally prohibited or put substantial restrictions on all of these activities and/or failed to specify if they were allowed or prohibited. Moreover, 87% (13/15) of TOS indicated that website access could be restricted at any time. A total of 73% (11/15) of websites specified that violating TOS could result in deleting user content from the website, revoking access by having the user's Internet Protocol address blocked, terminating log-in credentials, or enforcing legal action resulting in civil or criminal penalties. CONCLUSIONS TOS create complications for public health surveillance related to e-marketing on brand websites. Recent court opinions have reduced the risk of federal criminal charges for violating TOS on public websites, but this risk remains unclear for private websites. The public health community needs to establish standards to guide and protect researchers from the possibility of legal repercussions related to such efforts.","Weiger, Caitlin; Smith, Katherine C; Cohen, Joanna E; Dredze, Mark; Moran, Meghan Bridgid",JMIR public health and surveillance,https://doi.org/10.2196/23579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263555/,180

The number of patients in China has risen to 31,000. We collected patient data from four Chinese cities (Hefei, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Shenzhen) and described epidemiologic characteristics. As of 6 February 2020, we extracted data from 950 patients from the four cities. There were 477 (50.21%) males and 473 (49.79%) females of age (mean ± SD) 45.64 ± 15.59 years. Before contracting COVID-19, 299 patients had contact with Wuhan residents or contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (31.47%). Also, 138 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection of unknown source (14.53%). COVID-19 patients in the four cities were mainly from Wuhan originally, and had spread infection locally. Therefore, the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in cities outside Wuhan were mainly input. Cutting off input and controlling community communication would reduce local incidence.","Hu, Jianguo; Rao, Shenhong; Hu, Xiaojing",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475873/,180
134203,Sexual activity and contraceptive use during social distancing and self-isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is related to several extrapulmonary disorders; however, little is known about the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological characteristics of pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE To evaluate and summarize the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological characteristics of pernio-like lesions reported in the literature. METHODS We conducted a search of the PubMed, SciELO, and ScienceDirect databases for articles published between January 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020, following the PRISMA recommendations (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42020225055). The target population was individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with pernio-like lesions. Observational studies, research letters, and case/series reports were all eligible for inclusion. Observational studies were evaluated using a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean prevalence, overall mean, and 95% confidence interval. We evaluated case studies using the chi-square test for dichotomous variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS A total of 187 patients from case reports and 715 patients from 18 observational studies were included. The mean age of patients was 16.6 years (range 14.5-18.8). Feet were affected in 91.4% (87.0-94.4%) of patients in observational studies. The proportion of patients with a positive RT-PCR test was less than 15%. Lesion topography and morphology were associated with age. CONCLUSION Lesions mostly occurred in pediatric patients, and the morphological characteristics tended to differ between pediatric and non-pediatric populations. There is a possible multifactorial component in lesion pathophysiology. The non-positivity of laboratory tests does not exclude an association with COVID-19. Pernio-like lesions may be a late manifestation of COVID-19.","Rocha, Kelvin Oliveira; Zanuncio, Virgínia Vinha; Freitas, Brunnella Alcântara Chagas de; Lima, Luciana Moreira",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34515379/,180

METHODS From March 2010 to March 2011, all patients undergoing various surgeon-controlled robotic reconstructive urologic surgeries utilizing barbed sutures were prospectively enrolled in this study. Type and number of procedure performed were noted. Intraoperative and peri-operative outcomes potentially related to suture technique and material were recorded. RESULTS This study reports on 210 patients, in whom barbed suture was used during this period. These included partial nephrectomy (20), pyeloplasty (9), ureteric tailoring and reimplantation (1), closure of bladder after Nephroureterectomy with excision of bladder cuff (8), closure of vaginal cuff in female radical cystectomy (12), partial cystectomy (1), radical prostatectomy (152), simple prostatectomy (2), vesicovaginal fistula repair (3), sacrocolpopexy (1), and hernia repair (1). We encountered 5 instances (2.38%) of tissue cut through possibly attributable to the use of barbed suture and 4 instances of misplacement of suture occurred, of these two required a new suture, whereas retrograde pull back of suture and needle was performed in 2 cases. No instance of slip back/loosening of suture was noted once it was tightened. At mean follow-up of 6.8 (1-14 months) months, we did not encounter any complications of urinary leakage, stone formation or fistula or any clinical evidence of urinary tract obstruction due to the use of barbed suture. CONCLUSION Use of unidirectional barbed suture is safe, feasible, and efficient at short-term follow-up for reconstructive part of urological procedures.","Shah, Hemendra N; Nayyar, Rishi; Rajamahanty, Shrinivas; Hemal, Ashok K",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-011-0075-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22057590/,180
137259,COVID-19 and Telehealth Operations in Texas Primary Care Clinics: Disparities in Medically Underserved Area Clinics.,2021,"This is Part I of a three-part series on community empowerment as a route to greater health equity. We argue that community 'empowerment' approaches in the health field are increasingly restricted to an inward gaze on community psycho-social capacities and proximal neighbourhood conditions, neglecting the outward gaze on political and social transformation for greater equity embedded in foundational statements on health promotion. We suggest there are three imperatives if these approaches are to contribute to increased equity. First, to understand pathways from empowerment to health equity and drivers of the depoliticisation of contemporary empowerment practices. Second, to return to the original concept of empowerment processes that support communities of place/interest to develop capabilities needed to exercise collective control over decisions and actions in the pursuit of social justice. Third, to understand, and engage with, power dynamics in community settings. Based on our longitudinal evaluation of a major English community empowerment initiative and research on neighbourhood resilience, we propose two complementary frameworks to support these shifts. The Emancipatory Power Framework presents collective control capabilities as forms of positive power. The Limiting Power Framework elaborates negative forms of power that restrict the development and exercise of a community's capabilities for collective control. Parts II and III of this series present empirical findings on the operationalization of these frameworks. Part II focuses on qualitative markers of shifts in emancipatory power in BL communities and Part III explores how power dynamics unfolded in these neighbourhoods.","Popay, Jennie; Whitehead, Margaret; Ponsford, Ruth; Egan, Matt; Mead, Rebecca",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382890/,180
137399,Clinical characteristics of adolescents referred for treatment of depressive disorders.,2017-05-01,"Pollinator-dependent crops rely on the activity of managed and wild pollinators. While farm management and surrounding landscape can influence wild pollinator contributions, managed pollinator contributions may be primarily driven by their stocking densities, though this is not well studied across crops. We selected 20 southern highbush blueberry farms along two independent gradients of honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) stocking density (~1-11 hives/acre) and bumble bee Bombus impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae) stocking density (0 - 3 colonies/acre) ensuring that stocking densities were not correlated with farm or landscape attributes. Across farms, we observed managed and wild bee visitation rates, and measured yield estimates. Farms with greater bumble bee stocking densities had higher bumble bee visitation rates and yield estimates, but farms with higher honey bee stocking densities only received higher honey bee visitation rates at the end of bloom and did not have higher yield estimates. The main wild pollinator, the southeastern blueberry bee Habropoda laboriosa (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), showed higher visitation rates on organic farms and in late bloom. In general, higher visitation rates by honey bees, bumble bees, and H. laboriosa were correlated with higher yields. Our results suggest that yields are limited by bee visitation rates, and that within the stocking density ranges studied, increasing managed bumble bees, but not honey bees, increases their visitation rates. While H. laboriosa had the greatest effect on yield estimates, its activity appears to be limited by both a phenological mismatch with crop bloom and farm management.","Mallinger, Rachel; Ternest, John J; Naranjo, Shiala Morales",Journal of economic entomology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106276/,180
137717,Letter to the Editor.,2020-09-11,"OBJECTIVE This retrospective study examined whether changes in patient pre- and post-treatment symptoms correlated with changes in anti-neuronal autoantibody titers and the neuronal cell stimulation assay in the Cunningham Panel in patients with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS), and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). METHODS In an analysis of all tests consecutively performed in Moleculera Labs' clinical laboratory from April 22, 2013 to December 31, 2016, we identified 206 patients who were prescribed at least one panel prior to and following treatment, and who met the PANDAS/PANS diagnostic criteria. Patient follow-up was performed to collect symptoms and treatment or medical intervention. Of the 206 patients, 58 met the inclusion criteria of providing informed consent/assent and documented pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Clinician and parent-reported symptoms after treatment or medical intervention were categorized as ""Improved/Resolved"" (n = 34) or ""Not-Improved/Worsened"" (n = 24). These were analyzed for any association between changes in clinical status and changes in Cunningham panel test results. Clinical assay performance was also evaluated for reproducibility and reliability. RESULTS Comparison of pre- and post-treatment status revealed that the Cunningham Panel results correlated with changes in patient's neuropsychiatric symptoms. Based upon the change in the number of positive tests, the overall accuracy was 86%, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 83% respectively, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 93.4%. When evaluated by changes in autoantibody levels, we observed an overall accuracy of 90%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 92% and an AUC of 95.7%. Assay reproducibility for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.90 (p < 1.67 × 10-6) and the ELISA assays demonstrated test-retest reproducibility comparable with other ELISA assays. CONCLUSION This study revealed a strong positive association between changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in the level of anti-neuronal antibodies and antibody-mediated CaMKII human neuronal cell activation. These results suggest there may be clinical utility in monitoring autoantibody levels and stimulatory activity against these five neuronal antigen targets as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of infection-triggered autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders. Future prospective studies should examine the feasibility of predicting antimicrobial and immunotherapy responses with the Cunningham Panel.","Shimasaki, Craig; Frye, Richard E; Trifiletti, Rosario; Cooperstock, Michael; Kaplan, Gary; Melamed, Isaac; Greenberg, Rosalie; Katz, Amiram; Fier, Eric; Kem, David; Traver, David; Dempsey, Tania; Latimer, M Elizabeth; Cross, Amy; Dunn, Joshua P; Bentley, Rebecca; Alvarez, Kathy; Reim, Sean; Appleman, James",Journal of neuroimmunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2019.577138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884258/,180
138042,"Veterans, Firearms, and Suicide: Safe Storage Prevention Policy and the PREVENTS Roadmap.",2020-09-01,"PURPOSE Perioperative analgesia during thoracotomy is often achieved by combining paravertebral block (PVB) with general anesthesia (GA). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can detect changes in cerebral oxygenation resulting from nociceptive stimuli in the awake state or under sedation. We used NIRS to measure changes in cerebral blood flow provoked by thoracotomy incision made under GA and determine how these changes were influenced by supplementation of GA with PVB. METHODS Thirty-four patients undergoing elective thoracotomy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to a group receiving only GA, or GA combined with PVB (GA + PVB). Changes in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (ΔO2Hb), deoxygenated-Hb (ΔHHb), and total-Hb (ΔtotalHb) were evaluated by NIRS as surgery began. RESULTS In the GA group, ΔO2Hb was significantly higher in the hemisphere contralateral to the side of surgery when the incision was made and 2 min after incision compared with the ipsilateral side (start of surgery, P < 0.01; 2 min, P < 0.05). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the ΔO2Hb at any of the time points in the GA + PVB group. Comparable with ΔO2Hb, the concentration of ΔtotalHb was significantly higher in the contralateral hemisphere in the GA group at the start of surgery (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Changes in the cerebral O2Hb concentration were detected by NIRS immediately after surgical incision under GA, but not in the presence of a PNB. NIRS could be used to monitor surgical pain. PVB inhibited changes in oxygenation induced by incision-provoked pain.","Mukaihara, Keika; Hasegawa-Moriyama, Maiko; Kanmura, Yuichi",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-017-2402-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28836009/,180

METHODS We conducted a retrospective population cohort study of hospital admissions in New Zealand between 23 April and 27 May 1988-2018. We compared acute and arranged hospitalisation and mortality rates in holiday (Anzac Day Monday to Friday) and non-holiday (Anzac Day Saturday or Sunday) years, for mid-week holidays and long weekends; and measured total weekly average acute and arranged hospitalisation counts. RESULTS Hospitalisation rates were lower in holiday years than non-holiday years (rate ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.96, p<0.001), with fewer arranged admissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.94, p<0.001), but no significant difference for acute admissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00, p=0.087). Holiday year acute admission rates were lower than non-holiday years for children aged 0-4 years, but higher for adults aged 15-44 years. Holidays reduced arranged admissions most in children and areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. There was no significant difference for mortality. Average weekly acute hospitalisations were higher than arranged admissions between 10 June and 7 October. CONCLUSION Secondary holidays do not reduce deaths; or acute hospital admissions except in the holiday week; and may delay elective treatment. However, if New Zealand is to add a new public holiday, it would have least detrimental health effect scheduled between 10 June and 7 October.","Telfar Barnard, Lucy Frances",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243758/,180

The aim of this study was to evaluate the blood flow at the marginal artery near the rectosigmoid junction. METHODS From January 2013 to January 2014, we enrolled consecutive patients with a preoperative diagnosis of left-sided colon cancer or rectal cancer who underwent surgery with lymph node dissection. During the operation, the blood flow through the point of origin of the last sigmoid arterial branch, originating from the inferior mesenteric artery, was interrupted, and the rectosigmoid junction was supplied by only the marginal artery. We injected indocyanine green intravenously and observed the blood flow using a near-infrared camera system. RESULTS A total of 119 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Sixty-eight patients (57.1 %) had a good anastomosis of the marginal artery near the rectosigmoid junction (type A). In 27 patients (22.7 %), a fluorescence border was recognized, but the fluorescence border diminished within 60 s (Type B). In 18 patients (15.1 %), delayed fluorescence was recognized over 60 s (type C), and 6 patients (5.0 %) had no fluorescence at all (type D). A mean length of 14.8 cm was found from the peritoneal reflection to fluorescence border of blood flow.

141495,"Kawasaki disease fact check: Myths, misconceptions and mysteries.",2020-08-08,"UNLABELLED The cyclic dinucleotide 2',3'-cGAMP can bind the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon [IFN] genes) to activate the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. We found that cGAMP added to the culture medium could suppress the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b strain Con1 subgenomic replicon in human hepatoma cells. Knockdown of STING expression diminished the inhibitory effect on replicon replication, while overexpression of STING enhanced the inhibitory effects of cGAMP. The addition of cGAMP into 1b/Con1 replicon cells significantly increased the expression of type I IFNs and antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. Unexpectedly, replication of the genotype 2a JFH1 replicon and infectious JFH1 virus was less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of cGAMP than was that of 1b/Con1 replicon. Using chimeric replicons, 2a NS4B was identified to confer resistance to cGAMP. Transient expression of 2a NS4B resulted in a pronounced inhibitory effect on STING-mediated beta IFN (IFN-β) reporter activation compared to that of 1b NS4B. 2a NS4B was found to suppress STING accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. The predicted transmembrane domain of 2a NS4B was required to inhibit STING accumulation. These results demonstrate a novel genotype-specific inhibition of the STING-mediated host antiviral immune response. IMPORTANCE The cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP was found to potently inhibit the replication of HCV genotype 1b Con1 replicon but was less effective for the 2a/JFH1 replicon and infectious JFH1 virus. The predicted transmembrane domain in 2a NS4B was shown to be responsible for the decreased sensitivity to cGAMP. The N terminus of NS4B has been reported to suppress STING-mediated signaling by disrupting the interaction of STING and TBK1 and/or MAVS. We show that 2a/JFH1 NS4B has an additional mechanism to evade STING signaling through suppressing STING accumulation.","Yi, Guanghui; Wen, Yahong; Shu, Chang; Han, Qingxia; Konan, Kouacou V; Li, Pingwei; Kao, C Cheng",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01720-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468527/,180

METHODS We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. RESULTS The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of β Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus. This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.","Zhou, Yezhen; Zhang, Shihao; Chen, Jiayi; Wan, Chengsong; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Bao",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376535/,180

The TaperGuard™ ETT has a tapered, polyvinylchloride cuff designed to reduce microaspiration around channels that form with a standard barrel-shaped cuff. We compared risk of postoperative pneumonia using the TaperGuard™ ETT and the standard ETT in surgical patients requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. METHODS We used an interrupted time-series design to compare endotracheal intubation using the TaperGuard™ ETT (intervention cohort), and a historic cohort using the standard ETT (baseline cohort), among surgical patients requiring hospital admission. We compared the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in the intervention and baseline cohorts. Data were collected from the electronic health record and linked to patient-level data from National Surgical Quality Improvement Project. Additionally, we performed secondary analyses in a subgroup of patients at high risk of postoperative pneumonia. RESULTS 15,388 subjects were included; 6351 in the intervention cohort and 9037 in the baseline cohort. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative pneumonia between the intervention cohort (1.62%) and the baseline cohort (1.79%). The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of postoperative pneumonia was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.16; p = 0.423) and the OR adjusted for patient characteristics and potential confounders was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.19; p = 0.469), comparing the intervention and baseline cohorts. There was no a priori selected subgroup of patients for whom the use of the TaperGuard™ ETT was associated with decreased odds of postoperative pneumonia relative to the standard ETT. Hospital mortality was higher in the intervention cohort (1.5%) compared with the baseline cohort (1.0%; OR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.95; p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS The broad implementation of the use of the TaperGuard™ ETT for intubation of surgical patients was not associated with a reduction in the risk of postoperative pneumonia. In the setting of a low underlying postoperative pneumonia risk and the use of recommended preventative VAP bundles, further risk reduction may not be achievable by simply modifying the ETT cuff design in unselected or high-risk populations undergoing inpatient surgery.

While the main cause of PD is still not clear, it is shown that the basal ganglia loop, which has a role in adjusting a planned movement execution through fine motor control, is altered during this disease and contributes toward the manifested motor symptoms. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a non-invasive technique to influence the vestibular system and stimulate the motor system. This study explores how the motor symptoms of upper and lower extremities in PD are instantly affected by vestibular stimulation. In this regard, direct current GVS was applied to 11 individuals with PD on medication while they were performing two sets of experiments: (1) Instrumented Timed Up and Go (iTUG) test and (2) finger tapping task. The performance of participants was recorded with accelerometers and cameras for offline processing of data. Several outcome measures including coefficient of variation of the step duration, gait phase, phase coordination index, tapping score, and the number and duration of manual motor blocks (MMBs) were considered for objective quantifying of performance. Results showed that almost all of considered outcome measures were improved with the application of GVS and that the improvement in the coefficient of variation of the step duration, the tapping score, and the number of MMBs was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that GVS can be used to alleviate some of the common motor symptoms of PD. Further research is required to fully characterize the effects of GVS and determine its efficacy in the long term.","Khoshnam, Mahta; Häner, Daniela M C; Kuatsjah, Eunice; Zhang, Xin; Menon, Carlo",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254564/,180

In hemodialysis, obese subjects display lower mortality rates despite hypoadiponectinemia, while higher adiponectin concentrations correlate with an elevated cardiovascular risk in nonobese subjects. The aim of the study is to suggest that adiponectin level variations are associated with differences in the body mass index (BMI). The interplay between adiponectin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) levels may vary according to body fat mass. Fifty-two chronic hemodialysis patients were divided into three groups. Group A, BMI<25 (n=20); Group B, BMI 25 to 30 (n=21), and Group C, BMI>30 (n=11). Diabetics: Group A 10%; Group B 6 29%; Group C 55%, P=0.027. Determinations: Adiponectin, Pro-BNP, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA), troponin T, nutritional status, ultrafiltration rates, C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular accesses, and echocardiography. Group A: adiponectinemia positively and significantly correlated with Pro-BNP, CRP, and troponin T. As BMI increased, adiponectin, Pro-BNP, and malnutrition significantly decreased, while insulin, HOMA, and ultrafiltration rates significantly increased. Cardiac restriction was significantly higher in obese patients. In all groups, Pro-BNP and troponin T displayed a strong positive correlation. In low-BMI subjects, high Pro-BNP and adiponectin, low myocardial restriction, and worse nutritional status were prevalent. In obesity, hypoadiponectinemia stimulates cardiac remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy, and decreased stretching, rendering Pro-BNP levels low despite high ultrafiltration rates. Thus, adiponectin correlates inversely with BMI, probably playing different cardiovascular roles as BMI changes.","Trimarchi, Hernan; Muryan, Alexis; Dicugno, Mariana; Forrester, Mariano; Lombi, Fernando; Young, Pablo; Pomeranz, Vanesa; Iriarte, Romina; Barucca, Nanci; Campolo-Girard, Vicente; Alonso, Mirta; Lindholm, Bengt",Hemodialysis international.

We evaluated the clinical performance of Standard Q COVID-19 RAT (SQ-RAT; SD Biosensor, Suwon, Korea), the first RAT approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. In total, 680 nasopharyngeal swabs previously tested using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) were retested using SQ-RAT. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT relative to that of rRT-PCR was 28.7% for all specimens and was 81.4% for specimens with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) threshold cycle (Ct) values ≤23.37, which is the limit of detection of SQ-RAT. The specificity was 100%. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT for COVID-19 diagnosis was assessed based on the Ct distribution at diagnosis of 33,294 COVID-19 cases in Korea extracted from the laboratory surveillance system of Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT for COVID-19 diagnosis in the Korean population was 41.8%.

161978,Preliminary Evaluation of an Order Template to Improve Diagnosis and Testosterone Therapy of Hypogonadism in Veterans.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND The matricellular protein periostin has been associated with CKD progression in animal models and human biopsy specimens. Periostin functions by interacting with extracellular matrix components to drive collagen fibrillogenesis and remodeling or by signaling through cell-surface integrin receptors to promote cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. However, its role in AKI is unknown. METHODS We used mice with conditional tubule-specific overexpression of periostin or knockout mice lacking periostin expression in the renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model, and primary cultures of isolated tubular cells in a hypoxia-reoxygenation model. RESULTS Tubular epithelial cells showed strong production of periostin during the repair phase of ischemia reperfusion. Periostin overexpression protected mice from renal injury compared with controls, whereas knockout mice showed increased tubular injury and deteriorated renal function. Periostin interacted with its receptor, integrin-β1, to inhibit tubular cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in in vivo and in vitro models. After ischemia-reperfusion injury, periostin-overexpressing mice exhibited diminished expression of proinflammatory molecules and had more F4/80+ macrophages compared with knockout mice. Macrophages from periostin-overexpressing mice showed increased proliferation and expression of proregenerative factors after ischemia-reperfusion injury, whereas knockout mice exhibited the opposite. Coculturing a macrophage cell line with hypoxia-treated primary tubules overexpressing periostin, or treating such macrophages with recombinant periostin, directly induced macrophage proliferation and expression of proregenerative molecules. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the detrimental role of periostin in CKD, we discovered a protective role of periostin in AKI. Our findings suggest periostin may be a novel and important mediator of mechanisms controlling renal repair after AKI.","Kormann, Raphaёl; Kavvadas, Panagiotis; Placier, Sandrine; Vandermeersch, Sophie; Dorison, Aude; Dussaule, Jean-Claude; Chadjichristos, Christos E; Prakoura, Niki; Chatziantoniou, Christos",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019020113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690575/,180

Cognizant of the authoritarian risks in severed enjoyments of constitutional rights, the authors conclude that this is not what occurred in the case of solid democracies.

174114,Adaptation of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Autistic Children During the Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Program Evaluation,2021,"In animal gonads, transposable elements (TEs) are actively repressed to preserve genome integrity through the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. In mice, piRNAs are most abundantly expressed in male germ cells, and form effector complexes with three distinct PIWI proteins. The depletion of individual Piwi genes causes male-specific sterility owing to severe defects in spermatogenesis with no discernible phenotype in female mice. Unlike mice, most other mammals have four PIWI genes, some of which are expressed in the ovary. Here, purification of PIWI complexes from oocytes of the golden hamster revealed that the size of the piRNAs loaded onto PIWIL1 changed during oocyte maturation. In contrast, PIWIL3, an ovary-specific PIWI in most mammals, associates with short piRNAs only in metaphase II oocytes, which coincides with intense phosphorylation of the protein. An improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation revealed that PIWIL1- and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs appear to share the 5′- ends of common piRNA precursors and are mostly derived from unannotated sequences with a diminished contribution from TE-derived sequences, most of which correspond to endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Although binding sites for the transcription factor A-Myb are identified in the transcription start site regions of the testis piRNA clusters, the piRNA clusters in the ovary show no well-defined binding motifs in their upstream regions. These results show that hamster piRNA clusters are transcribed by different transcriptional factors in the ovary and testis, resulting in the generation of sex-specific piRNAs. Our findings show the complex and dynamic nature of biogenesis of piRNAs in hamster oocytes, and together with the new genome sequence generated, serve as the foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes. Highlights - The size of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs changes during oocyte maturation - Phosphorylation of PIWIL3 in MII oocytes coincides with its association with small 19-nt piRNAs - Improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation identifies young endogenous retroviruses as major targets of piRNAs in hamster oocytes - PIWIL1- and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs share the 5′-ends of the common piRNA precursors in oocytes","Ishino, Kyoko; Hasuwa, Hidetoshi; Yoshimura, Jun; Iwasaki, Yuka W.; Nishihara, Hidenori; Seki, Naomi M.; Hirano, Takamasa; Tsuchiya, Marie; Ishizaki, Hinako; Masuda, Harumi; Kuramoto, Tae; Saito, Kuniaki; Sakakibara, Yasubumi; Toyoda, Atsushi; Itoh, Takehiko; Siomi, Mikiko C.; Morishita, Shinichi; Siomi, Haruhiko",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407411,180

While the most common germicidal wavelength, 254 nm, is harmful to humans, studies demonstrated the germicidal effect of the wavelength of 222 nm and indicated it could be safe to humans under certain exposure conditions. Also, different conditions of virus exposure to UVC light were considered and the UVC dose required for n-log reduction compared. Data from analyzed studies demonstrated that some factors such as temperature, incident wavelength, and virus family have been shown to be important to determine the inactivation dose. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Rossi, M.

Knowledge of the very complex composition and function of the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system is essential to understanding persistent infection. The best solution to the problem of persistent infection is by prevention using prophylactic vaccines. Hit and run viruses evade immune destruction by infecting new hosts and rarely persist. Hit and stay viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine escape, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic change. Twelve prophylactic vaccines against hit and run agents exist, and there are only three vaccines against hit and stay viruses, all of which are of DNA composition. Several new vaccines against hit and stay viruses are feasible, but protective vaccines against RNA HIV and hepatitis C agents are highly unlikely, short of a major breakthrough. Therapeutic vaccines are very improbable without a magnitude of favorable new discoveries. In the meantime, antiviral chemotherapy, chemotherapy/prophylactic vaccination, and short interfering RNA silencing are worthy of intense investigation.","Hilleman, Maurice R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297608/,180

Inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), along with transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) in young (n=16, 21.1±2.1 years) individuals were examined in a cross-sectional descriptive study, to assess the effects of chronic stimulation on their expression and relationship with health parameters. Methods Fasting venous whole blood and lipid levels along with body composition measurements were obtained from young, healthy, endurance-trained NCAA Division III student-athletes and untrained individuals. Assays (ELISA) were conducted to analyze fasting plasma (CRP, IL-6, and TNFα) and isolated lymphocyte NF-κB activation (lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood samples through differential centrifugation and Ficoll-Paque). A Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient was used for associations between variables and a regression analysis was performed to determine which measurement accounted for the inflammation in this young and apparently healthy population. Results While the inflammatory markers were not associated with each other, CRP levels were associated with body composition and following regression analyses, body fat percentage (P>0.05) was a significant factor for elevated CRP. Conclusions Chronic physical exercise eliciting lower body fat percentages in young adults may have a positive protective impact through anti-inflammatory status, minimizing disease risk in a young population. Relevance for Patients Chronic physically active young adult patients may exhibit less inflammation and lower body fat levels which may decrease their risk for chronic disease.","Dunn, Sarah L; Vera, Desiree L; Weaver, Kathleen F; Garcia, Jerome V",Journal of clinical and translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179543/,180

The specific CTL response did not begin to decline until the amount of virus, which peaked at day 8 p.i. in both the kidneys and lungs, started to decrease. Clinical respiratory signs of illness also correlated with amount of virus. CTL activity was shown to be major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class restricted because the lysis of MHC-mismatched targets was negligible, and lysis was mediated by CD8+ CD4- T cells, as the CTL response could be abolished with removal of CD8+ CD4- but not CD4+ CD8- lymphocytes. In contrast, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody was not detected until day 10 p.i., and levels peaked at day 12 p.i.; IgG antibody levels were minimal until day 15 p.i. but continued to increase exponentially until day 30 p.i., the last day examined.

206731,COVID-19 related stigma and its association with mental health of health-care workers after quarantined in Vietnam,2020,"BACKGROUND: An infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus that can manifest as an acute respiratory infection was discovered in China in mid-December 2019 and soon spread throughout the country and to the rest of the world. Although chest X-rays are the initial imaging technique of choice for low respiratory infections with or without dyspnea, few articles have reported the radiologic findings in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection attended at our hospital in March 2020. To analyze the frequency of COVID-19 compared to other respiratory infections, and to describe the radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included all children with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection (fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or dyspnea) that required chest X-rays in our hospital between March 1 and March 31. RESULTS: A total of 231 pediatric patients (90 (39%) girls and 141 (61%) boys; mean age, 4 y, range 1 month - 16 years) underwent chest X-rays for suspected respiratory infections. Most (88.4%) had mild symptoms; 29.9% had a family member positive for COVID-19 with symptoms similar to those of the patient. Nasal and/or throat swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR in the 47 (20.3%) children who presented at the emergency department; 3 (6.3%) of these were positive. Microbiological analyses were done in 85 (36.8%) of all patients, finding infections due to pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in 30 (35.3%). One of the patients with a PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 had urine infection due to E. coli and blood culture positive for S. viridans. Abnormalities were observed on X-rays in 73.2% of the patients. Peribronchial thickening was the most common abnormal finding, observed in 57% of patients. Parenchymal consolidations were observed in 38.5%, being bilateral in 29.2% and associated with pleural effusion in 3.3%. The interstitial lines were thickened in 7.3%, and 7.3% had ground-glass opacities. CONCLUSION: During March 2020, COVID-19 and other symptomatic respiratory infections were observed. The radiologic pattern of these infections is nonspecific, and chest X-rays alone are insufficient for the diagnosis. Children with clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 (with or without PCR confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2) had mild symptoms and most did not require admission or invasive mechanical ventilation. In a context of community transmission, the absence of a known epidemiological antecedent should not be a contraindication for PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2.","Aguirre Pascual, E; Coca Robinot, D; Gallego Herrero, C; Navallas Irujo, M; Rasero Ponferrada, M; Pont Vilalta, M",Radiologia,,180
206732,COVID-19 related stigma and its association with mental health of health-care workers after quarantined in Vietnam,2020,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since its emergence in 2012, nosocomial amplifications have led to its high epidemic potential and mortality rate of 34.5%. To date, there is an unmet need for vaccines and specific therapeutics for this disease. Available treatments are either supportive medications in use for other diseases or those lacking specificity requiring higher doses. The viral infection mode is initiated by the attachment of the viral spike glycoprotein to the human Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP4). Our attempts to screen antivirals against MERS led us to identify montelukast sodium hydrate (MSH), an FDA-approved anti-asthma drug, as an agent attenuating MERS-CoV infection. We showed that MSH directly binds to MERS-CoV-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and inhibits its molecular interaction with DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner. Our cell-based inhibition assays using MERS pseudovirions demonstrated that viral infection was significantly inhibited by MSH and was further validated using infectious MERS-CoV culture. Thus, we propose MSH as a potential candidate for therapeutic developments against MERS-CoV infections.","Gan, Hanjie Jonathan; Harikishore, Amaravadhi; Lee, Jihye; Jeon, Sangeun; Rajan, Sreekanth; Chen, Ming Wei; Neo, Jun Long; Kim, Seungtaek; Yoon, Ho Sup",Antiviral Res,,180

215853,"""This Level of Death, It's New""-Health Care Workers in Their Own Words",2021,"Several factors ranging from environmental risks to the genetics of the virus and that of the hosts, affect the spread of COVID-19. The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus. Given the role of environmental and nutritional factors, we discuss and recommend some strategies to prevent the disease and protect the population against COVID-19. Since an effective vaccine can prevent the transmission of communicable diseases and abolish pandemics, we added a brief review of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Zarei, Mohammad; Rahimi, Karim; Hassanzadeh, Kambiz; Abdi, Mohammad; Hosseini, Vahedeh; Fathi, Ali; Kakaei, Karim",Environ Res,,180

Despite the notoriety clozapine achieved early in its development, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that close blood monitoring beyond the first year of treatment yields minimal safety benefits. Many health care systems have relaxed clozapine blood monitoring requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic for practical reasons, and this presents an opportunity to implement permanent, long overdue changes in mandated monitoring that reflect what has been learned about the real risk for blood dyscrasias with clozapine.","Gurrera, Ronald J",Psychiatry Res,,180

Methods - Continuous 12 lead-ECG of 5 episodes of long-lasting VF occurring in 3 patients with left ventricular assist device were analyzed. Spectral analysis (dominant frequency, DF) and quantification of waveform amplitude, regularity (URI) and complexity (NDI) were performed over a median of 24 minutes of VF. RF ablation was performed during VF in two patients. Results - There was a significant increase in DF between VF onset and termination but none of the other parameters significantly changed. Some VF parameters varied from patient to patient and from lead to lead. DF decreased after RF ablation in both cases and VF terminated spontaneously shortly after ablation in one case. The previously incessant VFs in these two patients did not recur afterward. Conclusions - VF rate increases over time in patients with left ventricular assist devices and is lowered by ablation. Long-lasting VF may be modified or even terminated by ablation.","Maury, Philippe; Duchateau, Josselin; Rollin, Anne; Hocini, Mélèze; Voglimacci-Stephanopoli, Quentin; Monteil, Benjamin; Sacher, Frederic; Jaïs, Pierre; Bernus, Olivier; Mondoly, Pierre; Delmas, Clément; Haïssaguerre, Michel; Dubois, Rémi",Circ.

225082,Children's emergency presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. Its causative virus, is a novel strain of RNA viruses with high mortality rate. There is no definitive treatment, but among available approaches the use of recovered patients' plasma containing specific antibodies can enhance the immune response against coronavirus. However, the dearth of eligible donors and also ABO incompatibility in plasma transfusion, have limited this therapeutic method. Therefore, it is highly desirable to introduce a simple procedure that allows efficient reduction or even removal of natural ABO antibodies. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate a RBC-mediated adsorption technique that reduces the titer of the mentioned antibodies in plasma. METHODS/MATERIALS: This experimental study was conducted in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. The pre- and post-incubation antibody titers of 168 plasma samples were determined. For incubation, each plasma sample was exposed (60 min) to different percentages of RBCs at room temperature or 4 °C. RESULTS: The results evidenced that both the concentration of RBCs and temperature had significant decreasing effects on antibody titer (P < 0.001) and all concentrations significantly reduced titer. Compared to RT, 4 °C further reduced the antibody titer. Overall, the best incubation condition for reducing antibody titer in all blood groups was 4 °C and 2% RBCs concentration. CONCLUSION: The presented adsorption procedure is able to produce universal plasma (we call it Ubiquitous Convalescent Plasma) with a non-immunogenic level of ABO mismatch antibodies which can be used for COVID-19 patients with any type of blood group with desirable simplicity, feasibility, and efficacy.","Sattarzadeh Bardsiri, Mahla; Kouhbananinejad, Seyedeh Mehrnaz; Vahidi, Reza; Soleimany, Saeed; Moghadari, Masoud; Derakhshani, Ali; Kashani, Bahareh; Farsinejad, Alireza",Transfus Apher Sci,,180

We evaluate the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected preeclamptic women. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the potential of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), dolutegravir (DTG) and remdesivir (RDV) in drug repurposing and their safety in pregnancy complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In HIV infection, the trans-activator of transcription protein, which has homology with vascular endothelial growth factor, impairs angiogenesis, leading to endothelial injury and possible PE development despite neutralization of their opposing immune states. Markers of ED show strong evidence supporting the adverse role of ART in PE development and mortality compared to treatment-naïve pregnancies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) to induce ED and hypertension, thereby mimicking angiotensin II-mediated PE in severe cases of infection. Upregulated ACE 2 in pregnancy is a possible risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PE development. The potential effectiveness of LPV/r against COVID-19 is inconclusive; however, defective decidualization, along with elevated markers of ED, was observed. Therefore, the safety of these drugs in HIV-positive pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 requires attention. Despite the observed endothelial protective properties of DTG, there is a lack of evidence of its effects on pregnancy and COVID-19 therapeutics. Understanding RDV-ART interactions and the inclusion of pregnant women in antiviral drug repurposing trials is essential.

Surgeries due to acute cholecystitis and complications from previous elective procedures decreased (26.7% vs. 9.4%) during the pandemic, while bowel obstructions and abdominal wall hernia surgeries increased (12.3% vs. 22.2%) (p = 0.001). Morbidity was higher during pandemic period (34.7% vs. 47.1%, p = 0.022), although this difference was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Reoperation rate (17.9% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.212) and mortality (6.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.358) were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in the performance of Acute Care Surgery procedures was observed. Moreso, a longer time from symptoms onset to patient arrival at the Emergency Department was noted. Higher morbidity was observed in patients undergoing Acute Care Surgery during the pandemic period, although there was not any difference in mortality or reoperation rate.","Cano-Valderrama, Oscar; Morales, Xavier; Ferrigni, Carlos J; Martín-Antona, Esteban; Turrado, Victor; García, Alejandro; Cuñarro-López, Yolanda; Zarain-Obrador, Leire; Duran-Poveda, Manuel; Balibrea, José M; Torres, Antonio J",Int J Surg,,180

Experts have speculated the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior. However, a quantitative synthesis is needed to reach an overall conclusion regarding the pandemic-suicide link. In the most comprehensive test of the COVID-19-suicidality link to date, we meta-analyzed data from 308,596 participants across 54 studies. Our results suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation (10.81%), suicide attempts (4.68%), and self-harm (9.63%) during the COVID-19 pandemic when considered against event rates from pre-pandemic studies. Moderation analysis indicated younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most susceptible to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are alarmingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic and vary based upon age, gender, and geopolitics. Strong protections from governments (e.g., implementing best practices in suicide prevention) are urgently needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dubé, Justin P; Smith, Martin M; Sherry, Simon B; Hewitt, Paul L; Stewart, Sherry H",Psychiatry Res,,180
235265,The Five A's of Access for TechQuity,2021,"Background and Aim: With the wide applications of chitosan and gold nanoparticles in drug delivery and many consumer products, there is limited available information about their effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). Changes in DMEs could result in serious drug interactions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to chitosan or gold nanoparticles on hepatic Phase I and II DMEs, liver function and integrity, oxidative damage and liver architecture in male rats. Methods: Animals were divided into three equal groups: a control group, a group treated with chitosan nanoparticles (200 mg/kg, 50±5 nm) and a group treated with gold nanoparticles (4 mg/kg, 15±5 nm). Rats were orally administered their respective doses daily for 10 days. Results: Both chitosan and gold nanoparticles decreased the body weights by more than 10%. Gold nanoparticles reduced the activities of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase and catalase), and reduced glutathione level and elevated the malondialdehyde level in the liver. Gold nanoparticles caused significant reductions in CYP1A1, CYP2E1, quinone oxidoreductase1, and glutathione S-transferase and elevated CYP2D6 and N-acetyl transferase2. Chitosan elevated CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 and reduced UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Both nanoparticles disturbed the architecture of the liver, but the deleterious effects after gold nanoparticles treatment were more prominent. Conclusion: Taken together, gold nanoparticles severely perturbed the DMEs and would result in serious interactions with many drugs, herbs, and foods.","Al-Hamadani, Mohammed Y I; Alzahrani, Abdullah M; Yousef, Mokhtar I; Kamel, Maher A; El-Sayed, Wael M",Int J Nanomedicine,,180

238939,Overview of the Issue,2021,"Samenvatting De behandeling van eerste keuze voor vesicale stenen is de transurethrale cystolithotripsie (TUCL). Door de COVID-19-pandemie kampen ziekenhuizen echter met lange wachttijden voor – onder meer – deze operaties. Daarnaast komen sommige patiënten niet in aanmerking voor een operatie door hun comorbiditeit. In de jaren negentig van de vorige eeuw was extracorporele shockwave lithotripsie (ESWL) een veel gebruikte, veilige behandelmethode voor blaasstenen. Toen TUCL effectiever bleek, is ESWL voor blaasstenen echter in de vergetelheid geraakt. ESWL is poliklinisch uit te voeren, waardoor wachttijden korter zijn dan die voor operatieve ingrepen. Gedurende de COVID-19-pandemie hebben we enkele patiënten met blaasstenen behandeld met ESWL. We concluderen dat ESWL een geschikt alternatief is voor de TUCL bij geselecteerde patiënten, maar dat voor een effectieve behandeling meerdere ESWL-procedures nodig zijn.","Zeelenberg, Anna M.; Hendriks, Nora Schout Barbara M.

239157,"Experiences of living with mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a coproduced, participatory qualitative interview study",2021,"This spring, students across the globe transitioned from in-person classes to remote learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This unprecedented change to undergraduate education saw institutions adopting multiple online teaching modalities and instructional platforms. We sought to understand students’ experiences with and perspectives on those methods of remote instruction in order to inform pedagogical decisions during the current pandemic and in future development of online courses and virtual learning experiences. Our survey gathered quantitative and qualitative data regarding students’ experiences with synchronous and asynchronous methods of remote learning and specific pedagogical techniques associated with each. A total of 4,789 undergraduate participants representing institutions across 95 countries were recruited via Instagram. We find that most students prefer synchronous online classes, and students whose primary mode of remote instruction has been synchronous report being more engaged and motivated. Our qualitative data show that students miss the social aspects of learning on campus, and it is possible that synchronous learning helps to mitigate some feelings of isolation. Students whose synchronous classes include active-learning techniques (which are inherently more social) report significantly higher levels of engagement, motivation, enjoyment, and satisfaction with instruction. Respondents’ recommendations for changes emphasize increased engagement, interaction, and student participation. We conclude that active-learning methods, which are known to increase motivation, engagement, and learning in traditional classrooms, also have a positive impact in the remote-learning environment. Integrating these elements into online courses will improve the student experience. © Copyright © 2021 Nguyen, Netto, Wilkins, Bröker, Vargas, Sealfon, Puthipiroj, Li, Bowler, Hinson, Pujar and Stein.","Nguyen, T.; Netto, C.

The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites that can evade detection by RDTs threatens control and elimination efforts. These parasites lack or have altered genes encoding histidine-rich proteins (HRPs) 2 and 3, the antigens recognized by HRP2-based RDTs. Surveillance of such parasites is dependent on identifying false-negative RDT results among suspected malaria cases, a task made more challenging during the current pandemic because of the overlap of symptoms between malaria and COVID-19, particularly in areas of low malaria transmission. Here, we share our perspective on the emergence of P. falciparum parasites lacking HRP2 and HRP3, and the surveillance needed to identify them amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Beshir, Khalid B; Grignard, Lynn; Hajissa, Khalid; Mohammed, Abdulrahman; Nurhussein, Awolkhier M; Ishengoma, Deus S; Lubis, Inke Nadia D; Drakeley, Chris J; Sutherland, Colin J",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,180

However, their treatment options are currently unavailable. Current studies have shown that quercetin is both resistant to COVID-19 and DENGUE; this study aimed to evaluate the possible functional roles and underlying mechanisms of action of quercetin as a potential molecular candidate against COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. METHODS: We used a series of bioinformatics analyses to understand and characterize the biological functions, pharmacological targets and therapeutic mechanisms of quercetin in COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. RESULTS: We revealed the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and DENGUE, including pathological mechanisms, key inflammatory pathways and possible methods of intervention, 60 overlapping targets related to the co-infection and the drug were identified, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) was constructed and TNF&#945;, CCL-2 and CXCL8 could become potential drug targets. Furthermore, we disclosed the signaling pathways, biological functions and upstream pathway activity of quercetin in COVID-19 and DENGUE. The analysis indicated that quercetin could inhibit cytokines release, alleviate excessive immune responses and eliminate inflammation, through NF-&#954;B, IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to reveal quercetin as a pharmacological drug for COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection remain a potential threat to the world's public health system. Therefore, we need innovative thinking to provide admissible evidence for quercetin as a potential molecule drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and DENGUE, but the findings have not been verified in actual patients, so further clinical drug trials are needed.","Zheng, Wenjiang; Wu, Hui; Wang, Ting; Zhan, Shaofeng; Liu, Xiaohong",Brief. bioinform,,180

Virus infection requires the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although studies have demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies to be protective in animal models, and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about immunoglobulin isotypes capable of blocking infection. METHODS: We studied spike- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin isotypes in convalescent and acute plasma/serum samples using a multiplex bead assay. We also determined virus neutralization activities in plasma and serum samples, and purified immunoglobulin fractions using a vesicular stomatitis pseudovirus assay. RESULTS: Spike- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG1, and IgA1 were produced by all or nearly all subjects at variable levels and detected early after infection. All samples displayed neutralizing activity. Regression analyses revealed that IgM and IgG1 contributed most to neutralization, consistent with IgM and IgG fractions' neutralization potency. IgA also exhibited neutralizing activity, but with lower potency. CONCLUSION: IgG, IgM, and IgA are critical components of convalescent plasma used for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Klingler, Jéromine; Weiss, Svenja; Itri, Vincenza; Liu, Xiaomei; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian; Ikegame, Satoshi; Hung, Chuan-Tien; Enyindah-Asonye, Gospel; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Nádas, Arthur; Liu, Sean; Lee, Benhur; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Hioe, Catarina E",J Infect Dis,,180

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. OBJECTIVE: To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. DESIGN: An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. SETTING: Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok). PARTICIPANTS: 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. RESULTS: The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192).

247828,An Innovative Model of Urgent Care for the Underserved: A Case Report of an Urban Hospital-Affiliated Federally Qualified Health Center Urgent Care Clinic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Achieving universal immunization coverage and reaching every child with life-saving vaccines will require the implementation of pro-equity immunization strategies, especially in poorer countries. Gavi-supported countries continue to implement and report strategies that aim to address implementation challenges and improve equity. This paper summarizes the first mapping of these strategies from country reports. METHODS: Thirteen Gavi-supported countries were purposively selected with emphasis on Gavi's priority countries. Following a scoping of different documents submitted to Gavi by countries, 47 Gavi Joint Appraisals (JAs) for the period 2016-2019 from the 13 selected countries were included in the mapping. We used a consolidated framework synthesized from 16 different equity and health systems frameworks, which incorporated UNICEF's coverage and equity assessment approach - an adaptation of the Tanahashi model. Using search terms, the mapping was conducted using a combination of manual search and the MAXQDA qualitative analysis tool. Pro-equity strategies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and compiled in an Excel database, and then populated on a tableau visualization dashboard. RESULTS: In total, 258 pro-equity strategies were implemented by the 13 sampled Gavi-supported countries between 2016 and 2019. The framework determinants of social norms, utilization, and management and coordination accounted for more than three-quarters of all pro-equity strategies implemented in these countries. The median number of strategies reported per country was 17. Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Uganda reported the highest number of strategies that we considered as pro-equity. CONCLUSION: Findings from this mapping can be useful in addressing equity gaps, reaching partially immunized, and 'zero-dose' vaccinated children, and valuable resource for countries planning to implement pro-equity strategies, especially as immunization stakeholders reimagine immunization delivery in light of COVID-19, and as Gavi finalizes its fifth organizational strategy. Future efforts should seek to identify pro-equity strategies being implemented across additional countries, and to assess the extent to which these strategies have improved immunization coverage and equity.","Dadari, Ibrahim; Higgins-Steele, Ariel; Sharkey, Alyssa; Charlet, Danielle; Shahabuddin, Asm; Nandy, Robin; Jackson, Debra",Vaccine,,180

249189,Grappling With the COVID-19 Health Crisis: Content Analysis of Communication Strategies and Their Effects on Public Engagement on Social Media,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent overdose trends are characterized by increased toxicological detection of stimulants with opioids, yet it is unclear whether these substances are mixed prior to consumption or purposefully used simultaneously. METHODS: Postmortem toxicology data were collected in Marion County, Indiana, from 45 fatal overdose cases involving heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, or cocaine. Substances found by death scene investigators at the scene of the fatal overdose (57 samples) were tested using high-pressure liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. We compared toxicology and LC-MS results to understand whether substances contributing to overdose were found in combination or separately at the scene of the overdose. RESULTS: Comparing toxicology reports with LC-MS results from substances found at the scene of overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants reveal that deaths are largely the result of the co-use of opioids and stimulants, rather than use of stimulants combined with opioids. CONCLUSIONS: Collecting and testing physical samples from fatal overdose scenes and comparing these to post-mortem toxicology results is a new way to examine polydrug use patterns. This community overdose surveillance method can be used to improve overdose prevention and response efforts.","Lockwood, Tracy-Lynn E; Huynh, Philip; Richard, Alex; Sightes, Emily; Bailey, Katie; Ray, Bradley; Lieberman, Marya",Drug Alcohol Depend,,180

Secondary endpoints were the identification of factors associated with the inability to selectively cannulate coronary ostia after TAVR. RESULTS: Among 300 patients enrolled in the RE-ACCESS study from December 2018 to January 2020, a total of 23 cases (7.7%) of unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR were documented. This issue occurred in 22 of 23 cases with the use of Evolut R/PRO transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) (17.9% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the use of Evolut R/PRO TAVs (odds ratio [OR]: 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 335.0; p < 0.01), the TAV-sinus of Valsalva relation (OR: 1.1 per 1-mm increase; 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.2; p < 0.01), and the mean TAV implantation depth (OR: 1.7 per 1-mm decrease; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.3; p < 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR. A model combining these factors was demonstrated to predict with very high accuracy the risk for unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR (area under the curve: 0.94; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Unsuccessful coronary cannulation following TAVR was observed in 7.7% of patients and occurred almost exclusively in those receiving Evolut TAVs. The combination of Evolut TAV, a higher TAV-sinus of Valsalva relation, and implantation depth predicts with high accuracy the risk for unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR.

A mixed-methods evaluation of a resilience training intervention,2020,"Background: Knowledge gaps remain in the epidemiology and clinical implications of myocardial injury in COVID-19. Our goal was to determine the prevalence and outcomes of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 compared to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to COVID-19. Methods: We included intubated COVID-19 patients from 5 hospitals between March 15 and June 11, 2020 with troponin levels assessed. We compared them to patients from a cohort study of myocardial injury in ARDS. We performed survival analysis with primary outcome of in-hospital death associated with myocardial injury. We performed linear regression to identify clinical factors associated with myocardial injury in COVID-19. Results: Of 243 patients intubated with COVID-19, 51% had troponin levels > upper limit of normal (ULN). Chronic kidney disease, lactate, ferritin and fibrinogen were associated with myocardial injury. Mortality was 22.7% among COVID-19 patients with troponin < ULN and 61.5% for those with troponin levels > 10xULN (P< 0.001). The association of myocardial injury with mortality was not statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and multi-system organ dysfunction. Compared to non-COVID ARDS patients, patients with COVID-19 were older with higher creatinine and less favorable vital signs. After adjustment, COVID-19 was associated with lower odds of myocardial injury compared to non-COVID ARDS (OR 0.55 95% CI 0.36-0.84, P=0.005). Conclusions: Myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 is a function of baseline comorbidities, advanced age and multisystem organ dysfunction similar to traditional ARDS. The adverse prognosis of myocardial injury in COVID-19 relates largely to multisystem organ involvement and critical illness.","Metkus, Thomas S; Sokoll, Lori J; Barth, Andreas S; Czarny, Matthew J; Hays, Allison G; Lowenstein, Charles J; Michos, Erin D; Nolley, Eric P; Post, Wendy S; Resar, Jon R; Thiemann, David R; Trost, Jeffrey C; Hasan, Rani K",Circulation,,180

255279,mHealth Mindfulness Intervention for Women with Moderate-to-Moderately-Severe Antenatal Depressive Symptoms: a Pilot Study Within an Integrated Health Care System,2021,"BACKGROUND: The twin pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism during 2020 have forced a conversation across many segments of our society, including the environmental health sciences (EHS) research community. We have seen the proliferation of statements of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and commitments to fight racism and health inequities from academia, nonprofit organizations, governmental agencies, and private corporations. Actions must now arise from these promises. As public health and EHS scientists, we must examine the systems that produce and perpetuate inequities in exposure to environmental pollutants and associated health effects. OBJECTIVES: We outline five recommendations the EHS research community can implement to confront racism and move our science forward for eliminating racial inequities in environmental health. DISCUSSION: Race is best considered a political label that promotes inequality. Thus, we should be wary of equating race with biology. Further, EHS researchers should seriously consider racism as a plausible explanation of racial disparities in health and consider structural racism as a factor in environmental health risk/impact assessments, as well as multiple explanations for racial differences in environmental exposures and health outcomes. Last, the EHS research community should develop metrics to measure racism and a set of guidelines on the use and interpretation of race and ethnicity within the environmental sciences. Numerous guidelines exist in other disciplines that can serve as models. By taking action on each of these recommendations, we can make significant progress toward eliminating racial disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8186.","Payne-Sturges, Devon C; Gee, Gilbert C; Cory-Slechta, Deborah A",Environ Health Perspect,,180
255584,Progress in mental health research and service provision in China: Lessons learnt from COVID-19 and SARS epidemics,2021,"More than one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several working vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies1,2. Here we report on a cohort of 63 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines3,4. In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable between 6 and 12 months after infection. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response and, as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern similar to or greater than the neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 strain achieved by vaccination of naive individuals2,5-8. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in the variants of concern4,9. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand markedly after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Wang, Zijun; Muecksch, Frauke; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Finkin, Shlomo; Viant, Charlotte; Gaebler, Christian; Hoffmann, Hans- Heinrich; Barnes, Christopher O; Cipolla, Melissa; Ramos, Victor; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Cho, Alice; Schmidt, Fabian; Da Silva, Justin; Bednarski, Eva; Aguado, Lauren; Yee, Jim; Daga, Mridushi; Turroja, Martina; Millard, Katrina G; Jankovic, Mila; Gazumyan, Anna; Zhao, Zhen; Rice, Charles M; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature,,180

259530,A snapshot of public knowledge of novel coronavirus disease 2019: a web-based national survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although more than a year past since COVID-19 was defined, there is no specific treatment yet. Since COVID-19 management differs over time, it is hard to determine which therapy is more efficacious. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the regimen with Favipiravir (FPV) and determine if the timing of FPV addition offers any improvement. METHODS: A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, we found that early initiation of FPV treatment did not have a positive effect on the estimated survival time. CONCLUSIONS: According to this retrospective study results, we believe that for better clinical outcomes, FPV treatment should be started promptly to enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes.","Ucan, Anil; Cerci, Pamir; Efe, Serdar; Akgun, Hakan; Ozmen, Ahmet; Yagmuroglu, Aysel; Bilgin, Muzaffer; Avci, Deniz",Virol J,,180
259531,A snapshot of public knowledge of novel coronavirus disease 2019: a web-based national survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. METHODS: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1-7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0·15, 95% CI -0·19 to -0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's &#961;=0·48, 95% CI 0·074-0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. INTERPRETATION: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if self-reported symptoms could help monitor the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: Users were asked questions about underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, zip code, and COVID-19 symptoms. Depending on the symptoms reported and the presence of coexisting disorders, users were told to either stay at home, contact a general practitioner (GP), or call an emergency phone number. Data regarding COVID-19-related hospitalizations were retrieved from the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2020, the application was opened 4,126,789 times; 3,799,535 electronic questionnaires were filled out; and 2,477,174 users had at least one symptom. In total, 34.8% (n=1,322,361) reported no symptoms. The remaining users were directed to self-monitoring (n=858,878, 22.6%), GP visit or teleconsultation (n=1,033,922, 27.2%), or an emergency phone call (n=584,374, 15.4%). Emergency warning signs were reported by 39.1% of participants with anosmia, a loss of the sense of smell (n=127,586) versus 22.7% of participants without anosmia (n=1,597,289). Anosmia and fever and/or cough were correlated with hospitalizations for COVID-19 (Spearman correlation coefficients=0.87 and 0.82, respectively; P<.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that anosmia may be strongly associated with COVID-19 and its severity. Despite a lack of medical assessment and virological confirmation, self-checking application data could be a relevant tool to monitor outbreak trends.

279636,Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution: Moving to a Race Conscious Approach for a Racially Disparate Problem,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of definitive anti-viral therapy, there is considerable interest in mitigating against severe inflammatory reactions in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to improve survival. These reactions are sometimes termed cytokine storm. PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4i) have anti-inflammatory properties with approved indications in inflammatory skin and joint diseases as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4i in respiratory models of viral and bacterial infection and also after chemically mediated lung injury. The rationale for PDE4i use in COVID-19 patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile. We highlight how PDE4i could be an overlooked treatment from the rheumatologic and respiratory armamentarium, which has potential beneficial immune-modulation for treating severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storms. The proposed use of PDE4i is also supported by age-related immune changes in inflammation severity in PDE4i modifiable pathways in primate coronavirus disease. In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with COVID-19 may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with PDE4i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.","Bridgewood, Charlie; Damiani, Giovanni; Sharif, Kassem; Watad, Abdulla; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Quartuccio, Luca; Savic, Sinisa; McGonagle, Dennis",Isr Med Assoc J,,180
279998,Correction: Building Health Services in a Rapidly Changing Landscape: Lessons in Adaptive Leadership and Pivots in a COVID-19 Remote Monitoring Program,2021,"Background: This study monitored total anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies levels in a large population of healthcare workers undergoing mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Methods. The study population consisted of employees of Pederzoli Hospital of Peschiera del Garda (Verona, Italy), who underwent voluntary vaccination with two doses of COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 (Comirnaty;Pfizer Inc). Venous blood was drawn immediately before the first vaccine dose, as well as 21 days (immediately before second vaccine dose) and 50 days afterwards. Humoral response was assessed with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S total antibodies, on Roche Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics). Results: The final study population consisted of 925 subjects (mean age, 44 ± 13 years;457 women), 206 (22.3%) anti-SARS-CoV-2 baseline seropositive. The increase of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies levels 21 days after the first vaccine dose was ~3 orders of magnitude higher in seropositive than in seronegative individuals (11782 vs. 42 U/mL;p &lt;0.001). Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies levels further increased by over 30-fold after the second vaccine dose in baseline seronegative subjects, while such increase was only ~1.3-fold in baseline seropositive subjects. In multivariate analysis, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies level was inversely associated with age after both vaccine doses and male sex after the second vaccine dose in baseline seronegative subjects, while baseline antibodies value significantly predicted immune response after both vaccine doses in baseline seropositive recipients. Conclusion: Significant difference exists in post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine immune response in baseline seronegative and seropositive subjects, which seems dependent on age and sex in seronegative subjects, as well as on baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies level in seropositive patients.","Salvagno, Gian Luca Henry Brandon M.; di Piazza, Giovanni Pighi Laura De Nitto Simone Bragantini Damiano Gianfilippi Gian Luca Lippi Giuseppe",Diagnostics,,180

To cope with the escalating insults to human life and health, governments have been establishing environmental laws since the 1970s. It posits a vital question at this juncture: What should be the functions that environmental law should serve, both today and into the foreseeable future? This article will suggest four thematic areas for action in this regard. First, all laws and policies should embrace a holistic view of Earth;second, a common and shared analytic methodology needs to be deployed such as environmental impact assessment;third, a strategic cock-pit for ecological cooperation required to provide solutions for environmental crises;finally, a set of mutually recognized and shared principles will need to be embraced in order to provide a coherent and harmonized outlook for humanity's ecological civilization.","Robinson, Nicholas A.",Environmental Policy and Law,,180

Using data from Italy and other countries we evaluated the role of different determinants of this phenomenon. We found that the Italian testing strategy could explain an important part of the observed difference in CFR. In particular, the majority of patients that are currently tested in Italy have severe clinical symptoms that usually require hospitalization and this translates to a large CFR.

Here we describe the integration of genomic surveillance into epidemiologic response within Humboldt County, a rural county in northwest California. Through a collaborative effort, 853 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated, representing [~]58% of the 1,449 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases detected in Humboldt County as of mid-March 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of these data was used to develop a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 introductions to the county and to support contact tracing and epidemiologic investigations of all large outbreaks in the county. In the case of an outbreak on a commercial farm, viral genomic data were used to validate reported epidemiologic links and link additional cases within the community who did not report a farm exposure to the outbreak. During a separate outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, genomic surveillance data were used to rule out the putative index case, detect the emergence of an independent Spike:N501Y substitution, and verify that the outbreak had been brought under control. These use cases demonstrate how developing genomic surveillance capacity within local public health departments can support timely and responsive deployment of genomic epidemiology for surveillance and outbreak response based on local needs and priorities.","Stoddard, Gunnar; Black, Allison; Ayscue, Patrick; Lu, Dan; Kamm, Jack; Bhatt, Karan; Chan, Lienna; Kistler, Amy L; Batson, Joshua; Detweiler, Angela; Tan, Michelle; Neff, Norma; DeRisi, Joseph L; Corrigan, Jeremy",,,180

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

Many hospital systems implemented testing of all presurgical patients, using results from tests performed 3 or more days prior to surgery. Among asymptomatic persons, the percent positive rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tests in the region did not appear to justify this practice. Instead of universal preoperative COVID-19 testing, the authors elected to mitigate risk by implementing a preoperative program including 14 days of recommended patient self-quarantine and social distancing. For those unable to complete this program and for those undergoing high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures, targeted rapid polymerase chain reaction testing within 2 days of surgery was performed. Data from the initial 4 months suggests that this approach was noninferior to universal preoperative testing with regard to postoperative COVID-19 detection and patient exposure-related COVID-19 cases among hospital staff.","Ray, Hollis M; Kamitsuka, Paul F; Firetti, Pamela W; Almeter, Andrew L; McNabb, Kevin M; von Biberstein, S Elizabeth; Barton, Andrew C H; Shakar, Robert; Paul, J West",Am. j. med. qual,,180

It is a small hydrophobic protein displaying ion channel activity that has proven highly relevant in virus-host interaction and virulence. Ion transport through E channel was shown to alter Ca2+ homeostasis in the cell and trigger inflammation processes. Here, we study transport properties of the E viroporin in mixed solutions of potassium and calcium chloride that contain a fixed total concentration (mole fraction experiments). The channel is reconstituted in planar membranes of different lipid compositions, including a lipid mixture that mimics the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane where the virus localizes within the cell. We find that the E ion conductance changes non-monotonically with the total ionic concentration displaying an Anomalous Mole Fraction Effect (AMFE) only when charged lipids are present in the membrane. We also observe that E channel insertion in ERGIC-mimic membranes - including lipid with intrinsic negative curvature - enhances ion permeation at physiological concentrations of pure CaCl2 or KCl solutions, with a preferential transport of Ca2+ in mixed KCl-CaCl2 solutions. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the presence of calcium modulates the transport properties of the E channel by interacting preferentially with charged lipids through different mechanisms including direct Coulombic interactions and possibly inducing changes in membrane morphology.","Verdiá-Báguena, Carmina; Aguilella, Vicente M; Queralt-Martín, María; Alcaraz, Antonio",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,,180

The World Health Organization has taken steps toward establishing a global surveillance system for RSV, based on the global influenza surveillance and response system initiated in 2015. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a genetic detection method based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is used in global RSV surveillance. In Japan, immunoassay-based rapid antigen detection kits are widely used for the detection of RSV. In this study, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method for the rapid detection of RSV was developed using the PCR1100 device based on the US CDC assay in order to detect RSV in comparable time to rapid test kits. The ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR could detect RSV viral RNA in less than 20 min while maintaining sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional real-time RT-PCR using large installed instruments. Furthermore, combining ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR with the M1 Sample Prep kit reduced the total working time for the detection of RSV from clinical specimen to less than 25 min, suggesting this method could be used for point-of-care RSV testing.","Shirato, Kazuya; Nao, Naganori; Kawase, Miyuki; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Jpn J Infect Dis,,180

Whereas Saint Sebastian is associated with plagues only symbolically, Catholic tradition considers Saint Roch to have had real contact with the bubonic plague. Indeed, during his pilgrimage to Rome, Saint Roch helped people suffering from the plague and was, subsequently, himself infected.

A group of international experts, with research and experience in MR-proADM applications, produced this review based on their own experience and the currently available literature. AREAS COVERED: The review provides evidence related to MR-proADM as a triaging tool in avoiding unnecessary admissions to hospital and/or inadequate discharge, and identifying patients most at risk of deterioration. It also covers the use of MR-proADM in the context of COVID-19. Moreover, the authors provide a proposal on how to incorporate MR-proADM into patients' clinical pathways in an ED setting. EXPERT OPINION: The data we have so far on the application of MR-proADM in the ED is promising. Incorporating it into clinical scoring systems may aid the clinician's decision making and recognizing the 'ill looking well' and the 'well looking ill' sooner. However there are still many gaps in our knowledge especially during the ongoing COVID-19 waves.

METHODS: Daily number of symptomatic HCW tested, SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates, and HCW job-descriptions were collected pre and post Universal HCW facemask policy(March 26). Multiple change point regression was used to model positive-test-rate data. SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity rates were compared for pre-intervention, transition, post-intervention, and follow-up periods. RESULTS: Between March 12-August 10, 2020, 19.2% of HCW were symptomatic for COVID-19 and underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. A single change point was identified â¼March 28-30(95% probability). Before the change point, the odds of a tested HCW having a positive result doubled every 4.5-7.5âdays. Post-change-point, the odds of a tested HCW having a positive result halved every 10.5-13.5âdays.

327782,Social media concerns during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An analysis of Sina Weibo Microblogging data,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Axillary sentinel node biopsy for melanoma is routinely performed under general anaesthesia. Emerging evidence has shown general anaesthetics are associated with increased mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interest of patient safety, we have designed a series of bespoke axillary regional blocks enabling surgeons to remove nodes up to and including level III without the need for a general anaesthetic. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of performing axillary sentinel node biopsy under such blocks. METHODS: Approval was granted by the Joint Study Review Committee on behalf of the Research and Ethics Department. Ten consecutive patients having axillary sentinel node biopsy for melanoma were included in this prospective study. Patients completed a Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR15) questionnaire preoperatively and 24 h postoperatively. DISCUSSION: One patient had a positive sentinel node, the remining were negative. A significant reduction in time spent in hospital post-operatively (p = 0.0008) was observed. QoR15 patient reported outcome measures demonstrated high levels of satisfaction evidenced by lack of statistical difference between pre and post-operative scores (p = 0.0118). 80% of patients were happy to have a regional block and 90% were happy to attend hospital during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: ASNB under regional block is safe, negates risks associated with performing GAs during the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitates quicker theatre turnover and discharge from hospital. Collaboration between anaesthetic and surgical teams has enabled this change in practice. There is a learning curve with both patient selection, education and development of technique.","Clancy, R; Hemington-Gorse, S; Pope-Jones, S; Jayakumar, A; Beynon, C; Egeler, C; Cubitt, J",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,180
328834,An Online Platform to Provide Work and Study Support for Young People With Mental Health Challenges: Observational and Survey Study,2021,"Background: After several waves of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are struggling to regain their economies by slowly lifting mobility restrictions and social distance measures applied during the crisis. Meanwhile, recent studies provide compelling evidence on how contact distancing, the use of face masks, and handwashing habits can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion. Methods: We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results. Results: We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds. We also found that in all scenarios, the combined effect of adhering to the three habits is more powerful than adopting them separately. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a broad adherence of the population to voluntary self-care habits would help contain unfold of new outbreaks. The purpose of our model is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of urging citizens to adopt the amalgam of personal care habits as a primary collective protection measure to prevent communities from returning to confinements, while immunisation is carried out in late stages of the pandemic.","Álvarez-Pomar, Lindsay; Rojas-Galeano, Sergio",ScientificWorldJournal,,180

329293,"Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Covid-19 Pandemic, Qalyoubia Governorate: Cross-Sectional Survey",2021,"It is currently not known if repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fundamentally different from those that have not been seen to repeat. One striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width. Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks, where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale, volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology. It also provides a way of predicting which sources could be seen to repeat in the future.","Connor, L.; Miller, M. C.; Gardenier, D. W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11930v2.pdf,180

OBJECTIVE: To identify UTI risk factors in adult patients with urinary catheter. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Control case study carried out between the years 2010-2016 at the Military Hospital of Santiago, Chile. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed using the binary logistic regression model, variables such as age, duration and indication of the device, some comorbidities and the installation of the device after 15 days of hospitalization. RESULT: A total of 63 cases and 123 controls were obtained. Predictive variables of CAUTI for the duration of the urinary catheter from the 7th day onwards (OR 2.6 IC 1.4-4.9, p = 0.004) and the installation of the urinary catheter with a previous hospital stay of 15 days and more (OR 7.8 CI 2.9-20.9 p = 0.000). No association was found in age over 80 years, comorbidities such as diabetes and neurogenic bladder and indication.

332774,Expectations of citizens from the government in response to COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Iran,2021,"Little is known about the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates, especially when the virus is contracted early in pregnancy. The literature is especially lacking on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestation) infants who have underdeveloped immune systems. We report the case of an extremely preterm, 25-week 5-days old infant, born to a mother with severe COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pneumonia. In this case, there is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, despite extreme prematurity. However, it appears that severe maternal COVID-19 may have been associated with extremely preterm delivery, based on observed histologic chorioamnionitis. This is the first reported case of an extremely preterm infant born to a mother with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who required intubation, and was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, inhaled nitric oxide, and prone positioning for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure prior to and after delivery of this infant. The infant remains critically ill with severe respiratory failure on high-frequency ventilation, inotropic support, hydrocortisone for pressor-resistant hypotension, and inhaled nitric oxide for severe persistent pulmonary hypertension with a right to left shunt across the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant should take all precautions to minimize exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to decrease adverse perinatal outcomes.","Easterlin, Molly C; De Beritto, Theodore; Yeh, Amy M; Wertheimer, Fiona B; Ramanathan, Rangasamy",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,180

Both vaccination doses, which are subject to a non-necessarily identical effectiveness, are administrated by respecting a certain mutual delay interval, and their immunity effect is registered after a certain delay since the second dose. The delays and the efficacies of the doses are parameters, which can be fixed in the model for each concrete experimentation. The disease-free equilibrium point is characterized as well as its stability properties, while it is seen that no endemic equilibrium point exists. The exposed subpopulation is supposed to be infective eventually, under a distinct transmission rate of that of the infectious subpopulation. Some simulation examples are presented by using disease parameterizations of the COVID-19 pandemic under vaccination efforts requiring two doses.","De la Sen, M.; Alonso-Quesada, S.; Ibeas, A.; Nistal, R.",Vaccines (Basel),,180

338639,Anxiety and Sleep Disturbances Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Cross-Sectional Online Survey,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a neurologic disease that carries a high disease burden and likely, a huge treatment gap especially in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC) such as the Philippines. This review aimed to examine the treatment gaps and challenges that burden Philippine epilepsy care. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pertinent data on epidemiology, research, health financing and health systems, pharmacologic and surgical treatment options, cost of care, and workforce were obtained through a literature search and review of relevant Philippine government websites. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in the Philippines is 0.9%. Epilepsy research in the Philippines is low in quantity compared with the rest of Southeast Asia (SEA). Inequities in quality and quantity of healthcare services delivered to local government units (LGUs) have arisen because of devolution. Programs for epilepsy care by both government and nongovernment institutions have been implemented. Healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is still largely out-of-pocket, with only partial coverage from the public sector. There is limited access to antiseizure medications (ASMs), mainly due to cost. Epilepsy surgery is an underutilized treatment option. There are only 20 epileptologists in the Philippines, with one epileptologist for every 45,000 patients with epilepsy. In addition, epilepsy care service delivery has been further impeded by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a large treatment gap in epilepsy care in the Philippines in terms of high epilepsy disease burden, socioeconomic limitations and inadequate public support, sparse clinico-epidemiologic research on epilepsy, inaccessibility of health care services and essential pharmacotherapy, underutilization of surgical options, and lack of specialists capable of rendering epilepsy care. Acknowledgment of the existence of these treatment gaps and addressing such are expected to improve the overall survival and quality of life of patients with epilepsy in the Philippines.","Moalong, Kevin Michael C; Espiritu, Adrian I; Fernandez, Marc Laurence L; Jamora, Roland Dominic G",Epilepsy Behav,,180

The aim of this study was to assess the spread of dental aerosols on patients and dental providers during aerosol-generating dental procedures. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted with one volunteer. A dental unit used at the dental school for general dental care was the site of the experiment. Before the study, three measurement meters (DustTrak 8534, PTrak 8525 and AeroTrak 9306) were used to measure the ambient distribution of particles in the ambient air surrounding the dental chair. The volunteer wore a bouffant, goggles, and shoe covers and was seated in the dental chair in supine position, and covered with a surgical drape. The dentist and dental assistant donned bouffant, goggles, face shields, N95 masks, surgical gowns and shoe covers. The simulation was conducted by using a high-speed handpiece with a diamond bur operating in the oral cavity for 6 min without touching the teeth. A new set of measurement was obtained while using an ultrasonic scaler to clean all teeth of the volunteer. For both aerosol generating procedures, the aerosol particles were measured with the use of saliva ejector (SE) and high-speed suction (HSS) followed a separate set of measurement with the additional use of an extra oral high-volume suction (HVS) unit that was placed close to the mouth to capture the aerosol in addition to SE and HSS. The distribution of the air particles, including the size and concentration of aerosols, was measured around the patient, dentist, dental assistant, 3 feet above the patient, and the floor. RESULTS: Four locations were identified with elevated aerosol levels compared to the baseline, including the chest of the dentist, the chest of patient, the chest of assistant and 3 feet above the patient. The use of additional extra oral high volume suction reduced aerosol to or below the baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of the level of aerosol with size less than 10 µm was minimal during dental procedures when using SE and HSS. Use of HVS further reduced aerosol levels below the ambient levels.","Yang, Maobin; Chaghtai, Asad; Melendez, Marc; Hasson, Hana; Whitaker, Eugene; Badi, Mustafa; Sperrazza, Leona; Godel, Jeffrey; Yesilsoy, Cemil; Tellez, Marisol; Orrego, Santiago; Montoya, Carolina; Ismail, Amid",BMC Oral Health,,180

348062,"Nurses' Attitudes and Perceptions towards Hand Hygiene in Mental Health and Medical Inpatient Settings: Comparative, Cross-Sectional Study",2020,"We study cosmological observables on the past light cone of a fixed observer in the context of clustering dark energy. We focus on observables that probe the gravitational field directly, namely the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect (ISW-RS), weak gravitational lensing, gravitational redshift and Shapiro time delay. With our purpose-built $N$-body code""$k$-evolution""that tracks the coupled evolution of dark matter particles and the dark energy field, we are able to study the regime of low speed of sound $c_s$ where dark energy perturbations can become quite large. Using ray tracing we produce two-dimensional sky maps for each effect and we compute their angular power spectra. It turns out that the ISW-RS signal is the most promising probe to constrain clustering dark energy properties coded in $w-c_s^2$, as the $\textit{linear}$ clustering of dark energy would change the angular power spectrum by $\sim 30\%$ at low $\ell$ when comparing two different speeds of sound for dark energy. Weak gravitational lensing, Shapiro time-delay and gravitational redshift are less sensitive probes of clustering dark energy, showing variations of a few percent only. The effect of dark energy $\textit{non-linearities}$ in all the power spectra is negligible at low $\ell$, but reaches about $2\%$ and $3\%$, respectively, in the convergence and ISW-RS angular power spectra at multipoles of a few hundred when observed at redshift $\sim 0.85$. Future cosmological surveys achieving percent precision measurements will allow to probe the clustering of dark energy to a high degree of confidence. Clear evidence for clustering dark energy at any scale would rule out a cosmological constant as the leading contender for dark energy, and may help to distinguish between different dark energy models.","Hassani, Farbod; Adamek, Julian; Kunz, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04968v1.pdf,180
348237,Could technology enable individuals with schizophrenia to access health care? The case of Ecuador,2021,"Along with the increasing popularity of agile software development, software work has become much more social than ever. Contemporary software teams rely on a variety of collaborative practices, such as pair programming, the topic of our study. Many agilists advocated the importance of collocation, face-to-face interaction, and physical artefacts incorporated in the shared workspace, which the COVID-19 pandemic made unavailable; most software companies around the world were forced to send their engineers to work from home. As software projects and teams overnight turned into dis-tributed collaborations, we question what happened to the pair programming practice in the work-from-home mode. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of remote pair programming in two companies. We conducted 38 interviews with 30 engineers from Norway, Sweden, and the USA, and used the results of a survey in one of the case companies. Our study is unique as we collected the data longitudinally in April/May 2020, Sep/Oct 2020, and Jan/Feb 2021. We found that pair programming has decreased and some interviewees report not pairing at all for almost a full year. The experiences of those who paired vary from actively co-editing the code by using special tools to more passively co-reading and discussing the code and solutions by sharing the screen. Finally, we found that the interest in and the use of PP over time, since the first months of forced work from home to early 2021, has admittedly increased, also as a social practice.","Smite, Darja; Mikalsen, Marius; Moe, Nils B.; Stray, Viktoria; Klotins, Eriks",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05454v1.pdf,180

The purpose of this study is to estimate the frequency of vaccine refusal against COVID-19 vaccines and to identify the underlying factors for refusal or hesitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a district of Istanbul from 25 to 30 December 2020. A sample of people from the ages of 20 to 85 in the district was selected, and a total of 384 people were enrolled. A questionnaire about the COVID-19 vaccine was administered to the participants by phone. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their thoughts about possible COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 45.3% of the participants were hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which was declared appropriate by the Ministry of Health. The rate of those who think that the COVID-19 vaccine will be effective in preventing and controlling the disease was 51.6%. 89.6% of the participants were hesitant about getting their children vaccinated. Those who do not consider COVID-19 disease as a risk to their health were 22.9%, and 32.8% thought that they would be protected from the disease by natural and traditional ways. The median score of the participants' risk perception was 7 (IQR: 6-8; Mean: 6.8; SD: 1.7). The median value of risk perception score of those who accept the vaccine was 6 (IQR: 4-6), while the median value for those who did not accept the vaccine was 4 (IQR: 4-6) (P < .01). Factors affecting vaccine acceptance were determined as the perception of risk (OR: 1.26% 95CI 1.03-1.55) and age (OR: 0.94% 95CI: 0.91-0.98) in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Half of the participants were hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccines.

While the emergence of effective vaccines has offered the Governments, scientific communities, and members of the public a possible way out of the pandemic, effective pharmacotherapy, including immunotherapy for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, are yet to be established. Internationally, this has led to a surge in the demand and supply of many complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and practices. Recent studies have shown increasing CAM information requests made to pharmacists and other healthcare staff from members of public and patients aimed at prevention, symptoms relief or treatment of COVID-19. In this context, it is imperative that healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, are acquainted with current practices, policies, and research in relation to CAM use in COVID-19. This narrative commentary will provide an update on global practices, policies and research in regards to CAM use in the context of COVID-19. Healthcare professionals' understanding of popular CAMs and those tipped for potential benefits in COVID-19, patient and consumer behaviors in relation to CAM use; and healthcare professionals' awareness of cultural, religious, and self-care practices associated with CAM use are imperative to inform effective communication and counselling practices and promote evidence based self-care when patients present for advice. This narrative provides relevant discussions specific to different continents and regions historically linked to diverse CAM practices.","Paudyal, Vibhu; Sun, Shusen; Hussain, Rabia; Abutaleb, Mohammed H; Hedima, Erick Wesley",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,180

We sought to describe clinician experiences providing telemedicine to publiclyinsured, lowincome patients during COVID-19. Methods. Online survey of ambulatory clinicians in an urban safetynet hospital system, conducted May 28, 2020–July 14, 2020. Results. Among 311 participants (response rate 48.3%), 34.7% (n=108/311) practiced in primary/urgent care, 37.0% (n=115/311) medical specialty, and 7.7% (n=24/311) surgical clinics. A large majority (87.8%, 273/311) had conducted telephone visits, 26.0% (81/311) video. Participants reported observing both technical and nontechnical patient barriers. Clinicians reported concerns about the diagnostic safety of telephone (58.9%, 129/219) vs. video (35.3%, 24/68). However, clinician comfort with telemedicine was high for telephone (89.3%, 216/242) and for video (91.0%, 61/67), with many clinicians (92.1%, 220/239 telephone;90.9%, 60/66 video) planning to continue telemedicine after COVID-19. Conclusions. Clinicians in a safetynet health care system report great comfort with and intention to continue telemedicine after the pandemic, despite safety concerns and patient challenges.","Sharma, Anjana E.; Khoong, Elaine C.; Nijagal, Malini A.; Lyles, Courtney R.; Su, George DeFries Triveni Sarkar Urmimala Tuot Delphine",Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved,,180
361881,COVID-19 and child and adolescent psychiatry: an unexpected blessing for part of our population?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several models have been developed to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but only a few have demonstrated enough discriminatory capacity. Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based score-the Piacenza score-for 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients' medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the naïve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes. A user-friendly website was designed and developed to enable fast and easy use of the tool by physicians. Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the naïve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a naïve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the naïve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a customizable machine learning-based score with a purely data-driven selection of features is feasible and effective for the prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Halasz, Geza; Sperti, Michela; Villani, Matteo; Michelucci, Umberto; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Biagi, Andrea; Rossi, Luca; Botti, Andrea; Mari, Chiara; Maccarini, Marco; Pura, Filippo; Roveda, Loris; Nardecchia, Alessia; Mottola, Emanuele; Nolli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; Mapelli, Massimo; Deriu, Marco Agostino; Piga, Dario; Piepoli, Massimo",J Med Internet Res,,180

In the rush to possible therapeutic options, probiotics administration has been proposed mainly based on indirect observation. Some evidence of COVID-19 effects on intestinal microbiota dysbiosis has been shown and probiotics have been considered for their efficacy in the management of respiratory tract viral infections. These observations could be reinforced by the more and more evident existence of a lung-gut axis, suggesting the modulation of gut microbiota among the approaches to the COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As different possible roles of probiotics in this extremely severe illness have been contemplated, the aim of this work is to collect all the currently available information related to this topic, providing a starting point for future studies focussing on it.","Bottari, Benedetta; Castellone, Vincenzo; Neviani, Erasmo",Int J Food Sci Nutr,,180

In this article, we document the humiliation of Dr Li Wenliang (1986-2020), the most prominent whistle-blower in the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic. Engaging with the thought of Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit, who argues that humiliation constitutes an injury to a person's self-respect, we discuss his contention that a decent society is one that abolishes conditions which constitute a justification for its dependents to consider themselves humiliated.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 11-year old male patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection was hospitalized at the Pediatric Clinic Clinic of the IRCCS Foundation and Hospital San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. Three days after hospital admission, because of the patient complaining very mild ocular symptoms, an ophthalmological evaluation was performed. No signs related to conjunctivitis or keratitis were found but a conjunctival swab was collected as well, based on patient's medical history. The specific SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed, unearthing the presence of viral RNA from the swab. On day 25 from hospitalization, the conjunctival swab was repeated, giving negative result. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular specimen in a pediatric patient without signs of ocular involvement. However, despite the transmission through tears is theoretically possible, it is still unclear whether this could be considered as an important route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Quaranta, Luciano; Rovida, Francesca; Riva, Ivano; Bruttini, Carlo; Brambilla, Ilaria; Baldanti, Fausto; De Angelis, Giovanni; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",Eur J Ophthalmol,,180
366888,Mental Health of Physicians During COVID-19 Outbreak in Bangladesh: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) in elderly patients is associated with unfavorable prognosis, and it is becoming an increasingly prevalent condition. The prognosis of elderly patients is equally impaired in ST-segment elevation (STE) or non-STE (NSTE), and it is markedly worsened by the common presence of multivessel disease (MVD). Given the limited evidence available for elderly patients, it has not yet been established whether, as for younger patients, a complete revascularization strategy in MI patients with MVD should be advocated. We present the design of a dedicated study that will address this research gap. METHODS AND DESIGN: The FIRE trial is a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter, open-label study with blinded adjudicated evaluation of outcomes. Patients aged 75years and older, with MI (either STE or NSTE), MVD at coronary artery angiography and a clear culprit lesion will be randomized to culprit-only treatment or to physiology-guided complete revascularization. The primary endpoint will be the patient-oriented composite endpoint (POCE) of all cause death, any MI, any stroke, any revascularization at one year. The key secondary endpoint will be the composite of cardiovascular death and MI. Quality of life and physical performance will be evaluated as well. All components of the primary and key secondary outcome will be tested also at 3 and 5years. The sample size for the study is 1400 patients. IMPLICATIONS: The FIRE trial will provide evidence on whether a specific revascularization strategy should be applied to elderly patients presenting MI and MVD in order to improve their clinical outcomes.","Biscaglia, Simone; Guiducci, Vincenzo; Santarelli, Andrea; Santos, Ignacio Amat; Fernandez-Aviles, Francisco; Lanzilotti, Valerio; Varbella, Ferdinando; Fileti, Luca; Moreno, Raul; Giannini, Francesco; Colaiori, Iginio; Menozzi, Mila; Redondo, Alfredo; Ruozzi, Marco; Ibañes, Enrique Gutiérrez; Gil, José Luis Díez; Maietti, Elisa; Zoccai, Giuseppe Biondi; Escaned, Javier; Tebaldi, Matteo; Barbato, Emanuele; Dudek, Dariusz; Colombo, Antonio; Campo, Gianluca",Am. heart j,,180

Ann Neurol. 2020. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.25814 In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who received EEGs to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had EEGs that showed periodic discharges (PD) consisting of high amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest CNS injury potentially related to COVID-19 in these patients.

Epilepsia Open. 2020;5(2):314-324. https://doi.org/10.1002/epi4.12399 Objective: Acute encephalopathy may occur in COVID-19-infected patients. We investigated whether medically indicated EEGs performed in acutely ill patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 report epileptiform abnormalities and whether these are more prevalent in COVID-19 positive than negative patients. Methods: In this retrospective case series, adult COVID-19 inpatient PUIs underwent EEGs for acute encephalopathy and/or seizure-like events. PUIs had 8-channel headband EEGs (Ceribell; 20 COVID-19 positive, 6 COVID-19 negative); 2 more COVID-19 patients had routine EEGs. Overall, 26 Ceribell EEGs, 4 routine, and 7 continuous EEG studies were reviewed. EEGs were interpreted by board-certified clinical neurophysiologists (n = 16). EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, clinical presentation and history, and medication usage. Fisher exact test was used. Results: We included 28 COVID-19 PUIs (30-83 years old), of whom 22 tested positive (63.6% males) and 6 tested negative (33.3% male). The most common indications for EEG, among COVID-19-positive versus COVID-19-negative patients, respectively, were new onset encephalopathy (68.2% vs 33.3%) and seizure-like events (14/22, 63.6%; 2/6, 33.3%), even among patients without prior history of seizures (11/17, 64.7%; 2/6, 33.3%). Sporadic epileptiform discharges (EDs) were present in 40.9% of COVID-19-positive and 16.7% of COVID-19-negative patients; frontal sharp waves were reported in 8/9 (88.9%) of COVID-19-positive patients with EDs and in 1/1 of COVID-19-negative patient with EDs. No electrographic seizures were captured, but 19/22 COVID-19-positive and 6/6 COVID-19-negative patients were given anti-seizure medications and/or sedatives before the EEG. Significance_ This is the first preliminary report of EDs in the EEG of acutely ill COVID-19-positive patients with encephalopathy or suspected clinical seizures. EDs are relatively common in this cohort and typically appear as frontal sharp waves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the potential direct or indirect effects of COVID-19 on activating epileptic activity. : Electroencephalogram (EEG) in COVID-19: A systematic Retrospective Study Petrescu AM, Taussig D, Bouilleret V. Neurophysiol Clin. 2020;50(3):155-165. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7315937/ Objectives: Although rare, neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasingly being reported. We conducted a retrospective systematic study to describe the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics in this disease, looking for specific patterns. Methods: EEGs performed in patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between March 25, 2020 and May 06, 2020 in the University Hospital of Bicetre were independently reviewed by 2 experienced neurologists. We used the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society’s terminology for the description of abnormal patterns. EEGs were classified into 5 categories, from normal to critically altered. Interobserver reliability was calculated using Cohen kappa coefficient. Medical records were reviewed to extract demographics, clinical, imaging, and biological data. Results: Forty EEGs were reviewed in 36 COVID-19 patients, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) and 22 in medicine units. The main indications were confusion or fluctuating alertness for 23 (57.5%) and delayed awakening after stopping sedation in ICU in 6 (15%). EEGs were normal to mildly altered in 23 (57.5%) contrary to the 42.5% where EEG alterations were moderate in 4 (10%), severe in 8 (20%), and critical in 5 (12.5%). Generalized periodic discharges (GPDs), multifocal periodic discharges (MPDs), or rhythmic delta activity (RDA) were found in 13 recordings (32.5%). EEG alterations were not stereotyped or specific. They could be related to an underlying morbid status, except for 3 ICU patients with unexplained encephalopathic features. Conclusion: In this first systematic analysis of COVID-19 patients who underwent EEG, over half of them presented a normal recording pattern. EEG alterations were not different from those encountered in other pathological conditions.","Lee, Jong Woo",Epilepsy Curr.,,180

373530,Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Workers in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2020,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a huge impact on health and economic issues. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes cellular damage by entry mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of the host cells and its conjugation with spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond airway infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury is common in SARS-CoV-2-associated infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is predictive to multiorgan dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond the cytokine storm and hemodynamic instability, SARS-CoV-2 might directly induce kidney injury and cause histopathologic characteristics, including acute tubular necrosis, podocytopathy and microangiopathy. The expression of apparatus mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), within the renal tubular cells is highly associated with acute kidney injury mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Both entry from the luminal and basolateral sides of the renal tubular cells are the possible routes for COVID-19, and the microthrombi associated with severe sepsis and the dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system worsen further renal injury in SARS-CoV-2-associated AKI. In the podocytes of the glomerulus, injured podocyte expressed CD147, which mediated the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and worsen further foot process effacement, which would worsen proteinuria, and the chronic hazard induced by SARS-CoV-2-mediated kidney injury is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the review is to summarize current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-associated AKI and the possible pathogenesis directly by SARS-CoV-2.","Chueh, Ti-I; Zheng, Cai-Mei; Hou, Yi-Chou; Lu, Kuo-Cheng",,,180

Solicitation of host immune defenses by vaccination is the treatment of choice to prevent these infections. It has long been thought that vaccine immunity was solely mediated by the adaptive immune system. However, over the past decade, numerous studies have shown that innate immune cells can also retain memory of these encounters. This process, called innate immune memory, is mediated by metabolic and epigenetic changes that make cells either hyperresponsive (trained immunity) or hyporesponsive (tolerance) to subsequent challenges. In this review, we discuss the concepts of trained immunity and tolerance in the context of host-pathogen interactions.","Peignier, Adeline; Parker, Dane",Cell Microbiol,,180
387757,Attachments: What It Was Like for Me: A Triple Board Resident's Experience on a COVID Unit,2021,"Various factors such as ambient lighting conditions, noise, motion blur, etc. affect the quality of captured face images. Poor quality face images often reduce the performance of face analysis and recognition systems. Hence, it is important to enhance the quality of face images collected in such conditions. We present a multi-task face restoration network, called Network Architecture Search for Face Enhancement (NASFE), which can enhance poor quality face images containing a single degradation (i.e. noise or blur) or multiple degradations (noise+blur+low-light). During training, NASFE uses clean face images of a person present in the degraded image to extract the identity information in terms of features for restoring the image. Furthermore, the network is guided by an identity-loss so that the identity in-formation is maintained in the restored image. Additionally, we propose a network architecture search-based fusion network in NASFE which fuses the task-specific features that are extracted using the task-specific encoders. We introduce FFT-op and deveiling operators in the fusion network to efficiently fuse the task-specific features. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art face restoration and enhancement methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.","Yasarla, Rajeev; Joze, Hamid Reza Vaezi; Patel, Vishal M",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06528v1.pdf,180
401627,The gingival sequination,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the spatial and temporal relationships between the prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms in the community-level and area-level social deprivation. DESIGN: Spatial mapping, generalised linear models, using time as a factor and spatial-lag models were used to explore the relationship between self-reported COVID-19 symptom prevalence as recorded through two smartphone symptom tracker apps and a range of socioeconomic factors using a repeated cross-sectional study design. SETTING: In the community in Northern Ireland, UK. The analysis period included the earliest stages of non-pharmaceutical interventions and societal restrictions or 'lockdown' in 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Users of two smartphone symptom tracker apps recording self-reported health information who recorded their location as Northern Ireland, UK. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Population standardised self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and correlation between population standardised self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and area-level characteristics from measures of multiple deprivation including employment levels and population housing density, derived as the mean number of residents per household for each census super output area. RESULTS: Higher self-reported prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms was associated with the most deprived areas (p<0.001) and with those areas with the lowest employment levels (p<0.001). Higher rates of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms within the age groups, 18-24 and 25-34 years were found within the most deprived areas during the earliest stages of non-pharmaceutical interventions and societal restrictions ('lockdown'). CONCLUSIONS: Through spatial regression of self-reporting COVID-19 smartphone data in the community, this research shows how a lens of social deprivation can deepen our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Our findings indicate that social inequality, as measured by area-level deprivation, is associated with disparities in potential COVID-19 infection, with higher prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms in urban areas associated with area-level social deprivation, housing density and age.","McKinley, Jennifer M; Cutting, David; Anderson, Neil; Graham, Conor; Johnston, Brian; Mueller, Ute; Atkinson, Peter M; Van Woerden, Hugo; Bradley, Declan T; Kee, Frank",BMJ Open,,180

Although the encephalopathy is idiopathic in many cases, there are several published reports of patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diverse presentations, risk factors, and outcomes of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We assessed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and a diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome at our institution from April 1 to June 24, 2020. We performed a literature search to capture all known published cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus 2019 at our institution during a 3-month period. One patient was treated with anakinra, an interleukin-1 inhibitor that may disrupt endothelial function. The second patient had an underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection. We found 13 total cases in our literature search, which reported modest blood pressure fluctuations and a range of risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. One patient was treated with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor that may have effects on endothelial function. All patients had an improvement in their neurological symptoms. Interval imaging, when available, showed radiographic improvement of brain lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 may include underlying infection or immunomodulatory agents with endothelial effects in conjunction with modest blood pressure fluctuations. We found that the neurological prognosis for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 infection is favorable. Recognition of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in this patient population is critical for prognostication and initiation of treatment, which may include cessation of potential offending agents and tight blood pressure control.","Anand, Pria; Lau, K H Vincent; Chung, David Y; Virmani, Deepti; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M; Mian, Asim Z; Takahashi, Courtney E",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,180

403211,The African American Petri Dish,2020,"Multiple pharmacological interventions tested over the last decades have failed to reduce ARDS mortality. This short note recounts past data indicating that (i) neutrophils home along an IL-8 gradient, (ii) in ARDS, massive neutrophil accumulation and degranulation in and along bronchoalveolar spaces contributes to damage and hypoxia, (iii) large increases in IL-8 are one of the chemotaxic signals drawing neutrophils to the ARDS lung, and (iv) old data from dermatology and glioblastoma research showed that the old drug against Hansen's disease, dapsone, inhibits neutrophils' chemotaxis to IL-8. Therefore dapsone might lower neutrophils' contributions to ARDS lung pathology. Dapsone can create methemoglobinemia that although rarely problematic it would be particularly undesirable in ARDS. The common antacid drug cimetidine lowers risk of dapsone related methemoglobinemia and should be given concomitantly.","Kast, R E",Exp Lung Res,,180

Epidemiological models like Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and its variants are helpful to understand the dynamics trend of pandemic that may be used in decision making to optimize possible controls from the infectious disease. But these epidemiological models based on mathematical assumptions may not predict the real pandemic situation. Recently the new machine learning approaches are being used to understand the dynamic trend of COVID-19 spread. In this paper, we designed the recurrent and convolutional neural network models: vanilla LSTM, stacked LSTM, ED-LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, and hybrid CNN+LSTM model to capture the complex trend of COVID-19 outbreak and perform the forecasting of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases of 7, 14, 21 days for India and its four most affected states (Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu). The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation metric are computed on the testing data to demonstrate the relative performance of these models. The results show that the stacked LSTM and hybrid CNN+LSTM models perform best relative to other models.","Verma, Hanuman; Mandal, Saurav; Gupta, Akshansh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13823v1.pdf,180

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System during March 1, 2020 to July 29, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. We identified sarcoidosis patients who met diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis according to accepted guidelines. An adverse disease outcome was defined as the presence of intubation and mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality. In sarcoidosis patients, we reported (when available) the results of pulmonary function testing measured within 3 years prior to the time of SARS­CoV­2 infection. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to generate an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to evaluate sarcoidosis as a risk factor for an adverse outcome. The same model was used to analyze sarcoidosis patients with moderate and/or severe impairment in pulmonary function. RESULTS: The study included 7337 patients, 37 of whom (0.5%) had sarcoidosis. The crude rate of developing an adverse outcome was significantly higher in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function (9/14 vs. 3/23, p = 0.003). While the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was not independently associated with risk of an adverse event, (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.6), the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function was associated with an adverse outcome (aOR 7.8, 95% CI 2.4-25.8). CONCLUSION: Moderate or severe impairment in pulmonary function is associated with mortality in sarcoidosis patients infected with SARS­CoV­2.","Morgenthau, Adam S; Levin, Matthew A; Freeman, Robert; Reich, David L; Klang, Eyal",Lung,,180

Strategies to safely reopen economies, travel and trade are a high priority. Until a reliable vaccine is available, non-pharmaceutical techniques are the only available means of disease control. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the extent to which social distancing (SD) and facemask (FM) use can mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 when restrictions are lifted. We used a microsimulation activity-based model for Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area, to evaluate the power of SD and FM in controlling the pandemic under numerous scenarios. The hypothetical scenarios are designed to picture feasible futures under different assumptions. Assuming that the isolation of infected cases and the quarantining of close contacts are in place, different numerical tests are conducted and a full factorial two-way MANOVA test is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the FM and SD control strategies. The main and interactive effects of the containment strategies are evaluated by the total number of infections, percentage of infections reduction, the time it takes to get the pandemic under control, and the intensity of active cases.","Najmi, Ali; Nazari, Sahar; Safarighouzhdi, Farshid; MacIntyre, C Raina; Miller, Eric J; H Rashidi, Taha",PLoS One,,180

Here, we report a newly developed LFA-NanoSuit method (LNSM) combined with a desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the direct observation of immunocomplexes labeled with a colloidal metal instead of signal enhancement strategies, such as using color, electrochemical signals, silver enhancement, magnetic properties, luminescent, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The proposed LNSM suppresses cellulose deformity, thereby allowing the acquisition of high-resolution images of gold/platinum-labeled immunocomplexed pathogens such as influenza A, without conductive treatment as in conventional SEM. Electron microscopy-based diagnosis of influenza A exhibited 94 % clinical sensitivity (29/31; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 79.3-98.2 %) and 100 % clinical specificity (95 % CI: 98.1-100 %), which was more sensitive (71.4 %) than visual detection (14.3 %), especially in the lower influenza A-RNA copy number group. The detection ability of our method was nearly comparable to that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR. This is the first report on the diagnosis of clinical diseases using LFA equipped with a desktop SEM.

416005,The Evolution of Young People's Mental Health during COVID-19: Evidence from four Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries,2021,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health communication campaigns have been targeted at reducing viral transmission, specifically among populations most vulnerable to infection and death from the virus (e.g. older adults). However, other individuals who have not been defined as vulnerable populations may also suffer from a decrease in health because of the measures aimed at reducing viral transmission, such as social distancing. To illuminate this issue, we investigate the role of social and media resources in complementing limited offline communication and supporting mental and physical health during this pandemic. We then suggest an alternative audience segmentation strategy based on social and media resources for public health interventions. Based on online survey data from 723 adults in South Korea, the regression analysis results indicated that individuals with lower levels of social resources suffered more during the pandemic. The cluster analysis results revealed that, contrary to the traditional definition of vulnerable populations, a cluster of younger people were unhealthier than a cluster of older people because of a lack of social resources. Clusters with different levels of ICT skills and uses for health-related activities also experienced the pandemic differently. These findings imply public health interventions should focus on social resources beyond the demographic factors to determine target audiences, and that they should take advantage of the target audiences' media resources to encourage them to forge intimate connections with others and to engage in health-related activities.","Ihm, Jennifer; Lee, Chul-Joo",Health Commun,,180

A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study in Nepal",2020,"PURPOSE: To reveal that a computed tomography surveillance program (CT-surveillance) could demonstrate the epidemiologic features of COVID-19 infection and simultaneously investigate the type and frequency of CT findings using clinical CT data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We targeted individuals with possible CT findings of viral pneumonia. Using an online questionnaire, we asked Japanese board-certified radiologists to register their patients' information including patient age and sex, the CT examination date, the results of PCR test for COVID-19 infection, CT findings, and the postal code of the medical institution that performed the CT. We compared the diurnal patient number and the cumulative regional distribution map of registrations in CT-surveillance to those of the PCR-positive patient surveillance (PCR-surveillance). RESULTS: A total of 637 patients was registered from January 1 to April 17, 2020 for CT-surveillance. Their PCR test results were positive (n = 62.5-398%), negative (n = 8.9-57%), unknown (n = 26.2-167%), and other disease (n = 2.4-15%). An age peak at 60-69 years and male dominance were observed in CT-surveillance. The most common CT finding was bilaterally distributed ground-glass opacities. The diurnal number and the cumulative regional distribution map by CT-surveillance showed tendencies that were similar to those revealed by PCR-surveillance.

420534,Coping with more than COVID-19,2020,"AIMS: It remains unclear whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates (SR). Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. METHODS: Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020.In 2020, SR (suicides per 100 000 LY) were lower in periods with severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.2, &#967;2 = 4.033, p = 0.045) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 16.8). A comparison with previous years showed that this difference was caused by unusually high SR before the imposition of restrictions, while SR during the pandemic were within the trend corridor of previous years (expected suicides = 32.3, observed suicides = 35; IRR = 1.084, p = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: SR during COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the trend in previous years. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalised.","Radeloff, Daniel; Papsdorf, Rainer; Uhlig, Kirsten; Vasilache, Andreas; Putnam, Karen; von Klitzing, Kai",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,180

While such data has been used in various countries, the changes in mobility patterns in Japan where interventions were limited to non-compulsory measures, has been under-studied. Here, we analyzed the temporal changes in i) human mobility behavior, ii) social contact rates, and iii) correlations between changes in such mobility metrics with the transmissibility of COVID-19, using anonymized large-scale mobility data collected from more than 200K mobile phone users in Tokyo, Japan. The analysis concludes that by April 15th (1 week from declaring state of emergency), aggregated quantities characterizing human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the effectiveness of non-compulsory measures. Mobility behavior had, in fact, already decreased to 60% of typical weekdays before the declaration of the state of emergency.

This study evaluates the effect of the shelter-in-place (SIP) mandate on glycemic metrics in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Northern California, United States. Methods: CGM and insulin pump metrics in youth 3-21 years old with T1D at an academic pediatric diabetes center were analyzed retrospectively. Data 2-4 months before (distant pre-SIP), 1 month before (immediate pre-SIP), 1 month after (immediate post-SIP), and 2-4 months after (distant post-SIP) the SIP mandate were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression, and longitudinal analysis using a mixed effects model. Results: Participants (n = 85) had reduced mean glucose (-10.3 ± 4.4 mg/dL, P = 0.009), standard deviation (SD) (-5.0 ± 1.3 mg/dL, P = 0.003), glucose management indicator (-0.2% ± 0.03%, P = 0.004), time above range (TAR) >250 mg/dL (-3.5% ± 1.7%, P = 0.01), and increased time in range (TIR) (+4.7% ± 1.7%, P = 0.0025) between the distant pre-SIP and distant post-SIP periods. Relationships were maintained using a mixed effects model, when controlling for other demographic variables. There was improvement in SD, TAR 180-250 mg/dL, and TIR for participants with private insurance, but changes in the opposite direction for participants with public insurance. Conclusions: Improvement in CGM metrics in youth with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that diabetes management can be maintained in the face of sudden changes to daily living. Youth with public insurance deserve more attention in research and clinical practice.","Abdulhussein, Fatema S; Chesser, Hannah; Boscardin, W John; Gitelman, Stephen E; Wong, Jenise C",Diabetes technol. ther,,180

While dentistry is known as one of the most exposed and high-risk professions, dental care professionals are indeed at even greater risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, occupational health practices, personal protective equipment usage, and mental stressors during COVID-19 pandemic among dental care professionals. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental care professionals who were subscribers to a dental hygiene journal using a self-administered online survey (nâ=â1047 respondents). Cross-tabulations were performed to determine differences in the responses to the statements related to different domains. RESULTS: COVID-19 impacted the healthy work-life balance (pâ< â0.001) and caused sleeping difficulty among the respondents (pâ< â0.001). Moreover, a lower response on changing respirators and gloves for each patient compared with before viral pandemic was observed (pâ< â0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing training on infection control, occupational health practices, and PPE usage can prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among dental care professionals and the public. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is a burden for applying occupational health practices in dental clinics and present a risk to the public. COVID-19 may contribute to developing psychological stress and disrupt healthy work-life balance among dental professionals.","Banaee, Sean; Claiborne, Denise M; Akpinar-Elci, Muge",Work,,180

This study investigated the patient-endoscopist vertical distance necessary to minimize an endoscopist's facial exposure to a patient's visible droplets during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and the ability of a new device to prevent droplets from reaching the endoscopist's face. METHODS: A model was developed to simulate a patient experiencing a forceful cough during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with a model endoscopist. Fluorescent dye was expelled from the model patient's mouth towards the model endoscopist during simulated coughs; dye adhesion to the model endoscopist's face was evaluated using ultraviolet light. The simulation was repeated with the model patient positioned 70-100 cm above the floor, with and without a barrier to shield the patient's face. The accuracy of the cough simulation model and the relationship between patient-endoscopist vertical distance and endoscopist's facial exposure were evaluated. RESULTS: The flow dynamics of the cough simulation model were similar to that of an actual human cough. There was a significant inverse correlation between the patient-endoscopist vertical distance and the model endoscopist's facial exposure, with positive exposures decreasing from 87% at 70 cm to 0% at 100 cm (P < 0.001). The barrier device prevented facial exposure to droplets at all distances. CONCLUSIONS: We found that positioning the patient at least 100 cm below the top of the endoscopist's head or using a barrier device minimized the endoscopist's facial exposure to visible droplets during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.","Suzuki, Sho; Gotoda, Takuji; Ikehara, Hisatomo; Ichijima, Ryoji; Kusano, Chika",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,180

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes ACE2 receptors on cell surfaces to gain intracellular entry, making them an ideal target for therapy. High-affinity variants of sACE2, engineered using high-throughput mutagenesis, are capable of neutralizing COVID-19 infection as decoy receptors. These variants compete with native ACE2 present on cells by binding with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, making native ACE2 on cell surfaces available to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-1,7, thus alleviating the exaggerated inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 infection. This article explores the use of sACE2 as potential therapy for COVID-19 infection.","Krishnamurthy, Sudarshan; Lockey, Richard F; Kolliputi, Narasaiah",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,,180

Using a high-throughput approach of affinity-profiling against the full human PDZome, we identified sixteen human PDZ binders of SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3A, and N showing significant interactions with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 82 µm. Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS-CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Among the binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a, or N, seven significantly affect viral replication under knock down gene expression in infected cells. This PDZ profiling identifying human proteins potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 can help to understand the multifactorial severity of COVID19 and to conceive effective anti-coronaviral agents for therapeutic purposes.","Caillet-Saguy, Célia; Durbesson, Fabien; Rezelj, Veronica V; Gogl, Gergö; Tran, Quang Dinh; Twizere, Jean-Claude; Vignuzzi, Marco; Vincentelli, Renaud; Wolff, Nicolas",FEBS j,,180

437429,Assessing Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Prevention: Defining Two Attitudes Crucial for Understanding Systemic and Social Variables Associated with Disparities,2021,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted radiology departments across the country. The pandemic has also disrupted resident education, both due to departmental social distancing efforts and reduced imaging volumes. The purpose of this study was to assess the differential impact the pandemic had on radiology resident imaging volumes by training year and imaging modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All signed radiology resident reports were curated during defined prepandemic and intrapandemic time periods. Imaging case volumes were analyzed on a mean per resident basis to quantify absolute and percent change by training level. Change in total volume by imaging modality was also assessed. The number of resident workdays assigned outside the normal reading room was also calculated. RESULTS: Overall percent decline in resident imaging interpretation volume from the prepandemic to intrapandemic time period was 62.8%. R1s and R2s had the greatest decline at 87.3% and 64.3%, respectively. Mammography, MRI and nuclear medicine had the greatest decline in resident interpretation volume at 92.0%, 73.2%, and 73.0%, respectively. During the intrapandemic time period, a total of 478 resident days (mean of 14.5 days per resident) were reassigned outside of the radiology reading room. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a marked decrease in radiology resident imaging interpretation volume and has had a tremendous impact on resident education. The decrease in case interpretation, as well as in-person teaching has profound implications for resident education. Knowledge of this differential decrease by training level will help residency programs plan for the future.","Poyiadji, Neo; Klochko, Chad; LaForce, Jeff; Brown, Manuel L; Griffith, Brent",Acad Radiol,,180

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19.

People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS: We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent.

445434,Effectiveness of Interactive Tools in Online Health Care Communities: Social Exchange Theory Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Companies use brand websites as a promotional tool to engage consumers on the web, which can increase product use. Given that some products are harmful to the health of consumers, it is important for marketing associated with these products to be subject to public health surveillance. However, terms of service (TOS) governing the use of brand website content may impede such important research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the TOS for brand websites with public health significance to assess possible legal and ethical challenges for conducting research on consumer product websites. METHODS: Using Statista, we purposefully constructed a sample of 15 leading American tobacco, alcohol, psychiatric pharmaceutical, fast-food, and gun brands that have associated websites. We developed and implemented a structured coding system for the TOS on these websites and coded for the presence versus absence of different types of restriction that might impact the ability to conduct research. RESULTS: All TOS stated that by accessing the website, users agreed to abide by the TOS (15/15, 100%). A total of 11 out of 15 (73%) websites had age restrictions in their TOS. All alcohol brand websites (5/15, 33%) required users to enter their age or date of birth before viewing website content. Both websites for tobacco brands (2/15, 13%) further required that users register and verify their age and identity to access any website content and agree that they use tobacco products. Only one website (1/15, 7%) allowed users to display, download, copy, distribute, and translate the website content as long as it was for personal and not commercial use. A total of 33% (5/15) of TOS unconditionally prohibited or put substantial restrictions on all of these activities and/or failed to specify if they were allowed or prohibited. Moreover, 87% (13/15) of TOS indicated that website access could be restricted at any time. A total of 73% (11/15) of websites specified that violating TOS could result in deleting user content from the website, revoking access by having the user's Internet Protocol address blocked, terminating log-in credentials, or enforcing legal action resulting in civil or criminal penalties. CONCLUSIONS: TOS create complications for public health surveillance related to e-marketing on brand websites. Recent court opinions have reduced the risk of federal criminal charges for violating TOS on public websites, but this risk remains unclear for private websites. The public health community needs to establish standards to guide and protect researchers from the possibility of legal repercussions related to such efforts.","Weiger, Caitlin; Smith, Katherine C; Cohen, Joanna E; Dredze, Mark; Moran, Meghan Bridgid",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,180

447773,Sociodemographic and Psychological Risk Factors for Anxiety and Depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland on Mental Health (CHARIS-MH) Cross-sectional Survey,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly impacted on education, training, and mobility opportunities provided to learners, teachers, and educators. In response to this situation, synchronous online learning has been massively adopted in universities and, therefore, the analysis of student behavior in this context is becoming essential. However, the literature has mainly tackled student behavior modelling in asynchronous online learning (e.g., interactions with pre-recorded videos), making how students learn in synchronous online learning so far under-explored. Grounding on the experience on online learning at the University of Cagliari, this paper proposes a preliminary study on student participation in synchronous lessons, covering more than 80 courses, and identifies patterns and strategies of engagement in classes over the semester. Then, by means of clustering techniques applied to data from more than 25,000 students, we model fine-grained behavioral strategies and discuss how they are related with the student's experience across courses and whether planning elements (e.g., the hour of the day a lesson is delivered) influence their level of participation. We expect that this study will support the educational stakeholders with preliminary data-driven informed decisions and pose the basis for data-driven personalization for students and teachers involved in online synchronous learning. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a total of 50 investigations in which we documented a complete valve closure at the so called ""crosse"" at the valve of the large saphenous vein, a delayed valve closure or an incomplete valve closure with consecutive insufficiency at the crosse. The valve function of the crosse is crucial for the development of varicosis. For our study we recorded age and gender of the patients. One patient in the study was suffering from Covid19. For the examinations we used a 3-9âMHz probe and a high-end ultrasound device. The examination was performed in a lying position and under quiet conditions. Before examination we practiced inhalation and exhalation as well as ""pressing"" or coughing with the patients, which resulted in a physiological closure of the venous valves. To rule out thrombosis, we carried out compression sonography on the legs. During the examination we documented the B-scan, the Color-Coded Duplex Sonography, the HR-flow and the V-flow for 3 seconds at the estuary of the crosses and incorporated these parameters into our measurements. Via V-flow, vectors can be imaged by representing the flow of erythrocytes and visually indicate a possible insufficiency due to delayed or incomplete valve closure. RESULTS: 31 of 50 patients (age 19-81years) showed a complete valve closure of the crosses, three of them suffered from thrombosis. In eight of the 50 study participants (age 45-79 years) a delayed valve closure could be diagnosed by V-flow within 1-2 seconds. None of them had a thrombosis, but six of them suffered from cancer. In eleven patients we derived an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency (age 51-88 years). With reflux it took >2 seconds to close the valve. The patient with Covid19 also showed an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency. At the same time this patient showed a Covid19-associated deep vein thrombosis. Eight additional patients also had a thrombosis. Six of them suffered from cancer. Overall, the results were best visualized by V-Flow. CONCLUSION: The crosse as a significant venous structure can be well investigated by V-flow with respect to hemodynamic changes and a resulted reflux. Also associated changes close to the valve can be visualized well.","Kammerer, S; Stroszczynski, C; Jung, E M",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,,180

COVID-19 mainly causes the respiratory complications of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and severe immune disruptions. The assays depict that though people recuperate from COVID-19, there are still symptoms that persists in the body causing discomfort, which is the consequence of the viral infection due to severe immune disruptions. Upon various difficulties of post COVID-19, the pulmonary fibrosis is the stumbling block in the lungs causing severe damage. In this review, we have shown the effectiveness and importance of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) secreted by Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy on selective stoppage of the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-ß) signalling pathway by causing immunomodulatory effects that ameliorate the pulmonary fibrosis through paracrine signalling.

455932,Screening Hospital Staff with Core Symptoms May Miss Cases of Covid-19,2021,"Importance: Before the widespread implementation of robotic systems to provide patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic occurs, it is important to understand the acceptability of these systems among patients and the economic consequences associated with the adoption of robotics in health care settings. Objective: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study included 2 components: a national survey to examine the acceptability of using robotic systems to perform health care tasks in a hospital setting and a single-site cohort study of patient experiences and satisfaction with the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate triage and telehealth tasks in the emergency department (ED). The national survey comprised individuals living in the US who participated in a sampling-based survey via an online analytic platform. Participants completed the national survey between August 18 and August 21, 2020. The single-site cohort study included patients living in the US who presented to the ED of a large urban academic hospital providing quaternary care in Boston, Massachusetts between April and August 2020. All data were analyzed from August to October 2020. Exposures: Participants in the national survey completed an online survey to measure the acceptability of using a mobile robotic system to perform health care tasks (facilitating telehealth interviews, acquiring vital signs, obtaining nasal or oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, performing phlebotomy, and turning a patient in bed) in a hospital setting in the contexts of general interaction and interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in the cohort study were exposed to a mobile robotic system, which was controlled by an ED clinician and used to facilitate a triage interview. After exposure, patients completed an assessment to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Acceptability of the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks in a hospital setting (national survey) and feasibility and patient satisfaction regarding the use of a mobile robotic system in the ED (cohort study). Results: For the national survey, 1154 participants completed all acceptability questions, representing a participation rate of 35%. After sample matching, a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [17.0] years; 535 women [53.5%]) was included in the analysis. With regard to the usefulness of a robotic system to perform specific health care tasks, the response of ""somewhat useful"" was selected by 373 participants (37.3%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 350 participants (35.0%) for acquiring vital signs, 307 participants (30.7%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 228 participants (22.8%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 249 participants (24.9%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. The response of ""extremely useful"" was selected by 287 participants (28.7%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 413 participants (41.3%) for acquiring vital signs, 192 participants (19.2%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 159 participants (15.9%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 167 participants (16.7%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of individuals who perceived the application of robotic systems to be acceptable for completing telehealth interviews, obtaining nasal and oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, and performing phlebotomy increased. For the ED cohort study, 51 individuals were invited to participate, and 41 participants (80.4%) enrolled. One participant was unable to complete the study procedures because of a signaling malfunction in the robotic system. Forty patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [2.7] years; 29 women [72.5%]) completed the mobile robotic system-facilitated triage interview, and 37 patients (92.5%) reported that the interaction was satisfactory. A total of 33 participants (82.5%) reported that their experience of receiving an interview facilitated by a mobile robotic system was as satisfactory as receiving an in-person interview from a clinician. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a mobile robotic system was perceived to be acceptable for use in a broad set of health care tasks among survey respondents across the US. The use of a mobile robotic system enabled the facilitation of contactless triage interviews of patients in the ED and was considered acceptable among participants. Most patients in the ED rated the quality of mobile robotic system-facilitated interaction to be equivalent to in-person interaction with a clinician.","Chai, Peter R; Dadabhoy, Farah Z; Huang, Hen-Wei; Chu, Jacqueline N; Feng, Annie; Le, Hien M; Collins, Joy; da Silva, Marco; Raibert, Marc; Hur, Chin; Boyer, Edward W; Traverso, Giovanni",JAMA Netw Open,,180
455933,Screening Hospital Staff with Core Symptoms May Miss Cases of Covid-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for populational adherence to measures for the prevention and control of respiratory infectious diseases. However, their effectiveness depends on the population's preventive behaviour, which may be divergent from public policies. Therefore, this study aims to summarise and evaluate the evidence on barriers and facilitators to populational adherence to prevention and control measures in COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search on MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for studies focusing on adults receiving protective behaviour recommendations to combat COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. The searches will be carried out from database's inception to the present. We will include studies that use qualitative methods in their data collection and analysis and studies that use mixed methods if they include any qualitative methods of analysis. Studies published in English, Portuguese and Spanish will be included. Two review authors will independently screen the studies for inclusion and extract data. We will assess the quality of the included studies using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme tool. For the assessment of the confidence in the synthesised findings, we will use the GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research. Data analysis will be conducted using the best-fit framework approach based on adapted dimensions from the Health Belief Model and the Behaviour Change Wheel. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted on published evidence, and thus, no ethical approval is required. The findings of this rapid qualitative evidence synthesis will be disseminated to academic audiences, health policy-makers and the general population. We will publish the results in peer-reviewed journals, present our findings in conferences, and disseminate results via social media. We also aim to present the research findings in plain language and disseminate the knowledge to the general population to increase public interest.

462201,Impacts of COVID-19 and social isolation on academic staff and students at universities: a cross-sectional study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous physical and mental strain on the US healthcare system. Studies examining the effects of outbreaks have demonstrated both an increased prevalence and long-term development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in healthcare providers. We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of medical providers, medical trainees, and administrators at a large academic center to identify stressors and moderators to guide future mental health and hospital-system interventions. METHODS: A 42-item survey examining specific stressors, grit, and resilience was widely distributed to physicians, residents, fellows, and administrators a large academic institution for departmental distribution. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and multivariate linear regressions. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 785 participants completed the survey. The majority of respondents rated their stress to be significantly increased during the pandemic. Respondents' fear of transmitting the virus to their family members was a significant stressor. Higher resilience was associated with lower stress, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Overall, respondents felt supported by their departments and institution and felt contingency plans and personal protective equipment were adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers have increased resilience in the face of heightened stress during a pandemic. Higher resilience and grit were protective factors in managing personal and system-level stressors at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our institution. Implementing an intervention designed to enhance healthcare workers' resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is warranted.","Huffman, Elizabeth M; Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Anton, Nicholas E; Haskett, Lindsay A; Doster, Dominique L; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Lee, Nicole K",Am. j. surg,,180

464171,COVID-19 and racism,2020,"Importance: The reopening of colleges and universities in the US during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant public health challenge. The development of accessible and practical approaches for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in the college population is paramount for deploying recurrent surveillance testing as an essential strategy for virus detection, containment, and mitigation. Objective: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic participants in a university community by using CREST (Cas13-based, rugged, equitable, scalable testing), a CRISPR-based test developed for accessible and large-scale viral screening. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this cohort study, a total of 1808 asymptomatic participants were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a CRISPR-based assay and a point-of-reference reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test. Viral prevalence in self-collected oropharyngeal swab samples collected from May 28 to June 11, 2020, and from June 23 to July 2, 2020, was evaluated. Exposures: Testing for SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 status, viral load, and demographic information of the study participants were collected. Results: Among the 1808 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.3 [11.0] years; 955 [52.8%] female), 732 underwent testing from May to early June (mean [SD] age, 28.4 [11.7] years; 392 [53.6%] female). All test results in this cohort were negative. In contrast, 1076 participants underwent testing from late June to early July (mean [SD] age, 26.6 [10.5] years; 563 [52.3%] female), with 9 positive results by RT-qPCR. Eight of these positive samples were detected by the CRISPR-based assay and confirmed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified diagnostic testing. The mean (SD) age of the positive cases was 21.7 (3.3) years; all 8 individuals self-identified as students. These metrics showed that a CRISPR-based assay was effective at capturing positive SARS-CoV-2 cases in this student population. Notably, the viral loads detected in these asymptomatic cases resemble those seen in clinical samples, highlighting the potential of covert viral transmission. The shift in viral prevalence coincided with the relaxation of stay-at-home measures. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings reveal a shift in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in a young and asymptomatic population and uncover the leading edge of a local outbreak that coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. The concordance between CRISPR-based and RT-qPCR testing suggests that CRISPR-based assays are reliable and offer alternative options for surveillance testing and detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as is required to resume operations in higher-education institutions in the US and abroad.","Rauch, Jennifer N; Valois, Eric; Ponce-Rojas, Jose Carlos; Aralis, Zach; Lach, Ryan S; Zappa, Francesca; Audouard, Morgane; Solley, Sabrina C; Vaidya, Chinmay; Costello, Michael; Smith, Holly; Javanbakht, Ali; Malear, Betsy; Polito, Laura; Comer, Stewart; Arn, Katherine; Kosik, Kenneth S; Acosta-Alvear, Diego; Wilson, Maxwell Z; Fitzgibbons, Lynn; Arias, Carolina",JAMA Netw Open,,180

476813,"Kawasaki disease fact check: Myths, misconceptions and mysteries",2020,"OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the effects of a pre-existing condition of diabetes and of the use of antidiabetic drugs in the Sicilian population on different outcomes of the COVID-19 disease. DESIGN: a retrospective observational study based was used. Data deriving from the COVID-19 epidemic surveillance and from the collection of information on drugs consume by Sicilian residents. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: due to the data availability, the study was calibrated on the Region and included all population distinguishing by gender and age groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the risks of cumulative incidence for COVID-19 were investigated in people who had diabetes comorbidities to incur a hospitalization for COVID-19, to be treated within an intensive care unit, and lethality. The role of previous antidiabetic drug treatments with respect to each study outcome was also investigated. RESULTS: in Sicily, from 01.03.2020 to 26.06.2020, a number of 172 cases of COVID-19 disease with diabetes comorbidity were diagnosed. The data did not show any difference in the cumulative incidence for COVID-19 between diabetics (64.2/100,000 inhabitants) and non-diabetics (56.9/100,000 inhabitants) patients. Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization in the under 80 in both men and women (men: OR 2.62; women OR 4.31), for treatment in intensive care (men: OR 4,41; women: OR 7.74), and for death (men: OR 5.21; women OR 5.92). The analysis of drug using showed risks effect of insulin (OR 2.13) on hospitalization, sulfonylureas/glinides (OR 2.58) on intensive care and protective of metformin on death both in single component (OR 0.44) and in multicomponent (OR 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: data availability made it possible to monitor the occurrence and explore some of the characteristics of the cases with COVID-19 in Sicily. Diabetes does not seem to represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sicily, while previous diabetes condition seems to determine greater risk of hospitalization, treatment in intensive care, and lethality among over 80. There are also gender differences with almost double risks in women for hospitalization and intensive care only. Among the antidiabetic drugs investigated, there was a risk for hospitalization and intensive care while protective for deaths. This study represents an important tool for the activation of intervention programmes in the area aimed at populations with greater health risk deriving from the effects of this new pandemic.","Cernigliaro, Achille; Allotta, Alessandra Vincenza; Scondotto, Salvatore",Epidemiol Prev,,180

The aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of how nursing and midwifery students experience, understand and cope with disgust in their clinical work. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Six participants (all women: two nursing students, four midwifery students) from a university in the South of England were interviewed. Four superordinate themes with eight subthemes were identified. Overall, findings suggest that participants experience both moral and physical disgust; however, they find it difficult to talk about and use other terms to describe their experience. Findings are discussed through the lens of social identity theory, to understand the relevance of professional identity and how this might further maintain the disgust taboo. The strategies participants have developed in order to cope with disgust are explored and understood within the current healthcare climate. Future research should focus on ways of addressing the experience of disgust by healthcare professionals in order to improve the quality of care provided, especially in the climate of the COVID-19 crisis.","Hadjittofi, Marilena; Gleeson, Kate; Arber, Anne",Nurs Inq,,180

METHODS: Using 2006-2014 data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), we identified all patients with primary brain cancers visiting EDs and evaluated trends of head CT and brain MRI utilization. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine patient- and hospital-specific factors associated with brain imaging utilization. RESULTS: A weighted cohort of 40,862 ED visits were included (mean age 55; 54% male), increasing from 3932 in 2006 to 5625 in 2014 (+ 43%). A total of 14.4% underwent brain imaging, with 13.2% undergoing CT, 2.3% undergoing MRI, and 1.1% undergoing both modalities. Between 2006 and 2014, there was a 104% increase in the rate of ED brain imaging (from 9.7% in 2006 to 19.8% in 2014). Factors associated with higher utilization of ED brain imaging in adults were non-teaching hospital status and Midwest and Northeast hospital regions (compared with the West). In pediatric patients, higher utilization was associated with older age, higher median household income of patient's ZIP code, and visits in rural, non-teaching hospitals located in the Midwest, South, and Northeast (compared with the West). CONCLUSION: In US patients with primary brain cancer, the number of ED visits increased annually, and the utilization of ED head imaging examinations doubled in a recent 9-year period. A variety of sociodemographic characteristics are associated with a higher likelihood of imaging in both adult and pediatric patients.","Elchoufi, Deema; Duszak, Richard; Balthazar, Patricia; Hanna, Tarek N; Sadigh, Gelareh",Emerg. radiol,,180

This commentary identifies key challenges and opportunities in continuing to conduct research with and for older people, both during and after the current pandemic. It shares opinions from responders to an international survey, a range of academic authors and opinions from specialist societies. Priorities in COVID-19 research include its specific presentation in older people, consequences for physical, cognitive and psychological health, treatments and vaccines, rehabilitation, supporting care homes more effectively, the impact of social distancing, lockdown policies and system reconfiguration to provide best health and social care for older people. COVID-19 research needs to be inclusive, particularly involving older people living with frailty, cognitive impairment or multimorbidity, and those living in care homes. Non-COVID-19 related research for older people remains of critical importance and must not be neglected in the rush to study the pandemic. Profound changes are required in the way that we design and deliver research for older people in a world where movement and face-to-face contact are restricted, but we also highlight new opportunities such as the ability to collaborate more widely and to design and deliver research efficiently at scale and speed.","Richardson, Sarah J; Carroll, Camille B; Close, Jacqueline; Gordon, Adam L; O039,; Brien, John; Quinn, Terence J; Rochester, Lynn; Sayer, Avan A; Shenkin, Susan D; van der Velde, Nathalie; Woo, Jean; Witham, Miles D",Age Ageing,,180

Using results from a web-based questionnaire survey conducted May–July 2020 in Moscow (Russia) and Perth (Australia), this paper provides insights regarding citizens’ needs for and values of urban BGI as well as their changes during and after the COVID-19 restrictions. Survey data collected during the lockdown period have captured information about people’s ability to access green and blue spaces within urban BGI, inequalities in access, feelings, and values as well as needs and perceived pathways of future development of urban natural environment. In both cities, lockdowns limited access of people to green spaces which affected their mental and physical health. Survey results revealed that the quality, functionality, and location of open green spaces illustrated a disparity in distribution, meaning that in many cases several communities from particular neighborhoods suffered from limited access to BGI. Furthermore, in addition to analyzing perceptions and values of urban nature during the COVID-19 pandemic, some suggestions for improvement of urban BGI based on the survey responses are provided. © 2021 by the authors.

503634,"A Resilience-Building App to Support the Mental Health of Health Care Workers in the COVID-19 Era: Design Process, Distribution, and Evaluation",2021,"Diffusion studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were conducted on two model surfactant solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/sodium salicylate (CTAB/NaSal) and cetylpyridinium chloride/sodium salicylate (CPCl/NaSal). By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 â Tdiff0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 â Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar microstructures. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing the existing restricted diffusion models and are shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.","Holder, Samuel W; Grant, Samuel C; Mohammadigoushki, Hadi",Langmuir,,180

The antiviral treatment acts as one of the most important means of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alteration of physiological characteristics in special populations may lead to the change in drug pharmacokinetics, which may result in treatment failure or increased adverse drug reactions. Some potential drugs have shown antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, interferon alpha, and remedsivir. Here, we reviewed the literature on clinical effects in COVID-19 patients of these antiviral agents and provided the potential antiviral agent options for pregnant women, elderly patients, liver or renal dysfunction patients, and severe or critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy or ECMO after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Lu; Wang, Xiaojuan; Wang, Rongrong; Hu, Yunzhen; Jiang, Saiping; Lu, Xiaoyang",Drug Des Devel Ther,,180

514432,Delayed access or provision of care in Italy resulting from fear of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnancy were uncertain. Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State. RESULTS: A total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3-23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2-7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%). CONCLUSION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups. These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.","Lokken, Erica M; Taylor, G Gray; Huebner, Emily M; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hendrickson, Sarah; Coler, Brahm; Sheng, Jessica S; Walker, Christie L; McCartney, Stephen A; Kretzer, Nicole M; Resnick, Rebecca; Kachikis, Alisa; Barnhart, Nena; Schulte, Vera; Bergam, Brittany; Ma, Kimberly K; Albright, Catherine; Larios, Valerie; Kelley, Lori; Larios, Victoria; Emhoff, Sharilyn; Rah, Jasmine; Retzlaff, Kristin; Thomas, Chad; Paek, Bettina W; Hsu, Rita J; Erickson, Anne; Chang, Andrew; Mitchell, Timothy; Hwang, Joseph K; Gourley, Rebecca; Erickson, Stephen; Delaney, Shani; Kline, Carolyn R; Archabald, Karen; Blain, Michela; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,180

As of March 30, 2020, there have been 693,224 reported patients with COVID-19 worldwide, with 1,446 in Japan. Currently, although aspects of the route of transmission are unclear, infection by contact and by inhaling droplets is considered to be the dominant transmission route. Inflammatory symptoms in the upper respiratory tract persist for several days to 1 week after onset, and in some patients symptoms of pneumonia worsen and become severe. The presence of underlying diseases and advanced age are risk factors for increased severity. Diagnosis is based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum. Symptomatic management is the main treatment for this disease. Although the efficacy of several agents is currently being tested, at present there is no effective therapeutic agent. To prevent infection, in addition to standard preventive measures, measures that counteract infection by contact and droplet inhalation are important. In addition, if procedures that cause aerosolization of virus are used, then measures that prevent airborne infection should be implemented.","Kutsuna, Satoshi",Uirusu,,180

SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically marked by respiratory symptoms although neurologic manifestations of the disease have also been described. OBJECTIVE: We want to measure the incidence and clinical aspects of persons exhibiting in otolaryngology clinic (OC) with SSNHL during the COVID-19 widespread and in the constant interval of previous year. METHODS: We retrospectively inspected the medical information for admissions to OC in Eskisehir, Turkey, during the COVID-19 widespread to describe the patients SSNHL. Clinical knowledge was saved for each subject and corresponded with that of SSNHL subjects demonstrating in 2019. RESULT: Between 1 April and 30 September 2020, 68 patients admitted to OC for SSNHL; in 2019, there were 41 subjects, for an incidence rate ratio of 8.5 per 100.000 (95% CI 1.02-2.92) for the 2020 cohort. Of the 2020 group, forty-one patients (60.3%) presented with active or recent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, compared with four (9.8%) in 2019 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, subjects in 2020 group were younger (-15.5 years, p = 0.0141) than 2019 group and demonstrated prolonged interim (+1.7 days, p < 0.001) between SSNHL initiation and OC petition. CONCLUSION: We detected increased incidence of SSNHL during the COVID-19 widespread compared to the same interval of the prior year; 60.3% of subjects confronting with SSNHL had signs that were harmonious with COVID-19.","Fidan, Vural; Akin, Okan; Koyuncu, Handan",Am J Otolaryngol,,180

524265,Surveying Tenants of Permanent Supportive Housing in Skid Row about COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Frontline healthcare workers have a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. The use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to prevent this occupational disease. Surgical masks and filtering face piece (FFP) respirators are important parts of this PPE. European standard EN 149 establishes three protection levels for FFP respirators (FFP1, FFP2, FFP3), depending on the particle infiltration degree through their materials, and these, in turn, are based on their filtration effectiveness. The aim of this laboratory test is to determine and quantify the filtration and fit rate of different FFP respirators, singly and in combination with surgical masks, by performing a series of fit tests and consequently, to check whether this combination improves protection levels for healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Several FFP respirators and surgical masks, singly and in combination, were fit tested with a PortaCount Pro + 8038, which fulfills OSHA standards, in a series of tests performed on healthcare workers in seven different breathing situations when taking care on COVID-19 patients, in order to determine and quantify their fit to the workers' face. RESULTS: Wearing a surgical mask together with a highly efficient FFP respirator provided increased respiratory protection. Interestingly, one of these highly efficient FFP models, combined with a surgical mask, achieved a protection factor over 200 (whereas 100 is the minimum required protection factor). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks, when used together with a FFP2 respirator, could significant ly improve the degree of fit of all self-filtering face piece by providing greater filtration efficiency and greater user protection from exposure to aerosols.","García Vela, Raquel; Cabanas Valdés, Rosa; Huertas Ríos, Santos; Donat Roca, Rafel; Monné Cuevas, Pol; Moizé Arcone, Luciana; Calvo Sanz, Jordi",Arch Prev Riesgos Labor,,180

Parameters such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Particulate matters (PM), Sulphur Di-Oxide (SO(2)), Nitrogen Di-Oxide (NO(2)), Carbon Mono-oxide (CO), and Methane (CH(4)) were derived using satellite data and validated using ground-based observations (n = 23). The coefficient of correlation (r) 0.91, 0.90, 0.95, 0.73, 0.81 and 0.80 were established with AOD, PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2) and CO, respectively.

However, this estimation is influenced by uncertainty in recalling effort of exposure time. We propose a novel method that uses viral load data collected over time since hospitalization, hindcasting the timing of infection with a mathematical model for viral dynamics. As an example, we used the reported viral load data from multiple countries (Singapore, China, Germany, France, and Korea) and estimated the incubation period. The median, 2.5, and 97.5 percentiles of the incubation period were 5.23 days (95% CI: 5.17, 5.25), 3.29 days (3.25, 3.37), and 8.22 days (8.02, 8.46), respectively, which are comparable to the values estimated in previous studies.

598959,Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study,2020-05-12,"Importance: Among COVID-19 cases, especially the (frail) elderly show a high number of severe infections, hospital admissions, complications, and death. The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. Observations: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. Conclusions and relevance: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.","Smorenberg, Annemieke; Peters, Edgar JG; van Daele, Paul LA; Nossent, Esther J; Muller, Majon",Eur J Intern Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520304349; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520304349?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.11.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303345/,180

Running is an activity that could be maintained while social distancing restrictions were implemented during the pandemic. If running-related injuries do occur, these restrictions may also influence the access to care or care seeking behavior of this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the social distancing restrictions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic influenced training habits, injury, and care seeking behavior in youth long-distance runners. Methods: A customized, open online questionnaire was provided to runners 9–19 years of age who participated in long-distance running activities including team/club cross-country, track and field (distances ≥800 m), road races, or recreational running. Participants responded to questions about demographics, running habits, RRIs, and health care provider visits 6-months before as well as during social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19. Wilcoxon signed rank tests compared differences for ratio data and Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions before and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: A total of 287 youth long-distance runners (male = 124, female = 162, unspecified = 1; age = 15.3 ± 1.7 years; running experience = 5.0 ± 2.3 years) participated. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth long-distance runners reported lower distances run per week (p < 0.001), fewer runs per week (p < 0.001), fewer hard runs per week (p < 0.001), fewer number of injuries (p < 0.001), and fewer injuries per 1,000 km (p = 0.002) during the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. A lower proportion of participants reported in-person health care provider visits (p < 0.001) and a lower proportion of visits were made to an athletic trainer during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions compared to prior to COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant decreases in both training and injuries which were different compared to previous reports in an adult population. Many of the runners who sustained an injury during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions did not seek care, with the most prominent reduction in visits to an athletic trainer.

A typical example is the case of display of peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues on the major coat protein, protein VIII of the filamentous bacteriophages M13 and fd. A solution to this problem has been the use of “two-gene systems” generating chimeric phages that concomitantly express wild-type protein VIII along with recombinant protein VIII. Although the two-gene systems are much more permissive in regard to insert length and composition, some cases can still adversely affect phage assembly. Although these phages genotypically contain the desired DNA of the insert, they appear to be phenotypically wild type. To avoid false-negative results when using chimeric phages in binding studies, it is necessary to confirm that the observed lack of phage recognition is not due to faulty assembly and display of the intended insert. Here we describe a strategy for generating antibodies that specifically recognize recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of its foreign insert. These antibodies can be used as a general monitor of the display of recombinant protein VIII into phage particles.","Kaplan, Gilad; Gershoni, Jonathan M.",Anal Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.08.050; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269711005951; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269711005951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21945353/,180

Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R(0) (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following intervention implementation (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread through predictions of the exportation of COVID-19 before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the true infection rates are orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone.

613278,A 24-hour online youth emotional support: Opportunities and challenges,2020-11-07,"SARS-CoV-2 is the latest worldwide pandemic declared by the World Health Organization and there is no established anti-COVID-19 drug to combat this notorious situation except some recently approved vaccines. By affecting the global public health sector, this viral infection has created a disastrous situation associated with high morbidity and mortality rates along with remarkable cases of hospitalization because of its tendency to be high infective. These challenges forced researchers and leading pharmaceutical companies to find and develop cures for this novel strain of coronavirus. Besides, plants have a proven history of being notable wellsprings of potential drugs, including antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer therapies. As a continuation of this approach, plant-based preparations and bioactive metabolites along with a notable number of traditional medicines, bioactive phytochemicals, traditional Chinese medicines, nutraceuticals, Ayurvedic preparations, and other plant-based products are being explored as possible therapeutics against COVID-19. Moreover, the unavailability of effective medicines against COVID-19 has driven researchers and members of the pharmaceutical, herbal, and related industries to conduct extensive investigations of plant-based products, especially those that have already shown antiviral properties. Even the recent invention of several vaccines has not eliminated doubts about safety and efficacy. As a consequence, many limited, unregulated clinical trials involving conventional mono- and poly-herbal therapies are being conducted in various areas of the world. Of the many clinical trials to establish such agents as credentialed sources of anti-COVID-19 medications, only a few have reached the landmark of completion. In this review, we have highlighted and focused on plant-based anti-COVID-19 clinical trials found in several scientific and authenticated databases. The aim is to allow researchers and innovators to identify promising and prospective anti-COVID-19 agents in clinical trials (either completed or recruiting) to establish them as novel therapies to address this unwanted pandemic.","Alam, Safaet; Sarker, Md.

As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Bobrowski, Tesia; Chen, Lu; Eastman, Richard T.; Itkin, Zina; Shinn, Paul; Chen, Catherine; Guo, Hui; Zheng, Wei; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Matthew D.; Zakharov, Alexey V.; Muratov, Eugene N.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637956/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.178889,180

The bed occupancy rate dropped to 20 %. Drastically enhanced hygiene measures directly after outbreak detection could stop further nosocomial infections among patients but were less effective among HCP. OBJECTIVE: Outbreak investigation and detection of risk factors for infection in HCP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anonymous online survey among HCP from January and February 2021 investigating potential risk factors for PCR positive infections (poorly fitting FFP2 masks, close contacts with positive patients, team meetings with positive HCP). RESULTS: Of 184 HCP, 96 completed the survey (52.2 %), including 38 who became infected. Of the HCP 8 remained asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic, 30 HCP became ill for a median of 10 days and in 2 continuously. Factors associated with an infection were close contacts with positive patients in a time-dependent manner despite wearing an FFP2 mask (OR 6.0; 95 % CI 1.6–22). Out of 88 HCP 55 described poorly fitting FFP2 masks. An infection was mostly attributed to a longer contact with positive, sometimes restless patients. The overall exhausting working situation was repeatedly mentioned. CONCLUSION: A COVID outbreak within the care-intense geriatric context is challenging to control especially among HCP. Longer patient contacts and limited compliance by patients counteracts strict hygiene measures. Vulnerability of HCP and patients requires additional preventive interventions by rapidly effective vaccinations and has to be a priority for health policy.","Raichle, Claudia; Schäfer, Johannes; Gann, Annette; Warth, Elisa; Slesak, Günther",Z Gerontol Geriatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01930-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228187/,180

METHODS: The committee for ASRS Best Practices for Retinal Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic reviewed existing evidence and information on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and risk factors during vitreoretinal surgery. Recommendations were based on best available published data, cumulative clinical experiences, and recommendations and policies from other organizations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the strength of recommendations and confidence in the evidence. These serve as interim recommendations which are routinely updated given gaps of knowledge and lack of high-quality data on this evolving subject. RESULTS: Relevant existing literature related to methods of transmission, and ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The data and clinical experiences driving recommendations for pre-operative, intraoperative and post-operative surgical considerations, anesthesia choice, as well as considerations for intravitreal injections are provided. CONCLUSION: Recommendations are provided with the goal of protecting vitreoretinal surgeons and associated personnel from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during interventional vitreoretinal procedures. This is a rapidly evolving topic with numerous remaining gaps in our current knowledge. As such, recommendations will evolve and the current manuscript is intended to serve as a foundation for continued dialogue on best practices.","Chao, D. L.; Sridhar, J.; Kuriyan, A.

618968,Dr. Loades and Prof. Reynolds Reply,2020-09-02,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults with COVID-19 have disproportionately higher rates of severe disease and mortality. It is unclear whether this is attributable to age or attendant age-associated risk factors. This retrospective cohort study aims to characterize hospitalized older adults and examine if comorbidities, frailty and acuity of clinical presentation exert an age-independent effect on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We studied 275 patients admitted to the National Centre of Infectious Disease, Singapore. We measured: 1)Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI) as burden of comorbidities; 2)Clinical Frailty Scale(CFS) and Frailty Index(FI); and 3)initial acuity. We studied characteristics and outcomes of critical illness, stratified by age groups (50–59,60–69 and ≥70). We conducted hierarchical logistic regression in primary model(N = 262, excluding direct admissions to intensive care unit) and sensitivity analysis(N = 275): age and gender in base model, entering CCI, frailty (CFS or FI) and initial acuity sequentially. RESULTS: The ≥70 age group had highest CCI(p<.001), FI(p<.001) and CFS(p<.001), and prevalence of geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy,53.5%; urinary symptoms,37.5%; chronic pain,23.3% and malnutrition,23.3%). Thirty-two (11.6%) developed critical illness. In the primary regression model, age was not predictive for critical illness when a frailty predictor was added. Significant predictors in the final model (AUC 0.809) included male gender (p=.012), CFS (p=.038), and high initial acuity (p=.021) but not CCI or FI. In sensitivity analysis, FI (p=.028) but not CFS was significant. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized older adults with COVID-19, geriatric syndromes are not uncommon. Acuity of clinical presentation and frailty are important age-independent predictors of disease severity. CFS and FI provide complimentary information in predicting interval disease progression and rapid disease progression respectively.","Lim, Jun Pei; Low, Kristabella Yu Han; Lin, Nicole Jia Jing; Lim, Celestine Zi Qian; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Tan, Wilnard Y.T.; Tay, Woo Chiao; Tan, Huei Nuo; Young, Barnaby Edward; Lye, David Chien Boon; Lim, Wee Shiong",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167494320303277; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167494320303277; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2020.104331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476755/,180

While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7 were shortlisted for validation. We show for the first time that the active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol, exhibits significant potent activity against SARS-CoV-2. This finding paves the way for consideration of host-directed therapies for ring prophylaxis of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Mok, Chee Keng; Ng, Yan Ling; Ahidjo, Bintou Ahmadou; Hua Lee, Regina Ching; Choy Loe, Marcus Wing; Liu, Jing; Tan, Kai Sen; Kaur, Parveen; Chng, Wee Joo; Wong, John Eu-Li; Wang, De Yun; Hao, Erwei; Hou, Xiaotao; Tan, Yong Wah; Mak, Tze Minn; Lin, Cui; Lin, Raymond; Tambyah, Paul; Deng, JiaGang; Hann Chu, Justin Jang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396,180
620669,Can we prepare healthcare professionals and students for involvement in stressful healthcare events? A mixed-methods evaluation of a resilience training intervention,2020-11-27,"Abstract Neurotropic viruses are important causes of morbidity and mortality in human populations. Some of these viruses preferentially infect oligodendrocytes in the white matter, causing either direct lysis of infected cells, or more commonly myelin damage as a consequence of the host immune response to the virus. Virus-induced demyelination has similarities to the human disease multiple sclerosis. To study this disease process in experimental animals, mice are infected, most commonly, with neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, a picornavirus. While the diseases caused by these two viruses differ in some aspects, in both cases demyelination is a major consequence of the infection. As in autoimmune disease, therapeutic interventions that diminish an overactive immune response would be useful. However, unlike autoimmune disease, complete suppression would result in unchecked virus replication, generally leading to more severe disease. Here we discuss two approaches that dampen but do not fully suppress the host immune response. Regulatory T cells, especially those that are specific for antigens recognized by pathogenic T cells, and IL-10 are two anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution factors that demonstrate efficacy in experimental models of virus-induced demyelination and may be useful in patients infected with viruses that cause demyelination.","Perlman, Stanley; Zhao, Jingxian",Journal of Neuroimmunology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572816304325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28065579/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572816304325,180

622850,Improving Mood Through Community Connection and Resources Using an Interactive Digital Platform: Development and Usability Study,2021-02-26,"PURPOSE: Reinnervation of chronically denervated muscle is clinically unpredictable and poorly understood. Current operative strategies include either direct nerve repair, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, or neurotization. The goal of this study is to compare muscle recovery using microneural repair versus neurotization in a rat model of chronic denervation. METHODS: Fifty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats had surgical denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle by transecting the common peroneal nerve. After 0, 8, 12, or 22 weeks of denervation, animals were assigned to either a direct repair or a neurotization cohort. An additional 7 animals were used for a sham cohort, and 7 of the 58 were used as controls. After a 12-week recovery period, animals had contractile strength and EMG testing of the tibialis anterior muscle. Peak force and characteristics were compared to the unoperated, contralateral limb. Tibialis anterior muscles were then harvested for mass and histologic evaluation. RESULTS: Sixty-two animals completed testing. Denervated controls demonstrated a significant decrease in muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor nerve conduction amplitude compared to sham animals. In all groups, chronicity of denervation adversely affected functional recovery. On average, repair animals performed better than neurotization animals with respect to muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor amplitude. Differences in contractile force, however, were significant only at the 0 week denervation group (94% ± 30 vs 50% ± 20, repair vs neurotization). Neurotized muscles processed for histologic analysis demonstrated acetylcholinesterase activity at the nerve-muscle interface, confirming the formation of motor end plates de novo. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that neurotization is capable of reinnervating de novo end plates in chronically denervated muscle. Our data do not support the hypothesis that direct muscle neurotization is superior to nerve repair for functional restoration of chronically denervated muscle. However, as the duration of denervation increases, the difference between outcomes of the neurotization and repair group narrows, suggesting that neurotization may offer a viable surgical alternative in the setting of prolonged denervation.","Swanson, Andrew N.; Wolfe, Scott W.; Khazzam, Michael; Feinberg, Joseph; Ehteshami, John; Doty, Stephen",J Hand Surg Am,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.02.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363502308002232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18762103/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0363502308002232,180
623455,Social determinants of mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation. However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer–BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines. METHODS: Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK. The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT. The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 0·63. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139. FINDINGS: Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. The mean age of participants was 57·8 years (SD 4·7), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities. At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5% CI 7·5 to ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 0·51 (one-sided 97·5% CI 0·43 to ∞). Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation. INTERPRETATION: Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.

Our purpose was to determine if the administration of both allergen and protective vaccines during one visit is safe and if such a procedure does not deteriorate the tolerance of both vaccines. As current guidelines are based on theoretical assumptions, our aim was to establish the safety and tolerance of shortening the recommended interval between vaccinations. During two influenza seasons, 44 adult patients, with a history of systemic allergic reactions after a Hymenoptera sting, underwent 58 simultaneous allergen and seasonal influenza vaccinations (study group) while in the maintenance phase of venom immunotherapy (VIT). The control group consisted of 57 healthy adults who were vaccinated against influenza only. The conditions of the patients were monitored during hospital visits, and via telecommunication methods to evaluate the safety and tolerance of the procedure. Within the study group, there were no immediate or delayed allergic reactions after vaccinations. The presence of common, adverse influenza vaccine reactions among study group patients (29%) and control group patients (32%) did not differ significantly (p = 0.841). We did not observe a difference in the frequency of various adverse reactions in either group or a dependence of previous vaccinations against influenza on the occurrence of adverse reactions. The most frequent occurrences were local adverse reactions. All adverse reactions were resolved without treatment. These findings demonstrate the safety and tolerance of an influenza vaccination and Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy administration during one visit.","Czerwińska, Ewa; Nittner-Marszalska, Marita; Pawłowicz, Robert; Szenborn, Leszek",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918358/,180

We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others.

A significant number of patients develop persistent kidney damage defined as Acute Kidney Disease (AKD). There is a lack of evidence on the real impact of AKD on COVID-19 patients. We aim to identify risk factors for the development of AKD and its impact on mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients with AKI admitted at the Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte between March and August of 2020. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification was used to define AKI. AKD was defined by presenting at least KDIGO Stage 1 criteria for >7 days after an AKI initiating event. Results: In 339 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 25.7% patients developed AKD (n = 87). The mean age was 71.7 ± 17.0 years, baseline SCr was 1.03 ± 0.44 mg/dL, and the majority of patients were classified as KDIGO stage 3 AKI (54.3%). The in-hospital mortality was 18.0% (n = 61). Presence of hypertension (p = 0.006), CKD (p < 0.001), lower hemoglobin (p = 0.034) and lower CRP (p = 0.004) at the hospital admission and nephrotoxin exposure (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for the development of AKD. Older age (p = 0.003), higher serum ferritin at admission (p = 0.008) and development of AKD (p = 0.029) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19-AKI patients. Conclusions: AKD was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in this population of COVID-19-AKI patients. Considering the significant risk of mortality in AKI patients, it is of paramount importance to identify the subset of higher risk patients.","Marques, Filipe; Gameiro, Joana; Oliveira, João; Fonseca, José Agapito; Duarte, Inês; Bernardo, João; Branco, Carolina; Costa, Claúdia; Carreiro, Carolina; Braz, Sandra; Lopes, José António",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640618/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194599,180

627693,The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by police during a public health crisis: An experimental test of public perception,2021-01-09,"Transpulmonary driving pressure (DP(L)) corresponds to the cyclical stress imposed on the lung parenchyma during tidal breathing and, therefore, can be used to assess the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Its measurement at the bedside requires the use of esophageal pressure (Peso), which is sometimes technically challenging. Recently, it has been demonstrated how in an animal model of ARDS, the transpulmonary pressure (P(L)) measured with Peso calculated with the absolute values method (P(L) = Paw—Peso) is equivalent to the transpulmonary pressure directly measured using pleural sensors in the central-dependent part of the lung. We hypothesized that, since the P(L) derived from Peso reflects the regional behavior of the lung, it could exist a relationship between regional parameters measured by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and driving P(L) (DP(L)). Moreover, we explored if, by integrating airways pressure data and EIT data, it could be possible to estimate non-invasively DP(L) and consequently lung elastance (EL) and elastance-derived inspiratory P(L) (PI). We analyzed 59 measurements from 20 patients with ARDS. There was a significant intra-patient correlation between EIT derived regional compliance in regions of interest (ROI1) (r = 0.5, p = 0.001), ROI2 (r = −0.68, p < 0.001), and ROI3 (r = −0.4, p = 0.002), and DP(L). A multiple linear regression successfully predicted DP(L) based on respiratory system elastance (Ers), ideal body weight (IBW), roi1%, roi2%, and roi3% (R(2) = 0.84, p < 0.001). The corresponding Bland-Altmann analysis showed a bias of −1.4e-007 cmH(2)O and limits of agreement (LoA) of −2.4–2.4 cmH(2)O. EL and PI calculated using EIT showed good agreement (R(2) = 0.89, p < 0.001 and R(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001) with the esophageal derived correspondent variables. In conclusion, DP(L) has a good correlation with EIT-derived parameters in the central lung. DP(L), PI, and EL can be estimated with good accuracy non-invasively combining information coming from EIT and airway pressure.","Scaramuzzo, Gaetano; Spadaro, Savino; Spinelli, Elena; Waldmann, Andreas D.; Bohm, Stephan H.; Ottaviani, Irene; Montanaro, Federica; Gamberini, Lorenzo; Marangoni, Elisabetta; Mauri, Tommaso; Volta, Carlo Alberto",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349666/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.693736,180

Methods: A survey was distributed using social media and organizational emails to Brazilian active healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. We explored potential associated factors including age, gender, occupation, workplace, work hours, income, previous infection with COVID-19, recent/current contact with COVID-19 patients, regional number of incident deaths due to COVID-19, anxiety, and burnout. We evaluated new-onset or previous insomnia worsening (primary outcome), sleep quality, and duration (secondary outcomes). Results: A total of 4,384 health professionals from all regions of the country were included in the analysis (mean age: 44{+/-}12 years, 76% females, 53.8% physicians). Overall, 55.7% were assisting patients with COVID-19, and 9.2% had a previous COVID-19 infection. New-onset insomnia symptoms or previous insomnia worsening occurred in 41.4% of respondents in parallel to 13% (n=572) new pharmacological treatments for insomnia. Prevalent anxiety and burnout during the pandemic were observed in 44.2% and 21% of participants, respectively.

We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which new variant B.1.1.7 became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.","Pietzonka, P.; Brorson, E.; Bankes, W.; Cates, M.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as necessary cell entry point for SARS‐CoV‐2. Previous animal studies have demonstrated an increased ACE2 expression following treatment with either angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) that have led to a massive precariousness regarding the optimal cardiovascular therapy during this pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have measured ACE2 mRNA expression using real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in atrial biopsies of 81 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and we compared 62 patients that received ACEi/ARB vs. 19 patients that were not ACEi/ARB‐treated. We found atrial ACE2 mRNA expression to be significantly increased in patients treated with an ACEi or an ARB, independent of potential confounding comorbidities. Interestingly, the cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression correlated significantly with the expression in white blood cells of 22 patients encouraging further evaluation if the latter may be used as a surrogate for the former. Similarly, analysis of 18 ventricular biopsies revealed a significant and independent increase in ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with end‐stage heart failure that were treated with ACEi/ARB. On the other hand, cardiac unloading with a left ventricular assist device significantly reduced ventricular ACE2 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ACEi/ARB is independently associated with an increased myocardial ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with end‐stage heart failure. Further trials are needed to test whether this association is deleterious for patients with COVID‐19, or possibly protective. Nevertheless, haemodynamic factors seem to be equally important for regulation of cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression.","Lebek, Simon; Tafelmeier, Maria; Messmann, Rebecca; Provaznik, Zdenek; Schmid, Christof; Maier, Lars S.; Birner, Christoph; Arzt, Michael; Wagner, Stefan",Eur J Heart Fail,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017071/,180

We propose a new fully automated deep learning framework for quantification and differentiation between lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia from both contrast and non-contrast CT images using convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Utilizing the expert annotations, model training was performed using 5-fold cross-validation to segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and automatic segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score coefficient of 0.876 ± 0.005; excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. In the external validation set of 67 patients, there was dice score coefficient of 0.767 ± 0.009 as well as excellent correlations of 0.989 and 0.996 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. Computations for a CT scan comprising 120 slices were performed under 2 seconds on a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Titan RTX graphics processing unit.

636668,COVID‐19: implications for paediatric dental care in the hospital setting,2020-09-22,"AIM: By October 6, 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed worldwide, reaching 3,355,7427 people and 1,037,862 deaths. Detection of COVID-19 and pneumonia by the chest X-ray images is of great significance to control the development of the epidemic situation. The current COVID-19 and pneumonia detection system may suffer from two shortcomings: the selection of hyperparameters in the models is not appropriate, and the generalization ability of the model is poor. METHOD: To solve the above problems, our team proposed an improved intelligent global optimization algorithm, which is based on the biogeography-based optimization to automatically optimize the hyperparameters value of the models according to different detection objectives. In the optimization progress, after selecting the immigration of suitable index vector and the emigration of suitable index vector, we proposed adding a comparison operation to compare the value of them. According to the different numerical relationships between them, the corresponding operations are performed to improve the migration operation of biogeography-based optimization. The improved algorithm (momentum factor biogeography-based optimization) can better perform the automatic optimization operation. In addition, our team also proposed two frameworks: biogeography convolutional neural network and momentum factor biogeography convolutional neural network. And two methods for detection COVID-19 based on the proposed frameworks. RESULTS: Our method used three convolutional neural networks (LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18) as the basic classification models for chest X-ray images detection of COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia. The accuracy of LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 is improved by 1.56%, 1.48%, and 0.73% after using biogeography-based optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. The accuracy of LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 is improved by 2.87%, 6.31%, and 1.46% after using the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. CONCLUSION: Under the same experimental conditions, the performance of the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization is superior to the biogeography-based optimization in optimizing the hyperparameters of the convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization can improve the detection performance of the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of overall accuracy. In future research, we will continue to use and improve other global optimization algorithms to enhance the application ability of deep learning in medical pathological image detection.","Sun, Junding; Li, Xiang; Tang, Chaosheng; Wang, Shui-Hua; Zhang, Yu-Dong",Knowl Based Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539094/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107494; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705121007565; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705121007565?v=s5,180

Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. We explore the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system through a case study of the YKFM. METHODS: In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The evaluation included an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, a vendor survey and interviews were deferred. Data collected from the two patron surveys, alongside researcher observations, available literature, public announcements, and informal email and phone discussions, inform the discussion. RESULTS: For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online; instead, they proposed and implemented a “Shop, don’t stop” market. Informal conversations suggested the small scale of the market and technology challenges were perceived barriers to moving online. The physically-distanced market was well-attended and featured in local media. CONCLUSIONS: NWT food strategies rely on farmers markets to nurture a local food system. Data suggest a potential incongruence between an online model and important market characteristics such as the event-like atmosphere. Available literature suggests online markets can support local food by facilitating purchasing and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. The decision not to move online for the YKFM reflects market patron characteristics and current food context in Yellowknife and the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.","Radcliffe, Josalyn; Skinner, Kelly; Spring, Andrew; Picard, Lise; Benoit, France; Dodd, Warren",Nutr J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12937-021-00664-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514376/,180

The target glycemic control is FPG ~ 5.0 mmol/dl (90 mg/dl) and 2 h PPPG ~ 6.7 mmol/dl (120 mg/dl). The goal is to obtain newborns birth weight appropriate for gestational age between 2.5 and 3.5 kg, a step to prevent offspring developing diabetes. CONCLUSION: The essential precaution required during COVID pandemic is to wear face mask, avoid crowded places, and maintain social distancing. Finally, the economical and evidence based “single test procedure” of DIPSI is most appropriate for screening during the COVID pandemic.","Seshiah, Veeraswamy; Balaji, Vijayam; Banerjee, Samar; Sahay, Rakesh; Divakar, Hema; Jain, Rajesh; Chawla, Rajeev; Das, Ashok Kumar; Gupta, Sunil; Krishnan, Dharani",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13410-020-00860-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929316/,180
641782,Febrile neutropenia in paediatric oncology,2020-01-24,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory tract infection is the most frequent cause of acute cough and is reported at onset in about one third of patients with chronic cough. Persistent infection is therefore one possible explanation for the cough reflex hypersensitivity and pulmonary inflammation reported in chronic cough patients. METHODS: Bronchoscopic endobronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts were obtained from ten healthy volunteers and twenty treatment resistant chronic cough patients (10 selected for lavage lymphocytosis). A screen for known respiratory pathogens was performed on biopsy tissue. Chronic cough patients also underwent cough reflex sensitivity testing using citric acid. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in incidence of infection between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients (p = 0.115) or non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic groups (p = 0.404). BAL cell percentages were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients without lymphocytosis. Lymphocytic patients however had a significantly raised percentage of lymphocytes (p < 0.01), neutrophils (p < 0.05), eosinophils (p < 0.05) and decreased macrophages (p < 0.001) verses healthy volunteers. There was no significant difference in the cough reflex sensitivity between non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic patients (p = 0.536). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates latent infection in the lung is unlikely to play an important role in chronic cough, but a role for undetected or undetectable pathogens in either the lung or a distal site could not be ruled out.

Therefore, expanding efforts that address the food environment and incorporate behavioral nudges through community-developed marketing strategies may be a viable mechanism to improve food and beverage choices within this unique population. This study installed shelf-wobblers across n = 5 gas stations in one rural Appalachian county in Kentucky. Smart Snacks were identified from store inventory lists utilizing the CDC Food Service Guideline for Federal Facilities calculator and were categorized into high-protein snacks, low-fat carbohydrate snacks, meal replacement snacks, and no-calorie beverages. NEMS-CS audits were conducted, and monthly sales data was collected at baseline and for six months thereafter for each store location. A difference-in-difference model was used, adjusting for total sales or total mean sales for each Smart Snack model to assess the percentage change within and between stores. Overall, percent change in mean sales and total sales across all stores resulted in a percentage increase of sales of Smart Snack items following wobbler installment.

There is controversy around which modalities account for the best microsurgical training. In this study, we aim to provide a systematic literature review of the practical modalities in microsurgery training and compare the living and nonliving models, emphasizing the superiority of the former. We introduce the concept of non-technical skill acquisition in microsurgical training with the use of living laboratory animals in the context of a novel proposed curriculum. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed/Medline and Scopus within the past 11 years based on a combination of the following keywords: “microsurgery,” “training,” “skills,” and “models.” The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. A total of 101 papers was identified as relevant to our study. The protocol was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Living models offer the chance to develop both technical and non-technical competencies (i.e., leadership, situation awareness, decision-making, communication, and teamwork). Prior experience with ex vivo tissues helps residents consolidate basic skills prior to performing more advanced techniques in the living tissues. Trainees reported a higher satisfaction rate with the living models. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of living and nonliving training microsurgical models leads to superior results; however, the gold standard remains the living model. The validity of the hypothesis that living models enhance non-technical skills remains to be confirmed.

Of the 181 records identified, 33 met the inclusion criteria, which generally had a fair risk of overall bias. In the included, 28 studies focused on the impact of the COVID-19 virus on tinnitus and 5 studies focused on the impact of the pandemic on tinnitus. From the studies identifying the impact of COVID-19 on tinnitus, there were 17 cross-sectional studies (n = 8913) and 11 case series or case report studies (n = 35). There were 2 cross-sectional studies (n = 3232) and 3 pre-post-test design studies (n = 326) focusing on the impact of the pandemic on tinnitus. No consistent patterns were found regarding the presentation of the tinnitus or additional factors that could have tinnitus developing in the disease impact studies. For the pandemic impact studies, the associated stress and anxiety of the pandemic were consistently suggested to contribute to tinnitus experiences. The pooled estimated prevalence of tinnitus post COVID-19 was 8% (CI: 5 to 13%).

We state that collaboration between humans and robots is fostered by two cognitive skills: intention reading and trust. An agent possessing these abilities would be able to infer the non-verbal intentions of others and to evaluate how likely they are to achieve their goals, jointly understanding what kind and which degree of collaboration they require. For this reason, we propose a developmental artificial cognitive architecture that integrates unsupervised machine learning and probabilistic models to imbue a humanoid robot with intention reading and trusting capabilities. Our experimental results show that the synergistic implementation of these cognitive skills enable the robot to cooperate in a meaningful way, with the intention reading model allowing a correct goal prediction and with the trust component enhancing the likelihood of a positive outcome for the task.","Vinanzi, Samuele; Cangelosi, Angelo; Goerick, Christian",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659886/,180

The underlying reasons and mechanisms for this relative protection are not established. However both genetic and environmental factors might play a role. Polymorphisms in ACE2 gene, ACE gene and in genes for some of the host cell proteases could affect the viral entry and replication. There is some evidence that HLA polymorphisms and several pathways involved in immune and inflammatory response could contribute to ethnic variation. Cross immunity because of past exposure to viral infections as well as malaria is likely to protect from the severe manifestations of disease. Role of BCG vaccination in trained innate immunity is recognised and could be a protective factor against COVID-19. There is limited evidence of the possibility of a less virulent viral strain circulating in South Asia. There is evidence from different parts of the world that temperature and humidity can influence viral survival as well as the host immune response.

We included women managed in our ART unit for fertility issues by in vitro fecundation / intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), fertility preservation (FP), frozen embryo transfer (ET) or artificial insemination (AI) and with an AMH test performed within 12 months preceding ART treatment. All the women underwent a COVID rapid detection test (RDT) and we compared AMH levels between those who tested positive (RDT+) and those who tested negative (RDT-). Results The study population consisted of 118 women, 11.7% (14/118) of whom were COVID RDT+. None of the tested women presented with a history of severe COVID-19 infection.

Although some studies have suggested a higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods, and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that NP swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is small, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference.

These drivers of health are integral in contextualizing the understanding and prevention of sport and recreation injury (SRI), and recognizing their impact is necessary to provide a complete and accurate picture of health and health outcomes related to injury. MAIN: Reducing disparities and achieving equity in sports and recreation is possible in part by improving data collection methodologies and utilization. Often, many SDOH have considerable effect on SRI. Although SRI epidemiology frequently examines differences by sex, there is limited inclusion of factors such as socioeconomic status, housing, gender, and food security, in sport specific data sources or in analysis of sport recreation and injury using other sources (e.g. administrative data). The ongoing dual epidemics in the United States – racism and COVID-19 – have emphasized the importance of having and utilizing SDOH data to reduce the burden of injury and disproportionate effects on our diverse population. CONCLUSION: Moving forward, to address disparities in SRI, SDOH must be included as a part of research priorities, health related goals, and policies. This difference can be made in developing consistency in data collection and utilization. This will provide an accurate picture of the intersections and interdisciplinary changes required to design the best approach to problems to develop solutions.

The mediating links with coping strategy and anxiety among Chinese college students in a cross-sectional study of COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-02,"During a disease outbreak, healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to treat infected individuals. However, these HCWs are themselves susceptible to contracting the disease. As more HCWs get infected, fewer are available to provide care for others, and the overall quality of care available to infected individuals declines. This depletion of HCWs may contribute to the epidemic's severity. To examine this issue, we explicitly model declining quality of care in four differential equation-based susceptible, infected and recovered-type models with vaccination. We assume that vaccination, recovery and survival rates are affected by quality of care delivered. We show that explicitly modelling HCWs and accounting for declining quality of care significantly alters model-predicted disease outcomes, specifically case counts and mortality. Models neglecting the decline of quality of care resulting from infection of HCWs may significantly under-estimate cases and mortality. These models may be useful to inform health policy that may differ for HCWs and the general population. Models accounting for declining quality of care may therefore improve the management interventions considered to mitigate the effects of a future outbreak.","Phadke, I.; McKee, A.; Conway, J.M.; Shea, K.",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268821000297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551007/,180

OBJECTIVE: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people’s acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. METHOD: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). RESULTS: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults’ compliance with protective measures over time.

There is statistical significance for those less likely to travel when commuters are employed, self-employed or students compared to unemployed, earning PHP 10,000 or less compared to those earning above PHP 50,000, in a household size of 10 compared to all other household sizes, and those with college degree against elementary or no formal education. By determining the travel behavior of commuters when they have ample time to adjust to the new normal, their mobility needs can be best understood and consequently satisfied. Interventions in fulfilling the travel needs for those belonging to socio-demographic groups that are highly affected by the pandemic, such as the working class, blue-collar workers, and have limited financial capabilities, can also be developed when a similar outbreak in the future is imminent.","Mayo, Francis L.; Maglasang, Renan S.; Moridpour, Sara; Taboada, Evelyn B.",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221001664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541487/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100461; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221001664?v=s5,180
661724,Implementation of a novel three-tier triage tool in Papua New Guinea: A model for resource-limited emergency departments,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: Carceral facilities are epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing incarcerated people at an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection. Due to the initial limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, all states have developed allocation plans that outline a phased distribution. This study uses document analysis to compare the relative prioritization of incarcerated people, correctional staff, and other groups at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and morbidity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a document analysis of the vaccine dissemination plans of all 50 US states and the District of Columbia using a triple-coding method. Documents included state COVID-19 vaccination plans and supplemental materials on vaccine prioritization from state health department websites as of December 31, 2020. We found that 22% of states prioritized incarcerated people in Phase 1, 29% of states in Phase 2, and 2% in Phase 3, while 47% of states did not explicitly specify in which phase people who are incarcerated will be eligible for vaccination. Incarcerated people were consistently not prioritized in Phase 1, while other vulnerable groups who shared similar environmental risk received this early prioritization. States’ plans prioritized in Phase 1: prison and jail workers (49%), law enforcement (63%), seniors (65+ years, 59%), and long-term care facility residents (100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that states’ COVID-19 vaccine allocation plans do not prioritize incarcerated people and provide little to no guidance on vaccination protocols if they fall under other high-risk categories that receive earlier priority. Deprioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination misses a crucial opportunity for COVID-19 mitigation. It also raises ethical and equity concerns. As states move forward with their vaccine distribution, further work must be done to prioritize ethical allocation and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to incarcerated people.","Strodel, Rachel; Dayton, Lauren; Garrison-Desany, Henri M.; Eber, Gabriel; Beyrer, Chris; Arscott, Joyell; Rubenstein, Leonard; Sufrin, Carolyn",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129620/,180

OBJECTIVES: This pilot study evaluates the impact of the Oncology Nursing Society's Get Up, Get Moving program, a personalized, home-based, nurse-led physical activity coaching program. METHODS: Patients with cancer in the intervention and control groups completed the SF-36® and the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire at weeks 1 and 12. All patients were initially counseled on exercise. A nurse called each member of the intervention group weekly to encourage physical activity and asked about fatigue, nausea, and step count. The control group was contacted at 6 weeks and 12 weeks only. FINDINGS: The program, coupled with nurse telephone calls, increased steps, decreased fatigue, and maintained health-related quality of life among patients in the intervention group. The control group had a decrease in steps, a decline in their SF-36 general health score, and an increase in fatigue.

669225,The effect of cognition and affect on preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in China,2021-04-14,"Countries across the world imposed lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been proposed that lockdown conditions, including social and physical distancing measures, may disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain and require rapid adaptation to treatment and care strategies. Using an online methodology, we investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N = 431) relative to a healthy control group (N = 88). Data were collected during the most stringent period of lockdown in the United Kingdom (mid-April to early-May 2020). In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised lockdown-related increases in pain and psychological distress, which would be mediated by levels of pain catastrophising. Responses indicated that people with chronic pain perceived increased pain severity, compared to their estimation of typical pain levels prior to lockdown (p < .001). They were also more adversely affected by lockdown conditions compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater self-perceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise (p ⩽ .001). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that pain catastrophising was an important factor relating to the extent of self-perceived increases in pain severity during lockdown (β = .27, p < .001) and also mediated the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also related to perceptions of increased pain (β = .15, p < .001). Interestingly, levels of pain intensity (measured at two time points at pre and during lockdown) in a subgroup (N = 85) did not demonstrate a significant change. However, individuals in this subgroup still reported self-perceived pain increases during lockdown, which were also predicted by baseline levels of pain catastrophising. Overall, the findings indicate that people with chronic pain suffer adverse effects of lockdown including self-perceived increases in their pain. Remote pain management provision to target reduction of pain catastrophising and increase health behaviours including physical activity could be beneficial for this vulnerable population.","Fallon, Nicholas; Brown, Christopher; Twiddy, Hannah; Brian, Eleanor; Frank, Bernhard; Nurmikko, Turo; Stancak, Andrej",Br J Pain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377461/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463720973703,180

671281,"Next generation Europe: a recovery plan for children, adolescents and their families: For the time after the pandemic, we need a vision and investments for the future",2021-04-10,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely used to determine future demand for power in the short, medium, and long terms. However, research has identified that ANNs could cause inaccurate predictions of load when used for long-term forecasting. This inaccuracy is attributed to insufficient training data and increased accumulated errors, especially in long-term estimations. This study develops an improved ANN model with an Adaptive Backpropagation Algorithm (ABPA) for best practice in the forecasting long-term load demand of electricity. The ABPA includes proposing new forecasting formulations that adjust/adapt forecast values, so it takes into consideration the deviation between trained and future input datasets' different behaviours. The architecture of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, along with its traditional Backpropagation Algorithm (BPA), is used as a baseline for the proposed development. The forecasting formula is further improved by introducing adjustment factors to smooth out behavioural differences between the trained and new/future datasets. A computational study based on actual monthly electricity consumption inputs from 2011 to 2020, provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity, is conducted to verify the proposed adaptive algorithm's performance. Different types of energy consumption and the electricity cut period (unsatisfied demand) factor are also considered in this study as vital factors. The developed ANN model, including its proposed ABPA, is then compared with traditional and popular prediction techniques such as regression and other advanced machine learning approaches, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to justify its superiority amongst them. The results reveal that the most accurate long-term forecasts with the minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values of (1.195.650) and (0.045), respectively, are successfully achieved by applying the proposed ABPA. It can be concluded that the proposed ABPA, including the adjustment factor, enables traditional ANN techniques to be efficiently used for long-term forecasting of electricity load demand.","Mohammed, Nooriya A.; Al-Bazi, Ammar",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393381/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06384-x,180

However, clinical research on its neurological manifestations is thus far limited. In this study, we aimed to systematically collect and investigate the clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in COVID-19. METHODS: Three medical (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and two preprints (BioRxiv and MedRxiv) databases were systematically searched for all published articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 since the outbreak. All included studies were systematically reviewed, and selected clinical data were collected for meta-analysis via random-effects. RESULTS: A total of 41 articles were eligible and included in this review, showing a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. The meta-analysis for unspecific neurological symptoms revealed that the most common manifestations were fatigue (33.2% [23.1–43.3]), anorexia (30.0% [23.2–36.9]), dyspnea/shortness of breath (26.9% [19.2–34.6]), and malaise (26.7% [13.3–40.1]). The common specific neurological symptoms included olfactory (35.7–85.6%) and gustatory (33.3–88.8%) disorders, especially in mild cases. Guillain–Barré syndrome and acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and meninges were repeatedly reported after COVID-19. Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological, and pathological evidence supported neurologic involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations are various and prevalent in COVID-19. Emerging clinical evidence suggests neurological involvement is an important aspect of the disease. The underlying mechanisms can include both direct invasion and maladaptive inflammatory responses.

Emerging evidence suggests that music groups, such as choirs, enhance mental health via group identification and the satisfaction of various psychological needs; however, more research is required to understand these processes in other types of music groups. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions in 2020 prevented music groups from meeting face to face (F2F). Some music groups adapted virtually, but the rate of adaptation of various music activities is unknown, as is the impact of such adaptations on participants’ group identification, psychological need satisfaction, and mental health. We explored these questions using a cross-sectional survey with 257 participants (M(age) = 46 years, 78% female) of singing (n = 172), instrumental (n = 48), and dance groups (n = 37). Participants rated group identification and psychological needs satisfaction retrospectively for their music group in F2F mode and then for the group in adapted mode, along with mental health 12-item short form health survey (SF-12). Results showed that instrumental groups (60%) were less commonly adapted to virtual mode than singing (83%) and dance (86%) groups. Group identification and average psychological needs satisfaction (M = 4.04 and 3.50 out of 5) scores were significantly lower for groups in virtual mode than in F2F mode (M = 4.53 and 4.14, respectively). Psychological needs satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between group identification and SF-12 mental health. Despite this, values on group identification and psychological need satisfaction remained high, which suggests that virtual music groups may be beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic and in contexts where F2F groups are less accessible.","Draper, Grace; Dingle, Genevieve A.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149530/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646292,180

However, the treatment options received by patients with different classifications are different, and previous studies have not discussed the differences in specific coagulation parameters between patients with mild, severe, and critically ill COVID-19. Aim:To investigate the change in coagulation function and the incidence of low limb venous thromboembolic events in mild/severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods:A retrospective analysis of coagulation parameters and lower extremity venous ultrasound examination results in 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University. We discussed the occurrence of vascular complications in patients with normal, severe and critically ill patients Rate and explore the nature of such vascular events. The anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis and patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Approval was obtained from the local institutional review board and all procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Results:The incidence of low limb venous thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients included in the study was 28.6% (22/77). A total of 22 cases with deep vein thrombosis, 13 of whom with multiple thrombosis events, and 9 cases with independent distal deep vein thrombosis.

There were 4 cases (50%) and 9 cases (64.29%) of severe and critically ill patients with multiple deep vein thrombosis events, respectively. There was no difference in age and gender between patients with lower extremity venous thrombosis and those without. The mortality rate of patients with thrombotic events has an upward trend; the mortality rate of patients with thrombosis is 18.18%, and the mortality rate of patients without thrombosis is 3.64%. Compared with mild patients, white blood cell counts, neutrophil percentage, fibrinogen, IL-6, IL-10 serum levels are higher in severe and critically ill patients.

SARS-CoV mainly infects tissues of non-lymphatic origin, and the cytokine profile of those cells can determine the course of disease. Here, we investigated the cytokine response of two human non-lymphatic cell lines, Caco-2 and HEK 293, which are fully permissive for SARS-CoV. RESULTS: A comparison with established cytokine-inducing viruses revealed that SARS-CoV only weakly triggered a cytokine response. In particular, SARS-CoV did not activate significant transcription of the interferons IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2/3, as well as of the interferon-induced antiviral genes ISG56 and MxA, the chemokine RANTES and the interleukine IL-6. Interestingly, however, SARS-CoV strongly induced the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 in the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2, but not in the embryonic kidney cell line 293. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV suppresses the antiviral cytokine system of non-immune cells to a large extent, thus buying time for dissemination in the host. However, synthesis of IP-10 and IL-8, which are established markers for acute-stage SARS, escapes the virus-induced silencing at least in some cell types. Therefore, the progressive infiltration of immune cells into the infected lungs observed in SARS patients could be due to the production of these chemokines by the infected tissue cells.","Spiegel, Martin; Weber, Friedemann",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571117/,180

Eosinophils have been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of virus‐induced asthma exacerbations. To determine how often asthma exacerbation is caused by virus infections and to examine the relationship between eosinophilia and asthma episode, we investigated 64 children who experienced asthma attacks between October 1999 and March 2000. We used rapid enzyme immunoassays to detect antigens of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus, and adenovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) of these children, and enumerated eosinophils in the blood and NPS. We detected RSV in 27% and influenza A virus in 17% of the patients. No adenovirus infection or RSV/influenza A co‐infection was detected. RSV‐infected children were younger (3.85 ± 0.83 years old) than influenza A virus‐infected patients (5.23 ± 1.34 years old). Eighty‐two per cent of patients in the RSV group and 36% of patients in the influenza A virus group had moderate‐to‐severe asthma episodes (p < 0.05). In RSV‐infected children, the eosinophil counts in NPS were higher in the ‘severe’ group, and younger patients had a greater number of eosinophils in their NPS than older patients (p < 0.05). These trends were not found in influenza A virus patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that, compared with influenza A virus‐induced asthma attacks, RSV infection had a higher probability of being associated with asthma exacerbation in infants and younger children and induced attacks of greater severity. The increase in the number of eosinophils in the NPS of RSV‐infected children may be responsible, in part, for these differences.","Zhao, Jing; Takamura, Mayumi; Yamaoka, Akiko; Odajima, Yasuhei; Iikura, Yoji",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12000498/,180

686907,"Vaccine Information Seeking Behavior Among Pregnant Women in Khartoum State, Sudan: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study",2021-06-25,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal endotracheal intubation is an essential but potentially destabilising procedure. With an increased focus on avoiding mechanical ventilation, particularly in preterm infants, there are fewer opportunities for clinicians to gain proficiency in this important emergency skill. Rates of successful intubation at the first attempt are relatively low, and adverse event rates are high, when compared with intubations in paediatric and adult populations. Interventions to improve operator success and patient stability during neonatal endotracheal intubations are needed. Using nasal high flow therapy extends the safe apnoea time of adults undergoing upper airway surgery and during endotracheal intubation. This technique is untested in neonates. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Stabilisation with nasal High flow during Intubation of NEonates (SHINE) trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the use of nasal high flow during neonatal intubation with standard care (no nasal high flow). Intubations are randomised individually, and stratified by site, use of premedications, and postmenstrual age (<28 weeks’ gestation; ≥28 weeks’ gestation). The primary outcome is the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability of the infant. Physiological instability is defined as an absolute decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation >20% from preintubation baseline and/or bradycardia (<100 beats per minute). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SHINE trial received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees of The Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia and Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia. The trial is currently recruiting in these two sites. The findings of this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences.

As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety, and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multisystems disease that disturbs the whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but the reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity, and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualize how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate, and accommodate stress. Critical Issues: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multiorgan/multilevel interdependencies. Host/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven ""oxidative storm"" alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic, and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at the individual and population level. Future Directions: While inflicting considerable damage to health and well-being, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve the diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. ""Redox phenotyping"" of patients to characterize whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.","Cumpstey, Andrew F; Clark, Anna D; Santolini, Jérôme; Jackson, Alan A; Feelisch, Martin",Antioxid. redox signal,https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2021.0017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985343/,180

Covid-19 pandemic: the coordinated support of the international community to low- and middle-income countries is needed immediately,2020-05-13,": The increasing number of single cell and bulk RNAseq datasets describing complex gene expression profiles in different organisms, organs or cell types calls for an intuitive tool allowing rapid comparative analysis. Here, we present Swift Profiling Of Transcriptomes (SPOT) as a web tool that allows not only differential expression analysis but also fast ranking of genes fitting transcription profiles of interest. Based on a heuristic approach the spot algorithm ranks the genes according to their proximity to the user-defined gene expression profile of interest. The best hits are visualized as a table, bar chart or dot plot and can be exported as an Excel file. While the tool is generally applicable, we tested it on RNAseq data from malaria parasites that undergo multiple stage transformations during their complex life cycle as well as on data from multiple human organs during development and cell lines infected by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Drug prescription data of 212 elderly patients of tertiary health care center had been analyzed for possible drug interactions with investigational drugs for COVID-19 treatment. Drug interaction had been checked from Stockley's Drug Interaction 2019 and Martindale the Complete Drug Reference 2017 and standard reference books of Pharmacology. FINDINGS: Different types of drugs prescribed in the elderly were 260 and out of which 68 (26.36%) were in the category of fixed-dose combinations. Around 150 (70.75%) elderly patients were having one or more associated comorbidities. Thirty-five drugs prescribed to elderly had been found to cause drug interaction with investigational drugs for COVID-19. Possible drug interactions are mediated through CYP3A4 (eighteen patients), CYP2D6 (seven patients) isoenzymes, or P glycoproteins transporters (three patients). CONCLUSION: Possible drug interactions predicted in this study suggested need for modification of dose of drug or watchfulness for adverse effects. If these drug interactions are considered beforehand, complications can be prevented on account of these drug interactions in elderly who are suffering from COVID-19.","Keche, Yogendra; Gaikwad, Nitin; Dhaneria, Suryaprakash; Joshi, Apoorva",J Res Pharm Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912505/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jrpp.jrpp_20_107,180
688559,Ethical and Clinical Considerations During the Coronavirus Era,2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has led to one of the world’s largest infectious disease outbreaks. COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and the emergence was especially concerning to the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) stationed in the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea), which remains vital to peace and security of the East Asian region. The first wave of cases emerged in South Korea from China before a globally established response, which forced USFK into a challenging position to combat a novel virus with countless unknowns regarding effective control and portended impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As cases began to emerge in South Korea, USFK in early February began to proactively formulate peninsula-wide preventative health measures to protect the force. Eventually, USFK spearheaded a uniquely proactive Operation Kill the Virus that targeted COVID-19 as an enemy that must be rigorously defended against. Through the operation, USFK systematically employed eight key principles to successfully combat the pandemic, which are documented in this article. RESULTS: The operation’s eight principles focused on (1) Treat it like a combat operation, (2) Protect the force to protect the mission, (3) Stay one step ahead of the curve by exercising an abundance of caution, (4) Use predictive analysis, (5) Maintain open and transparent dialog with the community every day, (6) Be empathetic but prepare the community for lifestyle and culture changes, (7) Follow and enforce rules, and finally (8) Keep your foot on the gas and fight complacency. By closely collaborating with the ROK government, especially the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USFK effectively limited the number of locally acquired cases, including service members, families, and civilians, to 24 by April 2020. Vital to that success was ensuring a sufficient capability and capacity to test, trace, treat, and logistically support with personal protective equipment and sufficient infrastructure for quarantine and isolation. As the pandemic shifted to the USA and Europe, new cases in the ROK shifted from locally acquired to imported from international travelers. Fundamental to USFK’s sustained preservation of readiness and training included aggressive quarantine and testing of all arrivals from the United States of America (USA), identification of hotspots in all installations, and perpetual fine-tuning of the operation’s principles in collaboration with the ROK’s aggressive approach to eradicate COVID-19 from the peninsula. CONCLUSIONS: In successfully executing the operation, USFK imparts three main lessons for future outbreaks. First, a military command should execute a health response similar to how it executes combat operations against a battlefield enemy. Second, the command should maintain flexibility to new changes or risks that alter courses of action. And finally, engagement with the local community, host nation, and international partners should not be compromised when formulating strategies. The USFK’s immediate recognition of the public health threat by all levels of leadership and medical personnel enabled a unique and highly effective Operation Kill the Virus that engaged all members of the community, both local and international.","Kim, Sharon Y; Lee, Kenny; Tussey, Jason B; Dougherty, Eric J; Williams, Stephen C; Abrams, Robert B; Murray, Clinton K",Mil Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528502/,180

Following the review of the existing literature on COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases, National and Hospital Board instructions for Infectious Diseases, as well as the consensus for surgical care by the consortium of the Orthopaedic Department Directors, we present the outline of the implemented principles in the orthopaedic departments of a tertiary academic hospital in Greece to operate during COVID-19 pandemic. Our overall objectives were to decrease the admission load and mitigate the risk of in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The principles involve the management of the Orthopaedic medical and nursing personnel, alterations of the workflow in the wards, operating rooms and outpatient clinics from the admission to the discharge of an orthopaedic patient. In addition, we present the recommended principles of management of traumatic orthopaedic injuries highlighting those deserving admission and in-hospital care and those that can be treated in the outpatient setting or day surgery clinics.","Kenanidis, Eustathios; Anagnostis, Panagiotis; Arvaniti, Kostoula; Potoupnis, Michael E; Tsiridis, Eleftherios",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699676/,180

However, there is uncertainty if the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the use of telehealth among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to compare the overall use of tele–urgent care visits for pediatric patients before and after the pandemic, especially among vulnerable populations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of pediatric tele–urgent care visits at a virtual care center at a southeastern health care center. The main outcome of this study was the use of pediatrics tele–urgent visits across geographical regions with different levels of social disparities and between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Of 584 tele–urgent care visits, 388 (66.4%) visits occurred in 2020 during the pandemic compared to 196 (33.6%) visits in 2019. Among 808 North Carolina zip codes, 181 (22%) consisted of a high concentration of vulnerable populations, where 17.7% (56/317) of the tele–urgent care visits originated from. The majority (215/317, 67.8%) of tele–urgent care visits originated from zip codes with a low concentration of vulnerable populations. There was a significant association between the rate of COVID-19 cases and the concentration level of social factors in a given Zip Code Tabulation Area. CONCLUSIONS: The use of tele–urgent care visits for pediatric care doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the tele–urgent care visits after COVID-19 originated from regions where there is a low presence of vulnerable populations. In addition, our geospatial analysis found that geographic regions with a high concentration of vulnerable populations had a significantly higher rate of COVID-19–confirmed cases and deaths compared to regions with a low concentration of vulnerable populations.","Khairat, Saif; McDaniel, Phillip; Jansen, Matthew; Francis, Tia; Edson, Barbara; Gianforcaro, Robert",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://doi.org/10.2196/25873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459742/,180

Specifically, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the ability to simultaneously detect viral RNA and human antibodies would prove highly useful for efficient diagnosis and disease course management. Herein, we present a multiplex one-pot pre-coated interface proximity extension (OPIPE) assay that facilitates the simultaneous recognition of antibodies using a pre-coated antigen interface and a pair of anti-antibodies labeled with oligonucleotides. Following anti-antibody-bound nucleic acid chain extension to form templates in proximity, antibody signals can be amplified, together with that of targeted RNA, via a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using four-color fluorescent TaqMan probes, we demonstrate the co-detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies and viral nucleic acids in a single bio-complex sample, including nucleocapsid protein-specific IgG and IgM, and the RNA fragments of RdRp and E genes. The serum detection limit for this platform is 100 fg/mL (0.67 fM) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and 10 copies/μL for viral RNA.
